Tesla on the other hand is very very strong in humanoid robotics which is going to be revolutionary it's very very strong with self-driving which is going to be absolutely a game changer and and autonomous driving is going to be kind of like power windows every omem is going to have it again a monopoly right here nobody's going to catch Tesla not to mention the energy business is growing at 100% per year not to mention the fact they do still sell a lot of cars I mean so you know it's very very hard to find companies as good as p and Tesla and the S&amp;P F design index even in 2024.",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,hG3VOsZEpF4,2024-11-29T18:33:52Z,TOM LEE: “If you hold these stocks….GET READY”,Palo Alto Networks,the three added stock that he just added a few days ago are P networks block and JP Morgan Chase so let's start with palal networks obviously it's a cyber security play they score 70 on our MVP scorecard it's not amazing but still not horrible mainly the two issues there are the high pee and the fact that they're reducing their cash over time it's not ideal Now if you look at the revenue growth it's at 177% it's okay the rule of 40 here is 55 which is phenomenal and over the past 12 months we had net income grow by 500% with 8 billion in revenue and $2.6 billion of net income that is absolutely incredible but the thing with the stock is that according to a revers DCF which we ran on stock MVP this pricing right now of this stock at $390 assumes a 30% annual growth in revenues for the next five years every single year for the stock when in fact it's currently growing at 177% so the current price reflects double than the current growth rate of the company and that essentially just means you're putting a lot of future upside a lot of future success a lot of future potential that may or may not materialize into this current $390 price point now look based on our fiveyear model here in stock MVP in 5 years this stock can range anywhere from 420 on the barcase to 6 140 on the Uber bull case and 530 in the midc case that's our fiveyear price target for the stock,1.0,0.1
Tom Nash,hG3VOsZEpF4,2024-11-29T18:33:52Z,TOM LEE: “If you hold these stocks….GET READY”,Block Inc,now let's move on to block now block didn't score much better than pout networks with just 75 again we've seen much much higher scores and again here the problem is PE the current p is 50 but the good news are that the forward be of the companies actually coming down to 20 which is going to upgrade its score next time we do this to 80 and that's really not that bad now the company actually increased its cash position over the past year by $3 billion and on the surface that looks very impressive but the problem is that that was mostly empty calories it was mostly debt on the stock MVP cards you can see that they've added $2 billion of debt and that is the base of that increase another 800 million in that income but that 3 billion is 70% debt so that's not that exciting especially with a company has about 5% of operating margin just not something that I get excited about now the stock is currently trading at $88 our fiveyear price target for the stock based on the SCF model here on stock MVP is 83 in the bare case 105 on the medium case and 127 on the bull case really nothing that exciting,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,hG3VOsZEpF4,2024-11-29T18:33:52Z,TOM LEE: “If you hold these stocks….GET READY”,JP Morgan Chase,now JP Morgan is an interesting play here I don't know if you're into financial sector I'm personally not but if you're looking for a financial sector investment if you're looking for banked investing I don't think he's wrong about this now look the stock scores only 75 on on our scorecard in stock MVP the growth is only 14% it's not exciting if you compare it to growth stocks however if you looking for a financial sector play a bank not that bad look we have $54 billion of income 60% operating margin that is actually not bad but the beauty of this only comes out when you compare JP Morgan to Wills Fargo and Bank of America when you put it side by side not against Tesla not against paler when you put it side by side against Bank then you actually see that's not a bad choice for a bank if you're looking for one look JP Morgan is actually growing at 15% year-over-year Bank of America is minus two Wells Fargo is minus5 net income of JP Morgan is almost 5% it's -23 for Bank of America it is basically zero for wals fargo. three net income is 54 billion doar Bank of America is half that and Wells Fargo is even less at 18 op in margin is 58% almost 60% way way higher than Bank of America with 38% and a lot higher than Wills Fargo with 30% and the forward PE is 15 with Bank of America being at 13 and Wells Fargo at 13 and a half they're pretty much identical so you're getting the best bank of the three at pretty much the same price and it is considerably better than the other two we just looked at so if you're looking for a bank JP Morgan is probably the best choice out of these three but again you have to do your own research you have to make up your own decision this ain't Financial advice I'm not telling you to buy JP Morgan I'm just showing you how to analyze these stocks people compare JP Morgan to this and then they say oh that's a crap stock no no you have to compare apples to apples that's the important part,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,hG3VOsZEpF4,2024-11-29T18:33:52Z,TOM LEE: “If you hold these stocks….GET READY”,IES Holdings,now the next stock is IES Holdings it actually scored phenomenally 85 on the stock MVP scorecard that is incredible slightly high short interest with 8% not horrible but slightly high that lowered the score a little bit the margin is 7.6% again very close to that 10% threshold which we have here to give it the full score and the p is a 26 which is a little bit higher nothing that bad like an 85 score is very very high and still we're talking about a company with 18% growth Revenue growth 100% net income growth over the past 12 months and an operating margin into double digits with 11% and the crazy part about this that the current share price of $287 per share assumes a13 % growth rate for the next 5 years that's not exuberant in fact it is below the current growth rate of the company so that company actually I'm curious about I'm curious about it genuinely I would definitely want more research and discussion about this company and if you know more about it put in the comments I would love to hear your expert opinion in the comments because you know everybody in the YouTube comment section is an expert our fiveyear model fiveyear prediction for the stock on stock MVP is $380 for the be case $422 for the medium case and $464 for the bull case,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,hG3VOsZEpF4,2024-11-29T18:33:52Z,TOM LEE: “If you hold these stocks….GET READY”,Sterling Infrastructure,now let's move on to Sterling infrastructure 85 score as well here 88.7% margin which took down the score ever so slightly and a 32p again very similar to the previous stock we talked about just on the brink of scoring 19995 but still a very very good score the problem here with this stock which does not excite me is that 88.7% growth rate which is not that great because especially if you look at the reverse this CF this current price of $195 per share assumes a 177% growth rate for the next 5 years which is double than what the stock is currently growing at so not really for me now let's move on to the next talk applied the Industrial Technologies,1.0,-0.4
Tom Nash,hG3VOsZEpF4,2024-11-29T18:33:52Z,TOM LEE: “If you hold these stocks….GET READY”,Applied Industrial Technologies,now let's move on to the next talk applied the Industrial Technologies I'm going to be honest with you not that excited about the stock the name is on the screen the ticker is on the screen with my thick accent I got to do this you know they're not growing enough 1% growth 10% free cash flow margin 11% operating margin 26 forward PE and more debt than cash that's a pass for me sorry,1.0,-0.9
Tom Nash,hG3VOsZEpF4,2024-11-29T18:33:52Z,TOM LEE: “If you hold these stocks….GET READY”,United States Lime and Minerals,now let's go to us lime and minerals this is a stock that scored 80 on our scorecard which is not bad but the problem here again you have a lot of assumed success here the current reverse DCF is a 22% assumed growth they're currently growing at 10% you'd have to assume a lot of success but then again this is a company that's going to give you almost 40% operating margin which is insane and way more cash than that $250 million of cash and only 5 million of thatt and plus 44 4% growth in net income for the past year so not a bad company at all if you can assume that 22% growth for the next 5 years everything else looks great now the current price is $153 per share our model says in the next 5 years is going to go to 169 in the bare case 214 in the medium case and 258 in the bull case,1.0,0.6
Tom Nash,hG3VOsZEpF4,2024-11-29T18:33:52Z,TOM LEE: “If you hold these stocks….GET READY”,Hims & Hers,and hims and hers a very familiar name on this channel because 3 years ago when the stock was at $8 back in September of 2021 I put out a video saying Hey this stock has a lot of opportunities for investors and now it's actually trading at 30 so we on this channel if you are subscribed on this channel you've been knowing about the stock for the past three years and you know now Tom Le also adds it to his list which is not bad it's a good confirmation. now the first stock on the list is hims and hers and as I mentioned in the beginning of the video this stock is no stranger to this Channel about 3 years ago in September of 2021 when this was an $8 stock it's currently 30 we put out a video saying Hey this is a really good stock NOW obviously 3 years later if you've been on this stock you've made a lot of money that's good for you but now we have to look at it from an OB to perspective whether it is a good investment at $30 today and that's a whole different question than the one that I answered in September 2021 now the stock is growing at 56% which is phenomenal free cash flow actually grew by 500% over the past 12 months which is insane we have $250 million of cash versus virtually no debt like $1 million of debt and the score MVP is about 75 which is not bad not the best score we've seen but okay mainly because of lower margins High Shore interest with 177% and a high PE and that's okay because the company is still scaling it's currently operating on a 3% operating margin which is extremely low it needs to come up significantly and at 40 40 40 forward PE this is insane it's a very expensive company but then again it is what it is it's just what happens when you find Excellent companies which everybody want to own you're always going to have a premium Now the reverse this year we ran on the stock basically assumes that the current $30 price assumes a 45% growth in revenues every single year for the next five years currently they're growing at 56% so that is in line but whether they can keep that percentage over the next five years that's the big question our fiveyear price target for this company ranges from $75 per share to 150 on the bullish case and 112 in the medium case again you have to understand the company first don't invest because a model told you that this price is going to go up we're talking about a lot of uncertainty we're talking about a lot of risks you don't ever want to be buying a stock because someone on YouTube or CNBC or X told you that's a great stock do the work,1.0,0.2

Tom Nash,I2Ov8uCZIlY,2024-11-21T23:05:13Z,Billionaire Ron Baron Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Tesla,"folks this is huge billionaire investor Ron Baron a guy who manages about $50 billion in assets just dropped a massive bombshell about Tesla it is insane we heard Ron Baron over the years being bullish on Tesla we heard him say a lot of incredible things about ilon musk and the company but we have never ever ever heard him say this this is a whole new territory uncharted waters as far as I'm concerned now in this video I'm going to do the same thing I do in every single video I put out I do not hold my audience hostage the bottom line comes first the video of his interview comes second the analysis comes third however I urge you to stay for the analysis because last time we did this kind of video I said the Testa is going to go from 250 to 400 back in July a lot quicker than people think and since that moment the stock went from 250 to 350 so people have made a lot of money listening to these sort of analysis videos so I urge you to stay but if you got to go you got to go that's fine here's the bottom line don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing the bottom line is that Ron Baron went on CNBC and he said look folks Tesla is not even close to being complete yet your your faith in Elon Musk um sounds like it's stronger than ever is this a stock that you would sell just from the perspective of if it goes up so much it's going to be a bigger and bigger part of your portfolio so I think that it's it's right now worth a trillion dollars and with Bitcoin trillion 7 uh so would I rather have two Teslas or one Bitcoin you know uh so basically the way I think about it is that Tesla I think is going to be worth three or4 trillion doll5 trillion in 10 years based upon the business plan that I I'm aware of and then Elon believes that longer term it's going to be worth 30 trillion it's now being worth a trillion do you believe that well um the people from Goldman Sachs were doing something for me uh one of the executives in California who's being groomed I think to be the next CEO of Goldman Sachs uh he and two other three other people from Goldman came to visit me this past summer at my house in New Hampton and uh they were telling me his name is d uh they were telling me that uh El you know Goldman then was struggling to get the business of their business value from 150 billion in the market to 180 billion so Elon said why don't you come to my plant and Hall Alto where I have Optimus robots I want you to see what that is so he says so we go there I take the board and we go out he says Ron it's toopan it's amazing you got to go see this so I went to see it and there robots walking all over and the idea that he has is that so here we have there wouldn't be any EVS without him there wouldn't be any autonomous driving without him there wouldn't be any Rockets you use over and over without him you wouldn't have any starlink without him so so the idea is that this this Optimus robots he thinks is going to be his biggest business ever and he thinks that he says everyone's going to have robots and my big question was when I was watching these things walking around and how intelligent to becoming super intelligent said well can they procreate that's the question I have and how is that going to happen but is this your way of saying no you're not going to sell shes any of your companies or your investments in no uh just you know if they get too big then I'll have to trim a little bit but no I have no no intention I can't predict the market I don't even try so everyone comes in says what's the market going to do I have no idea and don't I don't even try we interview analysts and we don't even talk about stocks we interview analyst I want to know who they are I don't care about what they know I want really smart people and I want them to be able to be trained the way we look at things first principal research so just look at things rip it apart in your head put it back together see if it makes sense if you like the business and think the prospects are good and you're trust the people then invest in I have heard Ron Baron talk about Tesla a lot is well known he's one of the most famous Tesla investors in the world one of the early investors it is his biggest position he manages 50 billion dollar so what he says matters etc etc etc once every couple of months he gets called up to CNBC to talk about his Investments Tesla obviously being the biggest one he talks about Tesla a lot he's bullish a lot all that's fine ending but we have never ever ever heard him speak like that he basically uses the most important metric in my view to understand who has the best talent in the industry and it basically say says look folks Tesla had 6 million applications for 30,000 jobs and that tells you a lot about the level of quality of talent that this company is recruiting and if you have the best talent you're going to be unbeatable another thing he says is look the stock price is flat if you go back all the way to November of 2021 the stock price was $400 it is currently $340 so over the past three years the stock has actually lost some percentages however if you look at the business the business is getting better so if the business is getting better but the stock price is getting cheaper it is a no-brainer and I couldn't agree more I'm going to show you the numbers to prove what he's saying is absolutely on point over the past three years in which the stock went from 400 to 340 the revenue has increased by 100% net income has increased by 265 per debt has decreased by 10% cash has increased by 109% and the institutional shareholding went from 40 to 50% and on top of it they're basically working on creating a monopoly in full set of driving with no Alternatives no competitors a business with 80% gross margin that's going to take over the world and generate way more Revenue that you have ever seen from Tesa now look Let's Get Serious a flat stock with a great business is a setup for explosion in fact the last time we have seen this was Tesla Tesla was doing great on the business side on the fundamental side but the stock was flat for a long time until it exploded out the stratosphere and all of a sudden people were surprised oh my God God I wish I could have caught it in time here you go you now have a second opportunity of course this ain't Financial advice I'm not telling you to buy Tesla stock I don't know what's going to happen I'm just sharing you my opinion which might be wrong might be inacurate might be the ramblings of a Madman but my opinion is that this is the second cycle in which Tesla remains flat for years and yet the business is getting exponentially better we haven't even said a word about the energy business that's going out of control we haven't said a word about robotics about robot taxi we just mentioned FSD alone and that in itself is probably a three to four trillion doll Business Without Even saying anything about the other stuff Tesla is doing and that's exactly what Ron Baron is saying he says look folks don't get caught up in the automotive business the margins this car that car 2024 vehicle sales is B in Russian it's it's meaningless this is not the future of the company the company is a software company not a vehicle producer they're not going to compete with the Chinese of the next 10 years on who can make cheaper cars they're going to generate a monopoly and full driving that's going to sell at about 80% gross margin and it's going to become an industry standard all vehicles will have it like power windows and the only producer of it is going to be tested because there's nobody else that's going to be a huge business way bigger than producing vehicles and for those of you who think that wayo can compete weo cannot compete the amount of gear you have to load up on the vehicle to use weo and the pre-ms and all the stuff Tesla can do it with a few vehicle installed cameras that's it every OEM would have FSD when it's going to become standard and Tesla is the only shop in town and yes Ron Baron acknowledges that the stock is expensive obviously you look at the forward PE and your eyes pop out of their sockets like it's the Mask movie with Jim Carrey I get it I get it the stock is expensive but all great stocks were always expensive always Microsoft 10 years ago was $40 then it doubled in price every two or three years 40 to 80 80 to 160 160 to 320 now to 400 every time it doubled people were saying it is expensive great generational stocks that are Market leaders doubl in price every few years and then the Skeptics keep shouting from the sidelines that the stock is just too expensive missing out on all this great growth Tesla is no different than the index the S&P 500 is again oh my God it's way too expensive so many reasons to sell oh yeah it's frothy it's overbought whatever the S&P 500 over the past 15 years with all this craziness that we've seen in the world over the past 15 years wars pandemics collapses 700% at the end of the day this always going to be reasons to sell the stock there's always going to be reasons to sell S&P 500 ignore the short-term BS that is what Ron Baron is saying focus on the future is Tesla the next big thing for the automotive industry for the energy business for the robotics business if you think the answer is no that they're not going to lead robotics AI FSD and all this stuff in that case do not buy if you think that they are why would you not buy that kind of company for $1 trillion when you know it's going to be three five 6 10 2030 like El says in 10 years why not so the analysis isn't if Tesla is cheap or expensive as far as forward PE the analysis is do you think this is the next best thing to slice bread and if it is then the trillion dollars today as long as you stay patient and you stay for the next 10 15 years it's not a huge problem generationally great companies will always be expensive and Peter Lynch said this not me it's never a bad time to buy a good company and Ron Baron is not the only one who's saying these things Tom Lee just launched his own ETF and by the way his biggest position in that ETF is Tesla much like Ron Barons and he was also on CNBC saying look folks this company is still massively undervalued our biggest position is Tesla because the biggest amount of upside for the next 10 years isn't Tesla it's trading at $1 trillion doll but it has all these massive projects energy robotics FSD robot taxing on top of the other stuff that we haven't even talked about yet AGI a lot of stuff that El is going to roll out over the next 10 years that people just misunderstand and on top of it actually Tom Le added another layer to this Tesla analysis which Ron Baron didn't talk about and that is the fact that this new Administration that's taking office it's going to expedite it's going to accelerate Tesla's ability to roll out new technologies a lot faster than would have happened under the previous administration now look I've talked about all of this back in July I said look folks this stock is heading to 400 whether you like it whether you not it's currently at 250 you still have time it's going to go to 400 a lot sooner than you think and now I'm here again saying the same thing it is not too late the stock may be 350 but this is just the beginning this is just the start for Tesla and this is your opportunity to enjoy the fruits of this company the way you do it is not to speculate not to buy and sell try to guess the bottom at the top not to be a short-term Speculator on the stock because if you look at the history of Tesla of the past few years it has gotten very good at punishing short-term Traders and excellent at rewarding long-term patient investors name one long-term Tesla investor that has been investing in the company for the past five 6 Seven 8 10 years and has not made an obscene amount of money name one you can't because long-term investors that didn't give a hoot about the short-term price action of the stock we're always rewarded about the stock why because the best friend of a great business which Tesla is is time in the stock market and the worst enemy of a horrible company again is time in the stock market that is why the stock market over time will expose which is and which is legit and I believe that Tesla is legit and that is the reason I've been talking about Tesla as well as other companies like paler since 2020 I like to invest in generationally incredible companies that are going to dominate their industry for decades to come",1.0,1.0

know what's going to happen and I don't think that following daily price action of stocks is anywhere close to being beneficial to your long-term investing journey I always say that following the day-to-day practice swings of stocks is pretty much the equivalent of trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum it's not very effective now look I know that a lot of people are concerned a lot of people are asking what's going on with paler why paler is down should we take profits and I promise you in today's video is going to be all real talk so don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing just listen now look I'm not a spokesperson by paler I don't have to say anything and if I see problems I'm going to call them out just like I did over the past few years I'm not a paid spokesperson where I have to talk about paler only in a positive manner I will always tell you the truth now the one thing I want to make clear in this video is that it's very hard for me to come on here and make up a reason why volunteer is down 10% of the past 24 hours now I know that CNBC and professional media Outlets they have to give you a reason the investors are digesting whatever they going to make up that day when I digest things I go to the toilet look it's just maybe people taking profits maybe just a correction after the insane Spike we've seen on Friday it can be a million different things in the short term markets can be have very irrationally and you don't have to find a reason for any irrational day-to-day swing in the stock price especially a stock like paler which is known to be volatile I mean is this your first day with this stock so let's talk about it look penter when you look at it you have to have a little bit of a perspective folks no penter is up 270% since January 1st of 2024 let me say it again it is up 270% year to date now it is up 44% in the past 30 days alone did you not think it's going to take a breather did you all just assume it's going to go in the straight line to the moon to the 500 price point I've made up about a year ago I'm just kidding it's not made up I promise you bottom line bottom line I still firmly stand behind that 500 price point it's a joke that somebody's going to take out of context they're going to post a clip and expose me go right ahead see if I care now look real talk right now paler is at $140 billion market cap $140 billion just for comparison snowflake is at 42 or 43 billion do and other massive companies like Ron or LED Martin are pretty much in that neighborhood 120 to 150 so piler has gotten to the level of L Martin and Ron it's massive it is insane now it is also up about 750 since it went public in the direct public offering back in 2020 now also one point that people seem to completely Miss is the fact that the pent institutional shareholding which was for me always the achil Seal of this stock has gone up all the way from 35% which is not that good for me just a couple years ago all the way to above 50% right now so institutional shareholders are piling in and the rest of the market is basically just pricing in the huge amount of upside this company has and that creates a problem because over the course of the past four years and I suspect over the course of the following four years this stock is going to do the same thing punish the short-term Traders and really really do well for long-term patient investors it's not going to change now I promise you the bottom line first and I'm not going to ignore the fact that pal is currently trading at 134 PE that is insane now I totally understand why some people who took one class in business school think that just because a stock is trading at 130 PE or forward PE that is it is 100% overvalued if a stock is at this price point it is completely overvalued no Nuance no Shad of a doubt and I think and I'm going to pull it very mildly in this video because I don't want to offend anybody but I think they don't know what the hell they're talking about there I think that actually what's happening is that they're missing the big picture now look I think that paler has a massive 10x upside and if you're on this channel odds are you kind of agree with me I don't think anybody here watches me and completely disagrees with that thesis but but I'm going to be honest with you look while everybody in the paler Community are going to be one of two things over the next let's say 12 months there are they going to be a cheerleader in which they're going to Hype it up and it will be in a point where it can do no wrong and they're going to be all about everything good but not even looking at the bad things which I think is also unhealthy and you have the haters are only going to see the bad and criticize and in their eyes paler cannot do anything good let me be honest with you I know that 134 PE is expensive and I also know that longterm that is completely reasonable for me because I see the trajectory however I am honest enough and transparent enough to come on here and not play that game where I cannot say anything that is even remotely negative about palente here 134 PE is expensive in the short term 100% now if you feel that you cannot stomach short-term volatility that might happen because the stock needs a breather because it's going to have a correction whatever happens over the next couple weeks couple months take some profits I'm not against that folks I'm not going to ha it against you if you sell 10% of your position just so you sleep better at night for the next six months nobody in the entire world has ever gone broke for taking a little bit profits off the top if you take 10% 15% off the top of your piler position I'm not going to hold it against you saying well that was a stupid thing to do because some times all you want is some peace and quiet and if you can't stomach the turbulence why not so if you feel like you need that for your mental health do it do it why not because if the market dips and if you've been watching this Market of the past two years it is in complete state of euphoria right now if this Market dips penter is a three beta stock which means that for every 10% the market is going to correct paler might correct all the way up to 30% so it's going to be very very violent it's going to be very very volatile and if you're not the kind of person who can stomach that and remain relatively well balanced mentally emotionally take your 10% and then secure some profits and feel a little bit more relaxed when it comes in that case should the storm happen well you got some cash on the sideline and you feel a bit better about yourself and if the stock keeps on running well you have your 90% still in the game and you haven't really messed out on anything so I'm not going to be sitting here ignoring the current market Euphoria okay let's be honest I see it I'm not going to ignore it I'm going to tell you right now it is very evident now pilers currently in its current pricing configuration might be the most expensive AI stock in the market and it is clear to see and short term it is possible and even I would say even quite likely that it's going to correct maybe this is the end of the correction maybe it's not I don't know but the reason that I am not actually selling is because I know who I am and if you know who you are and you determine that ahead of time you're not going to have this dilemma if you know that you are a Trader well this seems like a very evident possibility of a correction and if you're a longterm investor you honestly do not care and you don't play that game and you shouldn't be Buying and selling and I know that sounds a little bit contradicting I just told you hey if you need to take 10% at the top to sleep better at night do it for your mental health and then I'm saying well know who you are look it does not contradict each other completely different things taking a little bit off the top for your mental health that's fine but understanding that you're running a marathon and this is probably the first five miles of the entire Marathon you just ran and there's still a long ways to go and not getting excited about every every single price movements in every single day and look not every single penter investor must have my level of conviction and think about paler as the next Microsoft which makes it a no-brainer why you shouldn't sell and maybe some have different levels of conviction and that is fine and I am okay with that I'm not trying to create an Eco chamber where people are not allowed to have different levels of conviction about the stock but if you have some issues with convictions about the paler story so to speak allow me to give you some data paler growth rate currently is 30% per year I believe this is just a start and we haven't even hit we haven't even scratched the surface of where this is going to go I think there's going to be an Nvidia moment where we're going to see Invidia level growth which we've seen over the past few years in paler and while we talk a lot about the commercial sector of paler and how paler is becoming quasi monopolistic in the business sector the government total adjustable Market The Tam is absolutely insane and in that sector as well paler pretty much has no competitors in both commercial and government Palante has essentially created a quasi monopolistic company that is solving a problem that a few years ago none of its customers even knew it had it's literally what Peter teal wrote in his book 0 to1 in 2017 it's materializing right in front of your eyes now the reason that palente is so attractive and why it is one of the most expensive if not the most expensive AI companies in the market is because people see this they're seeing this quas monopolistic Force getting bigger and bigger The Snowball Effect in which peners just getting scarier and scarier every single quarter they came into these latest earnings with so much hype and still blew everybody out of the water and they look under the hood and they say well look these guys have a massive mode no competition lots of scalability their client acquisition costs are minuscule at best and all the biggest players like AWS Accenture M all the big players Oracle just to name a few are deciding wait we can't fight these guys we better join them we need them so all these big players are essentially jumping on board saying hey we're not going to fight paler Microsoft actually tried with fabric and you know failed miserably flatten their face but nobody else wants to try this point why would you right so right now we're looking at almost three billion dollar of annual revenue that is what penter is about to be in in a couple of quarters that is absolutely insane because just in 2021 we were at 1.5 billion so the company in about two or three years have doubled its Revenue at the same time the operating expenses to generate a 100% growth in Revenue were only 10% so if you can generate 100% Revenue growth by increasing your operating expenses by 10% you have to understand the meaning of how scalable this business is and that is why the operating income of penter over the past 3 years is up 200% now free cash flow over the past two years is up almost 400% net income is up 200% debt has declined by 3% and right now paler is almost at $5 billion of cash and about 250 million of debt and a really really good margin of about 14% operating income before they started even scaling now I said multiple times on this channel in my private patreon group patreon.com for/ Nash I've said it multiple multiple times fomo and panic are really evil brothers that you never want to be around fomo fear of missing out and panic are two sides of the same story if you're panicking into a stock or panicking out of a stock both are highly emotional driven decisions and completely irrational and they're not going to end well the same thing goes for waiting for a pullback or calling the top or calling the bottom and all of this nonsense that people are trying to do I said it in the beginning of the video if you need to take 10% to sleep better at night while acknowledging that you don't know where the stock is going to go and you're doing kind of a exercise to alleviate your mental pressure do it but people who try to call the top and bottom on a stock like this on the market in general that is nothing but gambling and Peter Lynch I think said it best I think anybody could have said it better a lot more money was wasted and lost waiting for a pullback or trying to time the pullback then the pullbacks themselves actually generated now if you look at this market right now you have Nvidia taking over the infrastructure you have large language models essentially becoming commodities and you have paler creating this operating system one of a kind that can scale that create compliance that creates basically efficiencies and a way to massively deploy these llms and AI systems in any business in any industry with ease and they're pretty much the only game in town and that is why Palante reminds me Microsoft about 15 years ago now was Microsoft already expensive 15 years ago sure it was trading at $20 per share and it was already expensive because it went way way parabolic since the IPO but guess what by 2014 Just 5 years later the stock was worth $40 per share it has doubled and by that point that was already too expensive for most but guess what by 2018 the stock has gone to $80 per share and at that point it was surely too expensive but guess what 2 years later in 2020 the stock went up $260 it doubled Again by that point it was surely too expensive and guess what four years later it's cented $400 per share and again of course it is too expensive now my point here is very very simple is paler short-term overvalued and overhyped possibly is it an extremely expensive stock probably the most expensive AI company right now in the market probably does it matter to me not at all because I believe in one simple principle it is never too late to buy a great company the question you need to ask yourself isn't should we sell Palante here did the stock run up too high come on cut it out you should never sell a stock because the price has ran up too much and now you have locked in profits that's just silly all you have to do is ask yourself one question is pener a stock I want to invest in is it potentially the next Microsoft level company does it have a mode does it have a client base does it have a huge business the margins look at the business folks imagine you're buying the whole company do you want to own this company and if the answer is yes and you want to own paler then just ignore the price the only thing you need to be looking at is how much the stock is trading compared to the 52 we high and that's the system we teach on our patreon patreon.com Nash in our Academy roic Academy and the system we teach is quite simple if the stock price that you're looking at and the stock that you like is trading normally well you dollar cost average at all times you buy at all times ignoring all that noise about the macro the wars the economy the company by bye bye as long as the thesis about your company does not change as long as your desire to own the company doesn't change you completely ignore the price and buy at all times should the price drop let's say 20% below the 52 we High then you double down instead of buying $100 every week you buy $200 every week and you continue to do so like clockwork like a bot until the price climbs back up and if the price happens to climb 20% above the 52 we high within the last 30 days you might consider slowing down and buying $50 instead of $100 every single time there's different variations to the system but the point being is you buy it all times you buy more when it's down you buy a little bit less when it's up and when you zoom out 5 years later your average cost in this stock is very very close to the bottom without timing the market even once now I urge you to give it a

Tom Nash,2vwQm2snk80,2024-11-04T22:37:57Z,This Changes EVERYTHING For Palantir,Palantir,paler paler paler I was about to wait until tomorrow to make this video to make a point that I'm not excited about one earnings call that it's all about the long-term investing and it is but what paler has done today was absolutely mind-blowingly shocking and was so insane that I had to drop everything I was doing literally and come on here and tell you how insane of a quarter this company has delivered now I'm not going to talk about the share price I'm not going to talk about the after hours action and how much this stock is up today or tomorrow CU I don't care I'm here for the next 10 15 years if not more but I am going to talk to you about these numbers because they are out of this world folks absolutely insane in the words of Alex carp who has now solidified himself as a top three CEO in the world pener has eviscerated this quarter hands down just insane insane so year-over-year Revenue growth of 30% us commercial growth of 44% and a much much improved guidance which you can't forget in these times makes or breaks companies now on the US commercial side we have seen 54% growth which is absolutely insane because that is that is the market on the US government side 40% growth now piler was claiming for years and years and years we're going to do it different we're not going to be like everyone else in silon Valley and now they have proven that they are indeed better this is their best quarter to to date I've never seen anything like this I'll show you in a second what we're talking about here it's going to be raw unedited and absolutely Based on data paler has done a lot of great quarters in the past they have broken a lot of Records not like this they came in hot to this quarter in fact I've made a video earlier today this morning saying hey we should be careful because with so much expectations on their back it's going to be very hard for them to impress and somehow they came in with all this mountain of expectations that even I wasn't sure they're going to be able to deliver on and blew everybody's Minds which is absolutely insane now just to give an example what we're talking about here folks in the first nine months of 2023 last year palen delivered net income of $120 million which is not bad at all not bad at all in the first nine months of this year palente has delivered net income of almost $400 million that is an increase of 225% from the previous 9 months at the same time the operating expenses that paler expended to increase its net income by 225% the operating expenses went up by 8% show me another company on this god-given Earth that can generate 225% increase in net income with an increase of only 8% in operating expenses it does not exist folks this is a unicorn if I was to make a 99 overall full sliders NBA 2K ultimate player that can dunk shoot threes Play Perfect Defense run at 99 speed basically a cheat code this would be it this would be the perfect Sliders in the video game to create a player that can't miss now pener have delivered 140 sorry 104 1 million plus deals in the past quarter the customer list grew by another 40% which is insane now here comes the good part Here Comes The Hammer the Gap net income of paler is now a 20% margin it is absolutely insane that we are at this margin at this point even better the rule of 40 of penter which was already expensively expressive massively insanely good somehow the rule of 40 which is the free cash flow margin plus the revenue growth percentage you add them up if you get 40 that is great pent was above 50 mid-50s 60s 68 rule of 40 which is absolutely insane insane only companies like Nvidia can deliver better numbers and that's with imaginary Monopoly numbers a 68 rule of 40 for a company that have increased its net income 9 months to 9 months by 225% its net income at 20% 40% customer growth 54% us commercial growth and all that we haven't even touched on the most insane and impressive part in this earnings which is absolutely mind-blowing to me yes somehow all of this was just the appetizer now check this out as you know pener is sitting on a pile of cash 4.6 billion dollars that is insane given the fact that they virtually have no debt that is also not the most impressive part what I found most impressive about this that pener for the first time in history broke broke a record that I didn't think they'll break piler delivered a free cash flow margin hear this please a free cash flow margin of 60% in this quarter a free cash flow margin of 60% with a 12 month running number of a billion dollars if you look at the past 12 months paler generated a billion dollars of free cash flow that is insane that is insane and they're guiding for 2. 8 billion for the entirety of 2024 which is absolutely insane now look Palante has been doing great so far the past three years they grew their revenues the operating expenses went down which is insane the EB That Grew by thousands of percent and a lot of people thought that this burden is going to be too heavy for the company to carry and maybe it will be I don't know in the short term I don't know but to come into this quarter with all these expectations all this massive mountain of extra extra extra on their backs with all of this hype and to deliver a quarter like this this is something that I I just can't remain static about I can't just go to bed and make a video tomorrow because again it's not about the stock price it's about the fundamentals folks the fundamentals will keep me awake all night long literally thinking about paler about what they've done in this quarter how Unthinkable the is now Alex karp top three CEO paler in route to being the world's most important software company trillion dollar valuation is just a matter of time it's not if it is when remember what Peter Lynch said it's never too late to invest in a great generational company it's never too late as long as you don't formo and do it slowly over time DCA into the Afterlife folks I'll see you in the next one peace,1.0,1.0
Tom Nash,2vwQm2snk80,2024-11-04T22:37:57Z,This Changes EVERYTHING For Palantir,Nvidia,only companies like Nvidia can deliver better numbers and that's with imaginary Monopoly numbers,1.0,0.5
Tom Nash,7xel0QYzdiE,2024-11-04T14:47:10Z,If you are a PALANTIR shareholder….GET READY,Palantir,"folks we have a major warning to all paler investors out there please listen to me carefully watch this video in full before the earnings now look the stock is up 150% year-to date that is incredible we have seen a lot the S&amp;P 500 inclusion we have seen massive adoption on the commercial side with AIP and we're currently just 10% below the all-time high this stock has been trading for now we're coming in into these earnings with a lot of expectations we're expecting a 26% Revenue growth we're expecting a quarter of $75 million in revenue and a 9 cents earnings per share now look penter has done a lot over the past three years I'm just going to give you a few examples right we have a 90% Revenue growth in the past three years while at the same time reducing operating expenses by 22% this is literally unheard of I mean I promise you a warning is coming I'm not clickbait you in this video I'm not about to bait and switch you listen to the end because there is a landing to this plane look 90% Revenue growth over the past three years 22% reduction in operating expenses that is wonderful and even if you look at the past year paler had an amazing year EB that growth 1,00% operating income up 540 per of the past year free cash flow up 85% of the past year Capital expenditures are down 57% that's good of the the past year cash is up 30% and we're talking about a company that's holding $4 billion in cash and only 200 million in debt that's a 20x more cash than debt and a rule of 40 of 52 which is absolutely incredible now penter has been doing a lot of good work the commercial sector numbers are out of this world I'm going to show you some stuff and it's absolutely insane if you look at the commercial sector for penter with 33% growth over the past year now if you focus specifically on the US commercial which is where the meat on the bone really is we're at 55% growth so paler is effectively growing the one business I care about which is the commercial side at 52% in the most important market now if you look at the US customer growth that is absolutely insane 83% increase in US customers over the past year now the company closed about a billion dollars worth of New Deals just in the past quarter and I'm assuming we're going to get a very similar number this time again and the biggest growth engine for paler AIP the new platform that essentially is the new operating system of the AI World much like Nvidia is building the asphalt these guys are literally building the roads and have the GPS and have the map now AIP ran about 500 boot camps last year which is insanely impressive this year just in the first half of 2024 we already conducted 1,300 boot camps and by this space we're about to hit 2600 124 alone which is a 5x more boot camps in 24 than in 23 this is over subscribed we have seen plenty of evidence of boot camps and AIP not being able to meet all the demand there's no competitors peners the only game in town and they're only constrained really by their ability to service all this demand and if that happens to remind you of Nvidia it's not accidental AIP is the only practical way to operate this massive large language models in scale in these massive businesses and talking about massive businesses look at the Divergence in the type of customers they serve on the one hand United Airlines on the other hand Wendy's on the other hand airp and then Learjet so if you look at these customer lists you understand one important thing that pener has a product that is completely industry agnostic and you can look at other customers like a hyai like an LG like a billion of different customers in various Industries this thing is Unstoppable and I have no doubt that this stock is going to be a trillion dollar company it's going to be the most important software company in the world and we are looking at $500 per share unless we're going to get a split over the next 10 years and fair disclosure I'm a massive shareholder of paler I own about 40% of my entire portfolio in palente here and I am a massive bull so it has to be put there on the table whatever I'm saying here is by definition bias because I love the company I love the vision and I see a massive amount of upside here having said that I promised you a warning and here it is I wasn't lying I wasn't blowing smoke up your ass I don't tend to do that to my audience so here's the warning and it is real but I want you to pay attention all the way through look paler is flying in very hot for this Landing imagine these earnings call as a landing and P is coming in on a 747 so you know for a plane to land nice and peacefully the landing speed the approach it all has to be calm and slow and almost this beautiful dance this ballet right a pil is flying in like a b Out of Hell into these earnings with an increase of 150% year-to date in the share price peners essentially coming into the lanting super hot super fast and completely overloaded oversized lots of baggage because they're carrying all this mountain of expectations on their back as they're trying to make this Landing into this earnings call now at a forward PE of 100 almost 100 that is going to be a very very delicate balance I'm going to put it this way it's not going to be easy it's going to be very difficult exercise to land this plane at this speed with this amount of luggage it's not an easy task but to be honest pener has done it before they may do it again and look I'm going to be honest with you I don't know what's going to happen right after the earnings come out the minute after the earnings get released we might see an explosion of a volcano and the stock May ran up because it beats across the board gives great guidance and the market keeps on chugging along I'm not going to complain if that happens but on the flip side we may have a lot of expectations baked in into this company at 100 forward PE at a massive massive amount of 150% stock appreciation over the past 10 months give or take we have a lot writing on this especially when the stock is very close just 10% below the all-time high valuation the market cap it's a lot of weight on this company so potentially what might happen is even though paler does well in the earnings call it does not wow people enough to justify all these expectations and if that happens you're going to see a pullback on the stock now how much of a pullback I don't know I don't even know if it happens at all or not but if the expectations are way bigger than what we end up seeing and if the results are not exciting enough and I'm telling you right now the threshold for that excitement is very very high right now if p doesn't blow everybody out of the water a pullback is going to happen and the stock is going to correct now to be fair with you as a long-term investor you should not be worried if this happens should this be the case the only thing you should be looking at is one thing and one thing only look at the share price find the spot at which you are 20% below the 52 week high of the stock and if it happens to drop below that point you get to Double Down at Double than your usual dollar cost average pace if you're buying penter every month for $100 if it drops 20% below the 52e high you're going in at 200 and you're going to keep going as long as the stock remains in that range once the stock climbs up back into less than 20% below the 52 we High then you go back from $ 200 to $100 each month and if the stock flies up then you just continue to DCA that is all no Panic no sill no formal I've heard a lot of speculation some people are shortening it which is absolutely stupid some people loading up which is absolutely stupid as well there's no point in timing the market or timing the stock in any direction you shouldn't be gambling about what a specific particular earnings call will do for the company it's gambling the market can be irrational a lot longer than you can remain solvent don't ever forget that now if you're investing in paler there is a good reason there's a fundamental reason let's say you have five reasons why you are a long-term investor in penter should any of those reasons change and deteriorate you can reevaluate your investment you can decide maybe I don't want to own this stock because the fundamental underlying reasons are not there yet should Alex carp leave or the business collapses something happens that's an okay reason to sell but if this particular earnings report isn't as great as the market expects that's not going to be a reason to sell for anybody with half a brain also if the market overreacts to a good earnings call and it flies up that's not going to be a reason to fall more into the stock like crazy again for the same exact reasons you have to understand the long Marathon mentality we have here with the stock only follow the numbers all this emotion all this hype all this Panic is just a smoke screen to confuse you and to get you to do stupid which I don't want you to do so pay attention I'm going to give you right now the nine Cardinal rules to remember going into this earnings call number one don't ever forget that what you're doing here is saving more money selecting better stocks and holding for longer holding for longer equals money number two if you buy it 50 and sell at 60 you've made a profit but if you buy it 50 and sell at 500 you've made a bigger profit only that the holding period might be longer but that's okay everybody wants to get rich nobody is willing to get rich slow never too late to invest in a good company Peter Lynch said that Cycles Cycles come and go penter drops a lot and it gains a lot it's a very volatile stock don't let that rattle you zoom out penter is now four times more than it was when it dpos in 2020 that's enough except volatility is normal penter May overreact in either Direction that's fine do not sell unless your thesis collapses with paler dollar cross average at any possible scenario you can think of dollar cost average into the Afterlife unless the company is no longer desirable for you",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,Osaq1KpTR7Q,2024-10-24T12:40:16Z,If you are a Tesla shareholder….GET READY,Tesla,"Tesla absolutely crushed its latest earning skull giving birth to one of the best quarters of Tesla in recent history every single thing we wanted to hear from this company finally happened and every single bare thesis that was still out there has now been evaporated because of what we've seen and heard in this earnings call and we have to talk about the bigger picture here I'm not going to bore you with a little tiny minutia details every little number the iida the adjusted iida that's horse baloney now for me one of the most important takeaways from this call wasn't the numbers which we'll talk about in a second I'll give you all the bottom lines of every single metric I promise but I want us to focus on what's important one of the biggest growth engines for Tesla is going to be the Cyber cap the robo taxi whatever you want to call it now one of the biggest gripes people had with Tesla is that during the recent event there were no timelines given and everything was kind of up in the air now in this call El said something incedible and a lot better than most people expected including some Bulls saying that Tesla is going to hit volume production on Cyber caps by 2026 that is incredible we're not talking the beginning of production we're talking about volume production by 2026 it is insane it means that Tesla is further ahead than most people thought now he also talks about 20 to 30% increase in volume as far as sales next year Automotive Sales and he basically says look it's going to happen one because we're going to introduce cheaper models cheaper options and number two because FSD is going to ramp up and still even more and it wasn't just the future and the guidance it also was the actual numbers we saw earnings per share beat estimates by 25% the energy sector grew 50% again 2.4 billion right now you can't ignore it Services as far as automotive services out of warranty up 30% now look I'm going to be honest with you the 8% Revenue growth was not amazing yes it is underwhelming especially if you're looking at Tesla as a growth company I get it but this 8% is just a temporary snag I think that once the new growth engines of Tesla will be presented and deployed this 8% is going to grow to the 20 30% like Elan said and as you notice the market actually believes in because the stock is up 12% nobody's paying attention to the fact that the revenue growth was only 8% because everybody's focused about what's coming next now as it stands already cyber TR is actually selling a lot better than people thought the top three EVS in America right now is the model 3 Model Y and the Cyber trck and if you look at the net income of Tesla 2.5 billion per quarter right now it is absolutely insane where this company has come from and where it's at right now now operating margin went up from 6% to 10% which is absolutely incredible and if you talk about energy which we talked about earlier deployments are actually up 75% so that 50% growth is just the beginning and on top of it we have $34 billion of cash with virtually no debt and for Tesla which manufactures Vehicles by the way to be completely unleveraged and so cash heavy it's absolutely insane how good the balance it looks now I think we can all safely say that the normal rational people who had doubts about Tesla can now put these doubts to rest certain people will never give up it might be ego it might be just you know they love the pain certain people will continue to bet against Tesla but rational normal investors that don't have an emotional attachment to this topic after this quarter I think we can say rest in peace all the Bears all the haters Tesla is a lot further ahead than even some of the Bulls thought now you're not even in the beginning of the growth cycle of Tesla the next esur for Tesla has not even started yet think about what Tesla is going to look like when these growth engines will be deployed think about FSD licensing right now Tesla is kind of testing the waters with FSD but imagine what happens once the floodgates will be open once other o M that don't have anything anything close to autonomous driving right now they'll have to buy Tesla software because nobody else is even close once Tesla becomes the primary Monopoly of full self driving of every other Auto manufacture around the world once full self-driving becomes the standard in all vehicles like power steering and Tesla is the only one with the code that's going to be a whole different ball game on top of it we have robotics which we've not even mentioned in today's video we have the Rob tax a business that God knows how much money is going to produce for Tesla we have the energy basically growing at insane paces and completely under the radar and you know what's going to happen next a lot of the saleside analysts that have been telling you that Tesla is a horrible company for the past six months they're going to put out updated price targets elevated price targets telling you how great Tesla is you have to remember for the most part not everyone but for the most part sside analyst they're kind of a weatherman they'll tell you what the street is thinking they're never going to give you an Edge ahead of time on a company like Tesla now look when I started investing in Tesla 5 years ago and by the way that investment was very kind to me despite all the turbulence despite all the stock price swings the stock is up about 900% 5 years now five years ago when we imagined what Tesla will be in 2025 we haven't thought about this what Tesla is today is light years ahead of what I thought back in 2019 and this is why Tesla has always served like a great transfer of wealth mechanism from the patient traders to the patient long-term investors like me who don't sell unless the thesis about the company gets destroyed and Tesla as I'll show you in a second has done nothing but improve the thesis over the past five years so according to the stock MVP scorecard and by the way stock MVP is a software I've built for you guys to break down analyze and look at stocks like a professional it's available at stock dmv.com use the code last 40 for 40% off until the end of the month then that code goes away so stocking the P scorecard say says that t is 85 out of 100 one of the highest scores we have seen on the platform if you break it down piece by piece it absolutely blows you away how much better Tesla has become over the past three years while people are telling you it's a horrible company Revenue 3 years ago was 31 it's now 96 billion net margin is now 13% which is incredible if you consider that Tesla literally makes cars cash three years ago was 19 billion it's now 30 billion it has twice more assets than liabilities it has way more cash than debt and it actually got better over the past three years the short interest is below 3% institutional investors are not betting against this company and talking about institutional shareholders right now Tesla is about 46% of institutional shareholding now once they cross 50% that score goes up to 90 or 95 I'm not sure but the thing is Tesla institutional shareholding is actually growing while sales out analyst are taking dumps on the company telling retail to sell now revenue is growing a lot faster than operating expenses and since IPO the stock has rewarded its shareholders 14,000 per. and of course it loses all the points on PE because at 55p it's higher than 30 any stock that's higher than 30 gets zero in the scorecard it is what it is so Tesla 85 is absolutely incredible and if you dig deep into the numbers you'll see that it has $95 billion in sales with only $10 billion of operating expenses a company that can give me 10 times more sales than operating expenses selling Vehicles it is absolutely mind-blowing don't you guys see it net income was 2.5 billion just three years ago it's currently 12 in a half billion it's getting better it's getting more efficient Tesla over the past three years have improved every single metric but the stock has been basically going sideways while saleside analysts and so-called experts were telling you that Tesla is is over when I see a company where the share price goes or even down while the business is shooting up I know it's my time to buy it's very very simple now obviously I'm not telling you to buy or sell Tesla it's your decision I'm just a rambling mad man with my own opinions but obviously doing research and look a few weeks ago I actually posted a video here on this channel saying that Tesla is a lot closer to 400 that people think $400 per share that is and a lot of critics and experts in the comment sections have been very vocal over the past week saying that I don't know what I'm talking about look at the share price Tom and whatnot and whatnot well after this earnings call it definitely seems a lot more plausible that I was right that I was wrong but this is just the beginning of the journey folks whether it hits 400 this year next year it doesn't matter for a long-term investor the only thing you need to do is to look at the business look at the strategy look at who is managing the company look at where this company is headed if you believe that this company is going to continue improving the way they have over the past 3 years over the next 5 years let's say you assume Tesla over the next 5 years with FSD with robotics with Robo taxi generates 40% of Revenue growth per year for the next five years now that is an ambitious goal no doubt but I believe it can do it now I'm not saying it's going to happen in a linear fashion 40% per year for 5 years but on average we're going to get about 40% per year for the next five years given the deployment of these new growth engines for Tesla if that happens Tesla is a $400 stock today simple that's a simple DCF so for me I feel very little risk being in Tesla and adding to my Tesla position at all times because I understand that based on my analysis of the business it's a $400 stock today which means that at $200 a pop it's an opportunity to buy it cheap very very simple now I've explained this concept in our Academy multiple times we don't look at stocks as some sort of a temporary way to get rich you buy a 20 you sell at 30 oh my God you've made so much money we are trying to hit the jackpot we want to buy at 20 and sell at 200 sell at 2,000 we won the big gains everybody wants to get rich everybody's trying to get rich quick most fail the easiest way to get rich is slow investing in great companies like Tesla over the Long Haul and continuing to dollar cost average into the stock and dollar cost average even harder when the stock drops so I can guarantee that you can get rich doing this strategy the only thing you need is to understand that it's going to take time and you're going to get rich slow and that's a lot of way to put on somebody's shoulder that wants to get it done this year tomorrow this month there's a reason why get rich quick schemes don't work you can't get rich gambling on stocks like Tesla it will punish you it will derail all your plans for the future it will make you feel very very small it will humble you it has done so for most specul lers that try to play the stock some get lucky some get lucky maybe a few times most get destroyed listen to me if you want to get rich of the stock market if you want to get rich of stocks like a Tesla generational game-changing companies the only thing you need to understand is number one you need to save more money so you have more money to deploy number two you need to pick good companies generational winners and number three you need to accept a holding period that is 15 to 20 years as long as you do these three things the only thing that's left for you is to continuously invest every single month a fixed amount.",1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,Osaq1KpTR7Q,2024-10-24T12:40:16Z,If you are a Tesla shareholder….GET READY,Stock MVP,so according to the stock MVP scorecard and by the way stock MVP is a software I've built for you guys to break down analyze and look at stocks like a professional it's available at stock dmv.com. so stocking the P scorecard say says that t is 85 out of 100 one of the highest scores we have seen on the platform if you break it down piece by piece it absolutely blows you away how much better Tesla has become over the past three years while people are telling you it's a horrible company,0.9,0.7
Tom Nash,F-BQBcydniA,2024-10-18T13:16:53Z,It is not too late to buy Palantir,Palantir,in today's video we're answering one simple question is it too late to invest in paler now at $42 the stock has gone up by 300% over the past three years it has 4X since it went public in 2020. a lot of investors are saying to themselves well there's so much hype around the stock so much noise so much fomo and the stock has ran up like crazy maybe it is simply too late to invest in paler and that's the topic of today's video. I was blathering on and on about piler how great it is how phenomenal of a company that is. my cousin Dima basically purchased a lot of pener shares at $10 per share and as you remember back in the day we had all this Reddit hype the meme stocks and the Reddit crowd basically took the stock to $35 per share very very quickly. everybody saying that palente is finished maybe it's time I take my money I take my lill you know I lose 20 30% on this but I'll be fine and you know I'll survive to fight another day. what were the reasons you invested in paler did any of these fundamental reasons change deteriorate got worse or did they stay the same or maybe even got better and now the price is significantly cheaper than what you paid for it originally. if that's how you feel about penter there's the opportunity to double down and dollar cost average into the stock and wait for the fundamental to take over the price. this week we had a kind of an off week with piler the stock was down 3% this week. why aren't you streaming the paner earnings why do you wait the next day to deliver a 7 minute recap video with kind of the bottom line of what happened well that is because I don't want to be a contrib to the noise that's driving short-term insanity and volatility and B encourages you to think there's something urgent about this there is nothing urgent about the palente earnings nothing is going to change if you find out about the earnings in a day or two. I see a lot of these patterns with paler I mean the stock launched at $10 then it went up to 35 on pure hype and meme stocks and fomo it quickly went down to $65 meanwhile the company was busy getting better getting more money in and we had this meme going you know when the stock would drop on the day that paler would announce another great contract so piler kept announcing contracts and business and getting better but the stock kept falling we found it funny nobody thought it was a bad thing we understood we're getting Prime for the big bounce and that big bounce happened from $6 and half to $42 and now we're here. number two it's obvious you cannot time a stock like paler it is impossible the growth volatility aspects of the stock in the short term are going to be insanely unpredictable and just basically random. so let's assume we have three style of dollar cost average investors in paler cautious guy average guy daring guy right so all these investors do is dollar cost average into paler so they are my people. this thing does not work unless paler is the next Microsoft level of a generational company if the company is good it's not going to be enough Palante has to be great for this thing to work unless it's a great generational company this Juju I just talked to you about means nothing because dollar cost averaging deep and hard into something that's just average or slightly above average is not going to get you anywhere. so how do I know that paler is that generational Juggernaut right right now the fourbe of Palante is 98 it is insane it is three times more expensive than Nvidia right now as far as 4D PE it is absolutely insane why not buy Nvidia at 33 fordp when paler is three times more it's not three times better I'm not saying it three times better but guess what if paler becomes if if paler becomes a one trillion dollar company which I personally in my opinion think it has a good chance of doing then we're going to 10 x our money. but on the company like paler it's more than 10 15 maybe even 20x who knows with paler if paler is going to be the most important software company in the world in 10 15 years I mean this number might even double maybe 20x who knows at this point. the thing is I look at paler and I look at metrics like rule of 40 for example which are a great way to analyze a Growth Company especially in SAS especially in the line of business that paler does Ru of 40 basically says that if you add up the free cash flow margin and the revenue growth if you get 40 That's phenomenal 35 is good 30 is okay penter at 50 right now it is absolutely phenomenal. if you look at the founders pet came from PayPal Facebook a billionaire 0er to one one of the best books ever written he's still there in the company 20 years later Alex karp is still there also another billionaire up there still in the company haven't left in fact they also have class F shares which basically means they will never leave this company. Anthology the way I understand it is basically the operating system that runs AI in businesses if you imagine all these AI systems working basically separately in different aspects of the business all this data being generated all these different analytical tools working in the business in the warehouse in the scheduling in the maintenance all this craziness going on onthology basically bring all of this AI models all these analytic tools into one place where the company can make instantaneous decisions based on all this data all this craziness that's going on now it basically allows companies to easily apply whatever AI models they're running whatever AI systems they're running at almost seamless quick times that are basically unheard of we have CEOs of companies talking about how paler changed the way they do business things that used to take six weeks now take six minutes essentially this is the operating system that the business world is going to run on for the next 15 to 20 years and to ignore it is kind of foolish in my opinion. but piler actually paves the roads and gives you the map of the GPS or where you want to go without a map without a GPS without a road a car and some asphalt ain't going to get you anywhere and the only guys who have the maps and the capabilities to pave these roads is piler it is unrivaled nobody comes close there's not a second Contender there Microsoft tried and failed with fabric rest in peace Fabric in fact I've never been more bullish about paler than I am right now. now look the fundamentals right now are good they're not amazing I mean if you look at the growth numbers 20% growth per year it's okay I mean they're getting better at becoming more efficient so we have less expenses while the revenues are growing great margins you know we have no debt the balance sheet is very very clean but what you need to understand that in my opinion I think we're really not there yet this is not the Quantum Leap of paler growing 20% per year this is basically paler idling waiting for the Quant leap we are just before the big Invidia moment for paler and paler isn't just sitting there waiting and hoping and wishing for this thing to happen they're making All the Right Moves behind the scenes prepping for this Quantum Leap in fact they're not really good at communicating how much better they're getting I like their approach it reminds me of the old Bill parcel's football coach where he just said like do your job I mean that's it that's as simple as that that's what poener has been doing for the past four years not really bragging not talking too much I mean occasionally Alex karp the CEO co-founder he comes out and says a few things but mainly paler has stayed quiet and yet despite that the stock is up 300% over the past three years. if you look at this company already in its current configuration where Alex karp has gotten into it's impressive right a100 billion do market cap 20% growth they're beating earnings consistently now clean balance sheet know that the mode that he created for paler is unsurmountable scalability is excellent all of this is great especially for a company that doesn't have any macro sensitivity because of the government business that's a huge shield and it's amazing leadership and its culture all of this is great but this is just the tip of the iceberg folks you ain't seen nothing yet. who cares whether palente is a little bit overvalue right now frankly the current share price is a little bit overvalued I get it I mean it has run up a little bit too quickly fine who cares if you're looking at this as a $400 $500 stock does it matter if you bought it 40 or 50 or 60 now. not the clowns who have sold paler for $9 because Alex karp banged on the table too loud my like,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,F-BQBcydniA,2024-10-18T13:16:53Z,It is not too late to buy Palantir,Microsoft,this thing does not work unless paler is the next Microsoft level of a generational company. look Microsoft back in 1986 right ipoed almost 40 years ago at 10 cents per share 10 cents per share now 990 four years later it has 10x to $1 per share then another 9 years later it was 58 times the previous price point $58 per share let's say you've completely missed the boat and overpaid you bought at $100 per share you have missed the boat very late very overvalued from this point on you are up four times on your money from $100 to $400 $ You've still made 4X on your money by being late to invest in a great company that's the point I'm making here. Microsoft tried and failed with fabric rest in peace Fabric.,1.0,0.7
Tom Nash,F-BQBcydniA,2024-10-18T13:16:53Z,It is not too late to buy Palantir,Apple,you can see this example in other companies Apple for example and again I'm not comparing paler to Apple different companies different business models I'm not saying they are similar or comparable I'm using this as a concept to make a point Apple about 20 years ago was a $1 stock $24 $1 per share by 2009 the stock is trading at $77 it has 7x and people are saying well now it's overvalued but guess what by 2015 the stock is at $30 now people are saying it's overvalued from 2015 to now 10 years later the stock has 10 xed so now it's overvalued right you see my point here it is never never never overvalued if you're investing in a great generational company.,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,F-BQBcydniA,2024-10-18T13:16:53Z,It is not too late to buy Palantir,Nvidia,why not buy Nvidia at 33 fordp when paler is three times more it's not three times better I'm not saying it three times better but guess what if paler becomes if if paler becomes a one trillion dollar company which I personally in my opinion think it has a good chance of doing then we're going to 10 x our money but as far as Nvidia goes the upside the ceiling is not that high Nvidia is already a $3 trillion company how bigger can it get from here can it get to 6 trillion 9 trillion let's say it goes to 9 trillion you have 3xtra money so at the end of the day the potential to me as an investor on a company like Nvidia is maybe 3x from here but on the company like paler it's more than 10 15 maybe even 20x who knows with paler. so you have Nvidia right Nvidia is basically creating the asphalt right they're building the building blocks of this and they're absolutely going haywire right now rightfully so. this is basically paler idling waiting for the Quant leap we are just before the big Invidia moment for paler.,1.0,0.6

Tom Nash,ytXlcDTz3fQ,2024-09-13T14:18:37Z,If you are a PALANTIR shareholder….GET READY,Palantir Technologies,"Alex karp the CEO and founder of palent Technologies just left the entire CNBC panel absolutely speechless this man has said something I've never thought a CEO of a70 billion company will say on national TV the man has balls of steel and because in my videos I never ha you hostage you're going to hear exactly what you said in the beginning of the video the bottom line always comes first the analysis is always later if you got stuff to do you got to go I understand I'm not in the business of creating retention for Revenue bottom line first so don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing now the bottom line here is quite simple I'm going to let you know what he said then I'm going to show you how he said it and then we're going to break about the other million things he said in that interview which are absolutely mind-blowingly insane so the first thing I want to focus here and the one thing that blew my mind and I think left everybody speechless is that this man went on CNBC and said hey piler is going to 10 x from here meaning pilante is going to be a $700 billion company now a lot of CEOs of publicly traded companies they think that maybe potentially they fantasize about that nobody would have the kahunas to say this on national TV like it's just another Tuesday and yet this man does shows you exactly what he's made of and what the company he has created in his image is made of check it out my firm belief is paler will be 10 times bigger in the future you know you've had all these critiques of paler where the Frankenstein monster it can't be a product it's never going to be be free cash flow positive it's never going to be Gap profitable it could never get on the S&amp;P it's clearly very valuable but it can't be 10 times Val more valuable and you know our our job is to show and not tell and we are going to show that we can be 10 times bigger than we are now now this is the same man just a few days ago posted a video message to the retail investing Community saying hey guys you are the real deal for decades and decades all this mainstream media all these professional money managers they have trained you to think that you are subpar that you are inferior to the smart money you are the dumb money this man comes out a day after the S&amp;P 500 inclusion and says look retail investors that's not a derogatory term anymore retail investment that's not a slight retail investor have seen their true value of penter before all of you so-called smart money retail investors have put their money their reputation on the line betting on us when you were running for the hills because retail have gone through the mud they have gone through the tough times and to find a CEO of a $70 billion company with one of the most fundamentals in the stock market I'll show you in a second the fundamentals of paler are absolutely insane a company like that a company that's headed to be the next Microsoft pretty much a company like that has a CEO that comes on and does a video message for the retail Community saying hey we are the rebels we won [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Wall Street pretty much that's what he said I'm paraphrasing slightly I don't think he actually said [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Wall Street but hey well I think that's what he actually thinks although I don't have official confirmation I mainly support by the way something that seems to be escaping both parties which is if you touch an American we will inflict pain on you for Generations that should be the US policy whether that happens in Gaza whether that happens in Ukraine wherever that happens you cannot touch Amer one of the things that impressed me the most about this interview has nothing to do with Foundry AIP paler the stock market Wall Street or even economics or Finance not even stocks he basically said look America whoever wins these elections it doesn't matter who wins but America has to adopt one simple policy if you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with an American anywhere on this planet you will receive generational levels of pain that's very simple concept that needs to be understood by American adversaries and it's been kind of Lost in Translation of the past few years it has to get back now Alex isn't taking Sid here he's not saying hey I think Cela will do it better or Trump will do it better he basically says look whoever wins you have to make sure that America projects strength again otherwise this whole thing is going to come down like a house of cards this is step one of building the dominance of the West over over its adversaries now look I don't know what about you there's a lot of people want to burn down their house I get it they're Psychopaths but I as somebody who came from that part of the world and very happy with the Western way of life and I would like to preserve it and if you got a problem with it and you want to see Empire is burned you're welcome to go to Iran or China and set up shop over there I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's dig into the software so we're here AIP pcon for your software AIP um you've been on the record that right now only two things matter chips and ontology all right so you don't make chips what's ontology you've been out talking about ontology kind of preaching about it how does it relate to Enterprise customers and the use of AI so there's AI is a mysterious Revolution people basically have it wrong they think all the values in the large language models large language models are like is like hydrocarbons in the ground they need to be processed if you're going to do something Beyond chat something that is crucial for the business like bringing hydrocarbons out of the ground or actually in the government contest monitoring troops figuring out how to kill your adversary while staying alive th that raw knowledge has to be processed and put in your system in the logic of your system and in the security model of your system at the cost your system wants to pay for a particular kind of model so long story short that hydrocarbon like llm is essentially worthless to your business without the processing capabilities both in the antology and in Foundry and we believe this 5 years ago we figured this out by the way by doing work for the US government some of that work is going to be presented today so if you want to really kill your adversary on the battlefield or change the economics of your business you need a way of processing the raw resources so our main goal is to accelerate product development in all areas military manufacturing government AI backed targeting AI backed uh ways of running your business where do you put the wires what is the most efficient way of having the customer connect to you how do you do preventive maintenance on the wires how do you do preventive maintenance on the on the infrastructure You're Building how do you do the capital allocation so that you can maximize it these are all these are these are actually life and death uh issues for the Enterprise because if you mess that up you mess up your margins you mess up the quality of your revenue and you get disrupted by other competitors and what pounder will allow you to do is transform that in in in in a in in a quarter what would have taken you three five years to do and that's why we have these very loyal very deep contracts with customers and by the way us commercial especially but also including uh you know BP and and other places in the world is just extraordinarily strong we've been growing year onye roughly 70% for 3/4s so it's like we are famous for what we've done to help the US and its allies I'm very proud of that but you know the unknown somewhat public secret of peners we're just crushing it in US commercial and that's really important it's important for America it's important for paler car basically was asked one question which is hey what do you guys even do the usual standard question by people who don't understand poer Tech and have not really bothered to educate themselves on the topic which seems to be kind of a recurring phenomenon in Min media but that's besides the point and Alex says one simple thing we will help you the company understand your business better than you ever had before and guess what next time you are going to disrupt yourself instead of the next Hot Shot startup coming in and taking your lunch you will do it yourself time and time over with our solution we will help you be the disruptor of your own industry so you don't lose your dominance in the next 10 15 20 years you stay always ahead of the curve with our software with our solution with our platform instead of you getting old getting tired and getting stale we're going to keep you up to date that's a great sales pitch but also it is true because that's how you have hundreds of clients willing to pay millions of dollars every year for this thing and if you remember back in the day one of the biggest problems paler head is to get through the door corporate clients unlike the government for some reason had a lot of politics in them back in the day and paler always struggled because the point of contact in the company would never never let paler in because they've already built a Frankenstein product that have cost millions of dollars they're not about to let paler walk through the door and say hey whatever you guys built over there that cost a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lot of money we got something a fraction of the cost that works 100 times better nobody wanted to look stupid stupid but back in the day I told you this gatekeeper problem is going to solve itself you know how well because a few Brave customers will take the leap of faith on paler those customers will dominate their industry and when they dominate the industry the other businesses will actually start banging on palen's door and it's going to be an oversubscribed business model which exactly is what happened right now customers are banging on the door paler can't meet the demand the cost of not working with paler has gone up so much that it outweighs the cost of looking like an idiot for not doing it in the first place now look I also want to talk about the fact that Peter Teel literally told you guys this is what going to happen way before Tom Nash did if you read Peter teel's book 0 to1 from 2017 he literally laid out the game plan of how he's going to do it 0 to1 literally says hey we're going to build a company that's going to be a monopoly pretty much in a market that still doesn't even exist with a product that nobody even understands of how it's going to look like and people thought it was a psychopath and yet now when you read 0 to1 in 2024 it makes perfect sense now Alex carp also says what I've been saying for the past few months llms are a commodity nobody cares about llms and generative AI the money isn't there the money is either in the infrastructure where Nvidia is making a killer bank or in the anology which is literally the operating system the llm is just the commodity it's everywhere everybody has an llm grandpa has built a new llm who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the money is infrastructure and operating system there's no other solutions that come even close to nvidia's and Palante [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now nvidia's moment has already happened so people understand yeah Nvidia is the best at what it does palen's moment hasn't come yet people are still standing at the bottom of the mountain saying that it's a beautiful day they don't see the Avalanche coming the moment that happens paler will have its Invidia moment I've been telling you this is going to happen for the past four years people have been calling me crazy well not so crazy anymore now look another thing he's saying is that look we're building a company that's based on providing a solution that is tailor fitted for a client with the speed of a completely automated off the-shelf product think about what I just said here basically what this means is the way to sell software back in the day until Palante arrived was very very unique that unique system was build something that people have built before so you can raise money to build that because you have to prove that it work works and then shoehorn that thing and try to shove it down the throat of your client and basically make it somehow Frankenstein work right pener comes in and says no we're going to do this absolutely different we have an absolute sandbox of a system you tell us exactly your business your logic your needs your problems we're going to study it we have the smartest the best people then we're going to come back and build in our sandbox mode a software solution which is absolutely automated but is custom tailored to you so this interview is a great showcase of what Alex karp really is and what he isn't he a non-compromising guy he is clapping at the doubters at any opportunity basically teabagging them into Oblivion he's full of confidence but not arrogance and he's not scared to say exactly what he thinks including not to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with America including that he thinks that Palante is going to tend X including everything he said that nobody in Silicon Valley would have ever thought about saying a year ago when I started this penter Journey a lot of people are saying well Tom you need to look at snowflake Warren Buffett invested in Snowflake it has better net dollar retention look at how many clients they have they have all these collaborations and Frank slothman is God's gift to humanity and all this okay okay cool now I've never invested in Snowflake but let's review this you know this is 2024 when we started this journey snowflake was you know 2020 snowflake was all the hype snowflake is still not profitable palente has been profitable for quite a while snowflake is not the S&amp;P 500 paler is snowflake of the past year has reduced its EB da by 24% peners of the past year increased by 500% income net income minus 18% of the past year on snowflake penter plus 1,000% cash positions minus 14 over the past year paler plus 30% forward be of snowflake 120 now is paler trading in a massive premium yes is it actually one of the hypest stock in the market right now yes is it very expensive yes can it drop 50% yes all of these things are true think about Tesla post the hype cycle where it was the darling of the stock market Anything Can Happen hence the importance of DCA dollar cost average which is essentially buying the stock every couple of weeks 14 days buy 14 days buy 14 days buy still goes up you buy still goes down you buy and if the stock drops it drops below a certain threshold which you set which you can learn more about in our Academy pin for Nash if it drops below certain threshold and you can start thinkering with that weighted average and start dollar cost averaging at a little bit faster of a speed that way in two or three years all of a sudden when everybody made two or three bucks on the stock trading from 32 to 35 you've been sitting in a 10 12 14 average basically doubling tripling your money especially with a company of these sort of fundamentals a 30% free cash flow margin a 50 rule of 40 when 40 is considered absolutely insanely good a company that in 2019 had 2400 employees currently nearing 4,000 employees just 5 years later a company that had a lot of fud fear uncertainty and doubt to deal with about the delution oh my God pilers deluding in shareholders look in 2021 paler had two billion shares right now it has 2.2 billion shares pener over the past 3 years or so has deluded 10% of their shareholders 10% in 3 years all this noise look in 2019 pener had a billion dollars of cash it's currently sing $4 billion of cash company had 4X their cash since 2019 and yeah sure it was unprofitable in 2020 minus 1.1 billion in 2021 minus 500 million in 2022 - 370 million in 2023 plus 210 million trailing 12 months $400 million I've told you it's temporary that unprofitable company thing that's gone delution is gone scalability is gone with 80% gross margin when the company's business keeps getting better and better but the price keeps dropping dropping like we had in 2022 this is the time to Dollar cross average folks I've told you this before a company has a free cash flow that has literally 10x since 2019 from 46 million to 550 million a company with a revenue growth that went from $1.1 billion in 20 20 to $2.5 billion right now 2.5x Revenue in four years so scalability [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] delution [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] non-profitable [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so penter has basically spent the last four years eliminating the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the fud now while the rest of the smart money was betting against it shorting the stock and basically saying it's a bad deal the retail Community actually knew better and that's why retail investors got to invest in this company without the premium because they knew better than the so-called smart money look at how much premium this company added for its investors the ones who bought at seven and eight and N9 and 10 and $12 and $15 and $20 over the past year the company's up 123% past 6 months 41% I guess it's not a $5 stock after all",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,NEceSxAfLdU,2024-09-10T17:02:53Z,Palantir CEO Alex Karp Just Said The UNTHINKABLE,Palantir,"so Alex karp woke up one day and chose violence this man just went on to have one of the biggest mic drop moments in history completely annihilating Wall Street culture Silicon Valley culture and empowering the retail investing Community all in one six minute clip he just posted on the paler YouTube channel people Trend to use the term retail investor which is another way of saying people courageous enough to invest their own money otherwise known as tendy in what they believe in and look at the list of the people are Partners I hate the term clients but look at the list of people that use our product the most important clandestine Services the most important special operators the most important AI targeting work in the world the most important allies none of whom were ashamed to support in private or in public they rely on paler look at our list of commercial of Partners in the in and outside the US but especially in the US that use paler either at Foundry deontology AIP all the above and are beginning and in some cases are already using uh our platform as a platform and then look at our structural advantage of having this a company built around what you ought to built not what you were told to build in some weird otherwise called uh artistic program that's kind of academic and imposed upon you by people that have no skin on the game we resisted that we are going to continue to resist that not just for our sake but for the sake of our partners that rely on us in any case everybody all of you who are inside the company and around the world should celebrate that the rebels won the rebels won on Friday I don't know any other occasion like this where the rebels actually got inside the gate and helped the institutions transform themselves and there's no better metaphor for that than being admitted to the S&P 500 and while it's maybe not the most important thing I am really really really happy this clip is precisely why we love Alex karp and why we invest in this company look he could have done the regular thing the normal thing what every other CEO does and situation let the lawyers draft up an official notice put it on the investor relation website and forget about it instead he goes out into the woods and makes a video saying Hey retail investors we love you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Wall Street I absolutely love that with a GoPro in the woods now look I'm not going to be sitting here talking about how great Alex carp is because we know I think I've done 700 videos explaining that exact point but my point is very simple the addition to the S&P 500 while is not carrying any fundamental value for the company it actually shows that a lot of the garbage you heard about paler its management and its business over the course of the past 5 years was absolute horeshit and Absolute Total dog manure on Friday paler uh was admitted to the S SMP which is an enormous momentous occasion for every palarian it is enormous because the way in which we built the company should have precluded membership to the most elite institution in economic life the S&P 500 in order to be on the S&P 500 you have to be Gap profitable which is a financial way of saying you have to make real attendees subtracting everything after subtracting every form of renumeration that could possibly be included including your well-deserved equity and we did it and how did we do it we built the best products in the world we started off in one area of the West CL clandestin Services we migrated into the military into spec ops into US commercial and into us into commercial globally and how did we do that we built products first PD PG then we built Apollo then we built products for the spec ops then we built uh Maven then then we built Foundry then we built the antology and uh we then integrated that into AIP all these products were conceived and productized and now are being platformization prevents the use of the most important Technologies of our of our lifetime I.E Ai and large language models uh as an end user and these were conceived again and productized in some cases a decade before anyone else even thought that you would need them much less that the whole Enterprise would turn on a platform uh that actually could power Ai and large language models it's still radical to the point where people do not completely comprehend they do not comprehend how we could have turned a switch and gone to Gap profitability and and gone from what adults professional managers and some analysts thought was a Frankenstein monster powered by a freak show leader me to uh a a dynamic clearly profitable company worthy of and admitted to the S&P 500 and we did it our way one of the most important parts of that clip to me was the fact that Alex karp is a guy who is into changing cultures taking rotten horrible cultures and changing them for the better he did it in Silicon Valley you know the founder mode that everybody's talking about right now it's going viral well Alex karp literally told you the blueprint to how to do this back in April or May this year so Alex karp just basically took this idea that was revolutionary and absolutely weird and strange when he talked about it may and now it's being a Ed as the mainstream Silicon Valley so now he's doing the same thing on Wall Street he's basically saying look guys the way you've been handling things I don't like and I'm going to change and pener in his credit did change as he said the term retail investor Alis carp says this in this video said look retail investor doesn't mean what you've in conditioned to think it means it's no longer oh it's the dumb retail investor that doesn't know what they're doing penter proves that retail investors are better at this game than the professional money managers it proves that they knew better they knew well in advance and they actually took their money and put it on the line something that these professional M managers they don't do they play with other people's money and get a fee for it he's basically saying R investors are way better at this game than Pros the times are changing like the Bob Dylan song and it's funny because he still sees himself and penter as the rebels he's basically saying we are the rebels we're coming to change [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around when they went to Colorado basically saying look we're going to do things different the proof was on them because because the burden of the proof on you when you say look I'm going to do this better because I'm better than all of yall and when he actually delivered and for the past few years they sure as hell delivered now he gets to enjoy his flowers no doubt and obviously you're going to see a lot of the hype build up around the stock again now that everybody's going to be talking about it a lot of opportunists will be trading this stock because it's a momentum stock right now now look trading is a scam trading is not a game which you want to play it's a stupid game that's going to earn you stupid prizes do not trade at all and definitely do not trade this stock trying to figure out and guess where the bottom and where the top is a useless stupid idiotic game to play you buy a 10 you sell a 12 you buy a 20 sell a 22 you buy a 30 sell a 32 you made a lot of money oh my God you have a 100% hit rate but hey what if you held from 8 to 35 and didn't sell at all you would be in much better position than these Traders they're idiots don't fall for the scam trading is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whole the line hold the stock all you got to do is invest longterm and just wait and be patient Warren Buffett coined this phrase many years ago he said look everybody wants to get rich nobody is willing to get rich slow this is exactly what we're talking about here if you have done your research if you understand that paler is the greatest thing that's coming for the stock market if you agree with me here which I'm not saying you have to because a lot of people disagree with me a lot of people may say well Tom piler is a horrible company so be it it's your work it's your research do the work make up your own damn mind don't go investing into paler any of this stock because I said so and vice versa you know you have your own brain use it so if you've done the work if you've done the research and you've decided that penter is the stock for you longterm investing beats anything else time in the market beats time in the market any day of the week it's impossible to win that game trading is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scam 90% of retail investors lose money consistently in the stock market even though the stock keeps going up over the duration of the next 10 15 years it's going to keep going up but they will lose money because they're in out they're playing they're trading they're actively trading themselves to death with the help of mainstream media and the big money they're getting conned and they're being led to the slaughter house like sheep don't be sheep play the long game this is a game where you have the advantage all the professionals they have to trade they have to actively basically try and make money every single year to Showcase results you don't have shareholders and the strategy is so simple it's laughable I'm going to give it away in about 30 seconds dollar cost average buy penter stock at a fixed amount every 14 days keep on buying until eternity and every time the stock dips 20% below the 52e high you buy at a quicker pace and every time it goes back up into that threshold amount then you slow down and buy at the DCA pace which is the normal pace and if you're asking me well how do I have money to constantly DCA number one get a job number two get a budget make sure you understand how much free cash flow you you have at the end of the month invest half of it half of it you put on the sideline and anytime you need to DCA double down you have that money on the sideline whether it's $300 or $300,000 it doesn't matter in fact it is so simple that most people find this boring and that's why they can't do it the hardest thing about this thing it's not the mechanics it's not the DCA double down and all the stuff the hardest thing is forget about the price Let It Go and stay discipline that's what most people struggle with.",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,xYX6wTY8iEQ,2024-09-09T16:56:37Z,Tom Lee Issues an URGENT Warning For Investors,Nvidia,I mean Tech I think revealed its hand last week cuz Nvidia had a good number but it fell so when stocks fall in good news you know it's either a crowded trade or something bad could be coming in know nvidia's last 10 years of History uh there have been 30% draw Downs almost eight times of similar magnitude uh its PE Nvidia Ford PE was actually higher at the bottom of those draw Downs you know right now Nvidia toward PS in the mid-20s so to me this looks like a normal profit taking maybe it takes Nvidia down to the '90s but I think 2 years from now that's really going to be a gift risk of a 7 to 10% draw down between now and November. Now he's also talking about Nvidia saying look Nvidia may have been a crowded trade I mean everybody piled into Nvidia we had good earnings great numbers and the stock fell that's usually a sign of a crowded trade but the fact that it's a crowded trade doesn't mean it's a bad long-term investment he's basically saying look it might drop even further who knows we might see Nvidia at 90 but in a few years when Nvidia continues to dominate the AI infrastructure Market which it will for at least a few more years that 90 is going to seem like a present like a gift which is undoubtable NVIDIA has went through a lot of these Cycles where it dropped 20 30% he's right but it has always gone up because of its dominance in the market what he's saying is that for long-term investors 90 is cheap for NVIDIA but if you don't have the patience and you want to play this trading mentality game I don't know what to say it's going to be complicated in the crowded trade like Nvidia.,1.0,0.5

Tom Nash,-kolIk5i3mw,2024-08-28T12:37:25Z,Nvidia Stock - URGENT WARNING,Nvidia,"one of the biggest Tesla and Nvidia Bulls in existence Jean monster was just in CNBC issuing a very urgent warning for NVIDIA investors before earnings um you think the odds are skewed that Nvidia actually trades down on earnings why is that I don't think that that uh that stock action should be representative of the opportunity Nvidia over the next couple years the new blackw chip from Nvidia might be delayed and that delay might push a lot of Twitchy people who have no understanding of Nvidia to sell off because they're paper hands n is maybe 28 times for earnings which is for the best one of the most important companies in the world it's not a high multiple so that Nvidia seems to me to be uh Cisco of the Next Generation The only game in town is Jensen the stock has run so much into the quarter that it needs a 2 billion Revenue beat it also needs the revenue guidance come in $2 billion higher than expected Nvidia is an amazing company great growth amazing cash flow superb margins but you're paying a premium price even given all of those pluses look they're a victim of their own success the stocks tripled in the last year and a half so it's been a great thing to own let's talk about Nvidia from an objective perspective Nvidia is right now the leader of the entire AI Revolution chat GPT comes out and then Nvidia becomes the only game in town for infrastructure they are the only ones who are making what people need to build their infrastructure around around Ai and now everybody needs AI you need AI whether you're in retail it know Healthcare any sort of Industry needs Ai and these are the building blocks and Nvidia holds the keys right now they're pretty much the Monopoly and that's why their revenue from data centers which is their AI product have gone 20x over the past four years you know a few years ago that was about 10% of the business right now it's 90% of the business of Nvidia so it's a complete flip now beyond the fact that the business have grown significantly the numbers are phenomenal right the company's you know revenu is up 208% over the past year you know operating income is up 1,000% over the past year absolutely insane net income over the past year is up 800% cash is up 105% and have actually decreased their debt by 10% and all of that with a forward PE of 34 which is identical almost to Google and Microsoft and Amazon and all these other companies so they're not really trading in a massive massive premium the facto looking at all these numbers they're pretty reasonably priced especially given the fact that they're kicking everybody's ass right now sorry excuse my French but you know what I mean now look here's the thing right now these great numbers if you couple it with the fact that about 66 out of 70 analysts who are covering Nvidia and mainstream media are positive you add the fact that they had six consecutive triple plays triple plays basically means that they've beat their on EPS earnings per share on revenue and they've raised guidance imagine six time in a row doing that that's a massive achievement but also it puts a lot of expectation on Nvidia going into these earnings on Wednesday the expectation is that revenue is going to be up 112% and that EPS earnings per share is going to be up 125% there's very little room for error here with Nvidia you have to understand this now I have no idea what happens in all likelihood Nvidia beats earnings and the stock runs to the Moon probably right but should they miss and I know this is a low probability event but should they miss earnings this time around with all this mountain of expectations on their back the consequence are going to be very harsh for NVIDIA and for the rest of the market in general especially tech companies now there's a huge risk here short term because the correction that might come if they miss even though it's a low probability event are going to be so significant you can't ignore it now here's the thing long term for the next 3 to 5 years there ain't nobody on this planet that says Nvidia isn't going to dominate and isn't going to generate massive amounts of cash flow massive amounts of business and nobody here is saying that Nvidia isn't going to be dominant for the next 3 to 5 years there's simply no alternative and no alternative in sight but what some people are asking themselves right now is whether Nvidia pricing wise have gone up too fast and needs to correct backwards and I don't know what's going to happen after earnings there's literally a 5050 50 chance nobody knows and if people are telling you because they've seen some lines on the chart they see that they can tell where this thing is going to go before and after earnings they're just bullshitting you they're trying to sell you some sort of product ignore block and move on nobody knows I think there will be two types of investors going into Wednesday and coming out out of Wednesday I think Traders are going to make a lot of money trading around earnings just because of the volatility but long-term investors like myself will be divided to two groups going in and out a Wednesday There's a famous saying you always know how you step into the court of law but you never know how you're going to step out the same thing with these earnings the type A are going to come in these earnings and if the stock runs up they're just going to keep buying and if the stock drops they'll buy even more because they understand this is going to be an opportunity now the second type will be the more newer investors in the market people who have joined the past month over the past year and haven't really experienced a serious pullback once Nvidia if Nvidia actually drops of the earnings the Fear Factor may push a lot of them to actually Panic sale and sell right into the hands of investors like myself and that's fine but let me tell you what happens if Nidia and I don't tend to talk a lot about shortterm but in this segment I'll do it just to kind of put you mind at ease if you're a long-term investor here's why you shouldn't be afraid not because of the next 3 to 5 years forget about that that's a given everybody agrees that the next 3 to five years in video are going to be great why you shouldn't be afraid for the next two months I would even go so far as saying why you shouldn't be afraid for the next month because because here's the scenario that I see Nvidia goes up after earnings great foro continues all the hype continues and then we wait for the correction next time but if Nvidia drops what's going to happen when Nvidia hits 110 what's going to happen when Nvidia hits 100 you know exactly what's going to happen because it's literally something that happened just a few days ago just a couple weeks ago you literally saw what happens when Nvidia drops to these prices the de buyers they step right in because they understand that Nvidia these prices is a steal and any sort of dip that's going to be created by a bad reception of earnings the Nvidia dip buyers are going to fill very very quickly so I wouldn't even be worried about Nvidia in the short term if you're going to step into these earnings make sure you understand that if there's a dip in Nvidia it's going to be bought up quite quickly not even to mention the fact that the next three to five years for NVIDIA is pretty much a shuing with them being a quas monopoly not even mentioning the fact that there's a lot of sideline money right now $6.24 trillion waiting for a dip like this to actually put some money in play before it's too late so make sure you understand that the next couple of days are going to be turbulent make sure you understand exactly what you do in each scenario have a game plan get some popcorn get your emotions out of the way and just sit back relax and enjoy this.",1.0,0.7

Tom Nash,247JpqzM5Gc,2024-08-26T19:22:21Z,NVIDIA: DON’T SAY YOU DIDN’T KNOW | Earnings Preview,NVIDIA,hey everybody this is Tom Nash and in this video we're talking about Nvidia now Nvidia is going to report earnings this Wednesday at 400 p.m. Eastern and for nerds and Geeks of the stock market like myself this is pretty much the Super Bowl we will all be glued to the screen trying to see what's going on because Nvidia is either going to take everybody else with them outside the stratosphere or down to the junkyard it's that important right now Nvidia is literally the most important stock in the market and whatever it does on Wednesday is going to impact everybody if they sneeze we will all be wet I promise you that Look if you look at the Nvidia kind of mainstream media Multiverse there's a lot of different opinions from a lot of smart people this is accelerating and I think the street like you said every quarter prove it prove it this revolution is just starting but it all starts with Nvidia in my opinion it is the most important earnings not just of the Year potentially in many years because of what this represents in terms of tax if $300 billion is all going to go to Nvidia you know what to do in the stock market There's a lot of chatter about how great N Video is Nidia is an amazing company great growth amazing cash flow superb margins but you're paying a premium price even given all of those pluses and there's a lot of conflicting information this is why a video like this is super important I know people have made a lot of money on Nvidia over the past two quarters and today everybody's convinced it's going to blast through earnings again and it probably will don't do things that are bad habits like trading Nvidia around earnings it's volatile it's risky that stock action should be representative of the opportunity Nvidia over the next couple years So Nvidia looks stretched does that mean you sell it I think it's a dangerous game to play if you don't own it the only way you can sell it is to short the stock and that's a recipe for disaster especially leading into an earnings report so if you're a long-term investor in Invidia all you want to do is just DCA dollar cost average you want to keep buying Nvidia all year long and if Nvidia dips like it did a few weeks ago from 130 to 98 you buy a little bit faster now I've gone over this again and again I'm not going to repeat myself but that's kind of the mentality we have with Nvidia if you're Nvidia shareholder that's what you do We've seen it in Nvidia when it dropped to 98 some people really just were too afraid to buy the stock for no reason other than the fact that they Dro in price and all of a sudden it's not that attractive anymore I think Nvidia this time around has an extremely tall order to fill they have a very high bar if you haven't seen the estimates they're looking forward to beating 112% Revenue growth expectations and 125% earnings per share growth expectation any slight Miss on this and it's going to be big big Kaboom we will all be in the toilet trust me now it's not likely and I do believe Nvidia should beat these earnings I don't think they'll Miss but if by any chance they miss everybody's going to go to the toilet really quick and that's something you have to consider I also screwed up Nvidia a year ago I've made a post on my community telling you hey I think Nvidia is a great company but I think given the current price a year ago you know I'm going to keep my money personally in paler and Tesla because I think palente and Tesla will give me great results for the year so I personally won't be buying in Nvidia even though I'm extremely bullish about the company I think they have great fundamentals etc etc etc but for my own portfolio I'm sticking with paler and Tesla now as you know I'm always transparent with my choices and when I screw up like this hey I'm going to talk about it so a year goes by and we are here today in the future so all of a sudden Nvidia a year later is up 170% on the other hand you have penter up 120% which is not as good and Tesla is down 7% so my portfolio is now comprised of the S&P 500 paler and Tesla significantly underperformed Nvidia at 170% so I've made a mistake I was wrong I should have allocated some funds and started dollar cost averaging into Nvidia a year ago and this goes to show you that we all make mistakes and that's part of the process I think nvidia's main risk is what would be the willingness of the hyper scalers to keep spending the crazy amounts of money they've already spent if you ask Eric Schmidt in that lecture I showed in the previous video he's saying it's only going to increase he's talking about 300 billion I mean the numbers are absolutely imaginary based on the Eric Schmidt numbers from that Stanford talk we're talking about a 5 trillion dollar market cap for NVIDIA which is almost double from the current price if you listen to other people like ask about the modun well it's already overvalued the big question is what will the hypers skillers do if they go to Nvidia exclusively like they're going right now and they'll continue to spend like this or even more Nvidia is definitely going into the stratosphere now a lot of people are saying well that's not going to happen though this is going to be a Cisco 2.0 at some point the hypers skillers are going to reduce the R&D expenses they're going to reduce their CICS and everything will go back to normal but here's the thing people don't understand when you talk about Cisco you you're talking about the life cycle of Telecom CAPIC spending this thing once you spend it is going to last a long long time we're talking about computer chips these things have a life cycle of two three four years Max and then you have to have the new one and the better one this is not going away we're not even half through the cycle of the current stuff we have so Nvidia is definitely going to be on top they're not going to be the next Cisco that's a bunch of horse manure that's not something I'm concerned about but yes the competition and the ability and desire of hyperscalers to keep spending that's something that's definitely risk and you have to take it into account you can't just ignore it in discount and say oh that's never going to happen you have to be mindful of this but the next Cisco it's not so the question is what happens next well what happens next is just sit and you wait and you look at the stock market and you say okay bring it on Wednesday 4 p.m. they have the earnings they have the talk and we know a lot better about what the hypers SKS are doing Jensen is going to be very transparent about what's happening and we know more the stock market will react obviously violently one way or the other it's either going to go up or down but it's going to be very violent if the stock flew out of the stratosphere well that means you continue to Dollar across average at your normal Pace but if by any chance they've missed even slightly and the stock have dropped but nothing fundamentally in the analysis changes NVA then all of a sudden There's an opportunity for you to double down your DCA I've actually posted a video but in that video I've made a full DCF valuation of Nvidia so on the screen right now you are seeing right here a video that I've done two days ago with the full valuation models of Nvidia go watch it right now so you have all the informations before the informations all the information before earnings thank you so much I'll see you in the next one peace,0.95,0.7

Tom Nash,lsiaZYfs7-U,2024-08-25T19:58:04Z,A Once in a Lifetime Investment Opportunity Is Here,FED,so Jerome pal the Fed chair comes out doish and I think that is the right thing the right component to combust the markets to ignite the next Bull Run so with inflation dying with the labor market basically being very very shaky this is a good setup for the FED to be very aggressive with the rate Cuts If the Fed has essentially two mandates one is the labor market the other one is inflation so if inflation is getting better and better and better we dropped all the way from 9% at the peak to 2.9% right now we're really close to that 2% Target while the job market unemployment numbers keep rising and Rising quite concerning now with unemployment the one thing you need to understand that it doesn't just always continuously rise in a linear fashion unemployment numbers can really Spike up quickly on you like a train leaving the station right in the beginning it's slow but then it gets fast and Fast and all of a sudden before you can even notice you can't even catch that train so the FED is now more concerned about the labor market unemployment numbers and that means we're going to have big cuts coming up inflation is now much closer to our objective the labor market has cooled considerably from its formerly overheated State the unemployment rate began to rise over a year ago and is now at 4.3% the cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable we do not seek or welcome further Cooling in labor market conditions the upside risks to inflation have diminished and the downside risks to employment have increased the time has come for policy to adjust and this is a great setup because it means that unless one of these events happens we are on a trajectory to go higher and higher this year. after the very doish Jackson Hall speech from Jerome Powell we are heading up not down. the FED is pivoting that's obviously a certainty right now after Jackson Hall. of course pal Jackson Hole is so important obv.,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,lsiaZYfs7-U,2024-08-25T19:58:04Z,A Once in a Lifetime Investment Opportunity Is Here,Nvidia,for example Nvidia missing earnings this Wednesday so unless big Tech sells off or unless the economy breaks after the very doish Jackson Hall speech from Jerome Powell we are heading up not down. Nvidia has 20x its revenue from data center in the past four years it has gone from being 25% dependent on data centers to about 90% of its Revenue coming from data centers nvidia's entire existence DNA has changed because of this Revolution and you have to understand that this is just a start. listen to Eric Schmidt the former CEO of Google who just gave a talk saying hey every single hyperscaler is going to spend about 300 billion dollar on Nvidia products for the next few years. why did I discuss Cuda and Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to go to Nvidia you know what to do in the stock market okay and if you take these numbers and translate them into simple multiples what you find is if Nvidia makes $250 billion a year for the next few years at 20 price to sales we're talking about a $5 trillion company versus a current valuation of $3 trillion so if you think Nvidia is not going to double itself over the next few years you're absolutely delusional This is accelerating and I think the street like you said every quarter prove it prove it this revolution is just starting but it all starts with Nvidia it my opinion it is the most important earnings not just of the Year potentially in many years because of what this represents in terms of tax if you look what Nvidia is doing especially from chips coming forward this Enterprise demand is just starting in my opinion of course pal Jackson Hole is so important obv but the but the market what it's going to do for the rest of the year and I could argue even in 2025 it starts with this Nvidia earnings and I expect get the popcorn ready it's going to you said this every quarter D no but this this is going to be a showstopper showing where the Revolution going and I think the Skeptics continue to get proven wrong. but Nvidia is just one link on this massive chain think about all this money that's going into the generative AI business hundreds of billions of dollars. now Wednesday the Nvidia earnings is going to be kind of the guide to where we're going short term how far away is this dip the next correction is going to happen because it is going to happen and it's quite simple if Nvidia by any chance lays an egg well we bring that correction closer the time frame from now until that big dip gets shorter because Nvidia basically drags the entire Market with it but if Nidia has great earnings then we push it forward into the future because it's going to take time for the market to relax from the Euphoria of great Nvidia earnings Nvidia is currently the most important company in the stock market and whatever it does in the Wednesday earnings is going to determine how long we have before that correction.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,yZ1vJZZb-08,2024-08-22T19:13:52Z,Aswath Damodaran Drops PRICELESS INSIGHTS About NVIDIA Stock,NVIDIA,in about 3 minutes the best in the business aswa the moan came on CNBC and answered everything you need to know about Nvidia before earnings I've been bombarded with DMS from every single person I can think of asking me what to do with Nvidia Nvidia before earnings should we buy more Tom should we sell Tom should we just hold on should we move to Thailand and never think about Nvidia again everybody's bombarding me with Nvidia questions and ask what the modon answered every single thing you want to know about this company in 3 minutes The way to think about Invidia is are you a Trader in which case you buy a low price and sell at a high price and Nidia might be the game you want to play are you an investor where you're buying based on earnings and cash flows Invidia is an amazing company great growth amazing cash flows superb margins but you're paying a premium price even given all of those pluses so I think you got to be honest with yourself about the game you came to play if you're an investor hold on to this thing for dear life it's going to be noisy it's going to be volatile it's not the sort of stock you want to be in and out it's a dominant Powerhouse of a stock that's going to be relevant in 10 years and it's only getting better maybe there are cheaper opportunities like Amazon out there but Nvidia is definitely a stock you want to be in for the next 10 years and even if it's trading at a premium it's not the worst thing in the world shorting Nvidia is a bad idea so if you're thinking about going into these earnings shorting Nvidia don't because the history shows you that's a very bad game to play in fact it's a very stupid game to play and if you play stupid games you are most likely to win stupid prizes so whatever happens with the stock shorting it into earnings is probably not the brightest idea for long-term investors it's just an amazing company with class A fundamentals and it's trading at a premium like every other company in the same position there's nothing wrong with it now look every time I post a video about Nvidia the same people in my comments claim it's an overvalued bubble now let me show you how this usually plays out my first video onvia was in December 23rd of 2021 the share price was $29 and because it went up from $13 to $29 within a year at that point a lot of people in the comments were saying well look Tom this stock is overvalued it jumped from 13 to 29 and since December 23rd 2021 the stock has done 350% good enough for me two years later on the spot December of 2023 I posted another video saying look guys Nvidia is the biggest opportunity buy now or regret forever this was December 2023 the share price was $49 and the same people the same cynic that missed out the first time were in my comment section saying look Tom the share price jump from $15 a year ago to $49 now this is an overvalued bubble 200% in a year 23% the Year that's an overvalue bubble stay away from the stock NOW needless to say that since that point to now the stock has done another 165% so let's just come to the conclusion that Nidia is not a bubble and this principle applies to every single investment out there every single stock I think Amazon is a better deal than Nvidia as an investor if you wanted to go with the meate tech I think you Amazon is a better buy than nedia it might not play out that way as a trade but I think given the earnings and the cash flows if I had to buy a stock now and you force me to buy a big Tech I would rather own Amazon or buy Amazon then buy Nvidia right now don't get obsessed about Nvidia Nvidia is not the only stock in the game there's a lot of great stocks he gives you one great example Amazon Amazon is a great business it's trading not as big of a premium as Nvidia we'll talk about that in a second we'll show you comparison between Amazon and Nvidia now I want to play a clip by Eric Jackson from emj Capital talking about Nvidia and making a lot of sense check it out it's uh it's the most important stock in the world right now so U you know if if they laid an egg uh it would be a major problem for the whole Market I don't think they will I think uh they're going to surprise the upside if you look ahead at at sort of what Wall Street is is counting on on a go forward basis it's almost like this explosion of of AI Revenue that they've seen over the last year and a half um you know is going to just sort of dry up and I just don't think that's the case they both believe that each of the hyperscalers uh plus the open AIs of the world we're probably going to have to spend something like $300 billion in Nvidia chips over the next few years each 300 billion each so you know Nvidia could basically only Supply those hyperscalers uh and their order book is going to be full for the next four years like it's a massive staggering amount of money that's sitting in front of them the vast vast majority like more than 95% of that revenue is going to go to Nvidia this is the most important company in the world right now everybody understands this everybody accept this and if you not if you're not admitting to the fact that Nvidia right now in 2024 is the most important company in the world well you're kind of coping number two he's saying look it's not probable that this company at this juncture is going to slow down we're talking about years and years of capex Investments by the big companies buying up inidia chips now he also brings up the famous Eric Schmidt talk that everybody talks about in which the former Google CEO basically said look guys we're looking at about $300 billion dollar of spend by every hyperscaler in the next few years into Nvidia chips this is massive that alone is invidious business for the next four years at the same level they are right now so they're not very likely to slow down for the next four years now we actually ran a few fundamental tests on Nvidia which I want to show you in this video because it's going to put a lot of things that as said earlier a lot of thing that Eric said earlier to the test now one is a DCF we ran a DCF right out of the gate a DCF doesn't give you a price target for the next 5 years it tells you what the company is worth today we ran a DCF based on a 10% discount 4% long-term growth and we had a 50% EB growth per year now before you go crazy 50% is actually lot lower than the current EB growth rate that the company is presenting which is about 700% so we took a much lower eida growth rate and we got $172 per share which is a 34% upside So based on rdcf the share price is currently 34% undervalued today now we also ran the MVP scorecard and this company scored 90 the only test in which it failed was the p the price to earnings ratio it was above 30 now the forward PE is actually 38 so they're damn near close to 100 score which we've never seen on this software yet now Nvidia might be the first company to do that in a year or two now we also compared Nvidia to Amazon and Microsoft just to show you the huge differences and why Nvidia is probably one of the most attractive companies in the market right now even at this Price look the revenue growth for NVIDIA is currently at 200% per year Amazon is at 12% Microsoft is at 16% now they do make more per year 245 for Microsoft 600 billion for Amazon and Nvidia makes only $80 billion but their growth rate is literally 10 20 times more than Amazon and Microsoft R&D expenses are a fraction of the other companies 9.55 billion versus 90 billion for Amazon operating income so check this out with much less Revenue Nvidia is generating $48 billion of operating income that's very close to Microsoft with the 9 and even closer to Amazon with 54 look it's a fraction 60 billion for Amazon 44 billion for Microsoft and the funny thing about it is that all those expenses are actually going from Amazon and Microsoft to Nvidia to buy these chips and if you look at the debt structure again $1 billion of debt versus $150 billion of debt for Amazon and 100 billion debt of Microsoft and look at the operating income margin 60% for NVIDIA insane if you compare it to the 9% of Amazon and the 45% of Microsoft they have the best margin of any big tech company you can think of with a forward PE of 38 compared to the 31 of Amazon and 31 of Microsoft so they're not really trading at such a great premium despite knocking it out of the park in every single category you can think of compared to Behemoth companies Great companies like Amazon and Microsoft so to me it seems that Amazon is a great company Microsoft is a great company definitely L good additions to any portfolio but Nvidia is in a league of its own and it's absolutely spectacular to see it play out and the people who think it's a bubble are absolute idiots it doesn't mean that Nvidia isn't going to be volatile for the next couple of weeks couple of months short-term volatility for NVIDIA is almost guaranteed and as a long-term investor all you have to do is be ready when it happens DCA that's it it's a great business and great businesses always traded a premium the CAPIC cycle in which Nvidia is currently leading this entire world is about four to five years away from being exhausted which means that for the next four to five years invia is pretty much a monopoly they can set their own prices and to say that this is kind of a Cisco example it's just kind of a misunderstanding of things Cisco was a telecom business Telecom CAPIC Cycles can last decades this is a whole different inial L folks every 3 to four years people going to need new servers new Chips you've seen how the black well the h20s and h100s every 3 to four years people will need new stuff for NVIDIA and with great management like they have right now with a great track record it's very hard for me to bet against them,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,igL2yVisXNs,2024-08-21T14:28:53Z,This Is The Best Investing Opportunity in 2024 (Don't Miss It),Russell 2000 / IWM,for small caps to rise 40% means that the PE the median Russell 2000 stock goes from 10 times to 14 times so it's not asking the market to provide some magic and a huge revaluation it's actually just saying small cap stocks which have been left for dead largely because the fed's been tight for almost two years as they start to normalize policy and as mergers pick up you know it's merger activity has been accelerating this year and it it should really strengthen because it's a sign ofo confidence all of these flow through to benefit small cap stocks and it's not like smaller companies are growing slower I know people post all these stats about small caps losing money it's mainly because of the biotech components basically don't make money and that's the largest uh cohort of stocks in the Russell but the Russell 2000 median earnings growth is almost 700 basis points faster than the S&P and Topline growth growth is almost 400 basis point so you're getting better growth lower valuation and I think the catalyst is now when the market is convinced the FED is embarking on a rate cutting cycle... he says look guys the median PE right now on the iwm the small caps is 10 for us to go 40% up we need to go from 10 to 14 PE which is not that crazy... if you carve out biotech the earnings growth on this index is even faster and bigger than the S&P 500 at 10 PE versus the 30p we have on the S&P 500... they're not going to buy the companies that have already gone through exponential growth like Nvidia they're going to look for opportunities mispriced opportunities like the iwm which has been lagging the entire index also he's talking about the fact that we have the idea of a cut absolutely wrong people think oh 0 25.5 he says it doesn't matter all we need is for the fit to signal to the stock market we are beginning a cut cycle that's all and from that point on the narrative will change and the iwm will start running of course he does mention that a recession can be a huge risk for this because if the rate Cuts come in the recessionary environment they're not going to help statistically historically speaking If the Fed Cuts rates too late the market still tanks and that's definitely a risk and that is what's holding the iwm still down what Tomley is saying here is very simple we have a lagging asset class the small caps that's been completely left behind and ignored we have cheap valuations good earning growth we have rate cuts a decent economy and even though everybody will win when the money will become cheaper the upside is bigger with small caps than the mega caps that is his thesis now why do I think he's right fundamentally about that specific idea well look you have to understand the iwm because we keep comparing iwm to S&P 500 Microsoft and Apple are bigger than the entire iwm index it's a small index so an influx of money into a small index like this can absolutely send it to the stratosphere the other reason is that while we've seen the SCP 500 recover from the initial rate cut drop and run 40% the iwm has been literally left behind almost nothing almost flat and while we have 30 pric to earnings ratio on the S&P 500 the average not the median the average on the iwm is 17p it's more attractive going into this rate cut cycle which is more beneficial to small caps and if you look at history small caps give 26.6% for the first 12 months after the First Rate cut and if you don't believe Tom Lee just look at the data itself when the FED started hiking rates we were pretty much zero we went above 5% from February 2022 to August of 2023 right that whole time basically saw a massive drop in the iwm minus 20% in the same time frame the S&P F dropped 2% so clearly the iwm is more sensitive to interest rate and you can see it 20% versus 2% so it's more sensitive and it's been left behind creating a massive rubber band effect and now that we have the FED starting to cut rates that Gap will absolutely have to close unless of course we get a recession we'll talk about that in a second and the reasons for that are quite simple the small caps the iwm the Russell 2000 well it has a lot more debt twice as much as the SCP 500 and while thep is mostly in fixed rates which means that it doesn't matter what the market does we pay a fixed rate the iwm is at 90% floating rate which means they're not just more sensitive they're a lot more sensitive to interest rates at any other stock that is in the S&P 500 and that has to be reflected once rates come down now even if you look at the DCF valuations logic if you look at the rate Cuts if you look at the debt structure if you look at the lag this whole idea and all this money on the sideline basically trying to figure out where we can come in what you get is a very interesting setup while the entire Market is going to benefit from lower rates more money cheaper money the economy will do better and then the stock market will do better the iwm the small caps are in a much better position versus the rest of the market and while everything will have to go up the iwm are positioned in the best possible spot assuming of course we don't get a recession because that is the big question and that is the reason why the small caps are still still to this day behind people ask me well Tom if everybody knows this why is the iwm still so behind the S&P 500 why hasn't the market that is so good at pricing in future development started pricing that in well because a lot of people fear that a recession might happen and if a recession comes because of unemployment data the Sam rule all the stuff we heard if there's a legitimate recession fear here that's a massive risk that will prevent potentially the iwm from making this run and you have to acknowledge that you can't just say well Tomley promised me I'm going to do what Tomley says no there is a legitimate risk that he may be wrong there's no certainty that he is right you have to take that into account especially if you look at the rest of the market because a lot of people say well Tom why not just sell my portfolio sell the S sell Nvidia sell everything I own and just buy small caps for the next 6 to 12 months because there's no certainty he's right there's no certainty and you want to do this while the AI rally that's going to last for another three four years going to send the stock market the S&P the NASDAQ into the stratosphere you want to sell out out of that asset class you're crazy even Tomley is telling you don't sell Nvidia you're crazy to do that so the idea is very simple Buy and Hold long term no jumping in no jumping out don't sell out of your portfolio just to buy I right now and then come crying tomorrow because you got screwed by the market,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,fTm-5d4CgmE,2024-08-20T15:33:12Z,The Stock Market Crash Of 2024 | What You Must Know,Nvidia,a month ago when Nvidia was trading at $130 and then all of a sudden it dropped to 98 a lot of people were panicking running for the hills but smart experienced investors like the ones we have in my community basically knew exactly what was going on and we knew how this thing is going to play out there was a limited time to get this stock at a cheaper price and lo and behold the stock is now back at $130 a month later so if you like Nvidia as a stock and you didn't buy at 98 you didn't decrease your cost basis in the stock and you set out because you fear that it might drop further well that's a good lesson for you yes Nvidia corrected yes paler corrected back but there's still a lot of opportunities,1.0,0.7
Tom Nash,fTm-5d4CgmE,2024-08-20T15:33:12Z,The Stock Market Crash Of 2024 | What You Must Know,S&P 500,"you see the S&P 500 is currently at 5600 very very close to the all-time highs by the time this video comes out maybe we pass it maybe we go lower but we're flirting with alltime highs again and we're up 4.3% of the past five days we're up almost 20% year to date so the IND index is doing very well the problem with an index that's doing very very well is that we have a lot of stocks right now in the stock market that are beginning to be a little bit overextended too quickly if a correction happens and actually takes prices of stocks that I want to own in my case Tesla or paler or the S&P 500 and it drops these prices below a certain threshold then I will be buying more of them on an ongoing basis and I'm not going to stop until the price climbs back up year to date the S&P 500 is up almost 20% NASDAQ is almost up 20% these are terrific numbers but way above the normal performance of either of these indices in the normal year right let's continue the S&P 500 is slow getting into overbought territory what do I mean by that well about 50% of the stocks in the index in the s&p500 is currently overbought on top of it we have moved a long ways away from the 200 day moving average right now the 200 day is at 5,000 we're currently at 5600 so we're getting ahead of the average and when this happens faster than normal and more aggressive than normal well the average serves like a magnet it's going to pull the market back down so it continues to rise slower whether this happens today tomorrow next week or doesn't happen at all I don't know I don't know but looking at the current setup of the market here's what I'm seeing we've started the month of August on the S&P 500 at 5446 that was the 1 of August currently after all the turmoil or the turbulence and all the volatility we're at 5608 at least as of the making of this video right so we are up 3% on the s&p500 in August so far in the first 20 days of the month now that's good right well yes and no and I'll explain why I'm saying no you see there's the statistic that shows what happened in the 23 times that the S&P 500 started the year with above 10% performance this year we're at 11.4% so we are in that category a really really good first half above 10% whenever that happens the average performance on the August month is .6% so if we're talking about averages right the average here shows us that August is supposed to be a negative .6% month on average and we're currently running at 3% a lot a lot higher than the average performance of August in a year like the Year we're having right now does it guarantee that we will have a correction no does it guarantee anything no past performance statistics they don't guarantee any individual results in any specific years there's always outliers but the general concept is that we are above know almost 4% above the average where we should be in August in a year like today and when you add it up to an overextended market and overbought S&P 500 especially if you look at S&P 500 earnings 81% of companies beat earnings with the average of 5% in this season with about 90% of companies that have already reported so the setup is not bad at all",1.0,0.2

Tom Nash,7WRBN4SY7fE,2024-08-14T15:13:49Z,"URGENT: Federal Reserve Cancels Recession, Massive Pivot Ahead",Federal Reserve,that's a lot closer to that 2% Mark the FED is trying to hit the FED basically has two livers they have to operate the liver that con basically controls the job market and the other liver is the prices so they have to have price stability and the job market also has to be okay so they have to kind of balance these two and this Balancing Act can be very very tough because sometimes price stability requires to raise interest which causes a lot of damage to jobs as we've seen over the past few months so the job numbers have been getting consistently worse and worse and worse over the last few months Rising all the way to 4.3% which is a lot worse than what the FED expected them to be by this point so with better than expected inflation numbers coming out this actually gives the FED a lot of leeway to start releasing the pressure and basically alleviating the pressure from the job market because inflation is getting better and better and better yet another time and because the job market is getting much worse a lot faster than the FED anticipated this data basically pushes the whole idea that the FED will have to cut rates in September if anybody had a doubt about a rate cut in September this doubt at this point should not exist because it is a 100% rate cut the big debate will be whether it's a 0 25 or 0.5 I don't don't think the FED structurally can cut 05 on the first cut cycle it's not within the DNA of jome Paul and his Compadres they're going to be very gentle with it and they're going to do 0 25 most likely but the bigger question here isn't 0 25 or 0.5 that's not that important although 0.5 is possible but the bigger question is which type of asset class is going to benefit the most out of this because at this point the markets have already priced in the September cut a long long time ago and that is why you're seeing the markets basically ignoring this and being completely nonchalant today as if nothing happened because this whole September thing has been priced in for a long time but the more important question is if you look at the next 6 to 12 months which stocks which type of stocks will do better than others when the FED is in active cutting mode so to speak because we spoke about it in previous videos the FED cutting cycle is probably going to take about a year so for the next year the FED is going to be cutting and cutting and cutting and in that time frame certain asset classes are going to be better than others and that asset class is the same asset class that has gotten consistently worse and worse and worse as interest rates have gotten higher and higher the more we've seen interest rates Spike and Spike and Spike over the past few years the same asset classes that got hammered will do better as the pressure gets released by the FED think about real estate real estate get absolutely annihilated by the FED interest interest rates right think about small caps the Russo 2000 the iwm index the small caps have absolutely been demolished we have gone 700 days since the Russell 2000 has seen a new High new highs on an index happened 10 12 13 times per year two years in which the iwm the Russell 2000 small caps index have not seen a new high it's been basically going as a kind of think about it like a the spring that's getting more and more tensed and you're about to release it and it's going to go out of control so the iwm is currently being in a really good position for this setup on top of it real estate any sort of re you can think about Real Estate Investment Trust these sort of asset classes will do much much better now the reason small caps are better positions for this than any other asset class in the market and I agree with Tom Lee about it is the fact that if you look at the the debt structure of these companies in the rest of 2000 what you're going to find is that they're mostly in floating rates which means that about half of their debt is subject to interest rate changes by the fed and as the FED actually increases rates they suffer but as the FED decreases they gain on the S&P 500 it's only 10% floating rate 90% fixed on top of it they're double The Leverage in the companies and this whole setup is going to basically serve as a big Catalyst for these small caps,1.0,0.2

Tom Nash,OfEDbK2QjVg,2024-08-12T13:02:47Z,Critical Warning For Investors (Get Ready),S&P 500,13 times in the entire history of the S&P 500 the week after this craziness hisor Ally is usually the worst week out of all the following year so to speak right and usually what happens in the week right after is seven out of 13 times we have red weeks six times we have green weeks but the median return on the s&p500 in the first week after such crazy minus four and then and positive ending to The s&amp; 500 is negative so the following week the week we're about to start today is usually a problematic week it's a crapshoot but the medium turn is actually negative and it's the only time you get a median that is negative if you look at the one month 3 six 12 months it's always going to be positive one month after this crazy week we've seen five of 13 are red and the rest is green the medi return is 4.15% on the S&amp;P 500 three months even better four out of 13 red the median return 5.4% and then the 12 month is absolutely insane only three red periods but here's the cricker the median return is 21.74% on the S&amp;P 400 in the 12 months following this occurrence so the good news are is very simple the good news if you are a long-term investor the 12 month period after last week is historically very very good 80% of the time you're going to get green and the median is almost 22% that's great and the good part is it gets better with every holding period that you stay in the market which is just another example of why time in the market is so important but the week after the one we're about to start today and the next few days this is the problem this is extremely volatile unpredictable and immediate return of minus point4 five% now for Traders that's great because Traders love volatility in craziness but for long-term investors I just want to make sure you understand the red you're going to see this week if it happens is just a precursor for a Very Good Year all always it starts red and volatile and then by the end of the year it actually gets better and better and better so don't be panicked if you're seeing red this week or even next week and I want you to pay attention to this the S&amp;P 500 started the year at 4740 it ended the first half of the year at 5277 that's 11.3% the 10 plus percent in the first half of the year on the s&p500 is not a usual thing as well that only happened 23 times and every time that happened we have this stats the average return on the second half of the year is plus 10% not bad now what's interesting is that August was the worst month of all the months remaining until the end of the year it's absolutely insane check it out so August on average after you've done 10 plus percent in the first half the year is negative .6% then you have September positive 1% October positive 2% and then November 2.2% December 2 .9% and what this means is historically after a great first half the year where we have 10% plus August is going to be the worst month then you have September flat and the party starts in October November December just like Tom Le said history doesn't lie now so far we are down 3% in August so we might actually be due for a little bit of a correction upwards but we'll see because averages you know they have outliers not every single August is going to 6% maybe this time we have negative 3% negative 4% but the point I'm making here is as a long-term investor I want you to understand that August is historically the worst month of the year after a strong first half and this playing out doesn't take away from the fact that October November December is going to be the strong month so as a long-term investor what you want to do if you actually believe this and if you convinced that this is more likely than not to happen is that youum acculate you accumulate in August you accumulate in September and then you accumulate slower and slower and slower as the market starts moving up in October November December so the time to DCA and to DCA into weakness to Double Down DCA is actually in August and a little bit in September not when the party has already started and everybody's stampeding back into the market we're looking down the barrel of a Fed rate cut during the last four cutting cycles and this is interesting the S&amp;P 500 did an annualize return during The Cutting cycle before the Fed was finished as the Fed was continuing to cut the average return on the S&amp;P the annualized under return was only 5% which is about half of the usual right so the markets don't do really well historically during The Cutting cycle themselves but here's the crazy part once the FED is finished once the FED stops the rate cuts and said okay we're done we're finished cutting the performance of the market is absolutely insane check this out one year after the FED stopped the rate cuts and finished the cutting cycle the average return on the S&amp;P 500 in the last four Cycles was 25.5% so what happens here it's very simple The Cutting of the rates puts money in the system money in the system takes time to stimulate the economy and get everybody excited again it doesn't happen overnight it happens takes few months six months 12 months 18 months but at some point all this money is inevitably gonna infused into the economy cause a massive eruption which happens as you see in the data about a year after the FED is done cutting so if you are expecting the FED cuts to magically start a rally that's not necessarily what's going to happen that might happen but had has more to do with the state of the economy basically the only way the Fed rate Cuts cause a massive explosion upwards is if the economy is great and a lot better than people think and in that case you already have a great economy which is boosted by more money cheaper money then this case you might get a rally but if the econom is in a bad shape we're probably going to have another year of mediocre kind of sideways performance or even worse before the Federate Cuts actually take effect and the market has that 26% you know 12- month period so all in all this is just to warn you to not get overly excited to slow down to DCA keep the steady course we've been doing for the past 18 months it has paid out so far it will continue to pay out I'll see you the next one be careful okay,1.0,0.7

Tom Nash,X6NLITmyR5A,2024-08-08T10:33:40Z,IT’S STARTING: THE FED IS ABOUT TO FLIP THE STOCK MARKET,FED,okay folks we have more and more calls for an emergency rate cut by the FED what started as Fringe now has become mainstream we have Jeremy seagull the professor from Wharton calling for a 75 emergency cut today Elon Musk saying the same thing and Claudia Sam the originator of the Sam rule which is now pointing to recession basically came out and said look guys the rule isn't showing a recession today but it's definitely a sign of concern and a rate cut an emergency rate cut is required right now so have a lot of smart people saying we need an emergency rate cut we don't want to wait until the standard course of business where we drop 0 25 in September. now if you go to the FED CME watch tool right now what you're going to find is that the 0 25 cut is now priced in at 100% And the 0 five emergency cut is now 70% according to the FED CME watch tool which to date has been extremely accurate in predicting what the FED is going to do so right now we're priced at about 70% % chance of that emergency cut happening so in that case if we're are 70% certain of an emergency cut we have to talk about what happens when the FED takes these emergency procedures because it's not as certain as you would think. well the history shows that in the eight times that the FED did an emergency cut for the past 25 years the day of the cut was four times positive and four times negative so literally we don't know what happens on the day of the cut four times the market went down four times the market went up so the behavior of the stock market on the day of the cut is completely not predictable. the third Cuts rate because the economy is bad and the rate cut doesn't do enough and the economy keeps fallowing the stock market follows suit the stock market is not disconnected from the economy no matter what your friends and Reddit told you so there's a lot of skew data here basically what happens is that if the rate cut comes when the economy is good the Wells Fargo study may not be as applicable that's what I'm saying so the big question is how good will the economy be in September when the rate cut comes how good will the GDP growth be how good the unemployment numbers or bad the unemployment numbers will be how good the CPI the inflation will be the consumer spending the consumer sentiment all of this is going to play a huge role in the impact of the rate Cuts as of now as of now GDP growth is almost 3% which is great CPI is at 3% which is not bad and we have unemployment at 4.3% which is above the FED expectations well above the FED expectations but still in the normal manageable region where we can actually live with that.,1.0,0.1
Tom Nash,X6NLITmyR5A,2024-08-08T10:33:40Z,IT’S STARTING: THE FED IS ABOUT TO FLIP THE STOCK MARKET,CME,now if you go to the FED CME watch tool right now what you're going to find is that the 0 25 cut is now priced in at 100% And the 0 five emergency cut is now 70% according to the FED CME watch tool which to date has been extremely accurate in predicting what the FED is going to do so right now we're priced at about 70% % chance of that emergency cut happening.,0.9,0.7
Tom Nash,X6NLITmyR5A,2024-08-08T10:33:40Z,IT’S STARTING: THE FED IS ABOUT TO FLIP THE STOCK MARKET,Wells Fargo,now there's a Wells Fargo study that looked at what happened over the course of 250 days following the first cut since 1974 and the results are not that encouraging based on this study from Wells Fargo since 1974 every time we had the First Rate cut the first 250 days in the market gave us minus 20% returns so that wasn't good for the market. because this Wills farg data shows you that we have a minus 20% average over the first 250 days of the rate cut that happens because mostly 90% of the time the thired cuts rate after the economy has already been broken the third Cuts rate because the economy is bad and the rate cut doesn't do enough and the economy keeps fallowing the stock market follows suit the stock market is not disconnected from the economy no matter what your friends and Reddit told you so there's a lot of skew data here basically what happens is that if the rate cut comes when the economy is good the Wells Fargo study may not be as applicable that's what I'm saying.,0.9,0.0

Tom Nash,MMcY5hiZmSA,2024-08-07T12:33:39Z,Tom Lee Just Said The UNTHINKABLE,Federal Reserve,the two years is signaling that the FED is behind um because two-year yields have fallen further. Tomy is bullish because he basically says look the FED is going to cut rates in September that's certain but what Tomy is saying in this clip is basically it's going to depend on the state of the economy. what Tommy is saying when he says pay attention to the macro he basically says that what's going to determine where we go from here isn't about the FED anymore because the FED will clearly reduce uh rates in September and by the way Tom says he should have reduced P that is in July and that was a mistake. the small caps are Uber sensitive to interest rates and once we understand that the FED is going to start cutting rates well what's going to happen is the small caps will benefit mostly from it a lot more than the max 7,1.0,-0.2
Tom Nash,MMcY5hiZmSA,2024-08-07T12:33:39Z,Tom Lee Just Said The UNTHINKABLE,Bank of Japan,what happened on Monday was mainly fueled because of what happened in Japan the bank of Japan decided to increase rates all of a sudden after being literally in 0% for a long time and a lot of traders that were carrying this out this car trade which is basically a getrich quake scheme where they were borrowing in Yen for 0% buying dollars and then buying equities these guys got caught in the middle and basically had to liquidate everything to try and stay afloat causing a massive selloff in the market,1.0,-0.5

Tom Nash,ttA5U5doZFA,2024-08-05T07:22:20Z,The Stock Market is Falling Again: What’s Really Happening?,Apple,we have Buffett selling his favorite alltime talk Apple slashing hat of his possession... you see Buffett sold apple and he sold Bank of America stock Apple was his biggest position by far with 40% of his entire portfolio which is absolutely mental... The mere sale here of Buffett of apple and Bank of America in itself isn't really an indication of anything... at the same time while Buffett was selling you know Apple actually increased its value by 30% so Apple had a massive quarter massive quarter while Buffett was selling so it's not like he timed this very perfectly and it's currently sitting at pretty much very close to alltime highs and the fact that Buffett missed this rali and he missed out on a lot of upside isn't really the point I'm trying to make here that happens sometimes that's part of the game the point I'm making is that the stock despite Buffett dropping 75 billion into the market really didn't move so you know what what gives right and the one thing I want you to think about it's a zero some game so if somebody dumped 775 billion dollar of Apple stock on the market within a single quarter and the stock didn't move in fact it had a 30% quarter it Rose by 30% while this was happening that means that somebody purchased the $75 billion worth of stock so that means the demand was high and if you think that stupid retail investors and I say stupid I mean stupid stupid retail investors bought 75 billion dollar worth of Apple stock while he was selling well that's just not the case because 80 cents on the dollar is not retail money in the market 80% of every single transaction in the market is institutional investors is professionals it's institutions it's the big boys it's the pros so while Buffett was selling and selling heavy the pros the institutions they were buying heavy on top of it Apple was buying back a lot of shares in that quarter as well so basically what happened is that Buffett sold 75 billion and a bunch of other institutions and apple itself bought the stock and that basically what happened so if this was a dump and this was oh they're super investors they know and there dump in on the the other super investors bought it Apple bought it so it's not really the case of Buffett dumping and getting out and the market basically saying yeah yeah yeah we got to get out and everybody's folling suit it's not the case... with the buffet cash horde and selling of Apple this means that everybody must sell that's the narrative you're going to be hearing in the media and perhaps that is true perhaps that is true perhaps we're heading to a massive crash a massive recession and that's the right time to sell I just don't know.,1.0,0.2
Tom Nash,ttA5U5doZFA,2024-08-05T07:22:20Z,The Stock Market is Falling Again: What’s Really Happening?,Bank of America,you see Buffett sold apple and he sold Bank of America stock Apple was his biggest position by far with 40% of his entire portfolio which is absolutely mental and Bank of America was his second biggest position with about 12% so him selling these two biggest Holdings it's it's it's massive it's significant I agree... the mere sale here of Buffett of apple and Bank of America in itself isn't really an indication of anything.,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,ttA5U5doZFA,2024-08-05T07:22:20Z,The Stock Market is Falling Again: What’s Really Happening?,Berkshire Hathaway,"we have Buffett selling his favorite alltime talk Apple slashing hat of his possession... The one thing I've been hearing over the past few days is oh Warren Buffett he knows what's coming he knows what's coming... if Warren Buffett now selling he at alltime highs with cash and the same rule got triggered and all this thing just crashing down upon us we must sell and liquidate our portfolios... you see Buffett sold apple and he sold Bank of America stock... him selling these two biggest Holdings it's it's it's massive it's significant I agree and now the one thing I want you to remember is number one Buffett is on record multiple times over the past couple couple decades saying that he doesn't like holding too much of a specific individual stock it's not a good idea having 40% of your portfolio in one stock isn't Buffett Style on top of it he also talked about the fact that this specific sale is mostly tax driven and whether he's lying or not I don't know... The mere sale here of Buffett of apple and Bank of America in itself isn't really an indication of anything... at the same time while Buffett was selling you know Apple actually increased its value by 30%... The stock despite Buffett dropping 75 billion into the market really didn't move... if somebody dumped 775 billion dollar of Apple stock on the market... stupid retail investors bought 75 billion dollar worth of Apple stock while he was selling well that's just not the case... so while Buffett was selling and selling heavy the pros the institutions they were buying heavy... basically what happened is that Buffett sold 75 billion and a bunch of other institutions and apple itself bought the stock and that basically what happened so if this was a dump and this was oh they're super investors they know and there dump in on the the other super investors bought it Apple bought it so it's not really the case of Buffett dumping and getting out... at the end of the day Buffett was up 700% on this investment 700% on a multi-billion dollar investment over over a long time it ballooned to half his portfolio at some point it's just doesn't fit the buffet approach having 50% of your entire portfolio in one stock with a 700% built-in gain it's just not good risk management the way Buffett likes to run his his shop and whether it's Buffett who's making the calls here or you know one of this lieutenants or whoever doesn't matter the buffet DNA is what I'm referring to right so right now A lot of people are concerned because they're seeing Buffett or berch hatu right sitting at $280 billion of cash that is a record and that spiked from 200 to$ 280 billion over single quarter and the 200 billion in itself was a record cash position so Buffett has been in record cash position for the past quarter and a half two quarters and right now he's sitting at 5% interest with about $280 billion that is absolutely insane and so if buff is selling and if Buffett is holding record cash right he knows better than most of us he's the super investor he's the go so if he's doing that we must sell because the market is about to crash and Buffett knows it right... if you combine Buffet selling and the unemployment data what you get is a lot of recession fears... with that and with the buffet cash horde and selling of Apple this means that everybody must sell that's the narrative you're going to be hearing in the media and perhaps that is true perhaps that is true perhaps we're heading to a massive crash a massive recession and that's the right time to sell I just don't know but here's what I do know right Buffett is one of the greats right let's break apart the buffet stuff and the samal stuff right Buffett is one of the greats no doubt right but Buffett does not have a crystal ball and he made bad calls before in 2022 he sold tsmc it's done 100% sense he dumped Airlines during the pandemic in 2020 100% cense uh same year sold out a Costco 200% cense 20 years ago he sold out of McDonald's McDonald's is up 1500% cents more than bir outway itself so he's made bad calls before and you also have to understand that the risk management of billionaires is like lot different than the risk management of your 10 50 $100,000 portfolio for them to sit at 5% interest with 0% risk in the time of a lot of uncertainty at $280 billion do it's not a bad deal at all why not right so the risk management of a multi-billionaire is a lot different than your portfolio the other thing I want to talk about here now that we have eliminated Buffett as an indicator of how you should be managing your portfolio Buffett does his thing you do thing it doesn't mean anything people who blindly follow Buffett are not investors right so Buffett aside let's talk about the Sam rule... Buffett has made a lot of mistakes and even if you look at the macro data there's a lot of good stuff there's a lot of bad stuff.",1.0,-0.1

Tom Nash,b0FYb-YMwG0,2024-08-04T12:57:18Z,URGENT: Major Warning for Stocks,Warren Buffett,Warren Buffett decides to sell 50% of his largest holding apple and that basically puts Warren Buffett in a major cash position like we haven't seen in a long time and that's also another massive indicator that trouble is ahead... on top of it we have apple selling off but the weird thing is that Buffett s 50% of his Apple position really did nothing if you look at the stock over the past 5 days it's up by 1% so what gives... Well you know Buffett has this Buffett effect when he sells people sell just the way it is you know that's why Buffett gets to sell quietly and just reported retroactively after 90 days which is what happened here so he sold over the past quarter quietly and now you're going to see the selling pressure following his sale probably on Monday because people like to copy buff it and it's you know it is what it is I for one don't do it but hey a lot of people do and that's why people will sell on Monday... The funny thing about this whole thing is that if Buffett would have you know stayed if he would have kept his position he would have made another 30 billion in this quarter because Apple actually went up quite significantly so there's that but whatever you say however you spend this Buffett going cash heavy liquidating his biggest position is not a good indicator for the market you can't argue it is just facts you have to accept it,1.0,-0.7

Tom Nash,b0FYb-YMwG0,2024-08-04T12:57:18Z,URGENT: Major Warning for Stocks,The Federal Reserve (FED),rates are very high right now at 5.25% and the FED has decided to keep them until at least September sorry that's not good... you see the FED has kept rates very very high for a very long time that's a fact also the FED will cut rates in 2024 that's also by this point a fact no matter what people are telling you that is a fact... usually when the FED Cuts rates for the first time after a prolonged period of elevated interest rates the market does way way better when there is no recession so basically the answer is when the FED Cuts rates does it take the market up or down the answer depends on how good the economy is if there is no recession the FED first cut leads to a 40% spike in the S&P 500 of the P of the sorry of the following 12 months so if there's no recession in the FED Cuts 40% S&P 500 for 12 months great but if there is a recession when the FED Cuts rates then the market does 5% is historically over the next 12 months but over the next 24 months it basically breaks even... even if the market crashes because of the FED Cuts because the market the economy isn't good in two years you're going to bounce back and be whereever you started this journey,1.0,-0.1

S&P 500 is flat. the S&P 500 has a lot of warning signs flaring up right now that you need to be aware of even as a bull. the S&P 500 dropped like crazy the S&P 500 lost 55% on the 2008 crash in the dotcom bubble the dotcom bubble crashed another 50% on the SP 500 even 2022 which was a bad year that's you know that giv you a 20% loss just on the 500 not talking about individual stocks. that guy that doubles down into weakness would have made in 20 years 230% off the S&P 500 in wars in crashes three major crashes 20 years 230%.,1.0,0.3

Tom Le says that he thinks that small caps the iwm is going to run up 40% by the end of the year. the only thing that can stop the rotation from the NASDAQ into the iwm is if we have a recession. if we have a recession the smoke CS are going to be absolutely horrendous if that happens. the whole iwm trade or investment whatever you want to call it is basically betting what happens with macro because the rate cuts are coming and if there's no recession it's going to send iwm to the moon and if there is a recession then it's not going to help and these stocks are going to be absolutely in the toilet.,1.0,0.4

Now we all understand that the Fed rate cut is guaranteed in September 100% Market down. Next fed meeting is in September. The reason is because like myself the FED is on vacation so we're not going to have a rate cut before September that will be a certain rate cut September is a cut. Look at the FED CME watch tool they pressing in 100% chance of a cut in September. It's a process, the FED has confirmed this once they start cutting cting it's going to start going down and down in a continuous manner. Statistics show that ever since we started measuring this the FED cutting rates for the first time has led to 27% return on these small caps for the 12 months following so the year after the first trate cut gives us 27% on average on the small caps.",1.0,0.1

Now as far as the iwm goes that is the rest of 2000 a lot of people have been asking me about it simply put these are 2,000 stocks that are good stock sorry good stocks Grandpa and I went hard yesterday these are good stocks it just they're not in the in the S&P 500 and these stocks are essentially something that's been lagging the entire market for the past 18 months for one reason and it if you look at these companies they have way more debt than the big cap stocks so if you compare the S&P 500 the debt to EB ratio is about 1 and a half for these small caps on the Russell 2000 they have three times more debt than ibida so double the debt than the S&P 500 companies and if you look at the debt structure as well it's the same problem while you know on the S&P 500 just you know about 10% of the debt is floating rate which means the rate that's in the market so it changes so they're not that impacted by interest rate increase because 90% of their debt is fixed on the other hand on the Russell 2000 50% of the interest is floating rate which means they're super sensitive to interest cuts and raises of course and now they will benefit the most uh not to mention the fact that I've said that as far as valuations go in small caps a lot of the potential is in the future so when you discount from the future to today in DCF cash flow discount that discount rate going down because of lower interest rate is going to rise as far as the valuations of these companies so just the lowering of the interest rate alone is worth more as far as the valuation of these companies from an inic value perspective so everything points out to the fact that the Russell 2000 is going to do well in this environment and it hasn't really started yet if you look at the Russell 2000 right now it's not above the 2021 levels we've seen so it hasn't done nothing since 2021 in fact it is still slightly down and that's why Tomley is saying that we have about 40% to go on this index on the iwm until the end of the year and statistics is on his side you know um statistics show that ever since we started measuring this the FED cutting rates for the first time has led to 27% return on these small caps for the 12 months following so the year after the first trate cut gives us 27% on average on the small caps that's pretty much where Tom Le is at and I tend to agree I think small caps will do really really well.",1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,CwkrwoYWmZI,2024-07-30T15:15:48Z,The Stock Market Crash of 2024 Is Starting,S&P 500,folks we have an alarming indicator right now on the S&P 500 a key indicator is flashing red right now and we have to talk about it because this is not good now this doesn't mean that the market is headed for crash or for major pullback it's not necessarily that but I'm not going to be sitting here and hiding information that I think is important to you because I am bullish on this Market it's important to understand low probability High consequence events and take that into consideration not just ignore that because it goes against your thesis now on this channel we have done I think phenomenally for the past 18 months over the past 18 months we've covered nine stocks on this channel we've called early smci Nvidia AET a bunch of other stocks nine stocks nine out of nine everything is green 130% in 18 months my own portfolio with Tesla paler in the S&P 500 has done 160% that time frame so the last 18 months were very good to us as a community and we thank the market for that however however there's data that shows that right now us being at 27 a half price to earnings on the S&P 500 is a dangerous territory this is the highest p ratio we have had on this index in the past 20 years if you're looking at a p on the S&P 500 and you measure the returns for the following three years the interesting point about this that if you're below 10 below 15 you are almost guaranteed to make money in the next 3 years but if you start investing in the S&P 500 when the PE is between 27 and 30 which is where we are right now you have a 95% chance of not making money for 3 years on that investment on top of it you have to understand that if you look at the S&P 500 the run that it had it comes with the price right now we have gotten to the position where we have the S&P 500 trading a double the p ratio than the small caps of the Russell 2000 while the Russell 2000 which is the small caps is trading at about 14p the S&P 500 is literally double in the past 18 months the S&P 500 is up 40% the NASDAQ is at what 70% we have been going up nonstop without a single proper correction we had a couple of minor Corrections many corrections but we haven't seen a 5% proper pullback ever since the end of 2022 so a year and a half without a single correction and that goes against everything we know about the S&P 500 statistics and history show us that the S&P 500 pulls back 5% three times per year we are now 18 months a year and a half without a single 5% pullback on top of it a 10% pullback happens once per year again we're now a year and a half into this no 10% pullback and every 3 years we have a 15% correction again that obviously hasn't happened yet option number one in my opinion is that the S&P 500 has just gone too hot too quick and certain other asset classes such as the small cap stocks have been lagging behind and now that rotation is basically going to be very painful for anybody who's deep into tick but eventually that isn't a market breaking rotation that's a healthy bull market cycle look the S&P 500 spent the last month in limbo pretty much being flat on top of it unlike the inflated p ratio on the S&P 500 which is nearing 30 you see the iwm is trading at 14 it's half of the P of the S&P 500 and also a 10year low and that is very unusual because the normal situation is a 98% compatibility between the P ratios on both these indices so basically they should be identical and right now that compatibility is 50% it's half and that's weird if the average eBid to net debt ratio on the S&P 500 is 1.6 1.6 the net debt to iida on the Russell 2000 is three it's double than the S&P 500 so it is two times more leveraged than the S&P 500 especially if you look at the floating rates which are about 10% on the S&P 500 mostly the s&p500 is 90% fixed rates so completely agnostic to Fed policies you see the S&P 500 is now comprised of companies that pretty much make their money anywhere there's 65% us and basically 35% rest of the world when you have a 10% 6 months on the S&P 500 that's not very usual that's kind of abnormal whenever that happens the next 6 months 80% of the time are positive now here's my two cents about it so the S&P 500 at 2728 PE is is quite expensive and if you're buying stocks today it's kind of hard to make money with a 28p S&P 500 at least in the short term there's always a possibility that we are in front of a market crash event or at least a major correction especially with all these flashing indicators flashing red on the S&P 500 you can't just ignore it because you're bullish on this Market you have to take precautionary measures such as selling a third of your biggest winners if you are up buy a lot on certain positions because you've been investing for the past two years you've made a lot of money take a third off the top and put it on the sideline why because if the market drops and corrects then you save a third of your cash from this Mayhem but if the market keeps flying up you're still 70% invested and get to enjoy the most of it and obviously the other thing you should do is just keep dollar cost averaging if you just dollar cost average slowly into great companies into the IND index it's going to fix itself whether we are going into a pool Market which is great or we head it into the toilet a DCA approach over the next 5 years is going to be profitable and it's going to make you a lot of money just buying every month slowly is going to work in the recession in the market crash or in the crazy bull run all of these events are fixed and not requiring timing if you just slowly dollar cost average,1.0,-0.4

Tom Nash,CwkrwoYWmZI,2024-07-30T15:15:48Z,The Stock Market Crash of 2024 Is Starting,Russell 2000,right now we have gotten to the position where we have the S&P 500 trading a double the p ratio than the small caps of the Russell 2000 while the Russell 2000 which is the small caps is trading at about 14p the iwm index the Russell 2000 the small caps it has done 10% in a month the reason that this is happening right now is very simple you see when the FED started raising rates back in November of 2021 from that point on until the end of the rate hiking cycle which was December of 2022 the iwm the small caps lost 27% of that value it is still down after a recent correction which we just mentioned but it is still down today 10% below the initial value it had in November of 2021 so the iwm has never recovered from this interest rate cycle even after that latest 10% Spike so it's still heavily down in what 3 years on top of it unlike the inflated p ratio on the S&P 500 which is nearing 30 you see the iwm is trading at 14 it's half of the P of the S&P 500 and also a 10year low and that is very unusual because the normal situation is a 98% compatibility between the P ratios on both these indices so basically they should be identical and right now that compatibility is 50% it's half and that's weird on top of it you have to understand that the iwm the Russell 2000 it's plagued with a lot of companies that have a lot of debt they're really leveraged how much they leverage well if the average eBid to net debt ratio on the S&P 500 is 1.6 1.6 the net debt to iida on the Russell 2000 is three it's double than the S&P 500 so it is two times more leveraged than the S&P 500 but because floating rates are cheaper at least when you take the loan the floating rate dominates dominates the iwm 50% of the iwm loans are at a floating rate versus a 10% on the S&P 500 so basically that creates The Perfect Storm companies that will benefit from interest reduction much more than anything else in this market especially when the iwm is very different than the sb500 and the revenue Source the IW and the small caps 90% of their revenue comes from the US if we're talking about a Fed rate cut the impact on the US market is going to be much more significant than the global impact on top of it we have statistics that show us that the First Rate cut of the FED leads to a 12month bullish cycle on small caps of about 26.6% again none of these things are certain but if we get a rate cut then these sort of companies the small caps the iwm the Russell 2000 is in the great setup versus the rest of the market and it is currently trading at half the price and in my view this is an Arbitrage opportunity look people right now at least Visa the small caps are pricing in recession at a high degree and no rate cuts at a high degree on the other hand the iwm stocks the Russell 2000 small caps are basically trading at half the price while being set up for The Perfect Storm which is a reductions in rate in a good economy which should send all these companies into the stratosphere and the stock market will act accordingly,1.0,0.7

A 3.2% drop in the S&P 500 is not even the definition of a correction; a correction is a 10% correction that happens every other year. The S&P 500 at its peak was at 500 67, and now we're 4500, which is a 4% drop. The S&P 500 over the past 96 years until the end of 2023 shows that 96% of the time, those 10-year periods, you will have a profitable year. A decade inside the S&P 500 for the past 100 years is positive. The average S&P 500 return for the past 20 years is 9.5%, which is normal. The S&P 500 dropped 2% on a single day, which hasn't happened since February of 2023. My portfolio is extremely simple: Palantir 40%, S&P 500 40%, Tesla 20%.

It's already a global leader, almost a quasi-monopolistic leader in its industry.

$3,000 I'm going to count all of it just to show you that I ain't bullshitting $3,000 200 to 3,000 in 5 years now Tesla has always been good at punishing the short-term Traders and really benefiting the long-term investors who have been nothing but patient with this company now money aside look let's talk about what happened yesterday so the earnings came out the beat on Revenue was great the Miss on earnings per share wasn't great the entire mainstream media went TS up and basically started throwing fear uncertainty and doubt at retail investors the same old thing the same old conversation most most of us have been through that a million times before if you started investing in the past 12 months 6 months you haven't seen it yet but it's the same old story then you have all the Cockroaches coming out of the holes starting to talk about how bad Tesla is how this is just a car company how El is bad basically the same old stick they do all the time now in this video what I'm going to do is a few things number one I'm going to dispill the myth versus the reality think of me as the Myth Busters of of Tesla stock we're going to do this right now so yes Tesla missed an earnings per share but let's look at the stuff that actually matter so let's talk about the fundamentals and I couldn't have said it better than Elon Musk on the call where he said look guys if you don't believe in the long-term vision of Tesla sell the stock what's the problem sell the stock why are you crying and moaning about it on X which is his platform by the way sell the stock sell the stock those who sold I'll show you in the second had really really good results I'm going to show you right now so Tesla if you actually bought it in January of 2021 at $300 per share and then you sold it in May of 2021 know just four months later because the stock dropped from 300 to 190 oh my God the stock is finished blah blah blah all that Spiel boom November of 2021 just 6 months later the stock goes from $190 to $400 per share so then you buy it again and then the stock drops in March just four months later to $265 oh my God the media starts all over again you sell at$ 265 and then in April of 2022 just a month later it goes from 265 to 361 in June of 2022 just two months later it's down from 361 to 26 oh my God you sell again September of 2022 stock goes to 275 it rises again Euphoria everybody buys by January of 2023 just 3 months later it's down to 13 $ 13 from $275 oh my God it's over this is finished Ros Gerber July of 2023 stock is up from $13 to $274 from $13 to $274 in six months oh my God we got to buy we got to buy April 2024 the stock is down to $150 per share what happens everybody sells yesterday the stock is at $250 up from 150 and then today it's down 225 might drop even further in fact most likely it's going to keep dropping who knows I mean it's Tesla stock but basically what has happened is the Tesla stock has completely punished the people who were impatient with the stock if you've been long on this company for a very very long time and you didn't budge you've made money but if you follow this trend in which the media screams bye bye bye at the top and sell sell sell at the bottom all you've done is made money for the sharks for the people who manipulate you through mainstream media now let's talk about the fundamentals look Automotive Revenue up again quarter over quarter from 17.4 to 19.9 billion so they've just increased by 2.5 billion the automotive Revenue in a single quarter I wouldn't say that's bad energy revenues are now $3 billion it is insane up 100% year-over-year it's no longer some insignificant Iota this is a big big big industry right now and Tesla is becoming an industry leader in that services up 21% $2.6 billion and that's before FSD licensing which is going to be a GameChanger of Epic Proportions 80% gross margin industry standard absolutely monopolizing this industry that's before that it's still up 21% operating income everybody talks about margins oh my God Tesla's margin so let's look at the bottom line what kind of impact that the reduction in the margins had operating income is up net income well that must be bad margins have gone down right net income is up 30% from the previous quarter net cash from operations that's the one with counts up 18% year-over year and by the way in the previous quarter that was 240 million this quarter it went up to 3.6 billion an increase of oh $3.3 billion quarter of quarter in net cash from operations that's really really bad cash up 33% year-over-year $3.7 billion a record-breaking Tesla quarter I mean Tesla has never had so much money literally cash position is strongest it's ever B so now you're going to tell me oh my God yes the margins look at the margins St the operating margin is 6.3 it's down from 9.6 last year look by the way that operating margin is still up from the previous quarter from 5.5 to 6.3 so it's actually getting better but yes it's not as good as last year but let me tell you something when you drop prices on vehicles you make less on every vehicle for sure margins go down Professor but guess what you sell more Vehicles you make more money you get more Revenue you get more money in your pocket so the declining revenues serve a bigger purpose which is more revenue and more income which is literally what happened you just saw the fundamentals Tesla sold more cars they've made more money and they've made less a little bit less per each vehicle oh my God this is the end of the world look it's the same conclusion we have every year this is a stock that's only relevant if you believe that this is not a car company if you think that Tesla is a vehicle producer only it's not worth what it's selling for right now I will agree with you if you think this is a car company it's too expensive I agree 100% but the problem is that Tesla isn't a car company a car company doesn't sell $3 billion dollar of energy up 100% year-over year as a tech company with leadership in FSD autonomous driving with robotics with the whole infrastructure in energy that they've basically been monopolizing for the past few years that is a whole different enchilada because each one of these components is worth more the entire market cap of Tesla today and that is why my price target for Tesla is $1,400 even though it can go a lot higher than that I think in the next few years what happens is that autonomous sales they go through the roof FSD becomes an industry standard Tesla basically holds the Monopoly and they sell it to all the other oems car companies will have to install cameras and computers and the new vehicles and they'll just license the FSD from Tesla it's the cheapest best solution Tesla becomes a software company that basically sells on 80 cents on the dollar gross margin auto sales by the way will continue to rise it's not going to go through the stratosphere but people will still keep buying Tesla vehicles because they're freaking good energy is going to keep growing at this massive Pace it's going to be a behemoth and we haven't said a word about robot taxi and Optimus which are absolute moonshots if any of these succeed if robot taxi or Optimus succeed it's going to be worth much much more than the current entire market cap of Tesla much much more if both succeed oh my goodness we're talking about a Quantum Leap so for everybody who's been asking me this question of the past few weeks when will Tesla drop to 200 again 220 I want to buy look guys when the stock price drops it doesn't happen in a happy go-lucky environment when everybody's just excited about the stock bad sentiment Drive stock prices down and this is the opportunity this is the opportunity to DCA now usually when the company does better and better and better every quarter but the stock price keeps going down or stays flat that is a trade-off I'm really excited about I would love to invest in any company that does better but the stock price stays flat and that's exactly what's happening with Tesla so ignore the noise ignore the do your own analysis make your own research and if you like Tesla you're now getting it at 10% less than what you had it yesterday and that's not a bad deal I'll see you the next one",1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,LhlZu65MoFU,2024-07-19T11:53:48Z,This Will Be The Best Investment You Will EVER Make,S&P 500,the best investment opportunity of my lifetime and your lifetime and pretty much anybody's lifetime is the broad Market ETF such as the S&amp;P 500 the US economy now I know what you think but hold on a second you probably want to stick around for this video because beyond that little bottom line which basically says that the S&amp;P 500 long-term cannot be beaten not by real estate not by professional money manager not by certain stocks and individual stock picking technical analysis trading all of this stuff nothing can beat the S&amp;P 500 in long term. Still as it stands right now 40% of my entire portfolio is invested in the S&amp;P 500 and if you use a few simple strategies with that specific ETF you can maximize your returns even further. If you started investing in 1999 you just jumped in the market a second before it crashed and all you did for the next 20 years is add $100 to the S&amp;P 500 $100 every single month 12 times per year 20 years no matter what you went through the 99.com crash you went through the 2008 subprime market crash you went through the 2020 little Co crash you came out on the other hand 20 years later with a 200% profit 200% why because you dollar cost average into an index simple as that what you got here is 10% per year for 20 years with the crashes with the collapses that's because your dollar cross average into an index fund a broad market index fund like the S&amp;P 500. If you DCA if you dollar cost average into the index into the S&amp;P 500 you never have a problem because you're never locked in at a price. Now look studies across the board show that the longer you stay in the S&amp;P 500 the more it becomes impossible to beat that index by professionals who get paid 20% carried interest 2% assets under the management they're getting paid ridiculous money to beat the index and guess what 85% of professional fund managers cannot beat the index fund on a 15-year basis cannot and if you go all the way to 20year basis it's more along the lines of 90% of professionals who cannot bid the index people who are getting paid to do so by their clients 90% of them over 20 years cannot beat the S&amp;P 500 cannot. The first ETF would be a classic S&amp;P 500. The S&amp;P 500 has become so Global since the three fund portfolio was launched in 1999 25 years a ago the S&amp;P 500 has changed a lot in the quarter of a century right now the top companies in the S&amp;P 500 are global companies Apple Google Microsoft they're extremely global companies Tesla has factors in China a lot of these companies are multinationals so buying the S&amp;P 500 is essentially like buying the US market and the entire Global Market it includes everything so that's why the S&amp;P 500 becomes both category 1 and Category 2 us and non- US stocks are now combined by the S&amp;P 500. The NASDAQ gives you extra ohm more than the S&amp;P 500 at the cost of crashing more when things are bad but when things are good it actually accelerates even more so it gives you that extra little oomph. Now when we say bonds QQQ NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 what is that mixture well that mixture depends on your age and your distance from retirement I'm going to tell you right now in a second just the basic structure but you can adjust your own if you are under 30 you want to have 45% in the s&amp; 45% in the NASDAQ and 10% in US bonds if you are 30 to 50 in that mid-range Zone where I'm at you want to have 60% in the S&amp;P 500 20% in the NASDAQ and 20% in US bonds if you are 50 and above 50 plus then you want to have 50% in the S&amp;P 500 25% in the NASDAQ and then 25% in US bonds. Whatever I choose the 40% S&amp;P 500 you might choose whatever but the idea here is very very simple you don't time the market you stay in the ETF that has the broad market and you buy every month and do nothing but adjusted once your age jumps a category that's it.,1.0,0.9

Now I invest in companies like Tesla and paler they're volatile and you know for me if paler loses 50% or even if p goes to zero if Tesla goes to zero for me that's another Tuesday because the entire money I have invested in the stock market in general is money I can afford to lose if I lose it it's going to suck but it's not money I can't afford to lose as simple as that. Like these stocks like paler and Tesla.,0.9,0.2

Now when we say bonds QQQ NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 what is that mixture well that mixture depends on your age and your distance from retirement I'm going to tell you right now in a second just the basic structure but you can adjust your own if you are under 30 you want to have 45% in the s&amp; 45% in the NASDAQ and 10% in US bonds if you are 30 to 50 in that mid-range Zone where I'm at you want to have 60% in the S&amp;P 500 20% in the NASDAQ and 20% in US bonds if you are 50 and above 50 plus then you want to have 50% in the S&amp;P 500 25% in the NASDAQ and then 25% in US bonds.,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,72v16AqHjIQ,2024-07-11T18:25:59Z,"URGENT: Market Plummets, Major Changes Ahead",Federal Reserve,that means that the Federal Reserve is getting better results from the market based on their interest rate policy right now which is quite high. that means that the FED Reserve given these results is now more likely to increase the pace of rate reductions and potentially move them up a little bit earlier than expected whether it's two or three rate Cuts we don't know yet but there will be rate Cuts in 2024 based on what just happened and based on what Jerome pal said yesterday. throughout history whenever the Federal Reserve actually cut rates because they had no choice because they were forced into it because the economy started to break that rate cut didn't lead to an explosion in the economy and the explosion in the stock market. when the FED is forced into rate Cuts that's not always a good thing but throughout history as well whenever the Federal Reserve actually cut rates when they wanted to when it was a prerogative not because the economy started breaking that actually led to an explosive reaction from the stock market and the economy. you see in this current situation does a lot of concern that this may be a little bit too late because if the labor market is cooling down a lot faster than we would like it to if consumer spending is coming down if Consumer Debt is coming up there's a genuine concern that these rate Cuts might be the former situation that I described which is where the FED has to cut rates and the economy doesn't have this explosive reactions so the fear here is that these rate Cuts will be the precursor to a recession which what happens when the FED actually has to force itself to cut rates because of bad economic terms that's not necessarily true but this risk will have to be priced in into the stock market because the stock market is a pricing mechanism of the next six months so this is now part of the scheme part of the whole setup part of the mathematic equation so that's also contributing to this cool down we're seeing in the markets according to the FED watch tool which I think everybody here should be following where you see the percentages the odds of the FED actually cutting rates and this has been one of the most accurate ways to predict what the FED will do right now the market is pricing in three rate Cuts in 2024 meaning September November December so all we had today is just a confirmation of that three Fed rate cut scenario and look I know I'm going here Against the Grain a little bit and I know mainst media makes living off of talking about what the FED will do next but at this point it becomes slightly irrelevant the whole ball game has changed here and I want to explain exactly what I mean now that we know based on what Jerome Powell said yesterday that they will cut rates now that we know that the inflation data is coming out cooler than expected we will likely have a rate cut in 2024 whether it's one two or three doesn't matter so the big question now turns back to macroeconomic data away from the FED now that we know rate cuts are coming the the question is how good GDP consumer spending and unemployment will be once the FED starts cutting rates if the economic data is good enough it's not breaking then that Fed rate cut is going to probably lead to a very positive reaction from the stock market however if the macroeconomic data weakens and it becomes less than optimal before the First Rate cut then that cut might not be enough to pull this out of the mud and then the stock market might actually start pulling back so what I will be doing for the next few months is following the macroeconomic data unemployment numbers GDP consumer spending these sort of things the whole Obsession about what Jon Paul said and didn't say sure we can talk about it but now that's no longer the focal point.,1.0,0.2
Tom Nash,YSjg9ppvsIs,2024-07-10T16:23:24Z,"Why Tesla Stock is going to hit $3,000 way sooner than most people think...",Tesla,"You're Going to Hear Keith Fitzgerald talk about Tesla in 60 seconds and get more things right in those 60 seconds than most in fact the vast majority of experts we've seen on mainstream media over the past year he said two things which you'll hear if you'll stay for the entire video which are Monumental to standing Tesla basically saying number one the business is still in the early Innings it's going to double and triple in the next few years talking of course obviously about the robotaxi FSD and energy as massive Tams untapped total addressable markets that have not been utilized yet by Tesla and also saying that looking at Tesla as a car company is a huge misunderstanding of what this business is again one of the core mistakes that was made by 95% of analysts who have missed the boat on Tesla. now I'm going to play this clip then I'm going to explain what this guy is talking about I'm going to give you my opinion and my understanding of where this company is headed where this stock is headed my price target for the end of this year and my price target for five years forward and then we're going to talk about why this might be the most undervalued AI stock right now in the market giving its price versus the potential stick around it's about to get interesting so first of all let's watch the clip check it out Keith I should mention as well you're still bullish on Tesla thinking this could be a $300 stock next year yes I am I think this stock is going to double or triple maybe even more in the next few years and again we're early Innings anybody who's thinking about this just in terms of cars is very smart but I would encourage them to broaden their Horizon significantly this is about power this is about robotics I think it perhaps is the best undervalued AI play on the planet right now and love him or hate him musk knows what he's doing now the interviewer asked Keith one simple question she said look Keith is the stock going to go to 300 next year that's about $50 upside 20% in about 12 months that's not an aggressive question he could have said yes but what he chose to answer is look you're missing the point it's not going to go up 20% in 12 months it probably is going to go double or triple in the next few years you're completely misunderstanding the potential of this company saying that looking at this as a Vehicle Manufacturer is a gross misunderstanding of what this business is now he's basically giving you a 100 to 200% upside in two to three years according to Keith fitgerald and I don't think he's far from the truth as you'll hear at the end of the video while I give you my price target for the end of the year and the the end of the decade now by saying that we are in the early Innings of this what he means is it's not about auto manufacturers it's not about Vehicles it's about trying to tap into some of the most undervalued AI stocks in the market everybody knows about Nvidia everybody understands chat GPT this is a misunderstood AI Play Even though everybody understands that Tesla is a great company that Tesla is a huge company has a lot of hype around it obviously but the vast majority of investors still fail to understand that Tesla is not just a great car company they're probably one of the best AI players in the market right now and they're not priced accordingly especially given the fact that they have the same level if not better CEO than Nvidia if I had to choose my top three CEOs in the market I would choose Jensen from Nvidia I would choose Elon Musk from Tesla and I would choose Alex car from paler so we have a top three CEO with one of the most undervalued AI business in the making and it is completely misunderstood and mispriced humanoid robotics is going to be the next wave of this Industrial Revolution we're living through right now we had the initial stage of chat GPT we then have the software side of things but we're headed into robotics robotics is just a huge business it's going to revolutionize the way we manufacture things the way we operate it's a huge huge market now most of it is obscure and misunderstood and we honestly just don't know how big this thing is going to be but one thing is for certain whoever figures out the code to building functioning cost efficient scalable humanoid robots that can be utilized in manufacturing and in day-to-day operations that's going to be a huge market and Tesla right now is one of the leaders in that and again the stock price just doesn't reflect that now understand that a lot of investors are terrified by this 45% increase in the share price over the past 30 days it's scary it's parabolic I understand But A wise man once told me when in doubt zoom out if you zoom out for the past 12 months the stock is still down 6% from one year ago we haven't done Jack deadle Squad except go back to where Tesla was about a year ago so nothing really happened here except a correction because a lot of the clouds over Tesla's head were lifted now the clouds I'm talking about is great delivery numbers everybody were talking about the fact that the delivery numbers are not going to be good because the gross story of Tesla is over there's a demand problem that became the narrative once the deliveries came out better than expected that narrative died on top of it we have August 8th coming up with the robo taxi day that's going to alleviate a lot of the clouds around that and the pay package for Elon was approved eliminating all this court hoopla now that's not even about the money it's about the fact that Elon said he wants 25% control of this company to develop further new Innovative AI projects in Tesla giving him that package allows him to have that 25% control essentially solidifying the fact that Elon is not going to develop new projects outside of Tesla that's a huge bonus all of this got priced in rightfully so right after the clouds were lifted the court case went away Elan stays in Tesla because of his 25% deliveries are great and everything is great and we're looking forward to the robot taxi day on August 8th now you know over the past few months we heard a lot of shots taking at Elon Musk and Tesla for lowering Auto prices saying well this is a proof that Tesla is losing demand now meanwhile what happened is that high interest rates finally caught up with the consumers and auto manufacturers have a lot of difficulty moving vehicles off the Lots off the dealerships not Tesla well all of a sudden that proved to be a great decision especially since Tesla could afford to cut prices with their best in the industry margins and Ford GM couldn't so for those who are looking at Elon Musk and saying well he's not that involved in Tesla anymore his decision making has gone sideways look at what he's done for the past few months all of these are top tier decisions now long-term holders of Tesla shouldn't be worried about what I'm about to tell you right now but I do have a slight warning for you now at this point I want to cool the Jets here a little bit and I want to talk about August 8th now we're all excited about this as long-term investors that's great and you'll see in my price Target that I have a huge expectations from this company for the next five years however for swing Traders and short-term Traders this might be a precarious situation August 8th is kind of by the rumors s the news event so be careful because if we G up 45% 30 days with the expectation of August 8th being this cataclysmic event if we don't get some sort of an insane thing going on on August 8th the stock might sell off so if you're a short-term Trader or swing Trader be careful of the earnings but more so be careful of August 8th that might be seld the news event so you know manage your stuff accordingly as a long-term investor I don't care I just buy and dollar cost average at all times it's not my game but if you are playing that short-term game be careful of that and the reason I don't play this game myself is because I understand one simple principle the fastest way to become poor is to try to get rich quickly by timing the market and I'm not going to do that now for disclosure I do have 20% of my entire portfolio in this company so I'm a huge bull but here's how I see it long term robotics energy and FSD will probably be worth a lot more than the current entire market cap of the company just robotics FSD and the energy business is probably another $3 trillion in market cap by the end of the decade so a lot bigger than the current valuation of Tesla as we stand so for me putting 20% of my portfolio in that company at 604 PE is not a huge problem now people forget that FSD full self driving autonomous driving it's a whole brand new market it's an unknown territory it's massive how big nobody really knows same thing with human robotics nobody really knows but it is potentially revolutionary now Nvidia had its moment and we've seen the revenue Skyrocket we've seen the fundamentals go and we've seen the share price go absolutely out of the stratosphere that hasn't happened yet with Tesla and pener despite being very obvious to me that they're next in line a lot of people wonder where the stock is going to be at the end of the year and I've said it multiple times I think the stock is headed to 400 a lot faster than people expect and a lot of you asked me to say when and how much exactly so in my opinion based on my DCF which I ran on stock MVP which the platform I've built I see that that parabolic Spike that happens in revenues once Tesla unlocks that new market with robotics and robotx and FSD if we go back at the end of the decade and reverse engineer the growth we're probably going to be at about 40 to 50% Revenue growth per year it's not going to happen in a linear fashion it's going to happen parabolically like it happened in video at some point during the next five years so if you apply a 40% Revenue growth for DCF at about 10% weighted average cost of capital for Tesla over the next 5 years the current price target of Tesla today should be about $490 to $500 today so in my opinion the current share price of Tesla is about 100% undervalued on top of it I've also said it before my fiveyear price target for this stock as covered in multiple videos is $1,400 and that's based on the fact that robot taxi FSD and energy are going to be way bigger than the current entire business of Tesla and you know what it's 64p I'll take it.",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,_SUu6t6XaTM,2024-07-04T17:03:12Z,Why Tesla Stock is going to hit $400 way sooner than most people think...,Tesla,"everybody's talking about Tesla stock again because it's up again because it had great delivery numbers and it makes headlines again. it's going to go from $250 to $400 per share a lot faster than most investors realize. If you have a great business like Tesla and the stock price is lagging behind the business eventually that Gap is going to close it always does and this is not going to be any different. I'm going to give you my checklist of how I knew Tesla is going to go back up when everybody was negative on the stock. I told you hey Tesla isn't going to stay below 100 for very long it's just a question of time. Currently the stock is at 250 and the question for a lot of investor is is the stock going to go to the next stage and why I think it's going to go to the $400 region it's not going to stay below 300 for very long. autonomy which is going to be a quasi monopolistic market for Tesla with 80% gross margin because it's literally licensing almost ready. much like with EVS where Tesla started before the curve they're starting the human robotics way before everybody else that in itself is worth a lot more than the current entire market cap of Tesla now. the net income over the past 3 years of Tesla is up 1,000% imagine a company that increases its net income actual dollars by 1,000% three years revenue is up 160% for that time period but the stock is down 50% from the all-time high in fact despite the recent increase in the stock price of 26% of the past 5 days the stock is still down 7% year today while 10 Xing the net income over the past three years now the stock is getting cheaper while the business is getting better it's a no-brainer it's a w it's quite easy in fact revenue of the past three years went from $35 billion to $95 billion so almost tripled stock is up 15% when I see these gaps created when I see the revenue goes up and basically 3 Xing while the stock goes up by 15% I know that Gap is going to close I told you 3 weeks ago this is going to happen I've been telling you that Tesla is going to do that since 2020 nothing has changed. FSD and Optimus on their own on their own are bigger than whatever Tesla is worth today and you're literally right now getting them for free because you're literally paying just for the auto business with some implied increases in sales nothing too dramatic you have to understand that $700 billion of market cap which sounds a lot is nothing once FSD and Optimus becomes mainstream FSD is going to be quasi monopolistic licensing deal to the entire Auto industry which Tesla is going to collect for with literally 80% margin and Optimus is going to change the game just like AI did if not bigger. I've said Hey Google Tesla paler crowd strike Bungie Sofi anet smci Nvidia and obviously the S&P 500 would be a great investment in 2023 now we are right now 18 months remove from the beginning of 2023 and right now these stocks on average are up 116% and they include names like smci that exploded out of the statosphere crowd strike AET paler and even Tesla did quite nice. does the company have increasing revenues check the box on Tesla. do they have increasing cash check the box on paler and Tesla my two favorite companies. now that's debatable in the case of Tesla although the Court ruled Elan should be labeled as a Founder but I'm going to let it go I would say that Elan is quasi founder at least. with the case of Tesla FSD is going to be one of the biggest if not the biggest recurring Revenue models in the Auto industry. with Tesla they're able to sell a vehicle with a premium I'm not familiar with any other company in the Auto industry that sells value that doesn't sell price there's very little things in the world that are being sold that are based on value. in the case of Tesla the idea is that to push a car at these prices that competes with much cheaper models especially now from China That's pricing Power. in the case of Tesla we have engineering we have software we have robotics we have energy and obviously the Auto industry and software there's such massive Ts for both these companies. in the case of Tesla I don't know of any single person who drove with Tesla and then switch back to Ford it doesn't happen once you drive a Tesla you stay with the Tesla. Tesla during the pandemic sold like hot cakes. with the combination of these eight factors that's why 40% of my portfolio is in paler and 20% is in Tesla quite simple. it's a really great Community to talk about stocks Tesla paler and stock as well.",1.0,1.0

Tomley was also in CNBC again and he was talking about Bitcoin and the S&P 500. Josh Brown who actually manages money for other people he came on the show on CNBC and explained look guys you have people who are very well compensated you know they drive Bugattis Ferraris you know porsa they have beautiful homes in the Hampton so they're very well compensated they're very wealthy but they're employees at the end of the day they manage very ultimately very rich people's money and their only job is not to lag the indicator not to lag The Benchmark now if they're lagging it a little bit that's fine but if you manage money for somebody that's a billionaire and you missed out on 25% last year because you went out of the market and you got them 5% instead of 25% okay and now second year straight you're about to miss a 20% year still sitting at 5% what's going to happen to your job people have a job to do and that job is to earn a return on the capital that's been entrusted with them and that is a huge driver in the second half of the year in both directions right so so we saw a wash out in September of October or October of 2022 this is the reverse version of that now you have the Dow the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 as of noon today all making all-time highs together it's a fairly rare phenomenon but when it's taking place and you're out of the market and or underweight it's deafening you cannot sit there and watch that go on and not just because you feel a certain way but there's an agency problem in investing which is when you're running money for other people they have expectations and one of those expectations is you better not Trail the SPX and obviously that means that your head is literally on the chopping block and as we go closer and closer towards the end of the year when it's going to be tested these people are feeling the pressure and they're feeling the urge to get back in this market to minimize the losses they've caused to their clients because missing out on 25 and 20% years consecutively is going to be devastating for their careers and for their clients.,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,8FgQnC5BgaU,2024-06-27T19:25:05Z,Palantir is the next stage of the AI revolution (Nvidia NEEDS Palantir),Palantir,you know piler is up 50% year-to date it's up 70% over the past 12 months and yet as I'm about to show you in this video pener is going to do another 500% give or take a few percentage points by 2030 it's about to make history it's about to join Elite stocks like Nvidia and like Tesla and the crazy part about this is that most Market participants are going to miss this opportunity most investors are not going to understand the true potential of until it is too late for people just looking at this what does it mean for paler it means we are sitting on the only thing that actually creates a quantifiable transformational value in an Enterprise let's talk about pener now despite these phenomenal numbers a lot of investors are worried because they're looking at the forward P of paler 61 and they're giving me the argument which is kind of true which is you know paler isn't worth double in Nidia and I'm not saying it is I'm just saying two things number one paler is still growing into its valuation it hasn't fully gone to its full profit potential because remember what happened with Tesla it took a couple years until it actually grew into its valuation the same thing would happen with paler penter has set itself up to be the quasim monopolistic element in the software sector which is the next phase of the AI Revolution and once that volcano erupts you're going to see the p ratio dropping down significantly and at this point it's trading at a premium because most smart investors understand that and they're willing to pay that extra premium knowing that P is about to erupt now luckily for penter they have the best product in town There's not even a close second you can listen to some of these AIP presentations in which customers are talking about how this is a massive Game Changer nobody else has now penter did this switch when they went from a super premium product for the Fortune 500 companies and they slowly coming down to earth in which your business eventually is going to use AIP that's the move Tesla did with starting with the model S and dropping all the way down to model 3 the same strategy is being utilized by paler they're democratizing and expanding the customer base what you're seeing right now with the AIP boot camps is just a start This is AIP this is paler this is the quas Monopoly palente created by focusing on this when everybody else were chasing after the hardware and right now they're set up to be the leader in this industry just like Nvidia is in hardware and yet somehow mid 2024 as this thing actually is developing right in front of their nose most investors fail to see this on the other hand Palante is trading at $50 billion market cap which is more likely to 4X 5x 10x from this point on is it more likely that Nvidia is going to go to $30 trillion or is it more likely that pil is going to go to $500 billion which is more likely and I understand how this may get confusing to some people because a lot of investors are actually not that versed in what paler does in fact most rated investors just don't understand what is so special about AIP and why it's a volcano waiting to erupt and in this video I'm going to try to quickly explain in very broad terms what it is but if you actually want to understand it in depth there is hours of film on the penter YouTube channel when you can watch AIP cons where clients come in and explain how AIP is being utilized in their business and how it actually helps them make money make better decisions and actually get ahead of the competition it's very very interesting it just requires some time so for those who complain about not understanding paler go watch the videos first There's so much material on it the whole craziness about this is that it takes paler 10 hours to come out with a working product that is why boot camps have been so successful and that's why clients have been going goag over this they come in and walk out within a day with a working product an llm that's integrated into a software that's literally operating their business from one single place allowing you to make decisions on the Fly within seconds that actually does things implements things there's a lot of examples on AAP conent how it's actually done Foundry and AIP have been terrific for us we actually launched the first prototype within 45 days and that was just amazing from my perspective everybody wants one because if you don't have AIP and your competitors obviously will have it you are screwed and that creates the same frenzy we're seeing with Nvidia with the Quasi monopolistic pricing power where Nvidia can charge pretty much anything because everybody wants one same thing with paler it's just not priced in yet now in 2020 when this company went public I told you hey bucks this is a steal we've done 170% cents in four years and this is just a start Vol is just getting warmed up I'll see you in the next one,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,8FgQnC5BgaU,2024-06-27T19:25:05Z,Palantir is the next stage of the AI revolution (Nvidia NEEDS Palantir),Nvidia,it's about to join Elite stocks like Nvidia they're looking at Nvidia at 35 and they're giving me the argument which is kind of true which is you know paler isn't worth double in Nidia and I'm not saying it is I'm just saying two things the other thing is that Nvidia is already mid cycled that Hardware AI cycle has started Nvidia is definitely leading that so the profits are going up the cash flow is going up everything is going up now everyone is chasing the hardware Trend right now and I get it you know Nvidia is the hottest thing in town but you have to understand that the next phase after the hardware after the capex after everybody's upgraded is the software side a lot of people will miss this because you see Nvidia actually needs paler just like a good computer needs good software a good llm model still needs not just the hardware not just the server it needs the operating system This is AIP this is paler this is the quas Monopoly palente created by focusing on this when everybody else were chasing after the hardware and right now they're set up to be the leader in this industry just like Nvidia is in hardware and yet somehow mid 2024 as this thing actually is developing right in front of their nose most investors fail to see this look Nvidia is at $3 trillion market cap rightfully so how much more is it going to go up to $6 trillion fine that's 100% on the other hand Palante is trading at $50 billion market cap which is more likely to 4X 5x 10x from this point on is it more likely that Nvidia is going to go to $30 trillion or is it more likely that pil is going to go to $500 billion which is more likely everybody wants one because if you don't have AIP and your competitors obviously will have it you are screwed and that creates the same frenzy we're seeing with Nvidia with the Quasi monopolistic pricing power where Nvidia can charge pretty much anything because everybody wants one same thing with paler it's just not priced in yet,0.9,0.3

Tom Nash,hg4Ody2ZJFI,2024-06-21T17:15:17Z,This Is The Best Investing Opportunity This Decade (Don't Miss It),S&P 500,"I mean we've gone from 3,800 on the S&P 500 to 5500 in 18 months that's a 19% return in 18 months absolutely insane now Warr wford coined a very important phrase that basically goes like this I'm about to butcher it so forgive me it basically says look when everybody's bearish I'm bullish and when everybody's bullish I'm bearish and right now it seems there's a lot of euphoria and a lot of bullishness in this market a lot of retail participation people want in on this party and that is usually the ingredient when people start to smell the soup of the end of the rally so a lot of people are anxious and worried that we might be getting close to the top of this market and they would like to make some adjustments and prepare themselves in case that happens now in this video what I'm going to do is I'm going to provide you the same answers I provide to myself because much like you I'm also an investor and I also really really want to know whether we are close to the end of this rally so I've analyzed all the data all the objective facts none of my gut feeling or emotions because when I got a gut feeling I go to the toilet this is not about feelings or emotions or speculations this is about data now let me tell you something very very important now if you invested money let's say $110,000 in 20 three in the S&P 500 and you kept it there all the way for 20 years to 2023 by the end of that period you're going to have $644,000 that's easy right now if I take out of this the top 10 days from a 20 year period 20 years of investment and I remove your best 10 days out of it the return is going to drop from 64,000 to 29,000 slashed by half more have by moving 10 days 10 days it all it took that's it so if you actually miss out on the top 10 days your return for 20 years of investment is going to come down by 50% now I want to actually explain it a little bit further you see seven out of those top 10 days between 2023 and 2003 happened during what was defined as a bare Market yes the market tends to be irrational shortterm in fact in 2020 which now seems like ancient history but was just 4 years ago in 2020 the second best day of the entire year came on the heels of the worst day just 24 hours prior if you missed out on that because you got fooked out fooked out because you got spooked oh my God I have to have fooked out on a t-shirt I mean look timing the market is very very dangerous not because you're just going to lose a lot of money it also means you're going to miss out on a lot of profit if you miss out on specific days you saw you're going to lose half of your profit timing this whole thing is not a good idea and yet I see a lot of people talking about potentially trying to get out before the market collapses a lot of people are thinking that this is a very similar situation to 1999 back in 1999 for those of you who are young enough not to remember this atrocity in 1999 every single company that said hey we're going to have a website. right like everybody's now saying oh we're going to have ai every time somebody mentioned do like they mentioned AI right now the company exploded right out the stratosphere and then the market went and took everybody with them to the Bottom now I want to explain why today in 2024 it is in fact nothing like 1999 and put your mind at ease I don't want to freak you out I don't care about the clickbait I just want to give you guys good information and I want to relax you I'm not here to fearmonger for clicks you see right now 2024 has nothing to do with 1999 it doesn't mean the market can't correct in fact the market by all statistics will drop 5% three times per year 10% once per year and every 3 years the entire index is going to drop 15% in a single specific year it always does that always Corrections are PRI of the game but are we ahead of a massive Market collapse like 1999 well if you look at the data I want to show you something back in 1999 when everybody was talking about getting in the market the participation was crazy look at the amount of initial public offerings how many companies went public in the 1999.com bubble when everything was published well we had 400 IPOs in 199 99 now in 2021 when we had this explosion of the co investing bubble we had 1,035 IPOs so these are the numbers we're talking about 400 in 1999 1,000 in 2021 when everybody went crazy last year in 2023 we had a total of 150 IPOs this year we're on track to do 170 IPOs there's no IPO activity that's signifies any sort of euphoric environment if this was a hot Market when it would be easy to get high valuations and go crazy the amount of IPOs you would have seen would been in the range of 400 to 600 IPOs and yet we're at 170 it's a completely calm situation companies are not running to the stock market because the market isn't that hot now let me show you something else I have a lot of data here so stick with me this about to get interesting now another point I want to mention is the PE the price to earnings ratio now we look a lot at PE with specific companies right we analyze a company and we say well their price to earnings is X and then the for B might be Y and that's how we analyze how expensive or cheap a specific company is but did you know there's actually a PE for the entire index you take all the PE of every single company in the S&P 500 and you make an average to figure out how expensive or cheap the entire index is simple as that now in 1999 the PE the price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500 was 33 insanely expensive I agree right now we are at 24.8 nowhere close to 33 in fact if you look at the median PE we're currently at 16 to 17 on top of it we have statistics that show us what is the average performance of a bull market before it ends in the US Stock Market and here's the thing the average bull market in us is about 114% the median by the way is 77% right now since the end of 2022 the beginning of this bull market and the release of chat GPT we did 18.5% and yes 2023 was a great year in fact if you go back one year from today we've done almost 30% now that seems to be bothering a lot of people who are telling you hey we've done too much we don't like to make money it's time to sell well hold on a second let's look at the stats every time the stock market has gone a 30% 12-month period which happened 27 times what happens next well 25 out of those 27 times the market in the following 12 months is positive so basically I can tell you that statistically if a market had 25 to 30% in a specific time frame which is a year statistics show us that 25 out of the 27 times that this happened happens the next 12 months are profitable how profitable well that changes but at least it's not a bad sign the profitability in itself isn't something to get spooked about or get annoyed about or get anxious about profitability isn't bad now especially if you look at the macroeconomic data now I get it things are expensive life is difficult I totally understand this trust me as a son of immigrants I know how tough things can get but right now if you're looking at the macro data at the Big Data not the specific life of a specific person the macro data shows us that inflation is under 4% and the job market isn't collapsing at the end of the day if you go back and you look at the market crashes that happened a lot of them happened because the underlying conditions the economic conditions were not good in a good economy sometimes crashes happen I totally get it but for the most part when you have good economic setup on the macro level it's very hard for the market to collapse and that's why I think a lot of the chatter about the whole 999 comparison is a big misunderstanding a lot of people who are explaining this you have no idea what they're talking about because in 1999 you had companies that had no business being public without any profit without any earnings without anything but an idea a name and a story going public getting crazy valuations right now what's leading the AI bubble soal the AI Revolution is the Mega C caps the mega C caps are leading the way it's not the trash companies that nobody has ever heard about it's literally the opposite of what happened in 1999 where all the small companies have ballooned out of the stratosphere right now we have the best companies in the world basically jumping ahead with AI ahead of everybody else now if you just remove the MA 7 out of the S&P 500 just for the exercise from the end of 2022 to now the amount of profits we're going to have are going to be slashed by half it's literally the ma seven who are creating this bull market it's not a bunch of kakami companies with a cool story now a lot of people tend to also forget the fact that we are in an election year yes I know things are going hectic in the market a lot of geopolitical stuff but we are in an election year and one thing about elections year that you need to know is they tend to be very bullish for the market the average return on the S&P 500 in an election year is 95% in fact if you go back all the way to 1928 what you're going to find out is that 74% of all election years were actually positive on the S&P 500 on top of it people kind of forget that we are in a 5.25% rate environment the interest rate right now is extremely high and it went up super fast probably the fastest space we've seen since Paul vulker now even though we're currently domiciled in a 5% interest rate the earnings have been nothing but spectacular and they're getting better by the quarter basically what happened is that Corporate America completely adjusted to that 5% environment and what would happen when the rates come down which they should by the end of this year the beginning of next year when rates starts dropping down profitability will improve because the cost of money will be much much cheaper and people will have way more available income to spend a lot of this is just the beginning the great earnings we're seeing right now are going to be way better once interest rates start to drop",1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,iFQWw-zAPZc,2024-06-18T16:04:09Z,"Palantir is about to have an Nvidia moment, but most investors will miss it...",Palantir,"okay so penter is going to make a lot of people rich now here's the thing this stock was absolutely obscure in 2019 then 2020 comes in the stock goes public and the whole meme action takes it to the moon everybody's now talking about it it drops back to the floor people forget about it now it's up again so people are talking about it again but this is absolutely irrelevant I believe that paler for the few who actually understand this is going to make people extremely wealthy now here's the point despite the new found Fame despite the fact that the stock did 160% of the past 4 years despite it being up 44% just in the past 6 months pilante is nowhere close to even scratching the surface of its true potential and it's going to make a lot of people really really sorry for not looking into this on time now there's a few people who actually understand the stock and the community is growing and I'm happy about it but the vast majority just doesn't get it now hopefully this video opens up paler to a wider audience which is at the end of the day what I've been doing on my channel that's why some people call me the paler guy by some people I mean my mom but that's a whole different video now look right now paler has three businesses that I want to talk about today Gotham which is the government business very little known but if you look at the numbers extremely lucrative on the other hand we have Foundry now Foundry is the commercial business Foundry and Gotham used to be the only Core Business of paler that actually mattered now over the past year and a half we have seen AIP emerge completely out of the underground and take over both of them right now AIP the new game changer for paler is going to be bigger than both of them combined because AIP is the future of paler don't look at this current 21% Revenue growth year-over-year this is irrelevant this is before the explosion that 21% is meaningless if I'm right about this that 1% is going to look like Child's Play in just a little while got to have patience like Tom Le said every great idea needs patience nothing happens overnight now look if I just kind of boil it down to one simple explanation AIP is just the operating system of every single large language model companies use out there as youve seen over the past year and a half ever since the launch of chat GPT the whole large language models llm has become the new economy every single company now understands that in order to do business they have to have an llm an AI based operating system the problem is that a lot of these are convoluted a lot of data doesn't match there's a big chaotic mess now piltin comes out with AIP is the equivalent of Microsoft coming out with Windows something to operate the hardware we have all the Nvidia stuff right now running up like crazy because people understand that everybody wants an Nvidia chip an Nvidia server base now the whole thing about AIP and and Foundry and paler is that people still haven't gotten that paler and AIP is literally the software side of the Nvidia Hardware side of the AI operation the whole thing here is very very simple Nvidia now is well understood so people are piling into it like crazy on the other hand while the hardware stuff is clearly owned by Nvidia quasi monopolistic way the other side which is the software side which is already being kind of owned by paler and it's getting stronger by the day that hasn't priced in yet the current market price of paler definitely shows a premium for sure I mean every great company runs on a premium that's fine but the car pricing does not reflect the understanding that AIP is the equivalent of the Nvidia Blackwell chip let's put it or the h200 doesn't matter software Hardware or rather Hardware software now it's very simple once people understand that and it might take a few quarters maybe a year or two they're going to pile into paler just like they did into Nvidia by that point it's going to be too late for you to get in on time very very simple now obviously I'm not telling you to buy paler or any of company I'm just explaining my thesis in my own personal opinion I'm not giving you investment advice here now look I know that the CEO of paler is unorthodox I know he's not normal but [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] normal who wants a normal CEO we've seen what Frank slothman did with snowflake we'll talk about snowflake in a second the big bad snowlake that was supposed to be way better than paler we'll talk about that in a second like a promise so yes Alex karp the founder CEO of paler who's been in this business and dedicated his life for this company who's been there for 20 years is unorthodox and sure he may have opinions that you guys don't agree with and I don't care and neither does he that's the whole point Alex carb does not care what you think about his opinions or in fact what you think about him or his company he's going to say and do whatever he thinks is the right thing that's why he's supporting Israel that's why he's saying what he's saying he does not care now look the fact of the matter is that despite him being unorthodox and not normal what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] normals anyway he is delivering results he's the founder he's been there for 20 years look at the results he delivered over the past 20 years look at the force of nature this guy is and look at the fact that he has principles he wouldn't sell for a dollar I like that and that is the reason that Palante is worth in my opinion a lot more than it's currently trading for now look right now we're witnessing the change in the whole Paradigm of how paler operat in the commercial side of things now paler has conquered the military side Department of Defense they all understand that paler is a must on the commercial side we've seen this problem with piler marketing basically what we've seen is that piler had trouble getting in through companies because you need a point of contact that point of contact usually spent a lot of the company's money on a solution that penter comes in and potentially wants to replace we have something that's cheaper better etc etc there's a lot of ego a lot of politics and a lot of blocking by point of contacts a lot of these companies who don't let penter in that was the reality up until two years ago and two years ago I told you in the video I told you one point this whole thing is going to flip over because the cost of not bringing on palente tier is going to be way more significant than the cost of losing your job because at the end of the day what's going to happen is that certain competitors will use paler they're going to outperform you they're going to drive you out of business and if you don't bring paler in to match you're going to lose your job and this business is going to collapse quite simple and it's literally what's happening it started with Airbus how Airbus literally overtook Boeing by just doing one simple thing which is using Foundry and losing basically skywise to absolutely change the way they assemble planes the whole supply chain the management of The Fleets go research skywise and how skywise completely transform Airbus into what it is today and now compare skywise to what's going on with Airbus and boing now look don't sleep on the Govern business as well I just mentioned that they've conquered it hey it's still growing at like 15 16% per year the top 20 clients on the government side are paying a lot of money for planer I'm talking about 20 30 40 million a year from these clients I invest in palan one simple reason I like industry leaders that's why I like Nvidia that's why I like Tesla and that's why I like paler all those companies are Quasi monopolistic and I like the fact that they have massive growth now don't get me wrong that 21% is not what I'm talking about that 211% is meaningless 21% year-over-year Revenue growth they got right now is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't care about that I look at the 1,000 boot camps they had over the past year I look at the 42% customer growth I look at the 87 1 million or more deals they've signed just in the first quarter of 2024 now look they also have a lot of growth in the institutional holding a lot of people are sleeping on this when paler was unknown when paler was kind of under the radar one of the main knocks on it was that there's not enough institutional shareholding in this company only 30% a couple years ago right now it say 42% and it's climbing by the minute as you're being told by mainstream media to stay away from this company institutional shareholders are buying like crazy in 2021 in fact in Q2 of 2021 literally 3 years ago we had 400 million shares held by institutionalsales card on stock MVP stock dmp.com it came out with 85 is the same score we have for NVIDIA and for Tesla they've only lost points on two things number one the institutional shareholding is below 50% and it's going to get there very very soon and also their PE is above 30 oh my God now another thing is the PE look at the current PE the current PE is 176 oh my God stay away from it look at the forward PE don't look at the current PE the 4p is not the past it is what you need to be looking at the 4p for paler is 60 it's still premium but it's 60 it's not 176 now give it another quarter another two quarters another year that thing is going to come down to 40 maybe then to 30 it's going to catch up with its valuation it's just a question of time now look at the operating income over the past year pante grew its operating income by 2 167% you heard me right 267 per increase in operating income in a single year at the same time your favorite stock snowflake has lost 26% in operating income net income is up 29% of the past year snowflake lost 8% in that same time frame debt down 16% which means PTY paid 16% snowflake increased its debt by 9% forward PE of paler is 60 forward PE of the value worn Buffett snowflake is 128 snowflake is literally selling for more than double with the declining business Zer mode and a low ticket item while paler has the keys to the Future and that's why my price Target based on my extremely conservative model which means my worst case analysis for paler in 5 years 2029 price targets bare case 42 that's a 78% in 5 years not bad medium case $94 per share that's a 300% and my bull case is 146 per share by 2029 that's a 57% in 5 years I'll take it",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,0uosLDD-cms,2024-06-13T14:51:12Z,If you are a Tesla shareholder….GET READY,Tesla,"folks we have some mindblowing Tesla updates absolutely insane you want to hear this now no doubt it's been a rough ride for the past few months but today is a good day to be a Tesla shareholder two things have happened of the past two days give or take that absolutely blows Tesla out of the water on the one hand AR invest came out about two days ago and released a new price target for Tesla for 2029 a whole new model and it absolutely is insane on the other hand yesterday the shareholders of Tesla did what they had to do which is approve both the Elon pay package and they move away from Delaware to Texas so let's start with the shareholder vote which is absolutely a massive event now a while ago we had a court that basically threw out elan's 2018 pay package now the court and the specific Judge they grabbed on to some sort of a technicality but at the end of the day it was very clear that this got thrown out because the specific Judge thought it was unfair because it was excessive now I remind you we don't live in a communist country and this was approved by the shareholders this was approved by a board of very very sophisticated individuals Like Larry Ellison a lot of smart people voted for this in 2018 and yet the court of Delaware found it a really good idea to intervene and cancel this like something you would have seen from a communist Court in China or in USSR nevertheless Elon Musk took it in stride and he basically said you know what bet I'm going to move my company to Texas where this sort of thing can happen because the Del court is out of control and I'm going to put up a brand new pay package of $56 billion to my current shareholders and they'll approve it because they understand it's not only fair it's not only contractually binding it's in their best interest to do so in fact if El musk would have come out with a completely brand new pay package that had nothing to do with the 2018 stuff and just said hey you know what I want $56 billion because I've done everything for this company for the past five years and I brought it to Greatness more shareholders would have agreed now at the end of the day and I want to extend my thanks to the great Alexander mer for mobilizing the troops here at the end of the day this was a no-brainer forget the counterarguments about the contractual law about the fact that they had a binding shareholder resolution a binding board approval and all that stuff at the end of the day at the end of the day it's very very simple Tesla in its current juncture needs El more than ever and they want El to be absolutely focused laser focused on Tesla taking away his pay package taking away his stock because this is all about options taking away his ability to control what's going on in Tesla all of this would have diverted his attention away from Tesla into other projects which is the one thing no Tesla shareholder wants in fact the guy who sued was a guy with n n shares and it's all about the lawyers here the lawyers are asking for billions and this whole thing was just a legal mumbo jumbo at the end of the day the shareholders absolutely saw it for where it is a complete no-brainer they voted for and then El musk was asked on Twitter Hey El now that this was approved in a massive Landslide because the Gap was absolutely insane everybody voted for with the exception of a few morons but basically after that happened Omar came on on Twitter sorry on X and he basically asked El musk you know El now that this has passed and it's settled will you make Tesla the most valuable company in the world and then El just replied yes now I personally would not bet against El when he makes statements like this and I think he's proven it in the past he's definitely capable of doing so I think that this puts to bed and rest in peace the whole counterargument about the Tesla keyman risk El going outside of Tesla to develop some new AI the whole Tesla fud is cleared and the dude is now all in on Tesla as they should have been as he always were and the shareholders did the right thing for them for him and for the company this opens up an opportunity to get a lot more institutional shareholders into Tesla now that there's no more uncertainty at least not as much as before now that that risk is gone you will see a lot more institutional participation in Tesla which will drive the price of the stock up voting no on this would have not just been unjust it would have hurt the company and their shareholders in a very detrimental way way I don't think that people even understand on the street what this deal was it wasn't about IL getting $56 billion in cash that was never the deal the deal was to get options by the way he'll still has to spend s billion dollars to buy these options of the company but those options will give him voting rights and control over what happens in Tesla that's what it's all about Elan was never about the money look at it this way when the guy sold PayPal with a couple hundred millions in the bank he could have just retired but instead he chose to buy a rocket company and a electric vehicle company back in those days that's Financial suicide and yet he did it because I thought it was cool he's not really financially driven like that he wants to control over Tesla and now that he has it all hell will break loose I think we'll see 200 soon and I think we'll see 25050 quite soon as well and a lot of the haters the doubters and the bearers are about to have some really really bad weeks now as far as the Aran vest new model that just came out AR invest just released a new fiveyear price target for Tesla a whole new model it's available on their website I'll put the link in the video now basically they have three cases here bull case $3,100 medium case $2,600 and bare case $2,000 meaning that Tesla is a, 1600% upside in the bull case, 1300% upside in the medium case and 1,000% in the bare case so basically the model has a few assumptions and the assumptions are very simple the main assumption is that 90% of the business in 5 years is not going to be from selling Vehicles it will be from the robo taxi business Arvest believes that within two years the robot taxis will launch and will become a pivotal part of Tesla in fact overtaking the EV sales as they right now EV sales are projected to be 10% of the business in 2029 just to show you how big they think Robo taxi will be it doesn't mean Tesla wants sell electric vehicles quite the contrary based on this model Tesla sells 5.8 million in the barcase and 14.5 million vehicles per year on the bull case in 2029 and as far as the gross margin that is supposed to go up to the 50s ibida from 177% to 32% and basically Tesla will become either an 11 trillion company in the max bull case or $7 trillion company in the be case now they do think that the robot taxi is a major pivotal point of this model but they did say hey if robot taxi for whatever reason doesn't happen this company is's going to be worth $350 in 5 years which means double than the current share price which means 100% 5 years which means way above the S&P 500 in the bare bare bare case now they are adding miles 110 times faster than way more which is a very distant second nobody's going to catch the FSD stuff and the craziest part about this model is what was excluded from it in fact with the exception of Optimus and energy which was taking just as a minor consideration it does not include whatsoever FSD licensing AR is telling you that without FSD licensing which I think is the next Catalyst for Tesla by the way not robotaxi without FSD licensing this is a 7 to 11 trillion dollar company now with FSD licensing with 80% gross margin with the standardization of autonomous driving we're talking about a massive massive business boost that is not currently even included in this AR invest model which makes you think about how big this company can really be if they launch Robo taxes and FSD within the next 5 years now if you look at Tesla from a fundamental perspective if you just ignore the arc invest model look this company increased its revenues in 3 years by 160% operating income is up 220% debt has come down by 20% net income is up almost by 1000% in 3 years all of this is selling at six time sales 52 4p it ain't cheap but greatness never is companies like this they always traded premium and with Tesla look we even put it through our own stock MVP scorecard it scored 85 one of the highest scores we've seen and only lost because it has a PE of above 30 and an Institutional shareholding below 50 with 45% it's probably going to go up to 90 very very soon now just to supplement the ark invest 5-year model my own personal DCF that shows me the current present value of Tesla is $1,400 per share almost 10 times of where it is right now that is why this thing is 20% of my portfolio if you actually want to run your own DCF on Tesla and maybe run it through the scorecard maybe other companies check out stock MVP stock mvp.com it's a platform I've

Tom what what if you know this this Market is just screaming out it's it's nvidia's world and we're just living in it right I mean nvidia's up markets are good Nvidia is not doing much S&P can't do that much nasdaq's negative today it's a one stock story uh I mean Nvidia is really a generational story for now because I mean how many $3 trillion companies actually have doubled uh you know I mean so clearly Nvidia is important but it's it's important because it's really one of the most important ways to get exposure to AI. Tom Le saying that Nvidia is a generational story and it's very hard to argue with that definition it's not something that we see every day now on this channel we've been covering n video for the past three years in fact in December 2021 we out a video telling you hey this company is absolutely insane in a rough kind of calculation that's about 400% profit since H actually we did it again many many times and even in December 2023 I put out a video saying Hey guys this stock is going to double again in post split terms the stock price was $48 when we put out that video it's currently at 120 so it's another 150% just from December of 2023 when we put out that video so I told you at least twice if not more about Nvidia so if you've been watching this channel channel for a long time you're not surprised and that might be a good time for you to subscribe it's free and you get information like this now the thing with Nvidia is that you don't need to be a NE resurgent to understand that this thing is trading at a massive premium compared to its intrinsic value sure but a lot of people missed out on this company back in the day when we were talking about this in 2021 and now they're hesitant to start investing in Nvidia because it's up 400% cense and it seems excessive you have to sense of it's the same thing like if you go to a casino and you lose some money and now you're saying I have to win back my money that money is gone that money isn't yours anymore there's nothing to win back you have what you have and they have what they have whatever the price was in December of 2021 or December of 2023 it's irrelevant you have to look at this company you have to understand hey this company is always going to trade at a massive premium it will always keep getting better on the business side and the stock price will always be above the intrinsic value good companies tend to do that,1.0,0.9

nonstop on CNBC mainstream media X wherever I will show you a clip three minute clip by one of the goats the greatest in the business as with the mother on in which he explains more about Nvidia than you heard so far in every other interview combined you have to see this check it out let's talk about Nvidia again I mean you own it so you should have that big smile on your face um is it the logic to you or just does this make perfect sense no I don't want to sound like a broken record but an intrinsic value base it's really tough to get to 3 trillion that said though if you were designing the perfect momentum company from scratch inv video would be it yeah you got a great story a CEO who sticks to the story no distractions is able to meet expectations the short ter because they've set the game up and you got a market that contributes to the mix I mean I think that you you're seeing one of the great momentum plays of all time playing out in front of you wow are you um re-evaluating I guess is the maybe maybe the best word I can think of at least now um of of how you would view this stock in terms of its value if it you know if you thought it was overvalued before right what do you think now and are you looking at it is it forcing you to look at it differently with every earnings report you're always required to go back and look at your basic story and I think my basic story is bigger than it was a year ago partly because of what Nvidia is delivered and partly because of what AI is showing it can do in the overall economy and Market you just I was listening in on the story about HP Enterprises reporting higher earnings because of AI you saw that with the big tech companies I think you're seeing AI percolate go beyond the architecture part of the business into Services into products into the rest the software and I think you're going to start to see the Ripple effects open other companies so if I raise my hand in your class and I say simply Professor is NVIDIA overvalued what do you say today I would say based on my story I mean 3 trillion is too high a number but I think this is a story where we could find plausible paths to get to 3 trillion if you add on additional markets so if somebody says I'm buying Nvidia because I think it's cheap it's not my job to argue with them and tell them that it's not cheap I think the story is in a sense and that's one of the things about momentum companies is there is a plausible path to get to these really high numbers and when the momentum is in your favor you'll find those paths that's why it's so hard I guess to be negative if you say there's such a plausible path your words that people sort of can see that that's why it's hard to be short names like this now obviously this interview is a good example of why as what the mun is one of the greatest in the business if you haven't heard about him he's the evaluations at NYU he's definitely one of the best now what he said in this video requires a little bit of deciphering because he's a very elusive guy and he uses a lot of hints but I'm going to do it in this video so don't worry so when he says that Nvidia is a great momentum company that is a hint you have to understand what he's doing here despite how it sounds it's not really compliment in fact it is a warning what he's telling you that right now it's riding very high and there's a good probability that it rides high for a long long time weeks months who knows how long but when he says momentum essentially what he's implying is that the current share price movement is completely detached from the fundamentals now the fundamentals will eventually catch up with Nvidia I have no doubt and I'll explain the second why I think it's one of the best companies to invest in for the next 10 years hands down but what he's saying is that the current price is just flying in the momentum not on any fundamental analysis and unless you're a momentum swing Trader for you as a long-term investor that's just a warning to chill out relax take it slow there's no need to changee these momentum trades now he's also saying in this interview quite clearly that Nvidia isn't fake and I agree Nvidia Is For Real the current pricing is not ridiculous it actually reflects a lot of success down the road but with the way Nvidia has been executing over the past few years with the quality of their management with the amount of demand and the growth in this market it makes perfect sense to be priced like this he explains it's not a about me saying that this is overvalued when he was asked this it's not the point what he's trying to tell you here is that certain companies really good companies Will Always by definition be overvalued overpriced there's always a premium to be paid for something that's the best of its kind it's never going to be priced fairly it's always going to be a little bit at a premium the idea here what he's trying to tell you is you'll never going to buy this cheap you can try and time the market but it's going to be very hard what he's trying to tell you in other words is to buy slow if you think Nvidia is a company to own for the next 10 years buy it slow over the next 10 years slow and steady every single week every single month every single quarter whatever suits you build a budget figure out how much money you spending every month how much money you have to invest allocate a certain amount and just buy it every single trench now whenever the stock drops below a certain threshold which you can determine for example 20% below its 52- we High you can increase your pace and whenever the stock gets too expensive then you slow down and you buy regularly that's as simple as it gets it's not even complicated now there's no doubt that Nvidia is a terrific AI infrastructure play in fact it might be the best of them 5 years the stock did 2200 per. revenue for the past 5 years is up 420 per. it's trading at a 32 forward PE it's not even that expensive with operating margin being at 54% and cash increasing by 250% over the past 5 years this is definitely the AI Hardware King no doubt this has nothing to do with Cisco all you out there who are being fooled into thinking that it will crash like Cisco did because at some point the capex investments will run out it's just horse manure what happens in Telecom does not happen in Computing laying down a fiber optic cable isn't like buying a blackw chip as AI becomes more advanced the acquirements from the hardware are going to get more and more intense it's not going to stop in three and five and six years it's just going to get better and better bigger and bigger more expensive Nvidia is set for the next 10 years easily and in comparison to Cisco just shows a lack of understanding right now the current share price reflects about 50% growth per year for the next 5 years consecutively it's going to be very hard to meet and it's okay to say that this is an insane assumption it's a very tall order for any company except Nvidia and Nvidia has done it in the past and it will do it in the future they have the management they have the team they have the perfect setup to get it done and while I think in the next 3 years Nvidia might do 200% next 5 years might do 400% I think those are the numbers nothing is guaranteed in life nothing and also the path also isn't guaranteed it might have a bad year it might have a bad couple years you never want to time the stock you don't want to fall more in because you're afraid you're going to miss out that's the worst thing that's what the point of mainstream media is to convince you that if you don't buy right now at this price you're going to miss it forever this is the new time share marketing scheme using mainstream media ignore it if you like Nvidia buy it slow over time get in this patient mindset understand that missing out on a huge profit does not define you in any way shape or form it does not mean you're a worse investor because you have understand that losing an opportunity will not hurt your ego at all except the past keep your eye on the ball slow and steady time in the market always beats timing the market remember that I'll see you in the next one,1.0,0.7

Tom Nash,e0JQlzRglrM,2024-06-06T15:25:25Z,Billionaire Ron Baron Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Elon and Tesla,Tesla,"Ron Baron just went on CNBC and he shot a lot of people up now he was talking about the compensation package of Elon how he's going to vote as one of the largest Tesla shareholders and basically being a very outspoken high-profile billionaire investor of Tesla they asked his opinion about this whole debate whether El should get that 56 billion dollar package or he shouldn't because it's excessive it's too much now he's an early investor in Tesla in fact his cost basis is $13 get it in your head now this is a prime example of how longterm patient investing Works guy buys at $13 many many years ago he ignores all the noise all the hoopla all the crazy talk around Tesla and just stays invested in his entire holding period he only sold 25% of his Holdings and that had nothing to do with himself it's basically something he promised to some of his clients 75% of his investment did not move from $13 all the way to K Price He more than 10x his money and he's still staying in because he thinks he's going to 10x it again and naturally this conversation was about the compensation package of Elon Musk the panel asked Ron Baron as a billionaire as a high-profile Tesla investor as an outspoken guy that everybody knows what he's going to do in this vote is he voting for or against the reconfirmation of the compensation package that Ilan musk basically got back in 2018 but was revoked by a Delaware judge because it was deemed excessive then uh we started uh when I met him in 2010 uh they were doing two 2,000 cars a year and then in 2014 I was 31,000 cars that's when we started buying in 2016 76,000 cars last year million 8s uh so a significant growth and he made promises uh if he met these metrics of uh iida of revenues of market cap uh that he would get this extraordinary compensation and the compensation uh when uh when he started uh when the contract was signed it was the company's M market value was $53 billion MH uh it got as high as a trillion that's now 550 billion I think in the next 10 years we're probably to make four or five times our money again in Tesla so so he's created tremendous wealth for people the will of the company and the will of the shareholders so I think he should be you it's a legally binding contract and then who sued uh you had an individual uh who was a shareholder For Hire with nine shares nine shares the lawyer who represented them uh when you talk about getting lucky he has applied to the court for payment of $5.6 billion $5.6 billion and uh and then uh he is asking for the payment to be made in shares of Tesla stock which are pressed because of this lawsuit it's crazy he he he earned it and he deserves it and he should be paid it basically this is the whole story here when Elon Musk made this contract the market cap of Tesla was $ 553 billion it has more than 10x cents he deserves it he earned this even if you go beyond the contractual legal issues 73% of the shareholders of Tesla approved this in 2018 the directors the board of directors approved this in 2018 now the person who is suing is a shareholder that has nine shares of Tesla and the point that Ron bur is making by saying oh he has nine shares is not that this person is broke is that this person really has very little vested interest in the success of Tesla it is more a tool for the lawyers to Sue Elon Musk and claim a compensation of $5.6 million for the legal proceedings so as any lawsuit you have in America right now the only ones who make money are the lawyers the company suffers the shareholders suffer nobody wins except the lawyers ain't nothing new here and I completely agree with Ron Baron now he was also asked about a keyman risk what happens to Elon Musk and Tesla if this thing does not get approved You've said for a long time when we've asked you what your biggest concern about Tesla would be is the keyman theory that that so much is writing on on Elon Musk being there if he's not there you don't think the company is worth the same so what do you think happens if this package is not approved what will Elon do we said as a Tesla as a company Elon if you perform this is what you're going to get how are you going to know back and reneg on that especially when all the directors and all the shareholders approved it it's crazy if this thing does not get approved this would be the equivalent of cutting the branch you're sitting on the Tesla shareholders by doing so if they vote against it may save themselves $ 56 billion not even I'll talk about that in a second but they're going to lose Elon Musk he's going to split his time attention and he's not going to put his full effort into Tesla the same way he did before simple as that now 2018 was a long time ago but if there's one thing that hasn't changed is that the American legal system is based on capitalism when the court of law says that a compensation of an executive that was contractually agreed upon and voted on is excessive I feel like it's the most communist thing I've ever heard and I can't believe that this has happened in America but beyond all the Communist arguments or the contractual arguments and all that stuff I think it will be a stupid move not to approve this it will mostly hurt Tesla long term and it's going to hurt the share price by a lot more than $56 billion not to even mention the fact that nobody in the media is talking about that Elan mus is not getting $56 billion to begin with everybody's talking about it as if El musk is about to get a check for $56 billion that ain't it it is an option plan an option plan that requires Elon Musk to buy options to spend $7 billion to buy options at a much much reduced price so it's not about a cash price it's about a 10year option plan that's going to cost elk 7 billion that's now worth 56 billion it's a huge benefit but it's not a cash reward out of the cash reserves of the company like they're making out to be if you just want to educate some people about this whole Tesla El mus situation send them this video explain to them what's going on don't let them be fooled by the mainstream media",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,67N8zb_SU64,2024-06-04T14:01:09Z,Salesforce Stock: Look Beyond The The Sell-Off...,Salesforce,I think Salesforce is a really good opportunity and I'll explain why shares of Salesforce are falling sharply in overtime after reporting earnings moments ago Revenue coming in light you can see Salesforce right now though is down 15% Italy is slashing their price Targets on salesforce's stock here many citing the possibility that the company could be falling behind in the AI race and yet I'm looking at the numbers and something doesn't add up now let's go this together right so Revenue over the past 5 years increased by 162% operating income increased by 1100 per. net income increased by 272 per. free cash flow increased by 238% cash by 226 per. all that happened in the past 5 years it's currently selling for six time sales and about 21 forward price to earn now I know the market hates these dinosaur non AI companies like Salesforce but look beyond the fact that this is currently a company that's selling for half of what its competitors are service now is selling at 40 forp and 14 times sales when in fact Salesforce hold about 90% of the Fortune 500 companies as customers now I've worked with the CRM with their product and it is irreplaceable it is a very sticky product once you get on it it is very hard for a large company to disengage is is virtually impossible so look $35 billion in Revenue that's what you get from this company every single year now if you look under the hood they already have $ 57 billion in remaining performance obligations which means that even if they do didly squat for the next 18 months they're going to be on Pace to get the same revenues again 9.43 billion that is what they have as debt that's massive but if you look at their cash position they have $18 billion in cash so I love the setup where a company has double cash in debt where the gross profit is 76% and the free cash flow margin is 66% I'm looking at the numbers right here in stock MVP and we got $6.25 billion in cash from operations just in q1 and the new dividend plan and potentially a new buyback I mean what's not to like now what's going on here in my opinion is that the market is overreacting and when the market is overreacting for me it screams opportunity to make money it's very very simple now look let's go over this together right now so Salesforce has missed earnings oh my God ooo oh my God they've missed earnings how much well 9.13 billion in revenues and missing earnings by $20 million over 9.13 billion of Revenue are we really going to do this now their balance sheet super strong cash flow is insane Market position absolutely quasi monopolistic this is a great long-term investing opportunity that just got cheaper for no reason other than a market overaction now they haven't even changed their full year Guidance the full year guidance is still at 37.7 let's say 38 for the sake of this debate right nobody seems to care I think it's a good entry point for investors who are patient long-term oriented smart investors now I know 2024 has become this oh my God growth over everything if you don't have 30% 40% 50% growth we don't care and this company only has 11% growth but my guy it's not just about growth what happened to buying amazing businesses amazing companies with great management Mark benov is one of the best in the business as simple as that now sure they have risks risks from Innovation disruptions from AI but who knows and God knows exactly how they're going to play into this just assuming they're done and selling them at half of what service now is selling for service now is double than Salesforce now to me it is very simple look look at this company as if you're buying the business if right now you're waren Buffett and somebody offers you this company at Half Price literally at Half Price what would you do would you say well it's just trading at 11% growth it's not good enough for for me or would you say well this company is generating $38 billion every single year it is insanely profitable it has great management it holds 90% of the market it is insanely sticky the product is very hard to leave leaving CRM living Salesforce is the equivalent of changing a big four auditor for a massive company it is virtually impossible and sure they don't have all the bells and whistles of the AI Revolution and I get it obviously you want to be an AI for sure but having a company like this at this price this is a mega opportunity as simple as that I'm here to find cheap opportunities for you to make money that's the only goal I have with this Channel and even if sometimes I have to bring an unsexy old company like CRM like Salesforce because it is selling for dirt cheap and it is a great investment I'm going to do it simple as that.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,toww1rKdsSg,2024-05-25T12:29:36Z,Investing Analysis,Nvidia,"so let's talk about Nvidia so Nvidia blasted through earnings my video about it aged quite well and now we're facing with this unbelievable price tag of about $1,000 a pop so let's go over this and let's find out if this is a buy at 1,000 bucks now look q1 numbers absolutely phenomenal revenue is up 262 earnings up 700% this is video game numbers you know those video games when you create a character and you max out every single attribute it has to 99 this is what Nvidia has become uh data center revenue is up 43% year-over-year it's now 87% of the total revenue of the company um demand for Blackwell h200 chips are out of control way more demand than Supply this is just the start of a massive massive cycle for NVIDIA and in my previous video I told you that $1,000 per share price for the stock represents an assumption of about 50% growth in revenues for the next 5 years consecutively so basically this price Target assumes that Nvidia is going to do 50% Revenue growth for the next 5 years every single year however for NVIDIA right now with what they're doing it doesn't seem unreasonable at all in fact we might look back at this 5 years and this is going to look ridiculous like we sandbag the Assumption now could there be a pullback on a stock like Nidia sure it's not immune to pullbacks and Corrections it's not made of solid gold it's just another company it's a terrific company it's an excellent company but a pullback a correction definitely might happen now for those of you who are actually interested in buying more Invidia stock whether you are an existing shareholder or your potential shareholder don't rush into it don't just F more mortgage your house and just buy a bunch of Nvidia stock you need to do this slowly over the next two to three years and the way to do right now is look at the current price the 52e high is 1,000 bucks and change so make a mental note every time the stock goes below 800 which is 20% below the 52 we High then you can accelerate the rate of your dollar cost average if every week you are buying 50 shares now every week you buy a 100 shares as long as stock is $800 or below now when the stock moves in the current price range of $1,000 $1,100 all the way up to $1,200 that's just normal dollar cost average territory you buy every week the same amount and you just accumulate if the stock flies way too hot into the Sun and goes past $1,200 super quick that's not a good sign in fact that is a contrarian element you need to pay attention to but it doesn't mean you sell it doesn't mean you stop buying if the stock flies above 1,200 in the short to medium term what you do is you slow down your DCA your dollar cost average and now instead of buying a 100 you're buying 50 so the whole thing is very very simple in one range you're doubling in one range you're buying normal and if you go above $1200 you slow down to half speed that's all you're creating a weighted average that's going to be very close to the bottom in the next three to four to five years without timing the market now there's massive CICS going on right now and this Capital expenditures by companies creating the infrastructure for AI is driving nvidia's business but the question here is is NVIDIA too expensive at a th000 maybe the price is absolutely out of this world and we should stay away because you know just a couple years ago it used to be a $100 stock right well I get this argument but let me tell you one simple thing if you look at the forward PE the price to earnings of Nvidia which in my opinion is the right way to look at this forward PE not current PE forward PE of Nvidia is 32.4 that's not exuberant that's not out of this world in fact that is way cheaper than a lot of stocks that are been trading at 35 40 45 50 55 60 PE that's not insane in fact I would argue that at the car price rate with a 32 PE this stock is fairly priced and maybe even quite cheap I know I'm going to piss off a lot of people by saying that but I don't care and here's another Point that's going to piss people off if you buy Nvidia right now at 1,000 bucks you're just basically paying for the data center business that's like 90% of their revenue they're all buying it right now because of the data centers but guess what Nvidia ain't done yet they have a lot of stuff going on in gaming in the automotive business in visual visual I can't say visual visual Vis visualization visualization I can't say it I can't say visualiz I can't say it I'm just going to give up visualization oh we got it and software there's a lot of heads in this monster right now one big head is getting all the attention but essentially you're getting all this extra stuff including visualization for free you're just buying data Setter business and that's not a bad deal look at the h20s the h20s that Nvidia put out for the chat GPT for 40 it it's double the capacity it's doubled the abilities of the h100 now that life cycle was 18 months Chad GPT was announced in November of 2022 we're currently in mid 2024 so we're 18 months away from the announcement of AI right and in those 18 months Nvidia has already replaced the h100s to the H2 200s and guess what in two to three years it's going to be another cycle and another cycle just like with computers you buy a Mac you buy a Mac and in two or three years you need a new one just not good enough it's not Telecom with Computing every two or three years you have massive obsolesence of your infrastructure of your network of your chips so Nvidia is just going to keep pumping out these guys every two to three years and this endless money glitch is going to continue and yes the current gross margin of Nvidia of 80% for a company that does tangibles Hardware that's a monopoly number eventually they not going to be a monopoly there's going to be competition maybe even China who knows so that number is going to drop the 65% operating margin that's going to drop but it's not going to go to zero they're still going to be making very good bang on their bu now there's risks here for sure it's not a risk-free you want a risk- free get a treasury get 5% and sleep well there's a lot of risks macro risk can go rates can go geopolitics you know the market might go south who knows Wars competition China might pull something out of the butt completely competes with the with Nidia and then there's a whole price War a lot can happen so there's definitely risks here but guess what right now inia is the Numero Uno and they're leading by a huge gap and they are running the fastest of everybody who's running in the race so if you're already quite comfortably in the lead and you're running faster ain't nobody

Tom Nash,6PuZ7mehLMA,2024-05-21T15:26:14Z,"Is Nvidia Stock (NVDA) a Buy at $1,000?",Nvidia,Nvidia earnings are tomorrow May 22nd everybody's excited the big question for me is this a buy at $950 per share just before earnings now a lot of decisions to be made in the next 24 hours so let's get started now this isn't my first rodeo it's also not my first video about Nvidia my first video was in October of 2020 telling you this thing is about to explode the stock was $138 per share it is now $ 950 so it's safe to say that we were in pretty early I'm not going to say we were the earliest but we hit it right in time now about 6 months ago I've also released a video telling you hey this isn't too late this is your last chance before the stock doubles again 6 months ago video comes out stock does 90% so it's safe to say we're not riding the Nvidia hype train here in this channel we've been through it quite early and we actually know what we're talking about now the big question is what's going on right now the stock is obviously up 200% of the past year 90% of the past 6 months so is it too expensive at 950 should you wait after earnings let's dig in now look AI is the king of this new Industrial Revolution it's all about Ai and Nvidia is all about the AI Hardware all the infrastructure that every single company in America and pretty much in the entire world world right now is built on AI Hardware that is manufactured by Nvidia now you're going to be surprised to know that Nvidia also has it hands in other plates a lot of software related products for AI also come from Nvidia it's a multi-headed monster when it comes to Ai and it's not by coincidence Nvidia spent the last 10 years ever since about 2015 developing AI products on the hardware and software site they've gotten into this quite early and now now they're ripping the benefits now after open AI boosted the entire AI industry Nvidia basically flew outside of the stratosphere because everybody wants their stuff even if you have other Alternatives right now in the market and you don't have a lot people are willing to wait months and months and months to get the Nvidia stuff this is the gold standard it's pretty much a monopoly right now now how long is it going to stay Monopoly nobody really knows but it is at least years away from actual competition now I'm going to be very clear here and I want you to listen to me a lot of people will tell you that Nvidia is just another case of Cisco when the internet came up Cisco was doing a lot of infrastructure work it flew up out of the stratosphere for the same reasons and then it landed back to Earth now this isn't the same story not at all with the invention of Internet a lot of one-time infrastructure Investments had to be made with Cisco this is absolutely just the ground level of next 10 years of a complete revamp of the way we do business in America in the Western World pretty much everywhere Nvidia is going to be providing the hardware for this industry at least for the next 10 years at the very least and even if we have some competition enter this Market in three or four or five years and Nvidia loses some of its pricing power at the very least it becomes a multi-headed monster like Microsoft Google and Amazon in cloud services so Nvidia at the very least in 5 years holds about 30% of this Market they're not going to go away and the level of obsolesence of hardware and software in this business is absolutely insane this isn't the internet for the next 10 15 20 years there's going to be a lot of business to be made and Nvidia is going to have a huge chunk of it and a lot of people are freaking out right now because we're hitting all-time highs both on NASDAQ and the S&P 500 and even the Dow Jones so people are naturally fearful about what's going on and that is a valid concern the only issue is that this is a once in a couple of decades event the last time we had a similar event like this was pretty much the invention of the internet if we kind of track it back all the way to 1994 with the launch of Netscape then we had about 120% on the NASDAQ for the next two years after that if we kind of look at the invention of AI as the release of chat GPT back in November of 2022 the ndaq only did about 58% since so if we compare what happened with Netscape to what's going on with with chat GPT we're still halfway there and I'm going to even argue that chat GPT is a much more critical invention than Netscape this is probably as big as electricity so I'm expecting a way bigger bull cycle for this thing now I'm going to be straight forward with you that doesn't mean that we're going to go straight up into the elevator outside of the stratosphere there going to be a lot of pullbacks a lot of volatility I'll show you in a second exactly how insane this can be Nvidia is trading at $950 per share that is a 52 we High all-time high whatever you want to call this at the very least very close to it the thing is NVIDIA is actually trading at forward PE of only 29 when Microsoft is a 35 AMD is a 30 and plenty of other companies are in the 50s so 29p the best AI Hardware the Monopoly in the entire AI infrastructure industry is trading at 29p not expensive I guess it's not Penny picking off the railroad tracks like some would want but it's not an expensive stock now if you look at the company from a valuation perspective and you run a DCF kind of reverse engineered DCF you look at this price right now $950 and you kind of reverse engineer it backwards to see what kind of growth percentage is assumed here so we've done it and at $950 at 10% discount this reflects a 44% annual revenue growth for the next 5 years in video has done that and some over the past 5 years Nvidia has increased its revenues by 400% over the past 3 years by 260% over the past year by 125% so putting on a 45% increase on revenues per year for the next five years on a company like Nvidia with everything that's going on in the AI sector is not outside the realm of reason I'm not saying that's a cheap assumption I'm just saying that if anybody can do it it's Nvidia and so far they've done much much better than that 45% having said that Nvidia still has a lot of risks built in it's not like buying a Government Bond it's not like a treasury there's a lot of risks involved right now we're looking video everything looks speechy 54% operating margin 250% increase in cash over the past 5 years the company is doing great the margins are spectacular the demand is endless but at some point there's a good chance the competition will come they're going to bite into the market share of Nvidia and also reduce its pricing power cutting into the margins that might happen you might have an economic downturn we might have a General market crash or at least a pullback geopolitical risks are always there and at some point Nvidia won't be Monopoly that's the thing that we also have to understand here it's not going to remain a monopoly forever but at the very least we're talking about Nvidia still holding about 30% of that market even once it actually is filled with more competitors now short-term volatility on a stock like Nvidia is something that you can't ignore we as humans we tend to kind of ignore the idea that the stock can absolutely swing in any direction but it can and it will and it's going to be very very painful now the stock went up 90% over the past six months that's a lot it's up 200% of the past year it's not going to just keep going up like this forever without pulling back without correcting you have to understand it's not just a possibility it's not a question of if it's a question of when now you look at the stock market right now and the numbers are spectacular the first 6 months of 2024 were absolutely out of this world now we did 10 and a half% on the S&P 500 just in q1 alone another 1% in Q2 but to get a 10% return on the S&P 500 within the first quarter of the year only happened 11 times since 1950 so in 75 years this happened 11 times it doesn't happen often now the good news is when that happens those 11 times 10 out of 11 times the market kept going up for another 11% from that point on the problem is that whenever we have this exuberant Market the volatility is absolutely insane even in years when we had 10% Plus in q1 and another 11% till the end of the year the average pullback in the market like that since 1950 to today was 11% 11% pullback on on the S&P 500 was the average that means that the stock like n can drop and swing like crazy it's true that we have a lot of money of the sideline there's a lot of money market accounts right now dying to jump back in it's true that the Middle East didn't really break out into this whole Regional War oil prices are low it's true that the rates will probably come down everything is 100% true but the market is currently shortterm in an overbought position and it just keeps going up so shortterm volatility for NVIDIA is something that you have to be careful about even if you love the stock and since none of us can really time the market and we don't have a time machine the only way to get into Nvidia at this price level with this expected volatility in the short term is not to try and time the market instead of chasing the stock and fing into it and trying to catch it before it explodes again be smart do what we've done for the past four years years on our community we started DCA dollar Coast average into the stock in October 2020 when the stock was $138 per share we have been dollar cost averaging ever since and we're sitting pretty we've never chased the stock what we've done in our community by the way you can check it out at patreon.com Nash what we've done in the community is essentially dollar cost average through the past four years but right now is the perfect example of a time where we slow down the DCA we ramp it up when the stock drops and we slow it down when the stock is peing next to its 52 we High basically to keep it very simple if the stock is anywhere from the 52 week high to 20% below that so from $950 to $780 that is the range when you still want to DC slow let's say that they have a bad earnings reaction or whatever happens or in two weeks in two months the stock drops below $780 below that 20% off of the 52e high then you want to double down your DCA it's as simple as that dollar cost average buy a little bit every single week and just slowly create a weighted average it's much closer to the bottom than to the top.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,LaSLruu4rys,2024-05-13T15:49:32Z,The Painful Truth About Palantir Finally Revealed,Palantir,folks I'm about to blow your mind in the past few days we heard a lot about why penter is down 15% ever since posting earnings what the hell is going on all of this chatter this endless W salad without giving you the actual explanation what I will reveal in this video is not only going to blow your mind which is a promise not a clickbait it is also going to make you more bullish about paler than you have ever been before wait and see now I'm not here to say that I'm the world's best expert on paler I think it's far from it I've seen a lot of people put in thousands of hours researching the stock I'm not even in the top 10% but I'll tell you what I've done over the past few years ever since they went public I've read the entire 0o to one book by Peter teal which is basically a manual of how and why paler was created to be what it is today years ago I've read the entire paler casebook 500 pages you can buy it on Amazon I don't have a sponsored link I've read client presentations about skywise which is The Foundry for Airlines two presentation each with specific detailed test cases I've learned about AOG airplane on the ground why it's important I've learned about every single valve out there how the oil measurements impact the fuel consumption I've learned everything about the AirLand industry just to understand skywise just to understand Foundry and that's the Legacy business that's not even AIP I watch every freaking video on pente I conf find including every video on their website I talk to their CTO sham Sankar and asked them bombarded them with endless questions about the platform the technology I engage with the community I talk with anybody who's willing to offer me information about paler including a guy who's in my DMs right now trying to set up a meeting with me who's from the industry wants to offer me more info and I talk to haters and Bayers who absolutely have a bare thesis about this company to understand their point of view I talk to former employees of paler who reach out to me and I talk to them about the problems they've seen in the company I read the entire freaking website page by Page Letter by letter I learned the entire industry the competitors the comparables there's 80 customer reviews on the platform on Pal's website some of them with video some of them not with use cases per industry I've read them all every single breakdown out there that's just a prime example of how you obsess about a company so that minus 15% in a week does not scare you but rather excite you now when you hear things like rbc's Rishi delura talking about paler post earnings in the way I'm about to show right now there's two ways you can interpret that and I'll show you the clip in a second at least part of it you can take it as something that scares you about the company or you can see it for what it is which is without any disrespect to Rishi delura complete misunderstanding of the business model which creates an opportunity for you to buy stock cheaper than what it should be priced at this has become a a hyped or in my opinion overhyped uh generative AI you know beneficiary company and we can get into that in a second remember paler is very heavy customized software right I estimated more than 30% of their businesses actually uh Professional Services and Outsource data science rather than actual true software so Rish delura talks about paler in a way that makes it very clear to me and some of my Compadres that are obsessive about paler makes it clear that he doesn't really understand the business and the company and that there no disrespect to him analysts they work on tens of companies they have to cover they just don't have the time to obsess about the stock like we do rich lur is talking about a company that has high Revenue growth with 20% Revenue increase they have high operating margin with almost 40% operating margin a company which increased its revenues over the past 3 years by 100% while decreasing operating expenses by 125% which is unheard of a company with an accelerating Revenue growth 21% Revenue growth right now versus 20% previous quarter 177% the quarter before that 133% in the quarter before that over the course of a year penter has increased the level of acceleration of its Revenue growth from 133% per year to 21% per year in a single year now on the other hand it's becoming more balanced commercial growth is actually accelerating way faster than in government so now we're almost at the Tipping Point where we're about to be 50/50 commercial in government just a couple years ago we were at 60/40 so pent is becoming more balanced their top 20 clients are increasing their annual spend by 10% per year the net dollar retention is increasing right now 111% so to me when I hear Rish delura speak about things like well this company requires a lot of customization for the products which means it is more Consulting than software now to me it shows a lot of misunderstanding about what the product is what AIP is we're talking about a Sandbox completely industry agnostic it's so easy to form like Play-Doh you can make anything out of it in hours that doesn't make it Consulting it couldn't be Consulting with 82% gross margin with 36% operating margin this is not the margin of Consulting companies now Foundry which is the previous gen took three weeks to deploy which in itself is not Consulting AIP deploys same day companies come to boot camps leave with a working product Same Day within 10 hours that's not Consulting sir that's just a misunderstanding and he talks about well they don't create any AI they're not a AI generative company now that's a mistake that's been done by a lot of commentators in the past some of them have repented this guy isn't yet but let me explain something you see generative AI llms have been commoditized to death it is now like the USB connector everybody makes one my grandpa has an llm this is literally like saying well you know Microsoft PowerPoint is a lot more valuable than Windows because you cannot create any information any documents in Windows but you can create documents in PowerPoint which one is more valuable PowerPoint or Windows AIP which is the operating system for every single AI platform out there or the random generalized commoditized llm large language model I think the answer is quite clear look at the customer growth on us commercial penter has grew their customer base in the US commercial sector by 70% in a single year that does not happen if they don't have a Cutting Edge game-changing product now here's what I promise to you I promise to blow your mind absolutely make you go Kaboom when you hear this about why the company posted such great earnings they've bat EPS they've beat Revenue they've increased their guidance and yet they've dropped 15% what happened nobody's talking about this and this is a prime example of how obsessing about a company Beyond any sort of normal reason absolutely insanely pays a lot of money I'll show you of course you need patience but here's the Crux of it you see the trading right now is mostly algorithmic it's BTS it's computers institutional investors basically just use computers to automatically trade if a company beats earnings stocks fly up if they miss earnings stocks drop it's an overreactive environment because all Bots essentially are in the group think mode pilent reported revenues of 2.22 billion in 2023 they gave guidance of 2.66 for 2024 now all 2024 estimates by analysts are aggregated to create one estimated number if the company beats this number stock flies up if the company misses this number stock drops it's an avalanche it's everything Amplified now if you look at the analyst estimates for penter earnings for penter Revenue specifically you find that all of them were basically very close to the palente guidance of 2.66 billion because why wouldn't they be the company knows best where they going to be some were above some were below but the analyst basically hover around the 2.66 number now a few days before the earnings we have an undisclosed analyst who have joined the free we don't know who that is days before the earnings and this analyst comes out with $3.2 billion of estimate that's 400 billion above the number two highest estimate now what happens that pulls the average of the beat up so now paler doesn't have to be 2.68 billion which was the case just a few days before earnings now the beat number has been raised to 2.71 billion because of that one analyst that joined a few days before undisclosed with 3.2 billion of estimate versus a company guidance of 2.66 billion what happens palente reports 2.68 billion in line with the estimates but below the new average what happens stock plummets 15% what happens somebody makes a lot of money shorting the stock now I'm not saying that any anybody specifically did this I don't have any evidence to show you who did this or why they've done it or maybe this is just a coincidence I don't know this might be just be crazy coincidence I'm not saying that this was any Foul Play here I'm not saying anything because I don't know I don't have any evidence but there's one thing I know I see this playing out and I see that paler actually beat revenues beat earnings gave increased guidance and dropped no matter what the monkey business is and we know that you know retail investors always always get screwed like this because we know all of this information about the company how great it is we know how good the earnings really were when we see the stock drop 15% this is like giving us a gift giving us a present because this is clearly clearly BS and that BS is going to make money for the people who are obsessive about this company plenty members of the paler Community can see through this BS it's a smokees screen that is why me and others remained bullish on the stock when everybody became bearish when certain YouTubers were selling at the bottom we just keep dollar cost averaging into the stock buying more buying more and buying more and if it drops 15% we buy more even harder simple as that now again don't go all tin foil conspiracy theory on me here because I don't know what happened but this is a prime example of how an anomaly let's call it an anomaly an anomaly that leads to a discounted sale of a stock that's in in the great shape makes money to people who understand it in a world but everybody has all the information 100% of the time I promise and I delivered I'll see you in the next one,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,tbpowoLx-J8,2024-05-07T12:58:41Z,The end of Palantir? (Why $PLTR is down and keeps dropping?),Palantir,"well paler just had one of its best quarters of all time it beat on every possible metric its Revenue was better than expected earnings per share was higher than expected and it gave great guidance for the rest of 2024 and yet the stock was down heavy right after earnings came out and of course the big question here is what the hell is going on why did paler had such a great quarter and it still dropped like a stone what just happened here now in this video I'll do a few things number one I'll explain to you what exactly happened what led to this but more importantly I'm going to show you why this is probably one of the best quarters paler has ever put out and why this earnings call made me more bullish about paler than I have ever been and trust me I have been quite bullish before this earnings call so this is very impressive stuff so let's start first of all with what happened here now you have to think about crowd psychology think back to what happened with Tesla everybody were convinced that Tesla is going to have absolutely horrendous earnings and the stock sold off like crazy leading up to the earnings everybody was saying hey I'm going to wait for the stock to crash once it crashes I'll buy back right after earnings at least the Bulls what ended up happening is this rubber band effect where everybody were convinced something is so horrible so horrific the minute the earnings came out from Tesla and they were not the worst the world has ever seen it wasn't the end of Tesla that spring got released and Tesla flew up and then corrected back but generally flew up like crazy now that happened because the expectations were so horrible that no matter what Tesla put out basically it meant that the stock would go up now very similar to this palente did the same thing from the other side and everybody were so convinced that paler will have such great earnings it will blow everybody out of the water which they did but because the level of expectation for the stock for the earnings was so high palen literally needed to come out and beat like nobody has ever beat before to meet that expectation level the stock increased by 8% in a single day leading up to the earnings it did 20% over the past two weeks leading up to the earnings so that lead up that buildup that 20% increase we've seen in paler stock just before earnings that was the setup that was very hard for paler to meet the minute the earnings came out and it was just a normal beat it was well below the threshold of what the market has already priced in and then it started correcting and then the Avalanche started because once it start selling off there's a lot of algorithmic trading especially in after hours and then you saw the Avalanche come down that's the gist of it that's what happened with paler does it matter to me as a long-term investor should it matter to you as a long-term investor not at all I mean it's pretty much irrelevant it's a fart in the wind who cares but it does matter to a lot of people who are unsure about this company who are unsure about its potential and that's why I'm here to explain to you and I've said this during the earnings call we had a beautiful live stream almost three hours phenomenal guest and I want to thank everybody who came on the live stream and one of the things I've said is that my bottom for this company my floor for the next five years is Salesforce so I see this at the very minimum about $250 billion market cap which is basically 5x from where they are right now at the top I see this is a Microsoft equivalent which is easily 20x from this point on so you see that I'm not bothered by this and in fact I'm quite interested in this stock price if it keeps dropping I'm just going to be more excited I'm going to be dcing even harder which is something that I've never used before hard dcing that might need to go on a t-shirt but you get what I'm saying here now as far as the quarter itself I mean when we look at the numbers I can't help but just being absolutely impressed by what they've done especially in this climate in this economy in this environment with this geopolitics look let's look over the numbers here and I'll start from the bottom and work my way to the top so one of the things that I was so critical of paler over the past few quarters is the deine deine in the net dollar retention in a SAS business in a software as a software business it's very important to have recurring Revenue right not only recurring Revenue but increasing recurring revenue and the way you measure this is with net dollar retention that's a very tricky metric but it's super important for paler essentially paler came in into this call with a net dollar retention of 108% which means that they have built all their clients on average 100% from what they've paid last year and 8% above that that's not bad but it's definitely not as good as some of the other SAS Superstars out there like snowflake now this 110% we got is an improvement especially when the 108% was already an improvement from the previous quarter so pante here is now improving the net dollar retention two quarters in a row now I definitely want to see this going into 20% which is where I think paler should be and that trajectory really really makes me confident what they're doing the other thing I like here is the fact that we have 9% growth year-over-year for the top 20 customers of pener now 9% growth year-over-year that doesn't sound exciting who cares well hold on a second you'll care in a second you see the top 20 clients of paler they generate a lot of criticism for the company because of you know concentration right if the top 20 clients basically are half your business you have a risk right it's a concentration risk client concentration risk but the flip side of this is when those top 20 customers that generate almost half your business have increased their spend by 9% per client year over- year that means that everybody's paying on average $55 million per year from those 20 customers which means that the Thor brats the clients that they care about they're increasing their spending every single year and if you go back through the earnings that 9% number is always there their top 20 customers consistently pay more every single year and they don't leave now the other thing that blew me away was the net income net income for penter get this is up 450% from $19.5 million to $16 million that is absolutely insane from 9 and a half to 106 that is a wild increase in efficiency in scalability in profitability on the one hand we have Revenue growth of 21% on the other hand our cogs cost of goods is only growing by 8% and the entire operating expenses are only growing at 6% so if you can give me a company that's growing revenues by 21% but only growing operating expenses by 6% that company is growing faster and faster it's faster it's expanding it's not only getting better it's getting better twice it's a double dip now even if you look at the balance sheet which we all know is beautiful for paler they have four billion in cash no debt but even there they find places to get better assets up 7% year-over year liabilities down 7% again the company that's increasing its assets decreasing liabilities at the same time usually these things don't happen you usually don't see this where $4 billion do no debt more assets and liabilities four times more three times more and the Gap is expanding it's absolutely insane now even if you look at data like Revenue per employee which a lot of people are really not that excited about but I think it's a really good gauge of how good paler is paler is currently generating about 700,000 Revenue per employee that is insane it's not as good as Microsoft or Google or meta which are probably towards the you know a million give or take but it's in the upper echelon of companies they're definitely in the league of the top tier companies in the world if you compare that to snowflake for example n generates about 500,000 per employee with 113 priced earnings on a forward basis versus peners 58 which we'll talk about in a second and a negative net income versus palente positive net income and with the same amount of Revenue of $2.8 billion per year so not to hate on snowflake but I'm saying it's a good Benchmark to show you how good paler is at profitability scalability now if you've already mentioned this I'm going to kind of move on from this point and I'm going to talk about PE everybody criticizes paler for having a very high price to earnings and I've been saying this for the past year I've been saying look guys the PE that you're seeing on Palante right now that's the first PE the second PE they just turned the profit they just turned the corner so they're essentially just basically broke even so it's not really the good comparable right now this is the evidence I've been talking to about look the PE was 200 just a year ago it's currently 4 PE of 58 not saying that 58 is low but 58 versus 200 in a year just show you that closing their Gap penter is slowly growing into their valuation the same way Tesla did the same way all great companies do you know that's saying time is the best friend of a great business and that's specifically true for the stock market and for multiples that 58 for PE p doesn't have an exuberant crazy PE anymore so another fud gone out the window right now we're talking about a company that generates 21% Revenue growth but that Revenue growth is just the tip of the iceberg you can see the potential of the revenue growth the one that's in the pipeline is a lot bigger and I'll show you look we have about 40% of us commercial growth year-over-year 14% quarter over quarter we have 70% us commercial customer growth year-over year those numbers are baked in in into the cycle of paler but they've not yet translated to revenue growth there's a lag there's a life cycle of a customer on boarding and it's not the only place where you can see this look at the US commercial remaining deal value it's up 74% look at the total contract value it's up 131% this lag will eventually close and will increase the revenues out of the 21 region into the 30s that's inevitable because paler at this price at this stage it's still a very early stage company people tend to think about paler this massive 20year Behemoth you have to remember that the commercial stuff of penter just started 2017 when you think of penter think about commercial versus government completely different businesses this is a young company this is you getting in on the ground level it's not cheap there's a lot of growth and success baked in into this price but so far over the past five quarters they've done nothing but execute and deler and they've definitely gotten my trust",1.0,0.9

which are probably towards the you know a million give or take but it's in the upper echelon of companies they're definitely in the league of the top tier companies in the world if you compare that to snowflake for example n generates about 500,000 per employee with 113 priced earnings on a forward basis versus peners 58 which we'll talk about in a second and a negative net income versus palente positive net income and with the same amount of Revenue of $2.8 billion per year so not to hate on snowflake but I'm saying it's a good Benchmark to show you how good paler is at profitability scalability now if you've already mentioned this I'm going to kind of move on from this point and I'm going to talk about PE everybody criticizes paler for having a very high price to earnings and I've been saying this for the past year I've been saying look guys the PE that you're seeing on Palante right now that's the first PE the second PE they just turned the profit they just turned the corner so they're essentially just basically broke even so it's not really the good comparable right now this is the evidence I've been talking to about look the PE was 200 just a year ago it's currently 4 PE of 58 not saying that 58 is low but 58 versus 200 in a year just show you that closing their Gap penter is slowly growing into their valuation the same way Tesla did the same way all great companies do you know that's saying time is the best friend of a great business and that's specifically true for the stock market and for multiples that 58 for PE p doesn't have an exuberant crazy PE anymore so another fud gone out the window right now we're talking about a company that generates 21% Revenue growth but that Revenue growth is just the tip of the iceberg you can see the potential of the revenue growth the one that's in the pipeline is a lot bigger and I'll show you look we have about 40% of us commercial growth year-over-year 14% quarter over quarter we have 70% us commercial customer growth year-over year those numbers are baked in in into the cycle of paler but they've not yet translated to revenue growth there's a lag there's a life cycle of a customer on boarding and it's not the only place where you can see this look at the US commercial remaining deal value it's up 74% look at the total contract value it's up 131% this lag will eventually close and will increase the revenues out of the 21 region into the 30s that's inevitable because paler at this price at this stage it's still a very early stage company people tend to think about paler this massive 20year Behemoth you have to remember that the commercial stuff of penter just started 2017 when you think of penter think about commercial versus government completely different businesses this is a young company this is you getting in on the ground level it's not cheap there's a lot of growth and success baked in into this price but so far over the past five quarters they've done nothing but execute and deler and they've definitely gotten my trust",1.0,-0.2

Tom Nash,MbErL8kB6u0,2024-05-06T22:11:21Z,Palantir Earnings Call - LIVE | Tom Nash,Palantir,"hello hello hello everybody uh welcome to this uh exciting palente earning SK live stream I have here with me Dominic Renaldi one of the best in the business we'll showcase your work on Seeking Alpha and next in a second and also Greg from investor is here to talk about the technicals and provide some contr analysis and we got some other guests popping in as we get closer to the earnings code TR will be here a little bit later on H ticker symol you might swing by for a few minutes so we have an incredible show for you guys today thank you for joining us.
how many pilent pln stocks you have I have none pln stocks um I have a few pltr stocks H I need to catch up so a my full Russian name is none of your business pettes B name and I have too little not enough volunteer talks thank you for the question Oliver I appreciate it.
with the seven and a half perc Spike today which is uh a little bit crazy before earnings do you think we're getting into the place where paler might be a little bit overbought is it to DIY at this point.
either we do very very well at earnings and we see it go crazy like it did last time we saw like a 48% in three days or something insane last earnings and that happens great or we see the opposite where they still do well but there is a little bit of a selloff people taking profits cutting back and to be honest with you I would rather them obviously do very well but then there is a slight pullback why because I'm dollar cost averaging I would rather have lower prices so I'm okay with either but I would prefer there to be a little bit of a pullback post post earnings as long as they do well of course.
Greg from a technical perspective purely we're I'm a long-term investor gz Halas and even you have a hat of a long-term investor but in your technical trading hat what right now with the pan you have about two minutes actually funny enough I kind of agree with alen I do think well I agree with everybody it's going to be all sides actually I do think through the volatility that potentially we're going to have through this we can Skyrocket all the way to 30 just as Dom said and very quickly break back down to 25 and 20 with this Market.
first of all to be clear I'm not a paler bear in fact just the opposite I do think let let us have some fun we need a contrarian in the we become way no I have to present things as they are come on Tom you know me well enough they will become a staple they're tremendously important but again technicals do bring me back down to earth a little bit sometimes and often times I'm more of a b bullish type but this instance is quite problematic with regards to the overall market and what we have on the charts.
and paler whether we like it or not although generally thrives on these on turmoil yeah when God sneezes everybody gets wet exactly exactly if it's a tsunami everybody gets wet so yeah but hey for us for all of us it's great we can buy more so it's a bearish bullish case.
can you tell me a little bit about why you are so excited long-term poer coming from the industry and the and and from the inside yeah I'll try to do it very concisely um they have I you up a little bit but it's a you know just they have a a a very different business model um they are very customer Centric and the technology that they have delivered for anyone who's new to palente tier is really you know a lot of customer companies say this outcomes focused but they truly are focused on return of value.
number one they do have to I think beat Wall Street's revised uh earnings and and numbers if they don't I think they end up actually going down.
I do think we're going to see more products like skywise emerge that people are changing the uh dynamics of Industries uh healthc care being one that paler really focused on they're going to be doing that building on on Foundry and AIP and it's going to Res and residual Revenue yeah.
do you think you will be able to continue growing EPs and risk to profitability growth I I think the you know the answer for the first part of the question is yes H risks plenty I mean obviously I think volunteer has a major concentration risk that no nobody talks about enough I mean 20 clients basically are 50% of their revenue which is a massive concentration risk they have to address.
that's fair look there's a problem with paler one problem that they just the way it is it is what it is and then I'm going to move it over to you when when you come out and you say we're better than everybody else we know how to do anything better we're we're going to move to Colorado we're gonna do things different Etc ET you got that that burden is on your neck and you got to be number one and everything you gotta beat massively you have to go crazy and that's that's you putting a you know Target in your back and when when you don't deliver in a way that basically says I'm way better than everybody else people are going to get upset and Market's going to react appropriately.
Palantir up until two three years ago was a project based military or whatever will call it company heavy on creating a specific platform for a specific customer right very project oriented very Project based deepen deepening their knowledge in AI but that was up until two three years ago then two three I'm talking from a product perspective then we'll go to the market from a product perspective two three years ago they understood that they need to package it in a way that they can sell it commercially and they started working with commercial customers those are the ones that everyone here is mentioning that did the workshops from a market and and now basically there are two companies there's paler let's call it government military all that and there's paler commercial that's how it's kind of positioned at least again from my perspective from a market perspective there also has been two poers the paler of the spa that went crazy a meme stock and now in the last year or two there's paler and AI company that needs to shake off the fact that people still think that it's a project-based company and listen more to Cod and Maddie here that say look people love using their software so I think it's also that and that's why the the stock is behaving still erratic and not H going up slowly like a regular or actually no stock is going no AI stock is going right now logically so it's not even a good comparison but that's why it's the way is um but again I think it's although it's a 20 now it's 21 or 22 year comp year old company I think it's a twoy old or fivey Old Company basically and that's how we made that point you're right we talked about it there's the startup paler and then there's the OG paler.
every smart thing you said because it's a 21y old company that is their only current challenge in the market they have customers they have very big customers but they're carrying a case that's filled with history and maybe even a bit of um misunderstanding of the company.
the company is performing on its guidance it's performing on all the metrics I think that this and this is not Financial advice from my perspective any I don't know correction here is a Bible one whether it's tomorrow or in two three days or five days or it doesn't matter there's a huge support that uh you can probably there's someone here with the chart that can show it at least from my perspective nothing to worry about but Tom I told you that a few hours ago anyway so it's not a surprise.
the fact that the company for the first 19 years of its existence was really just looking at honing in on you know government contracts and and really focusing on perfecting their Foundry and Gotham sort of products and it wasn't really until and it was more so focused towards Gotham to be honest with you and it wasn't until they started working with BP and several other select companies in 2016 2017 when they actually kicked off Foundry and you've seen the growth of the organization in terms of Revenue since then.
I think people that are thinking about where it is today and the products that are out today are discounting that these guys every 18 to 24 months will release another groundbreaking product that will have its own cohort of customers its own cohort of revenue streams coming from it and will only continue to expand on its uh I'd say dominant position within the market of being a 21st century technology company and software company.
Palantir adjusted eps8 of q1 Revenue 634 million estim at 615 okay let's up I don't know if that's the results right there.
it seems like they've beat but the I really want to see their official publication and they haven't put it out anywhere right I can't I can't see it anywhere yet they always do this where it takes them a minute to to find it so gr took us through the action as we flying up 3.5% flying up talk to us 5,400 people in the chat are listening to you.
you know what I will say job dumb right they did their job their job was to beat yeah they beat all the way across the board and rais gu so I mean they did their job.
so basically so basically what as we're now down 5.1% so p beat across the board and the stock is down 5% which only kind of brings me back to what we were talking about about uh you know an hour ago which is basically the beat was priced in they beat as expected and now the the basically the profits are being taken out correct.
net income uh 177% margin uh we got EPS Point 08 which was I think it was I thought it was the estimate but it's a slight beat 21% Revenue growth ER year-to year and US commercial grew 40% 150 mil uh commercial 27% government 16% oh nice numbers customer count grew 35 42% which is quicker than the 35 they had in the previous quarter um yeah cash from UPS 130 20% margin um yeah three everything looks good yeah it's a nice clean beat nothing crazy as as we said right it's a it's a nice clean bait what about the Outlook Q2 uh revenue 65053 and uh income operations 29 2 213 full year H pretty much the same and um 45% us commercial growth raising adjusted income from operations to 868 to 880 um yeah and uh Stay Stay G profitable yeah so everything everything looks good.
Welcome to our q1 earnings um I think it is fair to say we crushed q1 in the US uh we are on fire that you see this in our rule of seven rule of 40 being 40 57 you see it in the 68% growth in US commercial if you do apples to apples following on 7 70% growth last quart or 71% if you do apples to apples uh taking out a smack Revenue um you see it in the deal uh deal growth in the US uh growing from 70 to 136 in a year um you see it in the general enthusiasm uh around our products especially in commercial but also in government which has begun to re accelerate um you see it in general in our our customer growth in uscom which grew 69% uh and again we are growing these numbers while maintaining a rule of 40 score of 57 which basically means we're doing the impossible we are growing the company while while investing in our cor or software development uh we are winning in the US.
we are the only company in America the only really relevant Market that uh will allow you to do useful things with large language models uh and that is what's generating 68% growth in US Comm again with a nent Salesforce doing it in a way that is not kind of Playbook specific thin technology it barely works and you have a Salesforce but with 10 years of Ip that presupposed llms before llms existed you see the same thing in the government uh Shia and others will talk about it but you know our our our mission footprint whether in Ukraine Israel or in the United States government is uh stunning uh there is basically no conflict in the world that is not in not that where Western allies are involved and the battlefields involved and the stakes are life and death where paler is not the first call.
this is the sixth quarter of profitability the sixth quarter of profitability I Dare remind people that there was a time when no one thought we'd be profitable when no one thought we could cck commercial where uh uh where Revenue uh per person was called into question that also grew roughly 26% year on year year Revenue per person generated at paler.
I currently I don't believe we have competitors so I don't believe in the US commercial Market we have competition I don't believe in the US government Market we have competition I don't I think that's the reason Ukraine and Israel bought our product uh we are differentiated because in order to actually make AI work you need an antology no one has an antology to Sha's point you have a lot of people running around saying the data isn't ready of course it's not ready because they don't have Foundry if you have Foundry and and the ontology it is ready if you have Foundry the ont our ontology and Apollo you can actually work at the edge if you don't you can't and you know it's outside of America there's still we would still have to convince people of this inside of America we're not really convincing people that we have the only thing that works we're showing up we're showing it working and we're saying this is what it costs and it's working really well but I I I currently I don't believe we have competition we have a lot of people who are like the paler of Iowa or the paler of Harvard or the paler of Uruguay but they're not paler and it's going to take a long time to actually build what we have because you'd have to actually understand what is special about the about about the the software infrastructure of having the combination of Apollo Foundry and the and the ontology and then you would have have to build on top of it so that you can actually do these handoff functions uh with large language models and um luckily for us there is not a consensus at the investor level VC level or among analysts that we have the only thing that works because and that means there's just going to be very little invest investment in coping and doing what we do and investment in what we do outside of America be hard to do anyway because the ecosystem a term I don't particularly like to get this done is in America so you would have to do this in Valley and Silicon Valley is focused on to's point the wrong things.
the fact that we that I take you know I think the central risk to Palante here and America and the world is uh a regressive way of thinking that is corrupting and corroding our institutions that calls itself Progressive but actually and is called woke but is actually a form of a thin Pagan religion that is a real danger to our society and it is a real danger to Pal here if we allow if we don't discuss these things.
The reason we have by far the best product offering in the world is because we have by far the best alignment around how to build software what it means to build software full alignment with our customers a view that some the Western way of living is superior and therefore it should be supported by the best products people at this table have been in the trenches for over a decade each why do they stay why do they fight why do we come and do these calls why are we fighting for individual investors why do why why are we act why do we actually care about Revenue growth in quarter I mean honestly everyone at this table has a lot of money it's like we care and we fight for these things because we believe we are fighting for a stronger better less discriminatory wealthier more open and better Society by providing the friends of the West us industry US Government our allies with by far Superior Products and that's by the way how we you would be and that's how we align with our customers by the way I have customers who disagree with me but they sure as hell know I'm telling them the truth about what we believe and probably more important ly they know we're not s sophists they know we believe in things uh and that's why we fight for this culture and that's why we fight for our products and that's why our products are growing again you can repeat all these numbers over and over again how do you get 68% growth in uscom with the 57 rule of 40 how do you uh D nearly double your customer count your deal count your customer count all these numbers you do it by having full alignment and the best products in the world or you can do it by having weird things that barely work and trying to manipulate clients into buying your product until they realize it barely works because it's thin and of no value and that's just not how we roll at pound here so it has been really and by the way on the last note how do we have the best investors in the world especially individual investors why do why why do they stick with us when times were hard why do why why do they fight for paler why do they every time someone writes something in name paler gone Maga doesn't have a product paler doesn't have margins I'm sure this quarter paler growth is decelerating despite the fact it's obviously me we're obviously crushing it in in America a paler paler is too crazy paler will never be profitable paler can't IPO paler paler is too weird and odd to produce something that will be disruptive we knew it was the people who out out on the front fighting against that BS fighting against lazy inept uh discriminatory in the sense that that is ignorance uh uh people maligning paler do it in great part because they believe that we are fighting for them and we are and we're fighting for ourselves and that's why we have such a great company.
I didn't see the 26% Revenue per employee one on the slide so that was nice to learn um and uh you know they kept talking about the expansion and how certain things aren't factored into their ndr so I think we can expect their ndr percentage to continue to accelerate as those new customers become customers.
for me I pulled up the chart so you guys can see like that the stock price action I don't really follow it to me it's very simple and they've beat Revenue they've beat EPS they've improved adjusted operating margin they've improved uh the net dollar retention which I wanted them to improve they've improved the customer count significantly and they've raised their guidance so they've checked all my boxes and I think overall it's a terrific quarter when Dan said it I couldn't agree more so for me I'm a happy camper as a long-term investor.
paler is amazing it will become a staple it's one of those you're just talking short-term technicals I understand yeah it has nothing to do with how great the company is.
everything is moving along the thesis and the stock the or the company itself in the business model is still misunderstood by institutional investors.
the overall customer growth slide that was the the that was the one the big beat that I was shocked about uh slide 20 which was the commercial count growth that that is wild that's C wild yeah I mean that that's quarter of quarter that 19% 19% quarter for quarter that's insane.
the other thing that's so unique is just their business and pricing model they don't you don't not everyone in the company gets palente tier right from day one they're starting with certain departments and certain problems as it keeps building guess what you need more CPU usage you need more licenses so that's what's exciting is the 554 and you think about what they're going to spend when they're using palente tier for a majority of their their company.
net dollar retention Grew From 108 to 111 every single uh met RC grew you know operating margin now is 36% it keeps growing and growing and growing very uh good good indicators long term 34 last quarter 108 last quarter amazing.
Rule of 40 I mean look at slide 15 uh you know they're they're they're not you know the highest in the world but it's the trajectory you want to look at that's what you want to pay attention to um I guess I'm most excited about these earnings is just that it's still giving us time to keep piling in um because they're steady growing and and uh what was the Comm the overall customer growth slide that was the the that was the one the big beat that I was shocked about uh slide 20 which was the commercial count growth that that is wild that's C wild yeah I mean that that's quarter of quarter that 19% 19% quarter for quarter that's insane.
that revenue of $634 million an increase of 21% year-over-year driven by the momentum of AIP and our continued strong performance in US commercial our results also highlight the growing strength of our US Government business and our enduring Mission critical work the continued interest in AI IP is loud and clear in the conversations I'm having across our customer base we've shared our plans to capture the market with AIP and our results show that our strategy is not only succeeding it is accelerating.
first quarter us commercial Revenue grew 40% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to 150 million surpassing International commercial revenue for the first time excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts first quarter us commercial Revenue grew 68% year-over-year and 22% sequentially AIP is driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the US in the first quarter we booked 286 million of us commercial tcv representing 131% growth year-over-year total manying deal value in our us Commercial Business grew 74% year-over-year and 14% sequentially our us commercial customer count created 262 customers reflecting 69% growth year-over-year and 19% growth sequentially.
we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of got profitability generating a record 106 million of G net income in the first quarter we also delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of Gap operating profit generating a record 81 million of Gap operating income in the quarter adjusted operating margin expanded to 36% in the first quarter continuing to highlight the strong unit economics of our business the revenue and profitability outperformance drove a three-point sequential increase to a rule of 40 score from 54 in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 57 in the first quarter of 2024 this was the third consecutive quarter of an expanding rule of 40 score.
we generated 634 million in Revenue in the first quarter up 21% year-over-year and 4% sequentially exceeding the high end of our prior guidance excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts first quarter Revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 4% sequentially customer count grew 42% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to 554 customers revenue from our largest customers continues to expand first quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 9% year-over-year to 55 million per customer.
we ended the first quarter with 4.1 billion in total remaining deal value an increase of 22% year-over-year and 6% sequentially and 1.3 billion in remaining performance obligations an increase of 39% year-over-year and 5% sequentially as a reminder RPO is primarily comprised of our Commercial Business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall Beyond termination for convenience Clauses both of which are common in most of our government business.
we generated first quarter Gap net income of 106 million representing a 17% margin our six consecutive quarter of Gap profitability first quarter adjusted earnings per share was 8 cents and GAP earnings per share was 4 cents additionally our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 57% in the first quarter a three-point increase to our rule 40 score from the prior quarter we will continue to strive to maintain this exceptional balance of top and bottom line performance turning to our cash flow in the first quarter we generated 130 million in cash from operations and 149 million and adjusted free cash flow representing margin of 20 and 23% respectively in q1 we also repurchased approximately half million shares as part of our share repurchase program as to the end of the quarter we have approximately 990 million remaining of the original authorization we ended the quarter with 3.9 billion in cash cash equivalence and short-term US Treasury Securities you retain access to additional liquidity of up to 500 million through our evolving credit facility which remains entirely undrawn.
for full year 2024 we're raising our Revenue guidance to between 2.67 s and 2 . 689 billion we are raising our us commercial Revenue guidance to an excess of 661 million representing a growth rate of at least 45% we are raising our adjusted income for operations guidance to between 868 and 880 million we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of between 800 million and 1 billion and we continue to expect Gap operating income and net income in each quarter of this year.

Joining me on today's call are Alex karp chief executive officer, sham SAR Chief technology officer, Dave Glazer Chief Financial Officer and Ryan Taylor chief Revenue officer and chief legal officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call. We started the year exceedingly strong with revenue of $634 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year driven by the momentum of AIP and our continued strong performance in US commercial. Our results also highlight the growing strength of our US Government business and our enduring Mission critical work. The continued interest in AI IP is loud and clear in the conversations I'm having across our customer base. We've shared our plans to capture the market with AIP and our results show that our strategy is not only succeeding, it is accelerating. While still early days our focus is on building the foundations of a long-term business. We intend to relentlessly continue Landing new customers and subsequently expanding those engagements as our products gain traction and have meaningful impact within Enterprises. Not only are we increasing the volume of new customers but I'm pleased with our ability to grow these new customers as well. With regards to Landing new customers we've sustained our high volume of boot camps with over 9915 organizations participating to date. To meet inbound demand we are also seeing substantial deal cycle compression. As one example a leading utility company signed a seven fig deal just 5 days after completing a boot camp. Another customer immediately signed a paid engagement after just one day of their multi-day boot camp and then converted to a seven figure Deal 3 weeks later. We expect the favorable unit economics and higher throughput to continue to accelerate our business. Us commercial is where we're seeing the greatest transformation. While q1 is seasonally our slowest quarter AIP adoption by new and existing customers helped Drive notable growth in customer acquisition and revenue in our us Commercial Business. In q1 we added 41 net new customers in US commercial. Our customer count increased 69% year-over-year and 19% quarter over quarter compared to 8% quarter over quarter growth in q1 2023. Excluding strategic Investments our us commercial Revenue soared by 68% year-over-year and 22% quarter over quarter. New customers span a variety of Industries as aip's applications seem endless from the largest independent Bottling Company in the US to a leading energy and infrastructure company and a multinational airline in q1 our us Commercial Business had customers from 56 of the 74 GX Industries. As we're Landing new customers we're also seeing those customers expanding their work with us across my conversations with customers I'm seen the recurring theme of them asking me how they can do more faster with Enterprise Transformations driven by AIP. We're showing them how they can move their AI strategy Beyond chat. Existing customers such as Los Cleveland Clinic and General Mills among others are realizing the extensive possibilities of AIP within their own Enterprises and increasing their scope accordingly. Lowe's accelerated its engagement from a starting point of no AI to utilizing production level AI for over 1,000 customer service agents resulting in a 75% reduction in overdue tasks. As one of its directors noted quote we achieved this in just four months and onboarded a thousand users within 3 weeks of rollout. Cleveland Clinic committed to a 10-year expansion deal to deploy more broadly across its hospitals. General Mills expanded the scope of its work further last quarter as its senior director noted quote we're saving on average about $14 million annually and it's really only deployed to part of our Network as we speak. We're seeing rapid expansions within key customer accounts for example a Fortune 500 Industrials company signed a three-year expansion deal which increased the annual revenue run rate of our work with them nearly fivefold compared to our initial engagement with them in 20 22 a Fortune 100 retail company started a pilot in Q2 2023 expanded to a use case conversion in August then expanded its work to a $12 million ACV Enterprise engagement last quarter. These are just a few examples more and more customers are expanding their work with us due to AIP and the incredible traction our software has within their organizations. Turning to our US Government business our Revenue continued to accelerate at last quarter increasing 8% quarter over quarter versus 3% quarter over quarter in Q4 with our products every day having critical impact on current world events we see continued demand for Mission manager and positive reception to first breakfast last quarter we were honored the US Army awarded pounder over $178 million to be the sole prime contractor to build a Next Generation targeting node under the program this marks the first time that a software company has won a prime contract for a hardware system and exemplifies pounder's position as the software Prime opening the door to vast New Opportunities. It is with immense reverence that we approach building and maturing our revolutionary capabilities for our war fighters. In our international government business We are continuing to ramp up the critical work for delivery of the UK NHS Federated data platform as well as providing defense capabilities to Allied Partners around the world. Looking at our business and its impact broadly I'm invigorated about the year ahead. We have never had more conviction about AIP and the power of our software as well as our continued efforts supporting the most critical missions around the globe. I'll now turn it over to Sham thanks Ryan the clear signal from AIP boot camps is that AI is for Builders so many anecdotes and quotes from customers all reinforcing the same point they are getting more done in a day or two in AIP than in a quarter or two without. We have pioneered the approach to getting Beyond chat and unlocking the value of llms in the Enterprise taking inherently unstructured inputs that are flying around the Enterprise be it emails slacks PDFs images comments audio and turning them into structured actions and outputs taking an email from a customer requesting a different product mix and turning it into an actual inventory allocation in the Erp system of record taking a health claims denial and programmatically generating the documentation and supporting evidence from the clinical records and contracts automating PNC insurance claims processing and even in government using Vision models to narrow candidate products driving foodborn outbreaks at CDC. And we have started rolling out build with AIP a series of developer and Builder oriented tutorials and reference implementations that enable Builders to ramp quickly on The Primitives and power of AIP and practical examples that unlock every employee at every customer. Our growth is being driven by the incredible dynamism of the US commercial market and we believe the US government will follow with this momentum. We have launched Builder boot camps in the US government. The US Army recently issued a memo identifying two paler systems aidp and army Vantage as is amongst the five total platforms approved for Builders. The US Army's artificial intelligence integration Center a2c at Carnegie melon leverages these platforms for half of their active projects and recently built an application for the 18th Airborne Corp with osdk. Our DOD customer recently hosted a hackathon showing the value of the open joint all domain command and control or Jad C2 SDK that we have been pioneering. One participant commented nominating targets with Gia assist turns a six our workflow into 10 seconds. We continue to invest in Mission manager and will be extending it to the edge with our Edge X infrastructure in US Government. Now customers can use their Cloud instance as an integrated development environment for Edge platforms centrally build test and continuously deploy and manage multivendor Big 10 Edge ecosystems. It covers everything from streaming pipelines osdk backed applications native Gotham applications and third party apps. We are excited with our team of Rockstar Partners to deliver on the US Army's Titan program. This marks the first time a software company has won a hardware contract firmly establishing the role of the software Prime. We believe the core of this software Target workbench will be critical in every cockpit every vehicle and every ship. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the eye-watering work of our service members and our allies in meeting the moment defending against the mass of Iran and attack on Israel. The Gotham investments in Jad C2 performed excellently and we were building even more even even faster. I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers thanks sham q1 was a strong start to the year Revenue growth accelerated to 21% year-over-year in the first quarter driven by momentum in AIP and our us Commercial Business and a reacceleration in our US Government business. We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of got profitability generating a record 106 million of G net income in the first quarter. We also delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of Gap operating profit generating a record 81 million of Gap operating income in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 36% in the first quarter continuing to highlight the strong unit economics of our business. The revenue and profitability outperformance drove a three-point sequential increase to a rule of 40 score from 54 in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 57 in the first quarter of 2024. This was the third consecutive quarter of an expanding rule of 40 score. Turning to our Global Topline results we generated 634 million in Revenue in the first quarter up 21% year-over-year and 4% sequentially exceeding the high end of our prior guidance excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts. First quarter Revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Customer count grew 42% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to 554 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand first quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 9% year-over-year to 55 million per customer. Now moving to our commercial segment first quarter of commercial Revenue Drew 27% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to 299 million excluding impact from strategic commercial contracts. First quarter commercial Revenue grew 36% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We had a very strong quarter of commercial bookings. First quarter commercial TC booked was 505 million representing 187% growth year-over-year. Our us Commercial Business continues to see unprecedented demand driven by momentum from AIP. First quarter us commercial Revenue grew 40% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to 150 million surpassing International commercial revenue for the first time excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts. First quarter us commercial Revenue grew 68% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. AIP is driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the US. In the first quarter we booked 286 million of us commercial tcv representing 131% growth year-over-year. Total manying deal value in our us Commercial Business grew 74% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Our us commercial customer count created 262 customers reflecting 69% growth year-over-year and 19% growth sequentially. We generated 149 million in international commercial Revenue in the first quarter representing 16% growth year-over-year but a 3% sequential decline as a result of continued headwinds in Europe and the revenue catchup in Q4 that we noted last quarter. We continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and Beyond. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was 24 million in the quarter. We anticipate second quarter 2024 revenue from these customers to decline to between 7 to 9 million compared to 19 million in the second quarter of 2023. We continue to anticipate 2024 revenue from these customers to be approximately 2% of full year Revenue. Shifting to our government segment first quarter government revenue grew 16% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to 335 million. First quarter US government revenue grew 12% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to 257 million. As Ryan noted we're excited to be the sole prime contractor under the Titan program and will continue pursuing other defense opportunities. We believe we're well positioned to see growth in our US Government business over the course of 2024. First quarter international government revenue grew 33% year-over year and declined 9% sequentially to 79 million as a result of the revenue catch-up in Q4 that we noted last quarter and continued headwinds in Europe. First quarter tcv booked was 94 million up 128% year-over-year. Net dollar retention was 111% an increase of 300 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in q1 of last year. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that required in the past 12 months it does not yet fully capture the acceleration and velocity in our us Commercial Business over the past year. We ended the first quarter with 4.1 billion in total remaining deal value an increase of 22% year-over-year and 6% sequentially and 1.3 billion in remaining performance obligations an increase of 39% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. As a reminder RPO is primarily comprised of our Commercial Business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall Beyond termination for convenience Clauses both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense adjusted gross margin which excludes stock based compensation expense was 83% for the quarter. Adjusted income for operations which exclude stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was 226 million representing an adjusted operating margin of 36% and marking the sixth consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. q1 adjusted expense was 48 million up 2% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. Turning to the balance of the Year given our conviction in the US business coupled with our margin expansion we intend to boost investment in resources in the US including an AIP and specific defense opportunities. While we expect expenses to ramp starting in Q2 through the back half the year remain focused on calibrating expense growth below Revenue growth for the full year in order to continue delivering on our goals of sustained Gap profitability and GAP operating income. In the first quarter we generated Gap operating income of 81 million representing a 133% margin our fifth consecutive quarter of Gap operating income and fourth consecutive quarter of expanding Gap operating margins. We generated first quarter Gap net income of 106 million representing a 17% margin our six consecutive quarter of Gap profitability. First quarter adjusted earnings per share was 8 cents and GAP earnings per share was 4 cents. Additionally our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 57% in the first quarter a three-point increase to our rule 40 score from the prior quarter. We will continue to strive to maintain this exceptional balance of top and bottom line performance. Turning to our cash flow in the first quarter we generated 130 million in cash from operations and 149 million and adjusted free cash flow representing margin of 20 and 23% respectively. In q1 we also repurchased approximately half million shares as part of our share repurchase program as to the end of the quarter we have approximately 990 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with 3.9 billion in cash cash equivalence and short-term US Treasury Securities. You retain access to additional liquidity of up to 500 million through our evolving credit facility which remains entirely undrawn. Now turning to our outlook for Q2 2024 we expect revenue of between 649 and 653 million and adjusted income from operations of between 209 and 213 million. For full year 2024 we're raising our Revenue guidance to between 2.67 s and 2 . 689 billion. We are raising our us commercial Revenue guidance to an excess of 661 million representing a growth rate of at least 45%. We are raising our adjusted income for operations guidance to between 868 and 880 million. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of between 800 million and 1 billion and we continue to expect Gap operating income and net income in each quarter of this year.",1.0,0.9

my bull case is Microsoft okay so my range is Microsoft Salesforce so be careful for a very long time I think paler were really struggling with sales even though I'm very bullish on palente here I think for a very long time they weren't converting very well at all AIP boot camps that seems to be the solution so now my my sort of cap in my mind is expanding because I'm seeing how they're they're actually pushing those sales.
we are the only company in America the only really relevant Market that uh will allow you to do useful things with large language models uh and that is what's generating 68% growth in US Comm again with a nent Salesforce doing it in a way that is not kind of Playbook specific thin technology it barely works and you have a Salesforce but with 10 years of Ip that presupposed llms before llms existed you see the same thing in the government.",1.0,0.7
Tom Nash,MbErL8kB6u0,2024-05-06T22:11:21Z,Palantir Earnings Call - LIVE | Tom Nash,Tesla,"I'm also very very bullish on Tesla and obviously recently Tesla has been having quite a significant time so I've been using quite a lot of my spare cash there so yeah both the same boat for that haly that kind of space you're yeah it's the Eber it's the echo chamber of the Tesla poener Bulls it's good to be in the safe space it goes one of two ways of Tesla doesn't it true.
you look at Tesla it has the same type of uniqueness even whether you hate them love them or anything like that same thing with Nvidia companies that can have a sustainable culture as they grow is very unique especially in technology.
is paler providing any services to Tesla that's a cool question right so you know who said who confirmed to me this sham himself when I spoke to him because I was chatting with Sham before the the podcast we did and he was telling me about how paler is deployed in the Giga factories through the battery makers that's what I thought through Panasonic yeah yeah yeah so because they're on Panasonic so they're basically already working with Tesla on The Daily so the answer is yes to this one.",0.9,0.6
Tom Nash,MbErL8kB6u0,2024-05-06T22:11:21Z,Palantir Earnings Call - LIVE | Tom Nash,Nvidia,"this is an article he put out about Nvidia from May of 2023 in which he told you all this is going to happen the stock price was at 300 when this article came out and it's not his only work in the field so he's a modest dude but he knows what the hell he talking about.
do the smartest people want to work Nvidia paler Tesla it's extremely hard to get into those companies and um from a business standpoint my three things that I'll be watching somewhat similar to yours time I know you talked about a little bit earlier yesterday um number one they do have to I think beat Wall Street's revised uh earnings and and numbers if they don't I think they end up actually going down.
you look at Tesla it has the same type of uniqueness even whether you hate them love them or anything like that same thing with Nvidia companies that can have a sustainable culture as they grow is very unique especially in technology.
he also told you to buy paler in Nvidia about a year ago so if you listen to him you could have made look at my old YouTube channel when I wanted to be like you and dominating your Investments and laugh but in 2019 I was saying that uh Nvidia was going to be A2 trillion dollar market cap before 2029 and we're already you don't have to go all the way back there in 2023 I put an article saying n is going to go crazy when it was 300 and same for paler so uh very very credible stuff here from Dom.
it's not the Nvidia moment which is good for us because then maybe we have a chance to just keep piling in before that right.",0.9,0.7

if Microsoft pushes hard in fabric so I think there's going to be a turf war between Microsoft and paler and I think it ends with a two-headed monster but the size of each head depends on how good paler grabs real estate in that in that in that battle which is not going to be a simple one I mean paler is a great company but Microsoft fights very very harsh let's put it this way.
a lot of people are zeroing in on that too I think like Snowflake and data bricks and Amazon and Microsoft are all kind of building similar models right now so they're definitely going to feel like pressure I think to compete in that space as as time goes on but as of today they're they're pretty far out ahead of that.
you can layer in like power VI and power apps on top of it as well so it kind of gives you like a unified way to to deal with all your data Assets in in Azure and then um build apps on top of that so they they definitely have a similar architecture road map I think where the rubber hits the road is is the differences in experience and quality like I guess good comparisons are like teams versus Google meets versus you know slack Etc there's there's various degrees of quality in the execution across there and depending on what your needs are you may need a scalpel and not the the Sledge like the the dull knife you know so uh I think they're I think competition is good ultimately like it's going to open up a bigger Market as people start to like let's just imagine tomorrow every every company on the face of the Earth decides we need to stop with this old SAS 1.0 model we need to move to the 2.0 model and here are our options we've got data brecks over here we've got paler over here we've got Microsoft over here we've got Amazon over here they might not all choose paler but a hell of a lot more of them we going to choose paler than if it's the only company pitching that model and the only company that's bringing that model to Market I think you know it's like that Rising tide lifts all boats I think Fabric's ultimately good for paler and so are so are all these other companies it's just n pushing the industry towards a different architecture they don't have already.",0.9,0.1

and it wasn't until they started working with BP and several other select companies in 2016 2017 when they actually kicked off Foundry and you've seen the growth of the organization in terms of Revenue since then.",1.0,0.9

I can switch between my the models I'm using inside AIP at will I even have automatic evaluation tests that let me know which model's performing better than the other one at particular tasks and I can dynamically deploy with that configuration so like there is there are are really allowing Enterprises to extract like maximum value out of AI and that would be something I would pay really close attention to because too many of the other companies I think have their own models that they're sort of putting at the center of the commercial offering and it's the exact kind of opposite right they're like trying to lock you into that model and that platform so I think uh it's very unique and and maybe the only other people in that space might be might be companies like data bricks in the future U where they're where they're really able to offer that zero friction zero costing but I gotta go guys.",0.9,0.1

Tom Nash,YFA5XvvzcdE,2024-05-06T14:19:29Z,Palantir Investors: GET READY!,Palantir,Palante Palante Palante Palante I've not lost my mind I'm just a little bit over excited for the earnings today as I'm sure a lot of you are um look pente earnings are here it's an exciting time we're up 208% of the past year we're up 36% year to date it's fun to silence a lot of the morons who doubted the stock who doubted us as a community and it's fun to see the new trajectory of where we headed with this now to me it's very very simple what we need to do in this video is a few things number one we're going to have fun with it number two we're going to break down what the earnings should look like if paler are consistently improving and number three what metrics I'm specifically looking for as a long-term investor in this company at the end of the video we're going to do a little game I'll make a prediction where the stock is going to be right after earnings for the next couple days and I'm not going to be trading none of that you know I don't trade this stock but we'll do this so we can pull it up in a few days and roast me potentially if I was wrong or celebrate my greatness if I was right so you know over the past four years I have slowly become the face of the stock on YouTube and social media somewhat people call me the paler guy and by people I mean me and my mom I'm just kidding um but I am you know a serious investor in this company of most of of my portfolio is in it I've been talking about it since the DPO and I consider myself a long-term bull of paler uh last quarter I was really impressed with the results this quarter what I'm looking for is mainly the ability of the company to stay consistent when I see a basketball player give a really good game what the next question becomes for me is can this guy do this every single day can he come in every game and play like that and that's the question paler we had a few good quarters last quarter was phenomenal so the question is can palen remain consistent that's question number one because if they will you know show us that they can remain consistent at this level of greatness that's a huge milestone for this company now last quarter they guided for 612 to 66 million of Revenue in this quarter now already the estimation the estimates on the market are for 16 sorry 617 not 16 617 so the estimates we have have in the market right now for 6177 million are already above the original guidance of the company so what they have to beat today is not their guidance is the elevated estimates so when paler beats today which I'm sure they will they're going to beat the estimates that are above their guidance so that's a you know that's part of the problems of being a great company people expect a lot from you they put a lot on your shoulders and that's part of the process they got to they got to be able to deliver despite the the high barrier now Q4 the company gave us really impressive numbers us commercial growth was phenomenal we all know this what I'm paying attention this time is I want to see if the customer count keeps growing at these levels last quarter we had 35% increase in customer count that is insane if they can maintain that level of growth on the customer count I know that it will later be translated to more revenues there's always a lag between customer increase and revenue increase which allows me more time time to buy the stock cheap before everybody wakes up to the fact that their revenues are growing way faster than they give it credit and one more thing I'm going to be paying attention to is the top 20 clients now pante is very unique in this sense their top 20 clients generate about half the business so I want to see a massive growth in the spend per client on those top 20 clients last quarter they gave us 55 million which was an increase from 49 million just a year before that if we get 60 here I'm going to be happy now one point where I'm going to see Improvement I hope this quarter is the net dollar retention they were at 108% in the previous quarter that is good but not great I would like to see 110 and above on the net dollar retention now remaining deal value was 3.9 billion the remaining performance obligations was 1.2 billion so that's 5.1 billion in actual deals that they had to perform and money that basically was just a question of time if they can grow that number to 5.3 5.4 maybe that's going to be very impressive to me now another thing I'm paying attention to and it's not the X's and O's of the EPs and the revenue is actually the boot camps now last year in 2023 palente ran 500 boot camps I want to see at least 800 boot camps in 2024 although I'm sure the number will be much much higher so for me if I'm expecting 800 200 in this quarter will be good enough anything about 200 boot camps will be really really good for me now what I want to explain to you guys is that there's a lag in the amount of customers that the company acquires and the revenues that they post especially with a company like paler that uses kind of a freey model where people just come into the platform it becomes sticky and they they convert to paying customers and they they convert to Super paying customers that Cycle takes a year so what I'm paying attention to and I suggest you do as well is the percentage of customer growth is the percentage of growth in the boot camps this is where the money is you can't see it in Revenue yet now the Oracle deal is going to be massive it's not yet priced in by the market for some reason it's not going to appear on the revenues obviously it's too soon it just happened but that's another thing that completely gets missed by very smart people that completely discount the Oracle deal now on top of it we're seeing the world basically going up in Flames the Middle East there's a lot of craziness in this world and to me I'm looking at this company and I'm saying guys even if the world goes to crap this is a company that has 50% of its business benefiting from the world going to crap so if things hit the fan if you know what I mean piler is not going to be destroyed like some other companies are completely dependent on consumer on consumer on retail that's a massive insurance policy for a company like pal they got at least a billion billion point2 from the government no matter how bad things get no other company in the market can can say that and also have a billion coming from commercial you know we have you know the do contractors they do great but they have a ceiling this company has all the insane upside of the AIP and the business that they got going on on the commercial side with an absolute U insurance policy on the government side that which completely is insane to me to think that a company like this exists on top of it they're completely agnostic to interest rates everybody talks about when joh Paul will drop rates these guys have no debt which is a fee that only a few companies can be proud of there's not a lot of companies out there that don't have leverage even Tesla has a little bit of it but paler literally has zero and the most important part to explain here is that look guys what pan is building here is essentially this software that's going to operate all these llms all these AIS you got Nvidia building the infrastructure that's great but you have another company which is called Panet here who essentially building the operating system now that operating system is where the money is not in the llms if you haven't noticed the llms have been completely commoditized there is a thousand of them literally out there anybody can build one llms are not that special anymore I think where the strength is is in the hardware Nvidia and the operating system like AIP this is where the money is same example same analysis like with the gold rush the people who made the most amount of money were the people who were selling the shovels not the people digging for gold so at the end of the day we're looking at a company that's still in its diapers as far as how much of potential it has to benefit the AI boom cycle it also has an insurance policy if things go bad economically and it's selling at a massive discount yes I just said it I think this company is selling at a massive discount it doesn't mean it's not going to be volatile now speaking about short-term volatility in fact I think that these earnings might be a little bit different than what most people expect now look there's a lot of haters out there who are praying for paler to fall after earnings what you guys don't understand your haters is that for us it's a good thing when that happens we get to pick up shares for the cheap which you have done many many times before so I pray with you the stock price will fall so we can improve our cost bases however I don't think it's going to happen what I think will happen is paler will report good results they will show more Improvement more consistency it's going to push a lot of people back into the stock who are on the sidelines and it's going to trigger a lot of formo and it's basically create an avalanche of people basically piling in into the stock NOW obviously at some point it will correct which every formal fuel kind of a spike always does and that's fine you know what we're going to be doing we're going to be dcing into the stock non-stop buying it up accumulating and waiting for the next earnings.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,6nuayzOxjbQ,2024-05-05T15:16:24Z,Warren Buffett Just Did The UNTHINKABLE,Apple,okay Warren Buffett just sold 13% of his entire Apple holding that's insane what the hell is going on now last quarter when he sold 1% of his holding we were like okay he's just trimming but at 133% is that really just trimming is this the end of the Warren Buffett Apple love affair or is there something else here that has nothing to do with apple some of it has to do with apple some of it does not now look it's still waren Buffett's biggest holding don't get me wrong 140 billion dollar that thing is a behemoth why sell Apple instead of any of the other slew of stocks he has in his portfolio why specifically Apple I'll show in this video it's not going to be as simple as apple bad apple good as anything in investing it's going to be highly nuance and this video is not for you to on Apple or to say that apple is the best thing since slice bread it's probably the more nuanced answer that you'll hear about why this thing happened so what exactly is Warren Buffett doing with his Apple investment that's the question in everybody's mind bir hathway dumps about 133% of their Apple shares and that's a huge huge question what exactly is going on now Warr Buffett already sold a little bit of Apple in the previous quarter but that was about 1% of his investment this time it's 133% so is Warren Buffett losing trust in the company is he not seeing Apple growing anymore what's going on here now as we take a look here on stock MVP on the Apple stock chart over the past three months the stock is down 2% over the past year the stock is up slightly 9 and a half% so nothing crazy the question is did he sell Apple because it's a bad company or did they have an excuse a reason that has nothing to do with Apple's qualities You see this is still Buffett's biggest holding by far apple is currently $140 billion do of Apple stock is being held by bathway and I don't think he's going to dump those shares why sell Apple stock right that has nothing to do with apple but there are issues here that have to do with apple and I'll show you one slide on the screen that's going to make it very obvious why apple and not anything else but it doesn't mean that he's going to dump Apple going forward in fact he was asked about this and he says that you know he's predicting that Apple will be his number one holding even in 2024 so they're not planning to liquidate the position nothing has changed fundamentally for this stock at least for birkshire hathway and overall the company looks terrific $380 billion of Revenue hundred billion of income over the past 5 years the income is up 75% revenue is up 47% free cash flow is up 70% so everything here looks good it's a solid business it is an extremely solid business but there's two glaring issues here that made Warren Buffett sell the stock even though it's a great company and even though he will plan to keep a lot of it still on his books but this is the reason he chose this stock and not anything else to generate that liquidity number one the growth rate has been slowing down over the past year the growth rate is down by 1% so they're not growing as fast as their competitors which I'll show you in a second the other thing here if you look at forward PE and current PE they're 28 27.6 so they're trading at 28p forward and current which again is a little bit on the high side compared to their competitors which are performing better in growth and in Outlook allow me to show you what I'm talking about now these are the comparables I want you to pay attention to if you look at these three companies right now let me show you something you have revenues for meta growing at 21% of the past year Revenue for Google are growing at 11.7% over the past year apple is down so apple is not growing as fast as the other guys in fact it's slowing down if you look at operating income up 92% up 29% up 5% for Apple too slow net income up 113% 40% for Apple 6.4% slowing down not the same speed as the competitors free cash flow very similar story 180% 11% 4% so they're dead last in every single category here now if we scroll down here and we take a look at these numbers right here what you'll notice is a few things on the price to sales ratio the most expensive company we have here is meta with e now at 6.5 you can buy Google Now at 7.4 will you buy Apple now if apple is the third best out of these three as far as growth as far as cash flow as far as the way the business is kind of projecting forward for the next 5 years and they don't really have an AI play yet right so if they're trading at 7.4 and you can get you know you can get Google at 6.5 which one would you choose here same with PE look Google is trading at 22 PE forp meta at 19p and Apple at 27.6 P so they're the most expensive company of the bunch on forward PE bases they're also the most expensive on current PE ratio 25 25 28 and they're very very close to being number one they're close second in the price to sales so they're the most expensive company in the whole group as far as the ratios go and they're not that much better the profit margin is slightly better than Google's but not as good as meta and everything else they're dead last so in this case it's clear that it's a good business but it is currently being mispriced it's a little bit on the topheavy side compared to Google compared to meta so as a capital allocator Warren Buffett is saying look we need to trim this so the bottom line here is very simple Warren Buffett still loves Apple the fundamentals are solid but it's current rate of growth until they come up with a new plan to integrate AI into their business at this price level it's trading very very high at a premium and if I'm War Buffett and I already have four and a half times of profit on my investment this is the place where I'm going to trim off some fat and this is the perfect place to do it does it mean that apple is over and it's finished and it's on the way down no that's not what it means it means that this is the most appropriate PR for bar haway to trim at this position where they have lots of gains and it's trading at a crazy premium and it's currently not doing that great compared to its competitors comparables,1.0,0.1

Tom Nash,eEWjaIyKRg8,2024-05-02T15:35:59Z,MIND-BLOWING News Just Hit The Stock Market!,The Federal Reserve,what the FED said what the FED didn't say how the market reacted and how the market is going to look like for the next few months based on what we saw yesterday the fed's job in this whole thing is to prevent that from happen but do not make the economy go Kaboom in the process basically stop inflation without destroying the economy that's the Mandate of the FED now in June 2022 just a couple years ago we had 9% inflation that's bad the FED increase rates they slowed the money printer and it worked what a lot of people feared before the FED meeting yesterday was for the FED to say well you know guys we've been waiting for for a long time since October of 2023 for these interest rates elevated interest rates we expected the FED to come out yesterday and say we had enough of this it's time to start raising rates again because this is not working but as the F came out the pal speech came out and it was a little bit more relaxing than we expected basically him saying hey guys it's not as bad as the same we're just going to wait and see we're not going to raise interest anytime soon when everybody heard that they kind of went from this position of prepping for a punch to to exhaling and relaxing so that's why you've seen stocks bounce back up a little bit what I'm going to do in this video is talk about what Paul said number one what Paul said is that inflation is eased substantially since of you know June of 2022 pretty much but it's still too high 3 and a half% is just too high our goal is 2% we're not there yet that's why we're not changing the rate we're not reducing the rate and that was obvious everybody knew that the FED is not going to reduce rates he also said there's no progress in inflation reduction in the last few months meths in the sorry for that in the last few months you can hear I'm still sick and it's also a factual statement he did also mention that the economy spending of consumers and jobs are great now that's his way of letting you guys know that he's not under pressure to cut rates because cutting interest rates is putting gasoline putting fuel into the economy you know if the economy is running at a quick Pace there's no need for that so he's basically telling you guys hey I got time I'm not under any pressure to cut rates because the economy is doing fine even at high interest rates and that's also a really good point it just means that we might see higher interest rates for longer now he also said that we're not going to reduce rates until we are 100% sure that inflation isn't coming back up like it did in the late '70s and it also said it will take longer than your expecting so don't think it's going to be fast number five he said that rate increase in 2024 are unlikely that's super important he basically said look guys the fact that we're willing to wait doesn't mean we're going to increase rates in 2024 something really crazy needs to happen for us to increase in 2024 we just plan to keep it as is for longer until we're sure that inflation is coming down so inflation will tell us the story if inflation goes absolutely crazy we might raise but that's not the case right now with three and a half inflation in this scenario even if inflation stays sticky we're not going to raise rates in 2024 so that takes a lot of the risk out of the equation right He also talked about rate cuts and he said look there's two scenarios in which we will cut rates in 2024 one of them does not include lowering inflation and that's important um another thing he mentioned is that the a soft Landing is not impossible and at this point we already know it's not we we're seeing it playing out he's saying guys look we went from June 2022 to June 2023 from 9% to 3% inflation and with high interest rates with extremely restrictive monetary policy without economy crashing economy stay steady I mean employment is great the economy is great so why not go from 3 and a half% to 2% without crashing the economy I mean why do you all assume that the soft Landing is not possible right he's kind of saying look guys we can do it we've we've done it so far we're going to keep doing it he also said very important he said my forecast not my Tom Nash John PA I'm quoting him my forecast is that we will see progress this year in inflation basically he's saying that if things go to plan they do plan to rate reduce this year of course he also said that this forecast is subject to reality and reality might slap it in the face you know who's who knows He was asked about the potential of stagflation in the US stagflation means High inflation high unemployment especially bad economy bad inflation at the same time he laughed it off he said that's impossible given what we have right now we have H GDP numbers we have low unemployment and 3 and a half% inflation which is historically low maybe not 2% but it's not very very high so to call it stationary just Preposterous and he also said that the FED will not accept a reality when you know when we're at 3% inflation is normal 3% inflation is not going to be normal 2% is the normal and they're not going to just accept it and reduce rates at 3% just saying okay let's just live with 3% uh he also was asked about the election year and he said look it doesn't play any role in our decision- making we we don't play the the politics game um in his specific case it's actually true because he already got reappointed so he's not trying to get reappointed by this Administration or the next one so he's done He also mentioned that shelter inflation is a very lagging indicator and that's holding up the CPI which basically means that you know people renew their leases and they they buy new homes once per year once every five years so it's going to take time for you know housing to catch up and that's a fair statement the one thing he mentioned and I haven't heard a lot of talk about it because everybody's focused on the interest rates the interest rates how many Cuts uh increases in the midst of this whole discussion about interest rates he actually dropped a massive bombshell and he said look guys um forget about the interest as of June the rate of reduction in our balance sheet is going to slow down significantly the FED basically has a money printer and that money printer is how much money they are putting in the system by purchasing mortgage back Securities and treasuries the FED has set on9 trillion of these assets which means they pumped a lot of money into the system back in June of 2022 they've reduced it significantly by the way to $7.4 trillion right now the way they've done it so far is they basically let it run off so we're talking about $35 billion of mortgage back Securities and 60 billion of treasuries every single month that expired and would not renewed by the Fed the first time ever since this whole thing started back in June of 2022 that the FED is slowing down the rate of runoff on the balance sheet that's huge Overall what I heard from joh pal was doish and it was a little bit Rosier than reality that's okay he's a Salesman we will have time as the FED before we push rates down because we don't want a 1978 79 scenario where interest rates drops everybody relaxs and then spikes back up and screws everything up so they have the leeway of sitting on these rates and letting things play out because of the strength of the economy and if you combine that with the fact that as of June of 2024 the FED is going to be pumping more money into the system through the balance sheet we're looking at a little bit more D scenario than what we thought thought a day before which is why you're seeing markets right now act upwards.,0.7,0.3
Tom Nash,NxBo-1jcOTE,2024-04-28T21:56:26Z,This Is Huge News for Tesla Stock Investors,Tesla,"well this is a level of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we haven't seen in a long ass time and I don't care if this video gets demonetized cuz this is absolutely insane so Tesla goes up 20% after earnings and that doesn't sit well with the mainstream media bosses that have to put out a hit piece that looks like a objective story so they run a story that's titled literally former Tesla President says Core Business of Tesla is weak now I saw I like I got to see this which former Tesla president is saying that so they're bringing a guy who is the current board member of General Motors and a vice president of Cruz which is also a GM business to talk about what seems to be a 7 minute 41 second commercial of gm/ hitpiece on Tesla without properly disclosing that this guy is actually a GM Affiliated person and hasn't served a Tesla role since 2018. This level of insanity I haven't seen in a long time which makes me think of how desperate mainstream media has gotten in trying to bring down Tesla a dvx venture CEO and a former uh Tesla president good morning to you good morning uh GM did a a triple beat and they are getting through their production issues and now ramping EVS which I think creates demand challenges for Tesla because there's so many uh now EV Alternatives coming to Market uh and so I think they are having to answer the pressure to have lower cost EVS right at the same time they're trying to move the story to autonomy and uh and the longer term yeah I think there's a little bit of hey look over here when the core business is weak let's let's uh recast a different story and I think there's a little bit of that going on for sure uh because their Core Business is weak look I'm not going to sit here and say that Tesla is perfect that Tesla has had the most incredibl quarter they're not they didn't have a good quarter I think they had a brilliant earnings call I think the future is extremely bright but guys and I'm talking about the mainstream media here if you're going to run a hitpiece on Tesla at least let's disclose let's let's call it for what it is so the headline is former Tesla employee sorry former Tesla president Core Business of Tesla is weak cool they talk the entire time 7 Minutes 41 seconds they don't mention that he's a GM board member and he's the vice chairman of Cruz which is a GM subsidiary he's a direct competitor of Tesla literally with Cruz although I wouldn't really call Cruz a competitor with all due respect they don't say a word about that they don't say anything about him not being in Tesla since 2018 however they do put up a slide in a 7even minute piece 7 minutes and 41 seconds to be exact they put out a freaking slide for 3 seconds talking about hey he is a GM board member and a cruise Vice chairman for three freaking seconds on the screen out of an 8 minute clip without saying a word about it and by the way that's another little detail that we need to be aware of that slide ran for 11 seconds only the first eight seconds were the fact that he's a Tesla former president and the latter three seconds was the GM stuff so they literally put this thing like a drug disclaimer at the bottom of the screen so you guys don't catch it unbelievable there are already two companies that are doing driverless uh driverless cars uh and so there's there's a race where two are already out there right uh and Tesla they can get there would be the third like we've been waiting since 2015 for the for the Finish Line to arrive and the Finish Line keeps moving out and out and out and people that work on this problem say hey we're 95% done but the last 5% is like as big as the first 95% so this man his name is John did in fact serve as the president of global sales and marketing for Tesla between the years 2015 and 2018 so he's been out of the company for six years and he goes on this piece giving a wonderful GM commercial for 8 minutes talking about how great his Silverado electric is how great The Equinox is and how great the Chevy bolt is although I can't believe that came out of a human being's mouth about the Chevy Bolt the problem is that I look at the and I say look this man has left Tesla in 2018 so since 2018 um let's look what happened since he left I'm just saying let's look at what happened with Tesla since this man left okay he left in 2018 since then the stock went up by 889 per. Revenue increased almost five times from 21 billion to 96 billion per year cars delivered went up from 245,000 vehicles to 1.8 million so it's safe to say that he was not missed at Tesla no disrespect to John I'm sure he's a very professional guy that knows what he's talking about I'm not casting any Shadow on him really I'm not this isn't about John in fact he came on CNBC I'm sure theyve asked him to and as a GM representative you know he's a board member he tried to promote GM and that's fine totally legitimate I have no issues with John but what I'm saying is I think Tesla is a company they did fine after he left so for him to talk about the Cor business of Tesla in 2024 when he left in 2018 and since he left the stock is up 900% and the sales are up five times I think is a little bit you know irrelevant you know we should focus on GM let's talk about how great his Silverado is now he says that Tesla has massive demands challenges because there's a lot of competitors out there essentially the argument we heard since 2013 about the competition is coming is making a comeback back in 2024 and I I feel like it's very intelligent thing to say right now given the amount of Chinese vehicles in the market and giving uh all this competition coming out of China sure byd but when he was actually going through the details of where he sees the competition is coming he was talking about the Chevy Equinox the Chevy Equinox I'm not even making this up a car that doesn't even sell yet I think I mean I mean GM sold 75,000 electric vehicles in 2023 so there's a good chance that all of their EV lightup isn't for saleing but look I'm just saying did this man really go on CNBC and said that GM is the competition that's coming for Tesla's lunch I I don't maybe maybe I Mis misread or misunderstand but to me it sounds a little bit like a weird weird argument to make but hey to issue we own you know we have our own opinions and I might be wrong I might be just rambling like a madman it's just my opinion I don't know what I'm talking about grandpa had me running around the city yesterday you know I may be just tired so he's saying that the core business of Tesla is weak um I'm looking at this I'm saying look John Tesla has above 50% of the US EV market right now that literally makes them the definition of a monopoly so Tesla is monopolizing the US EV market and you're saying that they have a Core Business problem uh I don't know maybe he's talking about the margins maybe does you know cut prices and now the margins are horrible GM is probably way better right so let's look GM operating margin is 7.3% Tesla is 14.3% oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] John I mean literally they have double your operating margin I mean if if I if I if I'm allowed to you know approach you as a GM representative here since you're board member for GM and vice chairman the uh your highness of of Cruz my guy they literally have 50% of the market you have % and they have double your operating margin I mean what are we really talking about here it's like me criticizing the basketball play of Michael Jordan I mean I go to the wreck once a week and I hope and I'm pretty good but for me to criticize Michael Jordan you know it's it's laughable I mean I I don't see it let's move on here so uh he was also asked about the race to autonomy and you you have to understand look he's coming from the place where he's a crw vice chairman your highness and he's talking about you know there's already two companies in the the market and Tesla will be number three when they launch their their autonomy I'm I'm going to take an issue with that argument not on a personal level but I think a little bit on the interpretive level look um FSD is already you know out there and it's been out there for a while let's be honest about it the thing is Cruz wayo I get it I get it but is it really scalable I mean we're talking about $250,000 of capital expenditure per car to put it on the road if you have to put in $250,000 copics per vehicle how much would you need to sell this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for John for it to be scalable $560,000 600 700 I mean you understand that the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is not scalable so what this is saying and I think they're right here and I'm not taking any shots at John but I'm saying look John I don't know what happened here El is telling you look if we you know insist on lighter and all this fancy crap that you're loading up on your cars that's worth $250,000 this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ain't never going to be cheap enough to become a standard which is something we all want Cruz wants this and you know Tesla wants this sure right so we have to get rid of all this crap you have on your cars we have to get rid of the maps we have to get rid of all this lighter crap all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] has to go it needs to be basically just the basic cameras in every car that we can replicate now neither wh or cruise with all the respect have that you know yes they work in certain environments on a very limited scale they're not profitable they're just not it's impossible to scale what El is doing especially if you have experienced 12.3 FSD it's nothing short of spectacular it's not perfect yet it's absolutely brilliant but it's definitely you know in the almost finished uh section so it I don't think it's fair to say Tesla will be number three I think that if anybody can finish the task and go to 100% autonomy on a scalable basis it's only Tesla with all due respect I don't think Cruz or weo are anywhere close and I think for you guys to sit there you again as a Cru representative and take shots at Elon and for saying oh you know he's going to be number three no my God he's going to be number one not to mention the fact that if you've tried 12.3 they're hella close dude they're hella close. If you're sitting there claiming the GM is the competition that's coming for Tesla's lunch I suggest you find a place to buy lunch if you're Jam",1.0,0.9

you've tried 12.3 they're hella close dude they're hella close consumers really want hybrids too when they're walking in there yeah there's a difference between between hybrids and plug-in hybrids hybrids tend to be more expensive than gas so it doesn't answer that cost issue or Price issue he'd handled quite well though when the panel tried to push the EV fud on him and when they were saying well people don't want EVS they want hybrids and he did push back he did push back I have to give him credit he did say look that's he didn't bite he basically said look N I don't think it's the case be more concerned though about the competition or more concerned about the idea even that e the Eevee adoption is not staying at PACE right I mean that's the even the sort of bigger overhang of the whole situation are people going to go to hybrids are they going to stick with combustion engines what's really happening here well consumers really want them hybrids maybe even just gas cars and he didn't buy it again and I appreciate him for that he did say look we can sell plugin hybrids which is where GM can still make money but you know that's what would GM guy would say us s percentage by 2050 will be electric do you know what their estimate was so they've that estimate's been moving around a lot between 50% and now down uh 12% and we're already at uh we're already at about 8% so I think it's a layup to go from 8 to 12 between now and 2030 this is 2050 oh yeah that's so the the team over there at CNBC came back with another brilliant survey saying well according to our data here blah blah blah blah blah and the option rate for EVS by 2050 in the United States is going to be 8 to 12% which he laughed off he basically said guys like in a very polite way he said you don't know what you're talking about it's going to be way higher than that so I'm not here to criticize John you see I give him flowers where he you know deserves to he called them on their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

that estimate's been moving around a lot between 50% and now down uh 12% and we're already at uh we're already at about 8% so I think it's a layup to go from 8 to 12 between now and 2030 this is 2050 oh yeah that's so the the team over there at CNBC came back with another brilliant survey saying well according to our data here blah blah blah blah blah and the option rate for EVS by 2050 in the United States is going to be 8 to 12% which he laughed off he basically said guys like in a very polite way he said you don't know what you're talking about it's going to be way higher than that so I'm not here to criticize John you see I give him flowers where he you know deserves to he called them on their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] multiple times about EV demand and this crap so nothing against John but if you're sitting there claiming the GM is the competition that's coming for Tesla's lunch I suggest you find a place to buy lunch if you're Jam",0.8,-0.3

Tom Nash,NxBo-1jcOTE,2024-04-28T21:56:26Z,This Is Huge News for Tesla Stock Investors,BYD,"he says that Tesla has massive demands challenges because there's a lot of competitors out there essentially the argument we heard since 2013 about the competition is coming is making a comeback back in 2024 and I I feel like it's very intelligent thing to say right now given the amount of Chinese vehicles in the market and giving uh all this competition coming out of China sure byd but when he was actually going through the details of where he sees the competition is coming he was talking about the Chevy Equinox the Chevy Equinox I'm not even making this up a car that doesn't even sell yet I think I mean I mean GM sold 75,000 electric vehicles in 2023 so there's a good chance that all of their EV lightup isn't for saleing but look I'm just saying did this man really go on CNBC and said that GM is the competition that's coming for Tesla's lunch I I don't maybe maybe I Mis misread or misunderstand but to me it sounds a little bit like a weird weird argument to make but hey to issue we own you know we have our own opinions and I might be wrong I might be just rambling like a madman it's just my opinion I don't know what I'm talking about grandpa had me running around the city yesterday you know I may be just tired so he's saying that the core business of Tesla is weak um I'm looking at this I'm saying look John Tesla has above 50% of the US EV market right now that literally makes them the definition of a monopoly so Tesla is monopolizing the US EV market and you're saying that they have a Core Business problem uh I don't know maybe he's talking about the margins maybe does you know cut prices and now the margins are horrible GM is probably way better right so let's look GM operating margin is 7.3% Tesla is 14.3% oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] John I mean literally they have double your operating margin I mean if if I if I if I'm allowed to you know approach you as a GM representative here since you're board member for GM and vice chairman the uh your highness of of Cruz my guy they literally have 50% of the market you have % and they have double your operating margin I mean what are we really talking about here it's like me criticizing the basketball play of Michael Jordan I mean I go to the wreck once a week and I hope and I'm pretty good but for me to criticize Michael Jordan you know it's it's laughable I mean I I don't see it let's move on here so uh he was also asked about the race to autonomy and you you have to understand look he's coming from the place where he's a crw vice chairman your highness and he's talking about you know there's already two companies in the the market and Tesla will be number three when they launch their their autonomy I'm I'm going to take an issue with that argument not on a personal level but I think a little bit on the interpretive level look um FSD is already you know out there and it's been out there for a while let's be honest about it the thing is Cruz wayo I get it I get it but is it really scalable I mean we're talking about $250,000 of capital expenditure per car to put it on the road if you have to put in $250,000 copics per vehicle how much would you need to sell this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for John for it to be scalable $560,000 600 700 I mean you understand that the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is not scalable so what this is saying and I think they're right here and I'm not taking any shots at John but I'm saying look John I don't know what happened here El is telling you look if we you know insist on lighter and all this fancy crap that you're loading up on your cars that's worth $250,000 this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ain't never going to be cheap enough to become a standard which is something we all want Cruz wants this and you know Tesla wants this sure right so we have to get rid of all this crap you have on your cars we have to get rid of the maps we have to get rid of all this lighter crap all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] has to go it needs to be basically just the basic cameras in every car that we can replicate now neither wh or cruise with all the respect have that you know yes they work in certain environments on a very limited scale they're not profitable they're just not it's impossible to scale what El is doing especially if you have experienced 12.3 FSD it's nothing short of spectacular it's not perfect yet it's absolutely brilliant but it's definitely you know in the almost finished uh section so it I don't think it's fair to say Tesla will be number three I think that if anybody can finish the task and go to 100% autonomy on a scalable basis it's only Tesla with all due respect I don't think Cruz or weo are anywhere close and I think for you guys to sit there you again as a Cru representative and take shots at Elon and for saying oh you know he's going to be number three no my God he's going to be number one not to mention the fact that if you've tried 12.3 they're hella close dude they're hella close consumers really want hybrids too when they're walking in there yeah there's a difference between between hybrids and plug-in hybrids hybrids tend to be more expensive than gas so it doesn't answer that cost issue or Price issue he'd handled quite well though when the panel tried to push the EV fud on him and when they were saying well people don't want EVS they want hybrids and he did push back he did push back I have to give him credit he did say look that's he didn't bite he basically said look N I don't think it's the case be more concerned though about the competition or more concerned about the idea even that e the Eevee adoption is not staying at PACE right I mean that's the even the sort of bigger overhang of the whole situation are people going to go to hybrids are they going to stick with combustion engines what's really happening here well consumers really want them hybrids maybe even just gas cars and he didn't buy it again and I appreciate him for that he did say look we can sell plugin hybrids which is where GM can still make money but you know that's what would GM guy would say us s percentage by 2050 will be electric do you know what their estimate was so they've that estimate's been moving around a lot between 50% and now down uh 12% and we're already at uh we're already at about 8% so I think it's a layup to go

Tom Nash,VwOQ7YBNcb0,2024-04-26T15:15:11Z,Billionaire Ron Baron: Tesla's Stock Will Go Up 'HUGE' Now,Tesla,"whenever I hear Ron Baron talk about Tesla I click I watch and I pay attention because this man never disappoints and this time was no different he drops a massive Bombshells he left everybody absolutely literally speechless and he dismantled crushed and absolutely annihilated every single test of fud fear uncertainty and doubt we heard over the past 6 months but I think all the Cs are going to be electric and uh I think hybrids I know you love hybrids that's not going to last either to me it's funny to see all these experts that were telling you that they're shorting Tesla before earnings the Tesla is going to go down while we in the community kept buying Tesla throughout the past few years including before earnings including before before earnings well my next play increase the hell out of my Tesla position buy into the weakness now I'm obviously not mad at the people who flip like a winner schnit from shorting Tesla to being hyper bols welcome aboard that's a n positive for the stock for the community no doubt but to you the rest of my community let it be a lesson to you about the importance of having a longterm mindset about the importance of buying at all times about dollar cost averaging instead of trying to time the market that thing never work I don't worry about short term but I do look around all the time and see everyone getting rich and I'm not poor but uh I'm not making I haven't made a lot of progress in the last three years so therefore I I think it's like a rubber band I'm going to catch up again now let's go through one by one by one and I'll share with you my opinion my insights and I'm going to add some color to what he's saying because this man look if he had some bigger balls we have to fly him on the 747 all by himself check it out can it be too big sure it's around I don't know it's around uh three and half 4 billion something like that now this man has between 3 and half and4 billion in Tesla that's his investment now I'm not going to talk about the fact that what kind of wealth level you need to get to not to know where half a billion exactly is in the sea of Investments you got that's a whole different story I mean he's not there for clicks he's not there for clout he's not pumping his little stocks like some of the other clowns we've seen on social media he's there because he got fed up with all this nonsense he keeps hearing about Tesla and all this father mainstream media he comes in to basically put everybody in order and in this interview he definitely did and he dismantled every single fud we had before the earnings now luckily for us in this community we've made a video a few times let's say 10 or 20 or 30,000 times telling you hey Tesla is a buy Tesla is a buy literally the day before earnings I'm going all in on Tesla at this price this is maximum fear this is the perfect opportunity to increase your cost basis we knew this in the community folks you are being played right now it's always the same game the overreaction that the market is having right now is by design it is designed to create create a false reality of the end of the world scenario where you all sell at the bottom and buy at the top every single time so they can make money the World War III is coming World War I is coming whatever space aliens are invading everything to get you to sell right now so they can buy at the bottom and ride it all the way up and then do it all over again wax on wax off like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Karate Kid now to the people who joining us now the people who are here for the first time or the second time this is the sort of thing I like to see a guy who's been invested in Tesla forever he's not going anywhere and is focused about the long term that's the only way to do it not this win fing flipping from shorting to hyper bulying then to shorting again forget about the stuff you can't time the market definitely not a stock like Tesla now I want you to listen to the next thing he's talking about because this is super important but I think all the Cs are going to be electric and I think this hybrid is just a sort of a holding off action so the automobile companies don't have to lose money on the electric cars but the electric cars I think is going to be all the cars 10 15 years from now and uh I think hybrids I know you love hybrids that's not going to last either they're too expensive to they're not effective enough and they're not going to be part of the mix either so going to be all electric now in this segment he makes a simple observation which I think eluded most of these so-called experts with the Excel spreadsheets showing them how Tesla is a $70 car company he's saying look guys in the future eventually every single vehicle on the road will be Electric and the reason is not because I love Elon Musk or I love Tesla is because it is the most coste effective thing to do as a vehicle operator it's the cheapest car to own maintain and operate nothing comes close not even hybrids they're hella expensive compared to electric vehicles and he talks about incentives show me the incentive I'll show you the behavior eventually so there's only one company in China That's profitable by the way that's byd you know Warren Company Buffett's company and uh uh that's a company makes a billion a quarter and our company makes $4 billion a quarter no one else makes money Ford loses so much General everyone loses money on this so what's the reason it's going to go up and when oh it's going to go up huge when and now I mean now is the bottom okay and and so what they're doing is they're going into Robo taxis well we have a small investment in Cruise uh cuz I wanted to see what they're doing you know how rich I am I'm actually a cruise investor guess what I've seen it from the inside it's not good you know what wayo they have a 200 $50,000 capex investment in every single vehicle for equipment to actually drive this thing autonomously and and weo is uh their cars are $2 $250,000 because of all of the sensors and all of the the and they're trying to take cost out and uh and for us it's software Tesla has literally zero cost to run a car it's all software it's all code it's 100% scalable there's no capex there's no equipment how can you compete with this he's literally just giving him the road map saying hey look wa Amo Cruise These are nice prototypes they look great but is this scalable on the national International level no R would you like to see how she made unbelievable advances the first 11 versions were had to be designed so that they had code every single thing that happened right and now it's all AI it was impossible and so therefore they weren't making progress for two or three years they were at a plateau and now what's happened they version 12 they have all this enormous amounts of data and now they have compute to figure out humans can't do now they have compute to figure everything out and so so now you're on the verge with autonomous driving in your cars now this clip he actually educates them on something that most Tes labl already know which is by version 11 all of this was code from v11 and above and we are currently at 12.3 beta FSD beta no code it's pure AI it's pure AI there's no code it's a living breathing autonomous AI that drives these vehicles and every day it's getting better and every day Tesla is accumulating more data and more computer than anybody else and so where do you want to go so I want to see Steve Jobs house and say okay say punch in the address and we get into the car car drives around by itself Didn't Do It All We did is punch it in drive around in the parking lot goes to the road there's traffic going both ways it looks both ways looking for an entry to get in gets an entry pulls in makes a left hand turn gets drives right behind cars in front of us there's a stop sign first car stops goes second car stops goes we pull up the stop sign car looks both directions makes a right- hand turn just drives and then all of a sudden there's a pedestrian crossing the street the the car stops to let The Pedestrian cross the street The Pedestrian I don't know if I was being set up on this but The Pedestrian waves and then the car starts going again then it goes then it pulls up then it makes a left-hand turn and then goes in front of Steve Jobs house and he tells him a story that any 12.3 user or somebody who's experienced 12 .3 who've seen FSD in real action for 40 minutes for an hour we already know this stuff but he basically told them look we went to Steve Jobs house the car literally drove itself we see The Pedestrian The Pedestrian waved off the vehicle Tesla just basically rode it like it was an absolute human being driving it everything felt human it didn't feel robotic so so what's going to happen is that I thought the idea had been that you're going to sell a lot of cars so as a result of that once they have those cars out there you'll sell autonomous driving and he said the other day that he's negotiating to sell autonomous driving for some other cars too no one has a compute no one has the data and that that's the long-term thing if Tesla's everywhere just like if they're making cars they make $7,000 in profit a car for a car L own for $35,000 minus a $7,500 uh credit and I think the point Ron Baron is making here is that look guys you are looking at this and you're saying this is not finished and I agree with you this is not finished but you think this is about 6 5% all the way through there's 35% more to go and I'm telling you having used this and having seen this from the inside it's like 95% finish so this gap between 65 and 95 is where I'm Ron Baron and me Tom Nash the retail investor idiot from YouTube are going to make a lot of money because these buffoons are going to be stuck with the Excel spreadsheet looking at a $70 price target for a car company because at this price even $170 per share we're literally just buying the best car company in the world with the highest growth potential and the highest margins we're getting FSD robotics energy all of this for absolutely free that's a cheat code and even though Ron Baron was on TV multiple times trying to educate people trying to get them to see that this is a monopolistic product this is going to own this Market it's going to license this thing at 80% gross margin it's going to make a lot more money than just selling Vehicles he's trying to tell you hey this ain't about the cars it's about the FSD that's the actual money maker and that's literally the infinite money glitch for Tesla timing but just give me the timing that's the whole game now now now it's now and those of you who can see it will make money those of you who can't won't simple as that now obviously this is going to be a volatile stock it's going to be a volatile Journey if you look at Tesa stock it has a very volatile Behavior it might be at 120 tomorrow it might be at 200 tomorrow if you try to catch the bottom and call the top or whatever you're always going to get screwed by the market and the stock because the market is literally geared to confuse use you and to get you to make wrong decisions you have to get in the right mindset you have to get in the long-term mindset even Ron Baron talks about it you have to dollar cost average at all times now if you want to get a little bit better at this you can actually dollar cost average according into weakness and strength like we do on our patreon in our Academy patreon.com we teach you how to dollar cost average little bit different than anybody else we teach you a

Tom Nash,YoRyGQIWrOY,2024-04-24T15:06:28Z,Elon Musk Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Tesla,"well my next play increase the hell out of my Tesla position buy into the weakness folks. Ilan mus just delivered one of the best earning calls we have ever seen. In fact, I'm on vacation right now and I planned on making zero videos this week but I absolutely have to talk about what happened yesterday. I was blown away, Blown Away. They gave it earnings call of the century, probably the best earnings call by El musk or Tesla or company I've seen recently. They've absolutely blew my mind. They talked about how the gross margin which was the pet peeve of all the haters recently excluding regulatory credits actually came in at 16.2 Which is higher than expectations. They've talked about mega pack reaching alltime highs in q1. They talked about how they had a bad quarter. They owned up to it. They said hey we didn't do well in q1 this is why they didn't run away from they didn't hide it but they've also said hey but the future including from starting from next quarter pretty much for the rest of this year in the next 5 to 10 years is absolutely brilliant and here's why. They gave good outlook. They've explained exactly what's going on. They gave transparency exactly what the investors was asking for and they even confirmed that there's going to be higher sales in 2024 versus 2023 so this is not going to be a bad year. Elon Musk comes out yesterday swinging saying it's not only not cancelled in fact it's accelerating we're ramping up to deliver it in 2025 absolutely insane what about supercharged Network the one thing we always forget to talk about supercharging revenue is up 25% we got almost a million FSD users on the roads right now as we speak FSD licensing is happening they're already in talks with a major OEM and that's just the start the quasm monopolistic power of Tesla and FSD is going to be the next scurve of this company. now the crazy part about this is even though that FSD is going to be bigger than the auto business and even though that the energy business probably going to be as big Optimus is going to be bigger than all of them freaking combined already we got confirmation that Optimus is doing Factory tasks and they're talking about externally releasing it by the end of next year which is a lot faster than anybody's thinking but the crazy part about this we're talking about energy we're talking about FSD the auto business Optimus once it actually is ready it's going to be more valuable than anything else Tesla has ever done combined a sentient human noid is probably the biggest thing that we have ever seen as Humanity bigger than electricity and Tesla is probably the company with the biggest lead right now on it and it's being discounted Again by the haters and the Bulls like every freaking time. I guess the conclusion here is that maxel spreadsheets were wrong so Tesla isn't a $70 car company after all.",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,D_TxIyeyAOo,2024-04-22T12:16:05Z,URGENT WARNING TO ALL INVESTORS (YOU ARE BEING PLAYED),Nvidia,"when people were told to buy Nvidia by mainstream media at $950 Nvidia is still up 180% over the past 12 months again vide the stock we started talking about back in October of 2020 we're still up 450% that one if you invested in good companies Nvidia and smci over the long hole not just jumped at the top you're you're still up a lot Nvidia great company Rockstar business $950 per share in the peak lots of people bought it now they're crying about losing 200 bucks on that share now the big question is for all you dip buyers is this a good time to buy the dip on Nvidia at 750 but I don't think that's the right move I don't think you should be buying right now at 750 and just setting your cost Bas at 50 hoping for the best when I posted my first video about NV back in October of 2020 4 years ago our community discord.gg NES joined for free our community was talking about the stock four years ago most of my community members they have a cost basis of 170 200 250 some of them have it a little bit higher but they're up between 200 and 400% on this stock because they've been buying all along this whole crazy cycle they haven't tried to time the market I think that's the right approach so the real question is isn't Nidia a good business is NVIDIA a business you want to own and if so let's talk about it so first of all Let me show the fundamentals and let's then talk about how to actually get in Nvidia without timing the market without overpaying so looking at Nvidia right here you know revenues are up 125% over the past year that's a strong performance operating expenses are only up 15% so any company can give me 125% increase in Revenue with only 15% increase in operating expenses that's good it's a scalable business operating income is up 700% cash is up 100% free cash flow is up 600% net income is up 600% total assets up 60% not bad you know even the debt is down 7% the current PE is 63 which is a little bit on the expensive side but if you look at 4ward PE it's trading at sub 25 forward PE and in my opinion forward PE is way more credible of a source of a company is true valuation than current PE so you know 24 25 PE forward not a bad deal now on the price of sales it is a little bit on the expensive side but you know if they keep growing at this space that number is going to shrink as well now let's look at Nvidia Microsoft and Google I think they're good comparables look Google's market cap is $2 trillion doll Microsoft is$ trillion and Nvidia is $2 trillion so three Behemoth massive massive Blue Chip companies so the first point of comparison is revenue growth so Revenue growth on Nvidia side is 125% versus Microsoft 11 and a half and Google's 8.7 so it's definitely growing way faster than Microsoft and Google No Doubt operating expenses are up 15% over the past year but you know if you have 125% increase in revenues that's fine H growth of operating income you know Google is up 12% Microsoft is 21% great numbers by the way but nowhere near Nvidia 680% they're growing at a insane Pace net income 23% growth on Google 23% growth or rather sorry 22% growth of Microsoft 600% for NVIDIA so the trend continues free cash flow up 15% up 133% up 600% so Nidia is exponentially you know performing better in every category cash and Investments are down on both companies it's up 100% on Nvidia as you would expect total assets are up 60% Which is higher than these two with 10 and 30 um look at the end of the day the total debt here is down a little bit 4% in Google it's up 50% Microsoft case straggling $60 billion liability but Nvidia is dropping its debt by another you know 6.7% not bad at all looking at margins Google is operating at 27 and a half% operating margin uh Microsoft is way better at 44% that's great nvidia's margin is 54% it has better margins than both of these a price to sales nowhere near look they're priced to Perfection at 31.2 but as I'm saying this will come down as their growth continues but right now they're definitely priced higher on the price to sales but if you look at forward PE where I think is the truth lies you'll find out that forward PE wise this is the true comparison so Google is trading a forp of 20 Microsoft is at 30 and Microsoft I agree should be priced higher than Google and the current situation but Nvidia is currently priced right there in the middle so if you look at 4p in my opinion which is the best uh category to uh compare companies I don't know Nvidia seems to be priced better than most companies out there in fact they're priced in between Google and Microsoft and as we just saw here on the numbers it killed them in every single category so on the comparison side I don't have anything bad to say about Nvidia we ran a quick DCF here just to show you what is the current price reflecting so a DCF essentially is just a you know it's a discounted cash flow valuation so essentially you take all the cash flows from the future you bring them back to today's value and you add it all up you add some future growth and then you get the valuation right so what we showed you here is that this number $760 the current share price factors in this number 37% EB growth so the current price of the stock is based on 37% eida growth every single year for the next five years now on the fiveyear valuation model we assumed the 35% growth on the conservative side which is just what we saw earlier and then we said okay what happens if Nvidia grows at 50% a year for the next five years and then give us the kind of the range of where the stock is going to be in five years based on this valuation model we got stock MVP called the Sith So based on the most conservative model we have a 50% upside for the next five years which basically just like a 10-year annual return something you get on the S&P 500 so that's the floor so in five years Nvidia is at least a $1,100 stock there's no doubt in my mind about that and what happens in the Middle Ground well that's a $1,700 stock $1,800 stock that's 130% return but on the 50% growth scenario if if nid actually grows 50% per year for the next five years that's a 24 uh $2,400 stock which means a 220% return on the stock like Nvidia I mean that's very exciting now on the scorecard this is one of the best companies we have here on the company scorecard here in stock MVP essentially they kill everything Revenue net profit margin it's a 10 out of 10 everything is a 10 out of 10 assets to liabilities cash to debt short interest is very low institutional shareholding is everything here is great except the price the earnings but I just want to show you that the way we score this is if the price to earnings goes below 30 then we give you a five and below 10 we'll give you a 10 but it's not going to go below 10 obviously but as you just saw the forward PE is actually below 30 So within a few months within a year this is going to be a 95 score not a 90 score so they are getting better so I absolutely love this company so the question here is well that in that case we should buy the dip right well not necessarily I don't think you should buy the dip as as I just said I think you should dollar cost average slowly over time which means if you look at the stock price right here you buy here you buy here you buy here you buy here you buy at all times you buy the across the entire spectrum of pricing and then eventually like a like we have in our community your pricing is going to be way way closer to the bottom than to the top without timing the market and the way you can do it is essentially you can decide well look if my you know if my price Target is $760 so essentially buying more into weakness and buying less into strength but buying a little bit tiny bit every single month every single week so that over time you have a lowc cost basis and here's the trick if you haven't picked a Bad Company If Nvidia is in fact legitimate and it is a great company then that is going to guarantee you a very low cost basis in what seems to be a good stock",1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,OumO9FueWJ4,2024-04-19T15:07:15Z,It's Over,Tesla,"Dan freaking IES the king of Tesla analyst the most bullish analyst of Tesla Of All Times. Apparently Dan Ives is not as bullish as it just was but hold on hold on I'm just kid I'm just kidding I love that look Dan IES you know the king of Tesla Adas he was on CNBC and not as bullish as before but more bullish than 99% of Adas so you got to give him credit for that he was talking about the current state of affairs of Tesla which is the equivalent of getting three root canals without anesthesia at this point if you are a Tesla investor but he was basically saying what needs to happen now what needs to happen in the future for this stock price to start climbing up. Now Tesla has lost 35% uh of its value in 2024 which basically means it's not a good year for Tesla so far it's the low it's been since June of 2023. We have slowing growth, we have price Cuts, we of China demand issues, slowing deliveries, 10% of employees are fired, executives are living so there's a lot of bad press a lot of negative sentiment. When we see a 35% drop in Tesla in one year not even in one year in since the beginning of 2024 in four months that's equivalent of a 70% gain in the same time so we just experienced the 70% gain equivalent of a loss so it's not a fun thing to be in as an investor but if you have long-term perspective that's actually not a bad thing. Let's focus on what Dan I said this is probably the worst period that I've seen i'say about 6 years for Tesla and patience is wearing thin and you see from an invest perspective and obviously you know many throwing in the towel the long-term story is still there and and that's why we remain bullish but no doubt I mean this is White Knuckle and and there could be darker days ahead if musk does not handle the call I think like an adult in the room and actually give some sort of vision and navigation with a lot of questions. China EV Market it's like the video Thriller now that's obviously been the huge headwind for Tessa which is really that's a key part of the growth right in terms of the China story. What I think investors need to hear is what's the strategy to turn this around are they going to maintain prices and the big thing is model two like you need model two to have that growth Story the next 18 24 36 months this cannot just be about autonomy five six years from now and I think that that's really the crucial Point here that they need to get. If they don't do model 2 and went straight to autonomy that would be like being at a cliff in the Grand Canyon and looking down below it's a scary proposition because when when Tesla talks about two growth waves the second wave is model two refresh model 3 Model one and obviously some other you know models that they're going to introduce but that's the issue right now in terms of model two. You cannot go straight autonomy. This is really what I view when I say clock striking midnight it comes down from us navigate the category 5 storm just like he has an 18 2020 and other otherwise this is not just trust me because I think that's really the frustration now that essentially is you know went from A Cinderella Story magic carpa ride to what's been a bit of a horror show especially the last three three four months. We do believe in the autonomous Vision but in the near term it's about growth what is free cash will look like how do you reverse the growth TR how do you get to three four five million units the only way you get there is with a sub 30k car model two for for get a product line there really hasn't had to refresh since model y cyber truck continues to be limited that's not going to be Mass market and that's the issue here. Give what margins could look like there'll be a lot of charges where does gross margins level out at what's a realistic delivery number is it is it 1.95 is a two million what does growth look like like give the two to threee targets they need to basically reaffirm the model too reaffirm the lowcost vehicle give a strategy the next 6 9 12 months this can just be a trust me autonomy we'll be back to you in 2030 and that's why you're seeing many throwing the towel because of the fears and a lot of the reporting that surrounds that along with the Cost Cuts that were definitely you know I'd say a little gut-wrenching relative to a company that should in theory be in growth mode. So then I said this was the worst period for Tesla in years stock price-wise he's right company-wise I'm not so sure. What I think is important in this interview is the fact that then I said look I'm still bullish on Tesla long-term the story of the Tesla growth is still fully intact I do have problems with the way Tesla communicates with the investors and with the way we have no transparency about the future strategy of how Tesla is supposed to handle this. He also said what he thinks should happen in the earnings call next week basically saying look it needs to be handled with lots of Care at the last couple of calls people are not so confident about the way these calls are being handled they have to go to Wall Street talk not the Elon craziness that we've seen of the past two calls. However having said that I do agree with a few points Dan made which is what we need more from these calls which is more transparency about the future about the strategy more talk about the current problems the headwinds and how the company plans to basically handle them Beyond just the regular talk about hey in 2030 we're going to be absolutely massive. I think the China demand is where they need to kind of address the issue because it's been circulating over social media mainstream media people are hammering this China issue as if this is the end of Tesla obviously it's not. He also talks about the fact that model 2 which is that sub 30,000 vehicle needs to come out soon because that's the next S curve of Tesla. If you come out with the model 2 how he calls it basically the sub $30,000 car you're going to grab a lot of market share and you're going to generate a lot of income a lot of Revenue and you know it's going to hold you through until FSD comes in in 2030 and I agree with that point but look for Tesla it's very very hard to launch this car because it's going to be cannibalizing a lot of the existing inventory like model 3 right now with the credits it's not going to be a hell of a lot more expensive than the model 2. Do they really want to spread themselves so thin and add another massive undertaking like this and and you know deplete their bandwidth even more with very limited reward. It's not just Tesla byd is having a problem nobody's really like selling lots of vehicles right now it's very very hard in this environment. He also talked about the FSD and he said look FSD 2030 full Robo taxi we're all on board on this but there's a lot of regulatory challenges there's a lot of R&amp;D development challenges so it's just you know it's not here it's going to be here in five to six to seven years it's too soon for me to make any sort of a investment recommendations based on something that's not really proven yet and the biggest difference between me and Dan is I don't think that the steering wheel is is where it's at which means then C's FSD only becoming mainstream once you know we're talking about these uh steering cars where just literally drive themselves 100% of the time and for Tesla to make money off of FSD that's not required. I mean Tesla can make a lot of money off FSD even if it's still a very Advanced Driver assist system uh at at lower levels than atom 5 so I think it's it's definitely the timeline is a lot quicker than 2030 I think that the final product doesn't need to be a Sci-Fi driver list the way Dan thinks about it and I think that once that happens and Tesla becomes the license the license holder of this technology that nobody else will have they're going to make a lot of money from the software which is the ultimate goal of Tesla which is something that Ron Baron talked about for years nobody else has this it will become a standard and then Tesla will be not just an auto manufacturer they'll be the owner of the actual driverless technology that everybody will be using and I think that's going to be an absolute cataclysmic event for Tesla stock. I do like what Dan said at the end of the interview which is hey this is what I need from the upcoming earning call give me margin updates give me delivery updates give me growth projections for the next two to three years and show me how the progress of everything including AI robotics give me a little bit more transparency in the short term and address the issues instead of just basically saying well that's irrelevant that's too small we have way way bigger fish to fry. I think what Den is saying it's not mutually exclusive the fact that you have a cataclysmic volcano eruption of profits and revenue from FSD from robotics from all these things which I believe to be 100% true that does not exclude you from telling investors hey this is what's going to happen in the next two to three years even at the risk of sounding like a car company when you make these little updates. Look that hasn't Chang his mind about the future upside of the company I haven't as well my total price target for Tesla is $1,400.",1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,mo29d2oWk18,2024-04-18T13:28:43Z,It's Over: The Stock Market is starting to Break,Tesla,"loading up on a stock like that during weakness during extreme weakness is how you make money and a great example of a company like that can be test Tesla has lost a lot of its shine it has dropped from 300 per share all the way down to $155 per share it lost 9% just in the past month 27% of the past three months and if you go back one year it is down 177% it has not had a good year let's put it this way but if you take a look at the fundamentals of this business which we will in a second you find out that it may be actually selling at a massive discount so first of all let's scroll through the basic fundamentals of this company company which we have here in our stock MVP cards right so revenue is up 19% over the past year not amazing but still not bad at all net income is up 19% so at the bottom line the company is growing its revenues and growing its net income the bottom line both by 19% cash and short-term Investments is up 31% of the past year so it's cash position is getting stronger it's making more money it's generating more net income more profitability assets are up 30% total liabilities are up 18% which is not as fast as the assets and it's selling at five time sales now we're going to take a look in the second of how good or bad that five time sale is again stock on VP provides us a comparison of these three stocks Tesla Microsoft and alphabet right alphabet essentially Google Microsoft and Tesla what I think to be the top three companies that are racing towards AI dominance right obviously we can talk about Nvidia here but Nvidia is more of the hardware play these are the software plays of the bunch and Tesla is definitely leading in the FSD H Microsoft has the open AI Google is a little bit lagging behind but they will make a play so these three companies I think are good comparisons right so the first thing I want to show you here is right now the current short interest on all these companies so we have 075 on Microsoft not available on Google and 4% on Tesla which means that Tesla is the most shorted of these three companies which means it's the most hated let's scroll down here let's look at revenues so Revenue growth for Tesla over the past three years is 200% where the past year is 19% versus Microsoft's 50% and 11% so it's growing faster than Microsoft in the three year in the one year is it growing faster than Google yes over the three years yes over the one year so Tesla has higher growth rate than Microsoft and Google check that box net income it's not deriving the same levels of net income but look at the growth 19% which is in line with Microsoft's 22% and Google's 23% it's not as fast as generating more net income but it's definitely on par with these three companies now let's look at cash and short-term Investments while we have Google Down 2 and a half% Microsoft down 18.6% Tesla is up 31% in cash so they're generating more cash look at total assets again Google is up 10% Microsoft up 29% Tesla is up 29.5% again in line it's literally looking like a Microsoft and a Google while Google is trading at 6.3 sales Microsoft at 13 and a half sales Tesla is selling at five time sales so Tesla is the cheapest of them all it's not as expensive as Microsoft and it's definitely not as expensive as any of the other plays like Nvidia but it's even cheaper than Google that has taken a massive beating for being the lagger in the AI space I wouldn't say that Tesla has an exuberant pricing based on the comparison to comparables that make sense like Microsoft and Google Now if we move forward to this tool right here we have this tool that's called the scorecard the company scorecard is basically where we rank compan based on objective data for example right here we have a three-year Revenue if the revenue is decreasing then you lose points if it is flat then you get a little bit and if it's growing you get 10 points so here they got 10 points net profit margin actually is above 10% which means they get another 10 cash and short-term Investments is growing over the past three years so they get a 10 assets to liabilities is above one they get 10 points short interest is below 5% another perfect score institutional share holding they have 45% now our threshold for giving a 10 here is 50 so they're almost on the verge of that 50 but they're not quite there yet so they lose five points here scalability wise they're doing fine the three-year scalability basically Revenue versus operating expenses which one is growing faster the revenue is growing much faster stock has basically gone parabolic after the IPO so that's another 10 right here and the p ratio is actually too high at 33 to get a score here because we only score you if you are below 30 for the five points so they're almost there you can get a little bit better they will get five points but overall they get 85 out of 100 which is one of the highest score our software stock EVP can produce for a company I don't think I've seen the 90 since we started it but it's pretty high now if we go and we move to the valuation part right now Tesla should be valued at $200 per share and that $200 per share is based on the most pessimistic bearish case auto manufacturer analysis that I have for you looking at the auto business alone without the Robo taxi without the FSD without the robotics without none of this just based on Tesla's current existing sales growth and its trajectory it's at minimum a $200 stock based on my DCF and you can look at the underlying assumptions right here I'm not going to go through them but you can go with them you can punch them you can say it's horrible whatever it's your choice but just to show you that the EB growth for Tesla that I've used here is just 15% so we got 15% on theb growth which I think Tesla will beat we're using a 10% whack the discount rate and we have basically all the outline of the assumptions right here so you can punch holes in them but based on my understanding Tesla is currently a $200 stock without all the future upside that they have now if you factor in all the future upside you know my price Target is $1,400 that's not a secret but this is the most bare case valuation of Tesla right now if you're buying Tesla you're getting a 30% upside and you're getting Robo taxi and FSD and all the other stuff basically for free Now I also ran a 5-year conservative hyper conservative assumption test for Tesla basically meaning if Tesla doesn't develop the robo tax if they don't develop the FSD how much is Tesla worth in 5 years so the most bearish case I have here is $267 per share which means that over the next five years this stock is going to make 72% still Bing out the SP 500 and that's the worst case of the bare case the middle ground is 511 which gives us 230% and the optimistic bear case is 386 per with 750 per share now those are the most basic bear cases I I have right now my actual price target for this stock is $1,400 which is double than the base case right here but it just kind of gives you the idea of how low can this go and if this is selling at a 50% discount right now because the retail investment community and institutionalsales which again is normal for a new model Tesla has all these problems with demand oh my God China is closing China is collapsing there's all this narratives executives are living there's plenty of negative narratives that have driven the stock all the way down to 150 allowing a very comfortable way to DCA dollar cost average into the stock NOW the way we DCA into the stock in our community which we talked about is we create a threshold we create a line an imaginary line that's 10% 20% 30% below the 52 we High which is right now at 300 as you can see right here so if you take 10% below this line or 20% it's your choice to each their own anything below that line with dollar cost averaging double anything above that line we're basically dollar cost averaging normal and that way once we open this up in 5 years our cost basis is going to be quite close to the bottom of the stock without actually timing the market that's the beauty of the system we teach on our Academy he's the guy who was calling oil prices to go up and paler and Tesla to actually

Tom Nash,_Qpjwv_FNs0,2024-04-15T21:54:36Z,MIND-BLOWING News Just Hit The Stock Market!,Federal Reserve,you have to understand the very delicate dense that we have right now with the Federal Reserve essentially if we want to get rate cuts for the market we need the fed to be pressured to cut rates before they break the economy as long as the economy stays in great shape which means low unemployment which we got right now which means great retail sales data which means people spending money which we got just right now in fact people are dou you know spending way more money than we thought 7 versus the expected. 3 as long as the economy is doing great the Federal Reserve does not feel the pressure to cut rates because cutting rates is very dangerous it's very risky if they cut too soon inflation is going to come back and they don't know exactly where the too soon part is and as long as the economy stays strong they have more of a safety region of a safety net to wait and the FED has already indicated that as long as the economy stays strong they're not going to be under any pressure to cut rates ahead of time so since we just got really really good economic data people are spending money low unemployment the theory is that if the inflation is sticker than we thought which is what we had in the L CPI and the economy is better than we thought the FED is going to take its sweet time before the C of cut rates that essentially kind of solidifies the expectation of going from three to two cuts towards the latter half this year essentially we went from six Cuts in the beginning of this year then to three cuts and now based on today's data the expectation is two cuts in November and December of 2024 not before so really really completely different kind of a almost counterintuitive situation retail data comes in great inflation expectations and then everybody sells off because higher interest rates for longer means valuations will come down so that's part one but that is only half of the equation... ...the economy is way too strong for the FED to cut rates when the inflation data is just too sticky and they sold off I mean what did you expect them to do I'm not a Trader I'm not a short-term Trader but I mean it's a logical thing to do if you're you know a day trader or a really short done Trader and that's fine now as you would expect today you've seen kind of a flurry of opinions for both sides of the aisle obviously you have Tom Lee who jumped on CNBC today and he was talking about the fact that he se you know sees still his original Target for the S&P 500 unchanged and essentially saying well look we still believe the FED is going to cut rates and the there's still $6 trillion do on the sideline and even if the FED does not cut rates and the economy numbers are high we're still going to have great earnings and great earnings is going to push stock prices up so we don't see any problem as long as the FED doesn't sabotage the economy by hiking rates all of a sudden so Tom Le is still bullish others are not as bullish... ...then economic data comes out it's way better than expected now we know the FED has way more of a cushion they start selling then all of a sudden the Israelis are saying well we're going to start a war in the Middle East not really but they're essentially saying we're going to retaliate that increases the war in the Middle East increases is the potential of an increased price of energy and oil which increases the likelihood of higher inflation numbers which decreases the likelihood of rate Cuts so market sell off natural progression,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,YQ1Ni2GUE_Q,2024-04-12T20:22:25Z,The Stock Market Apocalypse Just Started,Federal Reserve,so Larry Summers Harvard Professor former treasury secretary one of the greatest economists of Our Generation Just Came Out Swinging literally saying that the Federal Reserve has lost its way when the economy is below what the FED thinks is the normal unemployment rate when the economy is growing faster than what the FED thinks is potential and when inflation is unambiguously above Target and plausibly uh accelerating and the FED is not political right now watch this next clip the FED has once again in important respects lost its way over the last six or nine months in the same way making policy and making forecasts based on Hope rather than on a hard-headed look at reality I think that uh the FED did a good job of cleaning up on the errors they had made in uh 2021 and I think it's reasonable to think that they will pivot off the errors they made last fall that led markets to be ludicrously expecting six Cuts uh this year and I'm hopeful that that will happen but I think the FED does need to learn uh some important uh lessons now in this next clip he gives the FED a huge compliment basically saying look guys you screw it up in the beginning you fixed it but now I fear you're about to screw up again if you pivot if you reduce rates in this situation you have not learned a thing from your first screw up price stability and I'm afraid there are some signs that in the last few months uh they have lost uh their focus in favor of more ambitious economic theories number one the Fed has to communicate to the public that they're not going to cut rates in 2024 If the Fed does that the expectation from the people is going to be for bad times which means they're going to spend less which means that it's going to be a self-fulfilling prophecy inflation will come down because people would basically be fearful and not spending as much so you can do a lot with crowd psychology and the FED does not actually use it right now in the proper way according to Larry Summers because they're not telling to the people hey stop spending because things are going to be bad for longer so he basically saying the FED needs to be way more of a bouncer you know what a bouncer does in the club he stands there he looks you know fearsome nobody wants to pick a fight with the bouncer that's the whole job of the FED here they're not doing a good job of that,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,nrooTYQH6Vc,2024-04-11T21:38:58Z,The Fed Just ENDED The Stock Market | URGENT,Federal Reserve,hey everybody this is Tom Nash and apparently the feder reserve is about to cut rates multiple times in 2024. now we have this leading indicator that the FED absolutely loves came out today and basically put everybody at ease. if it is slowing down then how much rate Cuts will the FED allow us to get in this year. and now that the dust have settled and we've seen the negativity of CPI yesterday the positivity of the PPI today the market has decided that we still will have probably three rate Cuts in 2024 although now we're not as sure about it as we were just 24 hours ago and that's a first statement because the CPI data was as I just showed you quite alarming now based on the fed watch tool by CME we only have a 16% of a rate cut in June now I would adjust that to 0.0% we're not going to have a rate cut in June there's still a 37% for one cut in July and if you combine it with a 5% for the two rate Cuts in July which is absolutely Preposterous there's a 42% chance of a rate cut in July that should go down to 0.0% as well June and July are not going to be a rate cut month no matter what happens going forward and as I show you in a second there's a good reason for that now we get to September November December the 3 months where the market actually predicts a cut although not at the same levels of certainty in September we're getting 65% chance of a rate cut not crazy but a hell of a lot better than less than 50% in November that number goes up to 73% and in December we get 86% now I assume these numbers will change as the day ship but basically we have one certain cut in December as it stands right now and two much much less certain Cuts in November and September that might merge into one so realistically we're looking to one or two or maybe maximum three R Cuts but it completely different level of certainty not nearly as certain as we had just 24 hours ago nevertheless there's still significant camp that believes that the second half of 2024 is going to be much easier for inflation allowing the FED to cut rates a lot faster and bringing the market to new highs. now the leader of that group is Tom Lee a guy I also showed on my channel the only guy that gives me a competition for the quality of hair and Tom is basically saying look unless the Federal Reserve raises rates in 2024 we're still going to have a good year whether the cut rates or they keep them as is in those two scenarios we'll be fine. scenario number four If the Fed pushes up rates like Jamie Diamond said even if they push up rates to 6% 6.2% 6.5 % then the market will have to make a massive adjustment because the entire Market valuation of stocks of multiples the entire setup we have right now is based on no further rate increases.,1.0,0.0
Tom Nash,nrooTYQH6Vc,2024-04-11T21:38:58Z,The Fed Just ENDED The Stock Market | URGENT,JPMorgan Chase,now look just a few days ago before the CPI data came out we have to be honest Jamie Diamond put a 60-page letter warning people that inflation is getting worse and that he foresees an 8% interest rate with a stack inflationary environment for the rest of 2024 now he's also talking about the potential of a market pullback it's going to be quite painful and he sees things are getting worse and not getting better and in fact just a couple days passed by and Jamie Diamond's prediction looks on point as CPI comes out way hotter than expected at 3 and a half% which is a hell of a lot higher than the 3.2 we had last month and an increase that is hotter than expected. but as much as I want to believe Tom Lee or I want to believe Jamie Diamond the data doesn't lie so we have to take a look at the data. scenario number four If the Fed pushes up rates like Jamie Diamond said even if they push up rates to 6% 6.2% 6.5 % then the market will have to make a massive adjustment because the entire Market valuation of stocks of multiples the entire setup we have right now is based on no further rate increases. because look even if you look at the Jamie Diamond letter as a horrible letter it's not Jamie Diamond literally says yes we're looking into a stationary period but longterm I see great things for this Market because the AI Revolution is going to be as big as the invention of electricity so there's going to be a lot of money being made in the stock market in the future if you're stay long-term minded and you just DCA and you ignore these little bumps in the road you're going to be fine.,0.8,0.0

Tom Nash,tGOroJW-EUE,2024-04-09T18:26:46Z,Tom Lee New Stock Market Prediction is MIND-BLOWING,CNBC,everybody this is Tom Nash and Tom Lee was just on CNBC talking about the rest of 2024 and you won't believe what he said he absolutely dropped some massive bomb shells check it out and now he's back on CNBC rightfully so leading this sheep into the rest of 2024 trying to explain to them how to invest in this market he absolutely answered the question which is not something you see often on CNBC lately great question CNBC does it matter if the FED Cuts rates or not if the economy is really strong anyway will earnings be able to justify the valuations at this point,1.0,0.1
Tom Nash,tGOroJW-EUE,2024-04-09T18:26:46Z,Tom Lee New Stock Market Prediction is MIND-BLOWING,Federal Reserve,inflation's Falling fast enough for the FED to to actually cut rates this year and of course that'd be great for stocks now he was also talking about the FED support now they've asked him an excellent question credit what credits do they've asked him a great question great question CNBC does it matter if the FED Cuts rates or not if the economy is really strong anyway will earnings be able to justify the valuations at this point and they've asked him look Tom what happens if the Federal Reserve pivots again and if they go from hey we're going to reduce rates real soon to you know what we're not going to reduce rates and maybe we will even increase rates what happens if that actually is the case right and that's a great question and he answered it to Perfection he said look guys there's three scenarios here I think the FED being supportive of the economy so managing the business cycle is the most important thing in the last two years the Fed was fighting inflation and therefore hawkish that was tougher equities but if we're in a mode where the FED doesn't know how many cuts it needs to make but it actually wants to support the business cycle that's good for stocks so I don't think you need to have three Ray Cuts you you could even have a a good scenario where the FED only Cuts once but if the fed's in a position where they feel they need to actually raise interest rates that that'd be bad for stocks one scenario is that the FED starts cutting rates in 2024 if that is the case the market is going to fly up second scenario if the FED keeps the rate where it is right now and does not change it for the rest of 2024 the market the economy is strong enough to still push the market upwards without any rate Cuts but he also said if the Federal Reserve for God knows what reason decides to basically pivot again and start increasing rates again that is going to be catastrophic for for the market because right now every single stock price out there is pricing in three rate cuts the drop to zero rate Cuts might not be that much but the drop to rate increase is going to be catastrophic and if that happens the market is going to crash and because the inflation is on the way down the FED will have to cut rates and it's going to pump the economy which is going to pump the stock market so we only disagree on one thing which is the direction of inflation not anything else anything that the FED could have dropped because of 5.25 interest rates have already dropped the real estate Market is in chambles nobody's moving anything the market is very very tight right now with respect to interest rates the only thing the Federal Reserve cannot control with their interest rates policy is the global Energy prices mainly crude oil if that happens the FED is not going to be able to reduce rates and that's going to push the market down from its Olympus of expectations of eight rate Cuts in the next couple of years do you believe oil price is going to push up in a manner that's going to slow the fed's pivot or not,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,tGOroJW-EUE,2024-04-09T18:26:46Z,Tom Lee New Stock Market Prediction is MIND-BLOWING,JPMorgan,then in the middle of the interview they asked him about the Jamie Diamond letter which we covered in yesterday's video basically saying look Jamie Diamond just came out with a 61-page letter literally saying the opposite complete opposite of what you're saying about where the market is headed for the rest of this year Jamie Diamond's JP Morgan is publishing his annual letter to shareholders pricing in a 70 to 80% chance of a soft Landing but Diamond thinks the odds are quote a lot lower I think Jamie's doing his shareholders justice it because they they want to hear from him about all the concerns out there Jamie Diamond manages a bank in fact Jamie Diamond manages the biggest bank in America his job is to warn you about the worst possible scenario so you prepare for the worst me and Jamie Diamond only disagree on one thing which is the direction of inflation because Jamie Diamond literally says that the root of all problems that he sees for the rest of 2024 is going to be higher inflation that higher inflation is going to lead to higher interest rates which going to slow down the economy and cause stagflation right this whole thing is actually not even about inflation the whole Jamie Diamond versus Tom Lee is actually about one thing which is oil prices that is the whole difference between Jamie Diamond and Tom Lee but at the end of the day you can't discount what Jamie Diamond warns you about you can't just ignore the risks and saying ah I think it's wrong you have to prepare and you have to build your portfolio to actually be ready for things to hit the fan,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,smfJ2i3_QkI,2024-04-08T19:28:34Z,MIND-BLOWING News Just Hit The Stock Market!,JPMorgan Chase,for me there's nothing better than to open the week on the Monday with a 61 page warning about the end of the society as we know it by the head of the largest bank in the United States I wish this was clickbait I wish this was fake but it ain't unfortunately Jamie Diamond got out of his bed Monday morning and chose violence the man put out a 61 Page Letter literally warning us about every possible thing that can go wrong he's talking about higher inflation he's talking about higher interest rates and he's talking about stagflation now I'm not going to bore you with this 61 Page Letter we're not going to go and read it together because that would be a waste of your time my job here is not to be a friend my job here is not to be nice my job is to make your life simpler and help you make money so I'm going to take this 61 Page Letter which I spent countless minutes of my life reading and I'm going to give you the bottom line here because I think that's the best value I can provide in this environment and most importantly I'll give you actionable strategies how to mitigate risk how to prepare your portfolio for the things is saying basically how to set up for the possibility of a really really bad event without absolutely missing out on the crazy bull market that we have right now now let's talk about it further what Jamie Diamond is talking about when he says higher interest rates High higher inflation for longer and a St inflation environment he actually puts a number in this saying that I see up to 8% interest not the current 5.25 we have all the way up to 8% potentially now he also says it might come down to 2% so it basically gave you a range of 2% to 8% which is like saying hey I'm going to be over there to fix your fridge sometimes between Sunday and Tuesday I mean it's a little bit of a wide Gap but nevertheless he is bearish now he's talking about massive government spending which would be a catalyst for this he ain't lying we know that and he's talking about massive geopolitical myths going on around the world Middle East Ukraine and many many others he ain't lying about that so he's underlying logic of why things are about to hit the fan or the is going to hit the fan so to speak is basically kind of valid I mean he's not lying now he is talking about a stack flary period for the United States and if you have any sort of history in you you understand that's a bad word we never want to hear stagflation that's like saying vmont nobody wants to say station station essentially means higher inflation high unemployment basically not a fun time for anybody now what he basically saying is that investors should prepare for turbulence because things are not going to be as good as advertised obviously we are in an election year everybody's trying to push the narrative that the you know the plane has landed the soft Landing is here and everybody can just relax now he's basically saying look I'm going to be honest with you I don't see it I don't see it in fact I see a high probability of the plane crashing now what he's saying here is very interesting check this out he's saying look right now stocks are being priced in on three assumptions it's basically been priced in on an 80% or higher probability of a soft lending three interest rate Cuts in 20124 and five interest rate Cuts in 2025 if that doesn't happen happen if we don't get a soft landing and eight rate Cuts in the next two years the correction is going to be extremely violent If the Fed has to Pivot back from quantitative easing into quantitative tightening because the circumstances will change he's definitely on point the markets will react very very negatively now before you go selling your portfolio wait I I have to give you a little caveat here now Jamie Diamond definitely has skills he has the information the resources the access the experience all that but Jamie Diamond has been in the more bearish camp for a while he's generally more bearish about the market at least for the past few years and when he says things like this it ain't a pivot it's just basically what he's been saying for the past couple years in between we had a crazy bull market we had a lot of stuff that didn't exactly go based on his beish St so you have to understand that not everything that Jamie Diamond says with all due respect it's going to happen exactly like he predicts it now I will actually add one little tidbit here which actually completely changes this whole thing and M media is going to miss this you have to realize that in this letter he also said one important thing that he is very bullish long-term about the market he's basically saying look the invention of artificial intelligence is the equivalent of the invention of electricity and that's going to catapult the market into new highs we have never even imagined before so while he is very shortterm because of inflation pressures longterm he is extremely bullish which once again for the millionth time should prove to you that time in the market always beats timing the market now look the question here is given what Jamie Diamond just said right now how do we prep for this how do we make sure that we buy some insurance in case this dude is right and honestly half of the solution is just that realizing that time in the market basically solves all wounds and as long as you stay in the market as long as you stay invested in good us companies in the US economy you'll be fine if Jamie Diamond is right and if we're actually headed to bad times at least you saved one3 of your portfolio and cushion the fall a little bit you actually get to enjoy both scenarios if Jamie Diamond is right if 2024 is going to have high interest rates then companies that still have a great business will not see a great stock performance they're going to actually get beaten down those are the stocks you can pick up on a discount if that's indeed the case if the stock continues to drop because of what Jamie Diamond said if the market isn't really ready yet for interest rate cuts and we're going to have more QT more quantitative tightening over the 2024 period then the stock will keep dropping and you can pick it up slowly over DCA and when it bounces up in 2025 or 2026 your cost basis is going to be up in the bottom whatever the case may be as long as you have patience you'll be fine all while buying this massive real estate trust one of the best in the business a category leader $50 billion market cap yes it might take another beating if rates remain high but at the end of the day this is a dividend monster whether the stock price moves up or down you're still going to get that dividend no matter what and when the interest rates drop whether it's 2024 2025 2026 as long as you have that patience you will be fine,0.9,0.0

Tom Nash,NNWk4db_fWI,2024-04-05T17:59:19Z,Why I have never been more excited about Palantir,Palantir,so paler is supposedly extremely expensive right now everybody keeps telling me that that paler is overvalued cool let's take a look at this this was paler 3 years ago on the money 9th of April 2021 it was trading for $244 right about here from 9th of April of 2021 all the way to K day the stock lost a dollar and a half basically it's now trading 6% cheaper than it was 3 years ago so penter over the past 3 years lost 6% of its stock price now even though recently we've seen this 170% Spike over the past year it still didn't recover all the way to $24 which exactly it had 3 years ago so the question is if penter actually lost 6% in 3 years of its share price what happened to the business because the share price has to correlate with the business right well let's take a look at the business on the business side what we can see here is something really interesting Vue for the past 3 years is up 103% gross profit is up 142% operating expenses are down 125% operating income is up 110% net income is up 118% and free cash flow is up 325 freaking per of the past 3 years let's keep scrolling all the way down to the cash cash and short-term Investments are up 82.7% over the past 3 years total assets up 70% over the past 3 years total liabilities down 17.7% of the past three years that is good total debt down 50% of the past three years so over the past three years paler has doubled its Revenue more than double its gross profit reduced its operating expenses doubled its net income double its operating income tripled its free cash flow reduced by 1/5 its liabilities cut in half its debt increased its assets by 70% and almost doubled its cash and short-term investments in that same time frame the stock lost 6% now obviously what we have here is a little bit of a cluster fckery because there's no way in hell that a company does this in 3 years loses 6% of its value obviously the stock is going one way the business is going another way now look I understand that everybody's right now looking at this price to earnings ratio of 234 oh my God it is so expensive listen they've just became profitable this number is meaningless what you need to be looking at is right here forward be that is the next year's numbers and that gives us a 56 price to earnings so when you talk about paler you have to understand you're talking about a 56 forward PE so that's a 56 PE company let's say 57 be company now now the price to sales again is not cheap it's absolutely insanely High 21 sales I get it it's an expensive company but still at 56 57 PE that's not horrible especially given the insane numbers you're seeing here on the screen so let's compare snowflake to paler snowflake is a similarly sized company at $50 billion they are not directly competing with paler but a lot of people keep comparing them so let's do it right here so palente is not growing as fast as snowflake with revenues right Reven news snowflake is up 374 pal is only up 100% same thing with gross profit you know 442 versus 142 both are growing nicely but definitely snowflake has the edge but when you look at operating expenses you see snowflake had to increase their operating expenses by 234 per over the past 3 years in order to generate all this massive Revenue which means they have a scalability problem at the same time paler actually reduced their operating expenses so while snowflake is spending two 134% more on operating expenses to generate 374 of Revenue increase penter is actually spending 12 a half% less to give us 100% Revenue increase which one is better which one is more scalable which one will win long term I think you understand the answer the scalability here is absolutely insane and to me it's kind of laughable how people talked about paler as a consultancy as a not scalable business it's absolutely amusing look at look at operating income operating income for snowflake based in these empty calories right here because these are empty calories because look at operating income operating income is down 100% over the past two years while paler is up 110% once we get out of the empty calorie region right here in revenues you see what's going on in the hood look at net income down 55% for snowflake up 120% for paler look at free cash flow now free cash flow wise they definitely are absolutely insane both of these have nomenal numbers snowflake is up 940 paler is up 325 so both of them are killing it on free cash flow good for them now we go down to the cash and short-term Investments and while piler almost doubled their cash position at 83% increase snowflake actually lost a little bit of money look at total assets penter is up 70% snowflake is up 40% look at total liabilities penter is down 17.7% that's good they've reduce liabilities by almost 18% at the same time snowflake had to take on 200% more liabilities to grow the business look at total debt up 40% of the past three years for snowflake down 50% for penter and now let's look at the ratios because now we've seen which is the better company right we've seen which one has the better engine which one is looking better under the hood and which one has empty calories so you got snowflake right here trading at 18 time sales p is trading at 21 time sales not a huge difference and this is a Warren Buffett Company Warren Buffett is a huge fan of snowflake at 18 time sales paler has better fundamentals at slightly higher price to sales not a huge difference not a huge difference at all look at forward PE snowflake is trading at9 forward PE pilers at 56 so pilers literally half the price of snowflake right now at better numbers this is a no-brainer and while the stock price stayed absolutely idle from 2021 for the past 3 years look at the institutional shareholding for the past 3 years from June of 2021 until now the institutional shareholding of penter has doubled from 424 million all the way up to 857 million so while the price stayed flat and the business massively improved the institutional shareholders like Vanguard like Goldman Sachs like Berkeley's all of them kept buying and buying paler while you were selling and now we're getting to the interesting part so this is my five-year price prediction for penter what planer will be worth in 5 years so my most conservative case right now is $35 now on the middle ground it's a $15 stock which gives us a 365 per upside for the next 5 years and on the optimistic side it's a $174 stock in 5 years giving us a 674 per upside obviously these are predictions based on my opinion which might be inaccurate might be wrong might be the am of amendment it's not Financial advice just take it as my opinion now look if I run a DCF for the current valuation of paler this is what I have so I have paler current currently valued not 5 years right now is $ 42.2 so right now for me the true value of paler the intrinsic value of paler is $422 as it stands here in our DCF model,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,q2yxl_-3JR4,2024-04-03T17:35:51Z,Tesla Just Did The Unthinkable [This Changes Everything],Tesla,"Tesla dropped delivery numbers yesterday and they were not great and when I say not great it was a trucker driver size Deuce 387,000 deliveries well below expectations there's no way to sugarcoat this third it was not a great quarter there's plenty of excuses obviously which is the Red Sea issues the Moto 3 Highland retooling the China issues the burlin fire the dog ate my car whatever right it doesn't matter at the end of the day disappointing num however if you put it into context it makes more sense I'm not here to say that this was a great quarter it wasn't but you got to look at the rest of the industry at the same quarter byd the Tesla killer or at least supposed Tesla killer they dropped deliveries by 43% GM by 20% so nobody's licking honey in this quarter so let's be honest in fact Tesla just bypassed byid as the world's bestselling EV producer with 387,000 while byd only sold 300,000 so that could have been a headline for CNBC Tesla takes first place on global EV deliveries of course they're not going to do that and I don't think they should because this was not a great quarter by Tesla what I do find disappointing here and I'm going to surprise you is that despite the fact that 387,000 deliveries was a third as far as delivery numbers despite this horrendous mainstream media noise and fud despite all this negative sentiment I'm still very much disappointed that the stock only dropped dropped 5% now I was hoping for more I'm not going to lie but I guess the Tesla Community is just too smart for this they know they've been there before they've seen it happen they're not going to let it drop more than 5% because they know it's they're cheap at 160 to 180 and I think just another proof that the Tesla retail Community is actually a lot smarter than people give it credit they've been one step ahead of the institutional crowd for many many years it seems like 2024 is no different because we have guys like Gene monster and then I going on national TV going on CNBC and talking about how bad this quarter was and how horrible this can be etc etc I want to pay you a FL clips from the den IES interview and from the gene Monster interview and no knock on them because they do say in those clips that Tesla will be fine long term but the way they talk about this event is absolutely mindboggling check it out let's call it as it is while we were anticipating a bad quarter this was an unmitigated disaster first quarter deliveries was a nightmare quarter for Tesla you wrote Elon is now pressured by the street and China demand remains very soft and you also say in this case Street criticism is warranted but then I end you still have an outperform rating and I wonder why hey look I mean for the long term like in terms of the actual opportunity for evv for full self-driving for autonomous that's still there but let's just call like it is this is no smoke and mirror I mean if you looked up train wreck in the dictionary you'd see a picture of teso's 1 Q quarter and now in terms of the the growth the opportunity 30 billion in cash they're in a phenomenal position from that perspective but I'd say probably this is what I'd say in the last five years probably the the darkest period relative to what we're seeing in China and this quarter explanation mark full self-driving autonomous You could argue that could be a trillion dollar worth of value from a software perspective uh I was just stunned today I think that this uh caught me off guard I was expecting it basically to be flat deliveries is down 9% uh just to frame that in that's a $22. half trillion Market what's the auto market on a yearly basis eventually of course it's going to go EV panel appropriately talked about What's the timing of that I think it's going to come faster than most people think even though this is such an ugly day on the delivery numbers and the reason is that I believe one of the the biggest factors in this horrible number was that there was so much excitement around EVS people who typically buy a car every 5 years probably moved it Forward bought it 3 years pulled a lot of demand in I think eventually that just starts I'm guilty of being too optimistic but I think eventually they get to the other side and one final thought Dan you talked about FSD I agree that that is an important piece here if anybody's tried FSD the beta that they just put out last week it is a step function better than what they've ever done and so I think that is going to come probably the next year or two and I believe that that's going to be another catalyst so that's where I'm at so you've got two camps you've got the people who believe and the reason why the Stock's not down more today is because that camp still exists the reason why this still has the market cap it does is because that camp still exists they're not going to be influenced probably by another couple Punky quarters that won't influence it the people who are skeptical there's nothing that Tesla's going to say over the next when they report their quarter on the 23rd that's going to get those people more optimistic now then iives is talking about an unmitigated disaster a horrible quarter and the fact is he still staying with his $300 price tag he's saying that this is essentially a speed bump and that FSD alone can be A1 trillion market cap now Den iives is a real dude it's a bad quarter he admits it which there's no reason to sugarcoat they have a good future ahead which I agree 100% and he's asking for more guidance and transparency as far as the future strategy of the company which is fair to me you may agree you may disagree but him asking for more clarity on the strategy sounds fine to me no issues with what that I've said and you have to understand that he's on TV so he have to come out with a little bit more flashy kind of titles and headlines but at the end of the day look at the bottom line the bottom line is $300 per share 100% upside FSD to1 trillion now gin monster on the other hand is a little bit of a different cat now he's saying look this caught me off guard I'm stunned they'll have more pain in 2024 which actually all may be true but here's what he also saying is saying look at the end of the day this is a $2.5 trillion dollar auto market and we have not even scratched the surface of EV penetration and Tesla will be the leader I mean who else VW toora I mean who GM Ford byd who just dropped 43% quarter over quarter I mean look at the end of the day he's 100% right FSD is super close it's going to be a monopolistic power for Tesla and the Bulls understand that no no bad quarter no bad quarters will change what they think about Tesla's future given fd's potential and the Bears will still hate Tesla even if Elon comes out with rainbows sparkling out of his freaking ears he's 100% right now look listening to these guys it sounds like the roof is on fire but they both say and I'll give them credit that things will be fine long term that there's no real issues as far as the Tesla long-term growth story Den I a little bit more concerned Jee monster seems to be more relaxed but all in all both of them agree that this is a bump in the road and that Tesla will be fine as long as they fix a few issues now that being said I look at Tesla right now and I'm saying look these guys are leading in the FSD they're leading in energy they're leading in robotics it's a long-term play that has so much upside in software and they got the model 2 coming out whatever it's going to be called the $25,000 car and they got the Cyber TR ramping up they're literally a leading software AI robotics company with unrivaled World leading manufacturing capacities and Manufacturing locations around the world and $30 billion of cash and no debt and look while I get it the Tesla Bears and the Tesla haters they're having a great time right now they're making shish kebabs of the sarter and you know why not let them have their fun but at the end of the video ask yourself this question if this was a demand problem if Tesla has a demand problem Tesla would have known about it a few months ago they wouldn't have just caught themselves oh my God we can't move any cars they know in real time exactly what's going on so why would Tesla produce 433,000 vehicles and only ship 387 why why would they do such a horrible discrepancy between the production and the deliveries unless it's more of a logistical problem and a temporary bump in the road just food for thought here now look here's the thing once FSD is actually operational we're talking about a recurring Revenue model with 80% gross margin and monopolistic power it's game over for everybody else I don't know why we're even having this conversation when FSD launches and now with FSD supervised we're actually a lot closer than even I thought not even talking about the robo taxes not even talking about the fact that every OEM out there will have to license FSD from Tesla these guys even if they just sell it in their cars it's going to be an insane Revenue generator probably more along the sides of a monthly fee monthly subscription not as a lumpsum payment but nevertheless something that no auto manufacturer have been able to achieve so far and you know what I find most amusing despite the fact that Tesla is sitting on a mountain of cash $30 billion no debt despite the fact that they have seven different scures right now in the works despite them being the best margins in the business despite running the fastest and being the biggest Gap in FSD out of everybody despite all of that record-breaking quarter and energy people people see talk about the Elon Musk post being too political and how that is killing demand for Tesla vehicles now look I'm going to be honest with you I've never purchased a vehicle based on the political affiliation of the CEO of the company I don't think nobody is buying a Tesla or not buying a Tesla because something that El musk says or does or post on X I mean if anybody does that there one unique snowflake now what I'm saying here is very simple I'll go with you here one step forward let's say that El is killing the Tesla Demand by posting about politics fine what I find peculiar here in this whole story is how in the world Elon posting about us Politics on X managed to drop byd deliveries by 43% in a single quarter I mean byd is so pissed at IL right now for causing them to lose 43% of their sales because of his political tweets it's absolutely insane so en is not only impacting Tesla he's actually killing byd as well so absolutely crazy now I'm obviously joking but you get exactly my point now look at $160 to $180 per share let's talk about it Tesla is way more exciting than it's ever been you know we're trading at what 35 times earnings five and a half times sales it's trading absolutely sweet they did have the worst performing year-to-date performance out of the entire Max 7 I believe they've lost 60% of their stock price in the past 3 years but the business is doing well always separate the business from the stock price in fact separated in a way where you can say well look I wish I could find a stock with a great business but a horrible stock performance there you go so this company increased net income by 1, 1600% over the past three years now we're talking about a company that still has a truck that's just starting to ramp up the best category in the Auto industry in the United States FSD is probably year year and a half away that's going to be a monopoly the model 2 or whatever it's going to be called the $25,000 car is going to be absolutely insane model Y is already one of the best selling cars in the world and they have a great brand great product line great brand and on top of it Tesla is actually spending the most out of the entire Auto industry on research and development and capital expenditures they're building more factories they're buying more machines they're researching more than anybody else so they're actually increasing the Gap from the entire industry now look with $30 billion of cash a free cash flow out of this world and no debt nobody's catching Tesla they have plenty of cash to do whatever they want at the end of the day this is a company that has a business that's going up a stock price that's going down it's the perfect opportunity for me to increase my position if you buy all the time and you buy more when the stock is weak and you buy a little bit less when the stock is strong eventually your cost basis will be very very low.",1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,dEAtlOZJexk,2024-03-29T18:50:10Z,Why I have never been more excited about Tesla,Tesla,"this is why I've never been more bullish about Tesla than right now I'm about to play you a little clip and this little few second clip will show you why now is the best time for actual long-term Bulls of Tesla to load up and increase their position without paying the extra premium check it out and look we've been here before in other words like there's no doubt and we call it out I mean this is a code red situation for Tesla I mean they are going through some dark days in China from a demand perspective but Joe I believe on the other side of this this is a company not just from an FSD perspective but from volume that could start to get 2 and 1 half 3 million vehicles per year as we go into next few years our whole point here is you're in between two growth waves here okay so wet push analyst Dan Ives one of the best in the business just came on CNBC for a few minutes to talk about Tesla's future the current price Target he has and his long-term predictions about the market G of this company now Den IES is a straight shooter he's not the sort of guy to hold on to his narrative he's not the sort of guy to play ego games he's going to call it like he sees it even if it's about himself he's going to be very critical when need be and he's going to be very complimentary when need be now in this specific interview he talked about a lot of the issues he sees right now with Tesla but he also mentioned his price Target and his 18-month projection for the market cap of Tesla now the crazy part about this whole story and this is what makes me so bullish is that the media mainstream media specifically CNBC in this case took this guy's interview and took one little sentence completely out of context making it sound as if this was a bearish interview when in fact the guy clearly said his price target for Tesla is 300 well above the current price and his 18month prediction for this company is $1.5 trillion market cap which is three times than when they are right now that makes me extra bullish when I see mainstream media feeding into a very negative narrative like this even though the verbiage in the interview was not bearish at all I like it because this tells me that we are in Peak negative sentiment which is exactly where I want to be as a long-term bull of Tesla which I am now look in my videos my goal is very simple I want to give you timely useful and factual analysis and then I'm going to add my own opinion on top clarifying exactly where my opinion starts and facts end so you can make up your own decision I'm not here to preach I'm not here to convince I'm not here to tell you to sell or buy this isn't investment advice this isn't financial advice just my own ramblings of a mment which might be inaccurate might be wrong you know the deal now I think right now this interview and the way it was handled by CNBC shows us that we are in Peak negative sentiment in fact when Den IES is going on CNBC and talks half the time about the problems of Tesla not just the good things he sees that's also a negative sign a strong bull like Dan IES talking 50% of the time about the problems he sees even though he gives it a 300 price Target even though he sees 3x in 18 months that's Peak negative sentiment I love it and the issue here is just that Game of Thrones price War that's happened in China with EVS it's it's hurt Tesla and I think right now the problem is do they continue to cut prices or do they ultimately hold and focus on where demand could be and I think as much as we talk about FSD and why we're long-term bullish and I do believe we're sitting here a year year and a half now at a trillion dollar plus Mar cap I think where we were dead wrong is underestimating just how bad China demand was going to be China demand for us when I look back that's really what's caught us I think many by surprise in terms of just how quickly demands come off but also with no adult in the room and with two disaster conference calls in a row they haven't laid out guidance they haven't given the strategy you've had other noise in terms of the AI issues with musk and and obviously the Delaware comp issue which is added to it but I think that that's the problem they haven't laid out the strategy to where investors right now feel like they're blindfolded plain darts that there our highest rating perform is your highest rating Al Perform it's on our top pixel list and I just view it is we've been through these White Knuckle periods before over the years this is another one now that we're hitting and we're just calling it out is that this is a nightmare in the near- term there's massive growth on the other side you need to handhold investors through it no different than we've seen Jensen cook and the others over the years what exactly did he say in this interview beyond the little short clip we just heard now he made seven points which I'll clarify right here in about 30 seconds you don't have to watch the entire clip just listen up now look number one he lowered his price Target from $315 to $300 whoppy freaking do number two he says he's still bullish longterm despite code red situation right now now I agree about the code red right now that's the peak sentiment I'm talking about and I also agree to the bullish long-term prediction now he also says that the main problem of Tesla right now is demand in China essentially what he's saying is that he didn't estimate how strong strong the competition in China is going to be especially going into price Wars between Tesla and some of these crazy ass Chinese manufacturers now when Tesla has about 30% of their sales in China and they're engaged in the price war against the Chinese that's a losing battle and that's going to hurt Tesla 100% he's right on that but I think that him pointing this out got completely taken out of context by CNBC he's pointing this as a factual thing and I agree Tesla has a pricing problem in China they have a demand problem they have to fix it somehow usually Tesla fixes this by selling better value Tesla like apple are really really good at selling value and selling ecosystem at a premium right now in Tesla's case they're engaged in pricing War in China which is the wrong type of game for them to play if you're talking about a basketball analogy if you're the sort of team that likes to run and score a lot you want to play standing slow game you want to play fast now he also says in this clip that his 18month price target for Tesla is $1.5 trillion market cap which is triple than when they are right now 3x now explain to me dear mainstream media how that is bearish I simply don't understand that now he says look I had a bad call no doubt I thought that China isn't going to be as challenging for Tesla as it turned out to be and that's the sort of guy then is he's going to be very honest even about his own shortcomings and his own mistakes that's fine now look here's the problem he says that the problem with this right now Beyond China is just the lack of transparency of management he says they need more guidance more explanation about the strategy and better management the way they communicate with the investing community and I agree to that the last two calls were not great that's a fact now again Dan is going to call it like he sees it but is this a structural problem with Tesla is not getting great conference calls and earnings and not communicating well enough is the structural problem that's going to destroy Tesla I doubt it is Chinese price Wars going to destroy Tesla well they're going to hurt Tesla but they're not going to destroy Tesla if you understand the business and where it's headed so again he also says something really important that only the real Bulls of Tesla understand and he says look we've been there we've done that it's just the same thing replaying all over again if you're a Tesla bull you know exactly what he means now he also says one more thing that I want you to listen to he says look guys I screwed up we didn't understand what's going on in China China is a lot more challenging everybody thought and I agreed to that but this is going to pull out of this eventually and they're a triple from this point on now my thoughts on this very very simple not a very bearish interview turned into a bearish interview by CNBC to increase clicks because that is the current sentiment you have to understand CNBC plays into the crowd if the crowd loves Tesla they're going to be more gentle if the crowds right now in Pitchfork mode and they all hate Tesla they're going to give the crowd what they want so them framing that D IES interview which was absolutely balanced with a little bit of a bullish sentiment into a bearish title tells me we are in Peak negativity which is exactly the time I want to buy now look here's the thing right now Tesla is about to hit 6 million Vehicles the global Fleet is about to hit 6 million Vehicles while we're talking about their failures right and they no longer compute constraint to train their models the FSD models and they're getting the most miles out of anybody who's trying to develop some sort of an autonomous driving system so it's clear that Tesla is going to be the first to solve FSD when that happens I don't know but it's clear to me that Tesla is going to be the winner whenever that day comes now the other thing is that you know Tesla retail Community Tesla investing retail Community has always been five years ahead of the institutional and always 5 years ahead of the mainstream media and it's unbelievable how this keeps happening in 2024 even after everything we know even after going through multiple cycles of the retail investing community of Tesla being ahead of the curve people still don't understand what to do in pick negativity they just bore the bandwagon and they just R it out absolutely insane to me now I think that Tesla has always been a transfer mechanism of money from the impatient people who don't fully understand the business to the patient long-term bulls and it's going to continue to do so paler is the same thing when I was buying paler at 7 at 8 at 9 at 10 at 11 12 13 14 15 I can go on all day you know that's the same thing people were happy to sell me the shares now stock is at 24 they're happy about again why not when it was seven when it was trading at discount now right now the most important price Targets in the market now most sside analysts are idiots but Dan IES is not an idiot he has 300 Morgan Stanley with 320 are not idiots that's a valid price Target and you don't see Cathy wood selling any Tesla stock right now again the Bulls the ones who understand the business give it a 300 plus price Target in fact kathywood has a crazy price Target way even higher than mine my long-term one is 1,400 for the stock which is 7x from here but that's the topic for a different video now right now Elan musk just opened FSD as a premium essentially letting people try out FSD without paying for limited amount of time that's that's that's a marketing technique from the software as a service World being utilized in the Auto industry the most Innovative thing I've seen in a while Tesla is building up right now A SAS business inside the Auto industry essentially software as a service 80% gross margin recurring Revenue uh scalable monopolistic quaz monopolistic business absolutely insane when FSD launches it's going to be such a cheat code it's going to be unbelievable and you see the crazy part about this whole thing is that the real Tesla Bulls are not complaining they're all quietly adding to their position they're all excited about this we pray for moments like this when we can double down on weakness increase our position at a discount without timing the market it's perfect the ideal setup for a long-term investor is to find a company whose performance is going like this and whose price is going like this that almost never happens I made an entire video explaining to you that's like dating a 10 out of 10 woman and finding that on Tinder and still having a great date I mean highly unlikely that's going to happen to you guys but hey if it happens to you that's your Tesla now to me Tesla is the perfect setup look at their revenue look at the amount of free cash flow they have look at how much money they're spending putting back into their business through Capital expenditures they increasing production they're putting more into their car than any other auto manufacturer and even with the margin erosion that we keep hearing about Tesla still has the best margins in the business after cutting prices now I look at this and I'm saying look price wings in the short term can screw with your head no doubt but it's best not to celebrate if the stock goes to 350 or 400 same thing like with penter I don't celebrate the 24 after being at seven there's no point in celebrating unrealized gains that way when the stock price drops I don't get sad when they have unrealized losses because it's just a temporary price swing don't let this thing screw with your head now the saleside analyst look they're watching the stock and they react to the sentiment on the street mostly not talking about Den eyes but all the other fluff you got to watch the business you got to watch the company freak the stock look at the business the business on a threeyear scale is improving exponentially yes they may not have the best year look at it this way they just had a 20% growth year and it's still considered not a not a good year mean look at the business look at the company don't look at the stock like the sside analyst this company can grow without debt because it has plenty of cash it's making money net income loads of cash no debt FSD Monopoly coming very very soon and on top of it they've become the gas station of America right now supercharged network is the standard everybody's going to use superchargers and Tesla operates these supercharges so they're no longer just an auto manufacturer they're literally the gas station of America as far as the goes um and FSD is going to be a monopoly not just in the vehicles themselves not just in the recurring 80% gross margin Revenue it's going to be licensable because it will become an industry standard and Tesla is going to license it out to every other other the manufacturer out there massive massive massive massive gains coming and that's why I double down on weakness and hold long term it's a cheat code unless you pick the horrible company which I don't think thises is over the long term you're going to be fine no company just goes 45 degrees like that it always will have bumps just roll with the punches now Dan has a 3x 18-month prediction I have a 7x let's say 24 36 month prediction I think Tesla is a $1,400 stock way way sooner than you think not the first time we've been through this look at the Tesla price swings over the past few years and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about",1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,dEAtlOZJexk,2024-03-29T18:50:10Z,Why I have never been more excited about Tesla,CNBC,Dan Ives one of the best in the business just came on CNBC for a few minutes to talk about Tesla's future... specifically CNBC in this case took this guy's interview and took one little sentence completely out of context making it sound as if this was a bearish interview when in fact the guy clearly said his price target for Tesla is 300... I think right now this interview and the way it was handled by CNBC shows us that we are in Peak negative sentiment in fact when Den IES is going on CNBC and talks half the time about the problems of Tesla not just the good things he sees that's also a negative sign... got completely taken out of context by CNBC... not a very bearish interview turned into a bearish interview by CNBC to increase clicks because that is the current sentiment you have to understand CNBC plays into the crowd if the crowd loves Tesla they're going to be more gentle if the crowds right now in Pitchfork mode and they all hate Tesla they're going to give the crowd what they want so them framing that D IES interview which was absolutely balanced with a little bit of a bullish sentiment into a bearish title tells me we are in Peak negativity which is exactly the time I want to buy,1.0,-0.7

Tom Nash,QSlSq44Y1EA,2024-03-19T19:30:57Z,Tesla is a GENERATIONAL investment opportunity at this price (here’s what I’m doing),Tesla,"I'm making a move doubling down on Tesla which will make me millions of dollars a lot sooner than people think now allow me to explain what I mean and I'm going to use a little bit of an analogy here so forgive me for that little story I'm about to put you through now I've not been dating for many many years I've been married since 2010 but even though the dating world has changed dramatically since I used to date the core principles didn't change you know Tinder didn't change the fact that all dudes they look for the same thing which is a woman that is you know stunning and smart and independent and all that stuff but also a woman that not fully aware that she's a 10 you know what I mean like a woman who's a 10 but she thinks she's an eight right that's the perfect combo ideally that's the perfect date right that rarely happens that fantasy Almost Never happens because you know people are aware of themselves they're self-aware and you know if a woman is a high you know high quality woman that looks good and she's very smart and accomplished usually she's going to have the right attitude to come along with that and that's fine I have no issues with that now in the world of investing the same thing happens it's very very hard to find a stock that is also over absolutely every metric perfect but is undervalued because you know when a stock is doing great on the fundamental level on the business level it's an open information you know everybody's seeing it so everybody knows that that's a great stock and everybody piles in and you know flood the DMS so to speak of of that stock and and push it upwards and that's also fine that's how you know perfect Market Works information gaps are closed almost instantaneously so when I see a stock that has fundamentals going one way up and price going one way down and I see this weird movement the Piner movement where the price keeps dropping but the quality of the company keeps Rising I'm saying to myself oh my god this is my 10 that thinks it's a seven I have to get in on this I have to double down on this stock now the reason I've used this analogy is to show you that Tesla even though it's been beaten down like crazy over the past uh you know 3 months it's down 35% since the peak of 2021 late 2021 it's down 60% it's been beaten down it's been absolutely HED on every single analyst told you it's dead money you have to drop it it's not going anywhere EV demand is going nowhere you know FSD is useless and you're seeing other car makers struggle to put out profitable EV segments you know we've seen that happen we've seen what just happened with Fisker many many failures um and it's just too expensive for analysts all of a sudden that told you just a couple years ago that it's perfectly priced now obviously some of it has to do with El you know robbing certain people the wrong way and I get that I have no issues with that but at the end of the day whatever you think about Elon whatever you think about Tesla right now factually speaking Tesla is at Peak negative sentiment that's a factual statement mean Tesla has not been hated on more than it is right now by the investing Community by analysts by mainstream media it is literally considered to be dead money right now it had a little bit of a good day yesterday but the sentiment is still quite negative now I'm looking at this and I'm saying well guys hold up a second this is a stock that for the past two and a half years lost 60% of its value so the stock is garbage right stock is garbage but the company on the other hand for the past two and a half years let's look what the company done for the past three three years right so um I'm getting excited so the wars kind of get mangled up and that's okay now for the past three years revenue is up 200% for the past 3 years net income is up 1, 1600% cash and short-term Investments is up 400% assets up 300% and liabilities are up 80% so let me get this straight for those three years that net income went, 1600% up revenues up 200% cash up 400% assets up 3% for those three years where the company absolutely killed it at the same time this stock has been discounted by 60% so are you telling me I can buy this beautiful car which used to sell for $100,000 for $40,000 right now is that what you're saying it's the same car right there the no it's not the same car this car is actually better this is a way better model with more power with more features it's it's all you know Decked Out etc etc it's actually a better car so wait you're telling me this is a way better car than the one you were selling for 100 and now it's selling for 40 I'll take it now by the way if you just want to look at the past year for Tesla because that's also a valued the argument maybe Tesla had a horrible year well that's also not really the case for the past year revenues are up 20% net income is up 20% cash and short-term Investments are up 100% uh assets are up 30% liabilities are up 18% and it's trading five and a half time sales five and a half time sales and 40 price the earnings it's not trading at crazy levels it's absolutely the cheapest we've seen it in a long long time now there's no doubt in my mind that the fundamentals of the company the way they should be analyzed by any you know long-term investor which is the growth the cash position the profitability um the multiples it's all getting better while the stock price is getting bat down I mean the stock literally lost a third of its value in the past three months right but even if you go beyond this fundamental analysis and you kind of look at what they they have in the pipeline and not getting excited about this it's almost a their Winan survival test look as far as FSD full self driving goals I don't know if any of you guys had experience with 12.3 I had a little experience with that and it's absolutely mind-blowingly good uh I mean I've never seen anything like this FSD is going to be a full set driving autonomous driving whatever you want to call it Tesla has it they're the only ones are going to able to figure that out whatever happens whether it takes a year or 5 years or 10 years to go full autonomous it's going to be Tesla who's going to get it done for the simple reason because they're the closest right now and they're running faster than everybody else so what do I mean by that well think about it like it's a race right whoever gets there first so Tesla is currently leading by vast vast amounts of Gap right and they're running fastest which means they're accumulating way more data at higher speed and they have so much more cars that are adding every year essentially widening the Gap and they have a already the far superior than anything else whatever kind of driver systems sorry driver assist systems out there ain't nothing comes close to FSD definitely not 12.3 so that thing is not only going to become an industry standard much like you know back in the day how Intel chips were basically driving every single computer out there so FSD is going to drive every single Software System of a vehicle in the next 15 years because it's going to be industry standard uh just like you know power windows used to be not a thing and you used to do that thing with your with your hand remember that and then all of a sudden it became standard power windows power steering Wheeling right steering Wheeling you know what I mean power steering wheel that thing became a standard now every car has it so FSD is going to be in every car and Tesla is going to drive it uh beyond the fact that it's going to generate nice profits for Tesla its own Vehicles not even to mention the fact that autonomous taxing networks whenever they come uh Tesla is going to be the one that's going to be first and they have no competitors I mean there's no number two um and charging they've already kind of become the standard right everybody else basically gave up on building their own charging infrastructure so they're actually an energy supplier if you think about it they have the you know the biggest supercharging Network in the world and nobody's building new ones so and they're expanding it so they're becoming a if not already become a monopoly in charging of electric vehicles the energy business which nobody kind of talks about anymore grew 100% over the past year from 3 to 6 billion Mega packs are literally industry standard already um and they're still going to push out 2 and a half million vehicles in 2024 and they just entered the uh pickup truck segment in the US which is the best segment to be in not even to mention the fact that they literally are the first who started working on humanid Robotics and they seem to be in the lead I mean if we're talking about human and Robotics you need to understand what kind of a size of Market of total addable Market we're talking about here uh by 2030 according to all studies there's going to be shortage of 85 million workers uh things that people don't want to do um smelly jobs the low paying jobs the dangerous jobs um you know food retail security bomb removal you know what I mean so all these jobs that are paying 50 60k a year which nobody wants to do there's 85 million people missing that don't want to do these jobs and that is going to be filled up by human robotics it's already a thing it's kind of known thing so I'm not saying Tesla is going to grab 5% or 10% or 50% of that market I don't know but they definitely going to grab some part of that market and if you think about it the employer cost of an employee it's right for an employee that you know earns let's say $45 $50,000 a year it's about 60 $65,000 a year as an employer cost now that robot they're going to buy from Tesla whomever and I think a lot of Tesla robots will be sold it's not going to get horny it's not going to get tired it's not going to skip work it's going to do it's perfectly it's not going to have breaks it's going to be able to work 247 so how much would that robot be worth for a company so let's say half of what it costs to run an employee so let's say 30k even though I think they actually should be paying more but let's say 30,000 so multiply 85 million employees missing by 2030 by 30,000 we're talking about a$2 and A5 trillion dollar market now I don't know how much of a Tesla is going to capture or not I'm personally in the camp that they're going to capture quite a lot of it but let's not get ahead of ourselves I'm just saying look if you look at Tesla right now and you're saying well Tesla has been beaten down sure H Tesla is a horrible stock sure but look Tesla is also a great company at $500 billion it's not an cheap car company I agree if you're looking for a car company if you think that Tesla is purely a car company at $500 billion yeah maybe not the best deal but that 500 billion energy software Robotics and vehicles come on it's a no-brainer",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,Z83F4C7Zlxg,2024-03-15T14:48:01Z,Every Palantir Myth (BUSTED in 11 minutes),Palantir,"okay so piler has a major problem and we got to talk about it right now so I don't have time to make the all shebang produce video but I want you to look at this chart right here this is the institutional shareholding of paler over the course of the last three years so this would be Q3 of 2021 Q2 of 2021 q1 of 2021 and so forth and so forth and this last column is Q4 of last year now what I want you to pay attention to which is very interesting here is that institutional shareholders such as Black Rock such as Vanguard such as Goldman Sachs and others they're all buying the stock while you were being pumped this fud fear and certainty of doubt about how paler has so much delusion how paler is actually a consultany business masquerading as a software company yes we had that how paler is a complete blackbox business which nobody knows what they really work how they do it what the software is like and most favorite the Ros Gerber the evil argument paler is evil and it's spying after you and that's why we shouldn't support it so all of this came about over the course of the last three years so while mainstream media was feeding you all this narratives about how paler is not investable the institutional shareholders the smart money the people who actually know what they're doing definitely buy like crazy during those few years where all this fear uncertainty and doubt was being pumped to you by mainstream media and social media I just want to show you what the smart money has been doing now I'm here in stock MVP and this is a chart that shows something that cannot be argued against you know facts and objective data is very very good at debunking arguments because there's nothing that you can tell me that's going to change the facts and the facts are that while you were being pumped all this negativity about paler day in Day Out M media social media YouTube X Instagram Tik Tok God knows where well you being pumped all this negativity look at this this is the shareholding that's being increased exponentially by institutional investors now we're talking about the Goldman Sachs of the world the Vanguard the black rocks the Barkley and you can see every quarter how the institutional shareholding of piler was increasing throughout the entire three years period while you were being pumped the fud while the retail investors being told stay away from this company the smart money has been buying like crazy look at this in mid of 2021 June of 2021 institutional shareholders held 400 million shares of paler fast forward to Q4 of 2023 that went up to 856 so 100% plus increase in institutional shareholding in paler within a span of 3 years in which you were being told that the company is not good enough for your money now I've been saying all along that it is extremely undervalued and I've been saying all along that you being pumped but some people listen some people don't now I'm hearing some new fud coming out from the woodwork I've seen a few articles a few people who are telling you that now the new fud is that paler is now a perfect company they have everything that it takes they're terrific company etc etc no criticism whatsoever towards the company no ution no consultancy no black box it's not evil with the exception of a few anti-semites who basically criticize it for sticking up to Israel which I don't have a problem with at all um but now the new fud is that it is just too darn expensive the company is just too darn expensive it's great but at this price you don't want to touch it now let me ask you something if I show you in this video something that justifies the excitement about paler will you go on these guys pages on these guys social media profiles and their YouTube channels and will you post my video and Link it so they can watch it maybe they learn something new well let's see if you take me up on my offer but let's be serious here for a second and over the course of the past year and a half penter increased the amount of boot camps and for the better term let's let's convert the word boot camp to the word funnel boot camps are essentially marketing funnels for paler with extremely high conversion rates they're probably the best converting funnel marketing funnel in existence and they've increased the amount of boot camps they R from 80 to 1,600 and still they're over subscribed which means there's more people who want to get in that they have seats that was the last AIP con as well way more people wanted to get in and you have all these companies explaining why piler completely changed their business I've been saying it for years I've been showing you that for years watch my video about Airbus how pader took and increased Airbus production by 33% the a350 and kept the level of quality in fact increased it absolutely insane these are unspeakable things that people were afraid to voice because the narrative was so trendy to on paler and people were saying well piler is just not good enough and they were basically getting clicks and Cloud off of hating piler but right now what you're seeing on the screen is actually the truth now I don't want to take a step away from institutional shareholders because we're not going to be chasing ing the stock because other people bought it I don't Advocate this on my patreon group pat.com Nash shout out to the academy members I don't Advocate buying or saying anything you know because somebody else did it maybe they bought it because they're idiots I don't know I'd like to evaluate stuff on my own I'm just using this as an indicator to show you that you know while you're being pumped all this negativity a lot of people with lots of money and lots of connections they've been actually buying I'm going to change my view here so you you can see it a little bit better so over the past 3 years as you can see right here the revenue of poer went up by 103% so this company increased their revenues in 3 years by 103% the gross profit of the company went up by 142% at the same time so they're definitely squeezing more lemonade from the lemons now that's just the beginning hang out a second now here's the crazy part at the same time while Revenue went up by 103% 3 years the operating expens of p 3 years went down by 12 a half% show me a company that generates 103% growth in Revenue over the course of three years while bringing down operating expenses by 12 a half% that's literally like if you had a video game and you had to make a company that's perfect that would be the attribute you would put in it it is unheard of i' I've never seen this now if you scroll down here a little bit and you take a look at ebda ebda the past three years is up6 % as well but here is the crazy part look at net income right here net income might not be huge yet but look at the growth 157% just in the past year and honestly that's not even the most exciting part look at free cash flow one of my favorite metrics free cash flow is up 325 over the past 3 years 325 per in three years free cash flow now you can't tell me that this business isn't scaling like something I've never seen before and a of it we actually know that they have no debt $3 billion of cash and they have four times more assets than liabilities we have this idea of how valuations should look like how multiples should look like and I totally get it when we draw a mathematical equation right 2 + 2 equal 4 and if we have five that means we did the calculation wrong right it's very very simple every calculation has a right and wrong answer and people tend to think of valuations as some sort of a mathematical equation and if you have a result that must be right because you've done all the right things you used the right multiples you were conservative enough you've done all the things they told you in business school in your MBA or how to do valuations and that's why you cannot be mistaken but here's the crazy part with valuations unlike math with valuations you can do all the right things all the right decisions apply all the right multiples and still get the wrong result there's so much unknown unknowns as far as this company goes the macro goes hell the entire world goes we just don't know what's going to happen and you have all these so-called experts showing you well we did all the right calculations that peners definitely overvalue perhaps and perhaps not but here's the thing the only way to make money in the market for retail investors like me and like you because I don't think black rock is watching my videos is because we get to make money in uncertainty because you see while they have the better models 57,000 tabs and Excel spreadsheet with the DCF and they've done all the correct calculations but there's one thing we as R investors do better than all of this smart money all these professional experts we are comfortable in uncertainty we are comfortable in not being sure we are comfortable in applying a success of future projects that are not easily quantifiable in the DCF people that are professionals experts they can't stand it we are able to operate an environment where uncertainty is an opportunity for us to make money simple as that and when you think about it it's actually insane how the most simple thing for us which is to allow uncertainty allow potten poal and allow imagination into these calculations into our valuations is almost Unthinkable when their head explodes when they professionals try to do so that's the only place retail investors can find Arbitrage can find opportunities in the land of uncertainty we're not going to compete with them on better models they're going to have the better DCF the better research and all that stuff the only place when we can beat them is long-term uncertain potential which is pader word by word actually now look paler might pull back the stock market might pull back no Market has ever gone up forever but here's the thing when pener pulls back and corrects and it will some people will Panic s because they think that's the end but they are hardcore penter investors the long-term people who have faith in this company for the next 10 to 15 years they're going to view this dip as another opportunity to improve their cost basis and they will disate into weakness and so forth and so forth that's going to keep happening years in years out the people who are try to be opportunistic about the stock they're going

Tom Nash,QmF3KcTvtsc,2024-03-14T16:24:52Z,Palantir CEO Alex Karp Leaves CNBC Interviewer SPEECHLESS,Palantir,"he's essentially saying look you got to be high to short a stock like paler knowing what you know about the trajectory of this company that was the point he made. an actual working product which you can take home and start paying paler within hours with slight adjustment obviously but that is insane to me not just because of how easy it is to show value to your clients not just because it's going to be a great funnel for paler to bring bring on way more business that people even imagine but because the margins are absolutely insane. the thing is with piler it's not going to be that simple this company has all it takes to go against you it has the punch it packs a heavy one it has the right team it has lots of money lots of resources and it has a superior product so I think this thing actually splits down the middle. now with penter you don't have to pigeon hole that product and try to shove it into customers's mouth and try to tailor fit it custom fit it push it down their throat you can actually build something brand new that's custom tailored to your client specifically to the te because they don't need to raise any money they don't need external Capital they have billions of dollars in the bank no debt and they can take their time. that's why I see this as a massive massive opportunity if you're arguing with me about $20 or $115 or $25 or $35 for this company you're not seeing the future at the very minimum this is a$ 250 to $300 billion company currently trading at 50 or 60 I mean no brainer again not FAL advice just my opinion might be the ramblings of a Madman but to me it's quite evident. paler always benchmarks itself versus itself the idea of what he says here is always we will try to get better versus the previous version of ourselves we don't care about the competition we're got them that's easy but we got to get better so things don't get sale I absolutely love that. one use case I'm very very excited about is our work that's now public with Panasonic battery so this clip he actually says hey we're working with ponic. it shows you the Simplicity and the genius and the combination of both of peners it is simply genius simple as that. he's talking about paler scaling from 80 to 1,600 boot camps a year which is just around the corner a couple years ago we were doing like 70 80 90 Pilots a year and now in the next year we're going to do you know 20 times that. especially with a company like paler that has traditionally transferred a lot of wealth from the impatient to the patient investors and it's not going to change. people are recommending our product one to another. Titan is a $180 million contract for the next two years of piler very impressive but this is just a start this is the pilot of the massive multi-billion dollar contract that piler will get once this pilot is over. pet actually owns a ton of paler stock in fact 140 million shares of paler. the fud the fear uncertainty and doubt about paler seems to be dying down short interest is dropping we saw 7% just a few years ago we're at 5% now institutional investors are pouring like crazy into paler we went from 35% to almost 50% absolutely insane. karp said this 15 years ago this product is going to be the most important software product in the world and pante is going to be the most important software company in the world. pener is just as important as Nvidia and yet because of Market misunderstanding there's a huge Arbitrage a huge opportunity in which it is not priced as Nvidia in regards to its importance in this new Revolution which makes it an absolutely underpriced undervalued underrated company. piler has probably one of the most exciting CEOs right now in the market and this guy gives zero he's brutally honest and he's going to step on some toes but guess what he's a s of guy who's going to take paler from two billion to 20 billion Revenue per year.",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,S-CgH4C1-5M,2024-03-11T19:19:12Z,Michael Saylor Leaves Entire CNBC Panel SPEECHLESS,MicroStrategy,"I want to talk about how you think about a micro strategy in your company as a proxy for Bitcoin now that ETFs are available to the public. Micro strategy got leverage if we borrowed $800 million at 62 basis points is there any company in the world that you wouldn't like to invest in that could borrow a billion dollars at less than 1% interest to invest in your best idea so we get that very intelligent leverage it's uh it's non-recourse it's unsecured and then we buy Bitcoin with it that leverage gives us volatility the vola it gives us performance the performance gives us volatility the volatility attracts Capital it's uh it's given our shareholders more Bitcoin per share this week than they had a few weeks ago so it's very ACC creative for them and it's pretty compelling for every investor if you're Bitcoin curious right now and you want to buy Bitcoin at the all-time high how do you get the upside in Bitcoin with downside protection micro strategy sold 800 million in debt and we have 12 13 billion dollars of Bitcoin on the balance sheet so so we're giving you an over collateralized loan and the up side but if you're a Bitcoin maximalist and you love Bitcoin and you want to hold it forever the ETFs charge you 25 basis points micro strategy is a creting we're giving you a yield against your shares in a tax efficient fashion so the maximal is like the equity the uh the hedgers they kind of like the upside with downside protection. Now he was asked a very interesting follow-up question which was essentially look Mike there's a lot of ETFs coming up right now that are dealing with Bitcoin and micro strategy is you know essentially just a Bitcoin ETF right now so what makes you better than these other ETFs and what I think he said was very very smart he said look number one we don't have any fees which is a great point because retail investors chronically ignore fees in their profit calculation fees are key and he doesn't have any the other point he's making is that look we're essentially buying Bitcoin on Leverage we're getting cheap loans we're paying virtually no interest and we're buying Bitcoin that's appreciating way higher than our leverage so we're actually multiplying your Bitcoin return tfold by doing the strategy as long as Bitcoin keeps coming up obviously you know there's a downside to this but there's protections to that as well what essentially he's saying here is that micro strategy is a Fess ETF that's also leverage Bitcoin ETF which means you kind of get to overextend yourself if you're actually a Bitcoin maximalist. There's 10 ETFs already and there's micro strategy but I think micro strategy actually carries a bigger punch and that explain why obviously you heard from Mike about the fees I totally agree no fees is a huge benefit but here's the thing what Michael sailor is doing with micro strategy is essentially my own system which is DCA dollar cross average at all times basically he buys non-stop Bitcoin some of these other players are going to have to play the market play the price time the market try to get in get out Michael S buys at all times and I'm sure without knowing without asking him that he buys more when the price comes down which is essentially my system of dollar Coss average and dollar Coss average double when the price drops that assures that Michael seller is to have the lowest price the lowest cost base of Bitcoin out of everybody else now my friend Jesse da who one of the best upcoming young YouTubers in the finance space who I'm hosting on my show live today at 4 pm he actually thinks that micro strategy can go all the way to 10 to 115,000 which essentially is a 10x from here but before you go pile in completely into Bitcoin or micro strategy look I'm sure even if you ask Jesse he's going to tell you the same thing you can't Pile in into this thing hoping for the best putting all your money immediately you have have to slowly get in slowly dollar cost average look at it as a 10year project not as a 40-day project not as a one quarter project is a 10 to 15 year investment when you zoom out everything starts making sense.",0.98,0.9

speak and today he did not disappoint very uh exquisitly happy about how well we're doing both in the government and commercially paler with somebody that has been hired 5 days ago that can't write code that's very smart may not speak English and is just enter the Enterprise is doing that workflow we're going to show you what happens in 4 to 6 hours as opposed to what happened in your whole Enterprise over the last two years been able to meet demand we've had to tell people we couldn't accommodate them we have hundreds of people coming not just people but leaders of industry and if you just look at it from the internal dynamics of how do you deal with the Contracting how do you deal with the implementation it's true these things have gone from taking us 3 months to 4 hours but it's also true what the idea is you cram four months wor worth of work into a day in these boot camps right we it is not even a day it's it's ours people fight us or fight Enterprises that are doing the most important work with slick Powerpoints and great steak dinners we're bad at slick PowerPoints we're even worse at steak dinners we don't play golf what we do do is we play software we will put if you want to actually compete compete on your product and I would also like a lot of those people asking the question by the way are not academic they are investors in paler and they have supported us when we were down on the ropes and those are the people that we are fighting for let's go over what he said analyze it break it down let's get start right away so first of all he basically was saying one important thing here which got lost a little bit in the SE of that he was trying to be fed by the guy who's interview him not a huge fan of that guy but it is what it is look I'm going to call it like I see it sometimes I feel interviewers get paler sometimes I feel interviewers don't get paler that guy seemed like he wasn't really in it but you know sometimes that's what you got to deal with as the CEO of a public company it is what it is no Alex said look the beauty of this software building here the beauty of the solution is that we can take a person off the street zero experience zero understanding no coding no English put him in driver seat of this thing and he'll make you smart informed decisions that data scientists spend month on that's the beauty of it who doesn't want that as a company who doesn't want that as a government that's why everything is over subscribed up to wo that's why everybody's trying to get a seat at Aon because this is a cheat code essentially what they're selling is a cheat code for a video game for unlimited strength come on now he also talks about the fact that the new Industrial Revolution is starting and some will miss it because they think that horses are more efficient than engines and I get it it always happens there's always these few people who miss the revolution I think he's absolutely right he also talks about the fact that now with aibon with the boot camps they can really show you a working product within four to six hours now imagine and having being in the room many many times in those meetings when you come in to a client I worked for deoy for many many years was a senior manager we come in and we try to pitch a product a solution so we come in with a PowerPoint we come in with some sort of an explanation a demo a mockup what we can do now he's basically saying look guys this is old school stuff we come in with a working product for you so we come in Imagine like if somebody's trying to offered me editing services and it's like oh Tom we would love to edit videos for your YouTube channel we're going to increase your click through rate we're going to do that and that and that and that or a guy walks in off the street it's like yo I have a software that just edited re-edited a 100 of your last videos and I did in 4 hours and it looks 100 times better than any other editor has ever done it and we can scale it and do it on every video and it's going to take minutes and it's going to cost you one tenth of what you would pay an actual editor my head would explode if that happens by the way volunteer where's the b2c product for me I need it but I'm just saying like this is like the mind-blowing stuff that people don't understand why is it over subscribed why is it absolutely everybody's going Gaga because they I mean it's it's a cheat code now look he says we don't come with the promise we don't come with PowerPoint presentations we come with a working product that's better than anything you ever seen before I mean that's why we beat companies you know simple as that now he was asked about a b2c product a business to consumer product he didn't answer that question which I don't think he should have but he hinted kind of if you understand how to read this guy he kind of hinted at the fact that they may have something in the works in the future I don't know we'll see I don't think that pan is V is derived as a b2c company I've said it multiple times even if stays a B2B if you look at Salesforce a pure B2B play it's still 10x undervalued now if paler goes b2c and successfully does so not even talking about 500 I don't know how to quantify that now look at paler let's look at paler objectively right now right okay cool so this company has revenues that are increasing it has a net income margin that's close to 10% massive piles of cash $3 billion five times more assets and liabilities lots of lots of cash no debt short interest of 5% institutional shareholding that's doubled over the past three years scalability AB du wazu margins are going up prices are going up revenues are going up expenses flat or coming down I'll show you in a second the insanity of what I'm about to show you and the stock has done very well since IPO unlike Snowflake and the founder is still the and he ain't going nowhere so I mean what more can you ask now you can listen to guys like rishy galura out of RBC who just a few days ago gave you a $5 price T gift of paler and all due respect to Mr galura um this guy gave paler at 12 times cell rating at $5 since May of 2023 if I'm not mistaken um he cost you 260% if you listen to him that's all I'm saying like if you listen to Rishi galura for RBC you missed out on 260% this year simple could have been worse could have been worse you could have listened to his Zoom recommendation which is a buy at $59 in 2020 that didn't really work out is $63 oh my goodness so yeah so you can listen to the bears that are still remaining for paler or you can actually get with the program and see that fundamentally this kind this kind of thing doesn't come along way often this is a Tesla level of of a company right here and it's not priced accordingly yet now it's not here to say that paler is going from 25 to 500 no we might see paler 15 in couple months maybe in a couple weeks it's a Fallout all company but again you have to look at it at a 10-year increment where would paler be in 10 years what's more likely paler in 10 years being double than what it is right now or Nvidia being double than what it is right now going from $2.2 trillion to $4.4 trillion for NVIDIA I don't think it's as likely as P going from 50 to 100 billion all I'm saying but hey to each their own decis is not Financial advice just Rams of amendment my own opinion doing research now look the thing is with Palante what they're saying to you is the data operating software that's going to become kind of the gold standard much like I just mentioned Nvidia which is building the infrastructure for this AI environment paler is giving you the software solution now the crazy part about this I think it's better than Nvidia why because I think it's much easier and more scalable to produce the software than the hardware for this new AI Revolution Gold Rush Industrial Revolution whatever you call call it now look we have hundreds of hours of content if not thousands explaining what paler does exactly including multiple interviews I've done myself multiple videos with case studies if by this point in March of 2024 you still feel like you don't understand what poer does you're either lazy or you're willfully intentionally misleading people or you just fail to listen and understand what this company does there's no excuse not to understand what the product is what poer does with the hundreds if not thousands of hours of explanations out there on YouTube alone not even talking about the resources you have on the web now let me show you some numbers here and this is the thing that gets me excited gets me out of bed every morning Revenue three years ago was $1.1 billion Revenue right now $2.2 billion 100% increase in Revenue while at the same time the gross profit grew by 140% from 740 million to 1.8 billion so you have revenues going up by 100 gross profit going goes up by goes up by 140% I'm getting excited I'm sorry it is what it is so at the same time R&D expenses for the past 3 years go down from 560 to 400 so revenues up 100 gross profit up 140% R&D expenses down 30% sgna down 6% so we have revenues coming up margins coming up expenses coming down operating income just 3 years ago negative 1.2 billion past 12 months plus 120 million in 3 years they went from negative a billion point2 to positive 120 million capex flat 15 million this is this is absolutely insane this company spends only $15 million a year on Capital expenditures a company that drives 2.2 billion in sales now look at the institutional shareholding of this company just three years AO AO three years ago 600,000 shares right now 860,000 shares 42% increase in institutional shareholding in 3 years years while you were being told by mainstream media to sell this because it's garbage they were gobbling it up look at the chart in stock MVP you can see that through past three years they've been buying every single quarter while you being fed this nonsense it's F about the delution and all this crap they were buying and they still are by the way free cash flow three years ago negative 300 million right now positive 700 million up 300% three years assets up 70% three years liabilities down 20% this is insane this is video game numbers with an 80% gross margin no debt and 3 billion in cash I mean why are we bro are we talking about practice we're talking about practice here not the game practice I'm just kidding shout out to Ellen Iverson the famous rant I mean what are we doing here guys and of course this may not be the investment for you and I get it paler isn't for everyone I totally understand and if that's not the stock for you right ahead there's plenty of other options but for me looking at the fundamentals looking at the numbers the objective data it's mindblowing to me how people fail to see that this is just the beginning I'll see you in the next one",1.0,1.0

Tom Nash,wjLp6gApn7g,2024-03-02T18:13:20Z,Aswath Damodoran Leaves Entire CNBC Panel SPEECHLESS,Nvidia,only one of the stocks look significantly overvalued which Invidia and it's actually the stock that's gone up the most so that can be taken as an indication that I either have no idea what I'm talking about the Market's doing things that I just don't understand so in this clip he talks about Nvidia and how he thinks in Nvidia is overvalued but I think the point he's making here is not so much about Nvidia but the entire market and how that market right now is pricing AI in exuberant levels I don't think I've ever seen a company celebrated as much as inia Jensen Wong is the greatest CEO ever walked the face of the Earth and this company cannot be stopped at least that's a perception the problem wooden momentum is everything at some point in time the fever breaks in this clip his point is very simple Nvidia is overvalued but that point is actually just a way to communicate the greater message which is yes I'm talking about Nvidia being overvalued but the entire stock market right now in my opinion it's aswa in this clip the entire stock market is completely overvaluing artificial intelligence and that leads to exuberant valuations that don't match any sort of modeling Financial modeling that we are aware of that we have ever applied. Nvidia is still not expensive it's actually still the cheapest of all of the AI stocks it's way cheaper than AMD it's cheaper than Marvel it's even cheaper than Intel at this at this point right so I still think there is room for expectations to continue to go up I think so now even though you don't see Stacy rasan on TV every single day but he's definitely very well respected he's one of the best in the business he basically says look this is the cheapest AI artificial intelligence stock to be buying right now and the way asth responded to this clip was actually very interesting when you make pricing statements against a subgroup stocks in this case AI stocks and say it's the cheapest of the AI stocks that might very well be true but they might all be overvalued I think at the moment the the fact that I think we have to accept as AI is real it's going to make a real difference to business and I think Invidia is in the front seat of that market that said though that pathway is not as easy and as and as um as open to profits as the market seems to be assuming it is I mean right now Nidia is in a strange place you ask me it's it's a great trade but not a very good investment the question to to ask now if you're an investor is if I get in now what am I pricing it I mean if you back out from the pricing the $2 trillion market cap what inia has to do break even it's got to add about $400 billion in revenues it's got to add 400 billion revenues to what it has as revenues right now that's a daunting task it's plausible but if investing is about the game of the probable and you play the plausible game you're setting yourself up to lose near term they will beat their revenue and earnings targets because there know all engines are are are firing at at at full force right now so I wouldn't be surprised upon the next earnings report they took their earnings expectations and beat them again which is what pricing is all about that's why I said it's a good trade is in the near term they're more likely to deliver upside surprises but in the long term when you price the company to be the best company ever what is the upset and before everybody goes off and sells their Nidia stock hang on a second you have to understand that asth is a very Nuance guy here's the point he's making here he's not saying that Nvidia is going to crash he's not saying that the AI is a bubble it's a DOT and all that stuff that's not what he's saying he's saying look right now Nvidia is priced to Perfection it is priced to have the best CEO of all time Jensen wing it is priced to be the best company of all time for the next 10 years and it is priced for massive growth for about 60% of Revenue growth for a year for the next 5 years consecutively and while it is quite posible that that's going to hold up for 2025 what the hell do we know about 2027 2028 what he's saying is a few things here number one when he says Nidia is overvalued what he's meaning is that we're going to see some corrections on the way up he doesn't think that Nvidia is a Bad Company he doesn't think that it's vaporware it doesn't think it's hype he's just telling you hey a correction is due no company goes up in a 45 degree angle that doesn't happen number two he also talks about the fact that when you price companies to Perfection it's very hard to make money while you still make money on Nvidia if everything goes according to plan and their perfection actually pans out you don't make as much money as choosing companies a little bit earlier on the hype cycle on the sentiment cycle it's the same thing with penter when piler was priced at $7 and at $15 it's not the same quality of deal as buying it right now at $25 it's just math and what he's saying hey if you're getting into Nvidia right now make sure you understand you're buying total success total Perfection and that's a very hard thing to predict he's basically saying look if you're buying Nidia right now go right ahead it's a great company but you have no room for any screw-ups no room for risk if anything goes south that valuation will not hold up it's not the same thing as buying nid 300 400 buying it right now at 800 900 and that's a valid point and I'm sure that despite my video most people will misunderstand what he's saying here he's not bashing Nvidia and he's not saying there's an AI bubble that's about to crash he's saying that Nvidia will have a correction the overall Market will have a correction because that's how stock markets work there's always a bull market a correction and a continuation of bull market that's just the way things are the one thing he didn't say in this video which I wish he had is how to play this as a the long-term investor the question is okay if that's the case how the hell do we play this if we sell now if we wait the stock might go way higher before it corrects again we might not be able to get back in before a th000 etc etc all these timing the market questions that people always have and I keep telling you hey that's the wrong approach the only way to invest in a company like Nvidia if you have decided that Nvidia is the company of the future is the sort of business you want to own in 2033 they're going to be the hardware base of AI everywhere if that's the case there's only one way to buy Nvidia and hold Nvidia which is dollar cost average opposite when the stock is going up slowly buy more every time except the fact that you're buying at the top but when the stock drops on bad days bad macro days bad inflation days bad sentiment when bad news come out either macro or specifically about the company and they don't change the overall assumptions you have about the basic fundamentals of the business you buy more you buy more when the stock drops you buy less when the stock climbs but you buy at all times and in that case if Nidia Remains the hardware base of the entire AI industry if in 2033 they're one of the greatest companies in the world then you have a cost base in this company in five 6 7 8 9 10 years that is way closer to the bottom without timing the market at all simple as that.,1.0,-0.2

Tom Nash,DL7N1tKF5VM,2024-02-28T19:13:41Z,Great News For TESLA,Tesla,"I do think it also shows you a lot about Tesla because if Apple a company that's used to selling premium products selling value and not price that could have sold the $100,000 $120,000 vehicle no problem this company is saying hey even at 120,000 this thing is not profitable just goes to show you that Tesla with 35 to 55,000 pop which is what they charge in model 3 and the model y have the best margins in the entire Auto industry not just the eveve industry they have the Holy Grail they have the secret sauce and people still refuse to understand how massive it is the Tesla is not just profitable of of VVS and the only one to do so including the Chinese that haven't yet figured this out the Tesla not just is profitable it is the most profitable out of the entire Auto industry which is absolutely insane to me now what I find also amusing here is that while we all know that famous story about how Elon Musk tried to save Tesla he tried to get Tim Cook to buy Tesla well rather to have apple by Tesla and he tried to arrange a meeting with Tim Cook and Tim Cook basically would not take the meeting imagine not even taking the time to give Elon Musk a polite no not even taking the meeting he was too big for that now obviously that's a point of regret for Apple at this point but you know nevertheless you live and learn and also I don't think that things were that bad for Apple anyways it seems to have worked out fine for everyone I'm sure IL musk is happy about not selling the company at this point now another thing about Tesla which is peculiar is while this announcement came out yesterday Tesla is announcing that their Roadster is going to come out in 2025 and it's going to have a 0 to 60 of under 1 second now just to think about it one second car blows my mind and the crazy part about this is that El tweeted wait this is not even the most interesting thing about this car it's going to blow your mind so I know that El likes to promise a lot I know but hey so far on every vehicle he promised he delivered it's a massive fail for Apple it's a huge win for Tesla just goes to show you how important the work that Tesla is doing and how good they are at what they're doing kind of also shows you where the market is headed as far as who's going to dominate the EV industry for the next 10 years Tesla byd maybe some other Chinese companies VW perhaps Toyota if they're pulled their stuff together at this point we'll see.",1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,DL7N1tKF5VM,2024-02-28T19:13:41Z,Great News For TESLA,Apple,"hey this is Tom Nash and the long awaited 10year $162 billion Apple electric vehicle that project is gone it's finished it cancelled it is kaput Apple winding down its electric car effort about a decade and billions of dollars in spending look this decision comes after years of leadership changes and deviations from the original Dream Apple had of a self-driving electric car they were calling it project Titan internally with no steering wheel or gas pedals at one point Apple even thought it could start selling its car by 2020 now the crazy part about this video is that my conclusion about the future of Apple is not what you think it is so hang on I'm going to explain in a second now I do want to mention something here which is a little bit unusual ever since the Tim Cook era started in apple we haven't really seen this dude fail now he hasn't been the most Innovative CEO in history to be honest he's actually CEO a chief operating officer running a company but his excellence in executing and implementing was Second To None I can't remember an apple failure like this or an apple cancellation of a massive project like this at least in recent history so it's a first for them no doubt and I do think that what happened here is that Apple looked at this project and said look even though we spent a decade on this even though we poured $160 billion into this the truth is that even if we charge $120,000 a pop on every vehicle number one we're not going to make any money off of this and number two the amount of effort money resources and time to build this it's going to be excruciating why spend so much time money and resources on something that's never going to make us any money it is literally impossible to make money of selling electric vehicles I think that's the conclusion of Apple in fact that's the conclusion of most automakers in the world right now very few are actually profitable on their EV division now I do think it also shows you a lot about Tesla because if Apple a company that's used to selling premium products selling value and not price that could have sold the $100,000 $120,000 vehicle no problem this company is saying hey even at 120,000 this thing is not profitable just goes to show you that Tesla with 35 to 55,000 pop which is what they charge in model 3 and the model y have the best margins in the entire Auto industry not just the eveve industry they have the Holy Grail they have the secret sauce and people still refuse to understand how massive it is the Tesla is not just profitable of of VVS and the only one to do so including the Chinese that haven't yet figured this out the Tesla not just is profitable it is the most profitable out of the entire Auto industry which is absolutely insane to me now what I find also amusing here is that while we all know that famous story about how Elon Musk tried to save Tesla he tried to get Tim Cook to buy Tesla well rather to have apple by Tesla and he tried to arrange a meeting with Tim Cook and Tim Cook basically would not take the meeting imagine not even taking the time to give Elon Musk a polite no not even taking the meeting he was too big for that now obviously that's a point of regret for Apple at this point but you know nevertheless you live and learn and also I don't think that things were that bad for Apple anyways it seems to have worked out fine for everyone I'm sure IL musk is happy about not selling the company at this point it's a massive fail for Apple it's a huge win for Tesla just goes to show you how important the work that Tesla is doing and how good they are at what they're doing kind of also shows you where the market is headed as far as who's going to dominate the EV industry for the next 10 years Tesla byd maybe some other Chinese companies VW perhaps Toyota if they're pulled their stuff together at this point we'll see now about Apple I know a lot of people tend to be bearish when you have failures like this there going to be a lot of people going to be bearish about Apple at least for a while the question is do you think that apple is going to be gone by 2033 I don't think so I think they're going to be still around so if you don't think that Apple will be gone in 9 years then why are you so bearish about this company we're talking about a company that has a huge business a stockpile of cash and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere despite flanking out out of EV School let's talk about it now look division Pro I think played a huge part in what happened here I think the vast success of the launch of division Pro which was essentially the worst product of that sort that Apple will ever build the success of it the enthusiasm from it and the potential they saw basically got Apple to focus on that more than another project which is doubtful it's going to ever make money it might be an extremely unrewarding exercise but on the other hand the Vision Pro seems to be going in a very good direction so it only makes sense to kind of you know shift your priorities and resources and employees to a better project I think Apple also understands that the AI stuff are going to be way more important than building a car and with the massive growth in the potential total addressable Market in AI in services in AI Based Services in division Pro and VR enhanced reality whatever you want to call it Apple has way more sources to make a lot of money with higher margins than to build a vehicle and it only makes sense I don't think it's a bearish thing that they've abandoned this project in fact it was long overdue I think a lot of ego prevented Apple from pulling the plag on a project about three or four years ago they should have done it a long time ago the fact that they did it now only clears up a lot more resources for them to focus on what will make them a lot of money now look if you examine Apple from a fundamental perspective I mean the company is spotless under 1% of short interest 100 billion in net income per year 26% of net profit margin 54% return and capital and it's current trading at seven price to sales at under 30 price to earnings apple is not trading an expensive multiple given the amount of money they got coming in and the amount of profitability they have in the company now the current share price of Apple basically reflects an annual growth of about 10 to 15% nothing out of the ordinary for a company like apple I don't think that apple is hyped like Nvidia and like other companies in the market I think they're price exactly where they should be and if you take a look at the SE valuator here on stock MVP stock dmvpn your own models your own valuations for every company get yours for free for one week try it out tell me what you think stock mvp.com so if you go to stock MVP and you actually apply the SE valuator on Apple you'll find out that it has three base cases the bare scenario shows us a share price of $160 versus the current 180 the middle ground shows us 244 and the upside shows us 327 that's a 5year price target for Apple now obviously this isn't gigantic ginormous numbers that's going to make you gazillion dollars that's not the point of apple apple isn't going to 10x from here we kind of all understand that but what this model shows us as well as the other stuff we just saw on stock MVP including the ratios including the multiples including everything that Apple has a great business apple is not going anywhere apple is not expensive and Apple has plenty of upsite.",1.0,0.7

Tom Nash,LbfbC_vsP3o,2024-02-27T18:00:58Z,Jamie Dimon Leaves Entire CNBC Panel SPEECHLESS,S&P 500,now the third part I want to talk about here is get it right and hold it very tight now that's a very important lesson there's two parts of any investment strategy long term no matter what the market does no matter what the market does the macro might go crazy the market might go crazy but guess what if you picked it right and if you held it tight you're always going to be all right now there's a few ways to get it right obviously one would be to learn some fundamentals such as analizing companies modeling and valuations like a DCF obviously you can do everything for free go on Google go on YouTube there's a lot of tutorials that will teach you everything you need to know you need to know how to evaluate companies how to model how to read financials how to understand risk how to do comparative analysis all of that now of course you're more than welcome to join our Academy on P Paton patreon.com Nash where we teach all of these things we just finished the module about financial analysis we just finished the module about portfolio management about how to actually model your own DCFS a lot of cool stuff would love to see you there and also join our Discord at discord.gg Nash it's free to join the Discord hang out with us talk to us about stocks etc etc but let's move on to the next Rule now the next rule is don't expect a Lambo and a yacht don't expect to live like the man in the penthouse and driving a red Lamborghini that's not the point of investing now you may get that you may but if you don't that's not the end of the world your idea your accomplishment your ball you know you always say keep your eye on the ball your target should be and will be after you watch this video is build your retirement fund no matter if you're 19 or 59 you're investing to build out your retirement fund this isn't about the Lambos the chicks and the respect and the cloud and all of that it doesn't matter the great car you buy to today is going to be worthless in 15 years guess what no matter how good and how shiny it looks right now that's the whole point that's why I drive a used car that's like a seven-year-old car not selling it anytime soon but besides the point here the idea here is very simple set your expectations right retirement fund not Lambo if you set that mindset right and you understand that this is a long-term game 10 20 30 40 years whatever it is for you it's going to be a lot easier to hold it tight than the previous Rule now another thing I want you to focus on is accepting the fact you're going to screw up I had my share screw-ups plenty of don't worry about it it's too long for one video had plenty of stocks I got wrong I got the entire macro wrong in 2023 I thought it's going to be a massive crash I mean I'm not embarrassed to talk about it because you're always going to have boo boos you're always going to have screw-ups nobody shoots 100% from the field accepting that is going to make you hard as rock and will allow you to make better decisions now there's a lot of ways to mitigate your screw-up potential which every human has I use specifically the S&amp;P 500 I use the S&amp;P 500 to diversify if I got paler and Tesla wrong which I don't think will be the case but hey maybe I got it wrong then I have still 40% of my portfolio in S&amp;P 500 which will C cover your ass yes I just said it and obviously that's my strategy that doesn't mean you have to copy it in fact I insist that you don't this is the point of these videos it's not for you to copy what I do it's for you to develop your own ability to think for yourself now the final thing I want to say here is stay the course stay the course which means buy at all times the stocks that you like the fundamentals that are good the index buy at all times and buy more into weakness double down on your dollar cost averaging as the stock price goes down and slow down when the stock price goes up but buy at all times then you zoom out in 15 years 20 years all of a sudden your cost base is at the very bottom and you never had to time the market not even once I think that's got to be one of the most important investing rules of all time,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,dkToxao_XYI,2024-02-26T18:03:33Z,Holy Crap! Tom Lee New Stock Market Prediction is MIND-BLOWING,Nvidia,what's interesting is nvidia's free cash flow was 7 billion a year ago it's now close to a 50 billion run rate so it's it's gone up by you know seven times and the stock price hasn't risen by that much isn't video overvalued all the questions every single investor out there is curious about right now and what he gave is three simple arguments to why we're not why this is not a bubble why Nvidia is not currently overvalued and why the market is just starting out it's not the end of the cycle in fact it is the beginning number two concerns of bubble because of Nvidia are completely unjustified because when you look under the hood of Nvidia and similar companies you'll find out great fundamentals great profit margins and great Revenue growth that goes along with the massive spike in price not just hype companies like Tesla like paler like Nvidia then you'll be fine anyways if you look at Nvidia right now it's at 70p the forward PE of Nvidia which is the one you should be looking at that is 40 so 40 versus 200 it doesn't seem like Nvidia is anywhere close to the level of hype that Cisco used to generate in the 2000s if you look at Nvidia if you look at the other companies are playing in that space the fundamentals are insanely strong these companies like paler like Tesla like Nvidia are printing money creating actual business models that work massive amounts of growth massive amounts of margins and the crazy part about it the demand for all this stuff is just the beginning it's just heating up whatever Nvidia can put out people want to buy,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,ZNHkRNN395g,2024-02-23T14:33:51Z,Insiders Are BUYING This Stock Like Never Before.,Super Micro Computer,"how did I know that smci is going to pop? Last time I talked about this stock it ended up doing almost 300%. The reason I got so excited about it back in August of 2023 is the massive Insider buying... and that is why I made my video back in August of 2024 about this company super micro computer. August 24th 2023 is when this video came out titled why I'm buying smci stock now. Since then the stock did almost 300%. This list shows every single video I made about stocks during 2023 and you can see smci is number nine on that list that's the crem the LA crem 285 return... Now it's at $975 per share so it's a completely different deal which requires a completely different analysis. This model is designed to show you how much success is priced in into the current share price of $975. The company's ebda has to grow at a rate of 42% for five consecutive years for this to make sense. Now that's a tall order but as you can see right here they're not far away over the past three years they grew by 879 per. over the past year by 25%. The conservative the floor so to speak for the stock is $737 which means that you may buy this stock right now at 975 and it may get to 737. On the other hand our Middle Ground pricing is at $1,000 which is pretty close where it's at today so it's pretty much priced in just right now. In order to get 45% return from this point on on the stock you're going to have to assume the most optimistic assumptions which means 1,423 assuming everything goes perfect for this company which qualifies the stock as a risky investment but on the other hand it has massive Invidia exposure it has lots of opportunities and a huge chunk of the business in the new infrastructure growth that Nvidia is leading.",1.0,0.7

While you were being told stories fud fear uncertainty and doubt about paler over the past three years by mainstream media about how bad this company is, institutional shareholding in paler went up by 380 percent. Paler went through a lot of changes in those 20 years, it's not the same company it used to be; it has morphed into something absolutely insane, defense contractor into a commercial business Legacy and now AIP and AI.

Tom Nash,RcrMFf66rtI,2024-02-16T13:48:06Z,Why I am NOT Selling My Palantir Shares Until $500,Palantir,so we have an important warning about paler now look paler is currently at $25 per share and everybody's trying to figure out when the correction is going to happen we're up 173% over the past year up 50% over the past month and everybody's tried to figure out when to jump off this before it goes south before it corrects back. now there's a lot of PTSD because of the way paler behaved in the past and I get it but I don't think that's the right approach especially given what happened over the past few weeks. one of the most interesting things about paler is what happened in the last couple of weeks and it completely went under the radar. you have to understand that one of the biggest knocks on this company was except the part of the delusion and the part about the profitability these two things have died down you haven't heard anybody talk about delution or lack of profitability over the past two years because paler basically got better they got complaints they did not get bitter they got better. but still one complaint remains for paler and it's mainly coming for more professional grade investors which is that the institutional level is not high enough not enough professionals not enough institutional shareholders are holding paler. now last time we did this video about paler we had about 30 35% of institutional shareholding in paler and that's quite low compared to the amds the nvidias the big companies the Blue Chips. now with penter that was always an issue but what happened over the past couple of weeks is that the shareholding by institutional investors actually went up from about 35% all the way to 42% and while that itself is extremely impressive no doubt but the speed at which institutional shareholding is piling into the stock right now is absolutely mindblowing. I don't think I've seen anything like this before where so many institution investors are buying a stock like that it's almost like a frenzy now a lot of it has to do with the fact that they're prepping for the S&P 500 inclusion a lot of them have been dying to get into the stock but they couldn't because of regulatory constraints there's a lot of reasons but if you look at the shareholding structure for the company by institutional shareholders from stock MVP which shows you what happened what the trend line looks like you can see that institutional shareholders were buying the stock and increasing the positions of the past few quarters and if you had stock MVP you could have seen it coming. I'm not going to personally sell a single share and let me explain why it's not because I have a religious belief in this company it's not because I think that Alex carp will be insulted if I do so and and it's not because I don't want to be like certain other YouTubers who have sold too early wink wink there's a more kind of deep rooted business reason why I don't want to sell any stock even though I expect a correction and here's why. especially when I look at this company I say well look this is at least at least a Salesforce at least right Salesforce makes the gold standard and you know crms software B2B so at the very least palente is a Salesforce or Salesforce equivalent right so sales force is a $200 billion company palente currently trading a $50 billion company so at the very least the floor for this company is another 4X from here so I know this is at least a $100 stock at the very least I personally think it's a $500 stock so if I think that the stock is worth between $100 and $500 in 5 to 10 years why in the world would I even care about reducing my cost base from 25 to 22 and trying to time the market and worrying about this and obsessing about this why instead I'm just going to do whatever it is I've done for the past three or four years which is just dollar cost average constantly into the stock and not worry about the share price. now there's definitely risks with the stock and it seems like a correction is due I'm not going to sit here and lie like the stock isn't going to correct at some point it's going to correct for sure but look at it this way Q4 earnings decimated Bears decimated people who have came out and said hey we're sorry we got palente wrong plenty of videos like that the Mia Kula videos 70% commercial growth 44% of customer growth year-over-year up to 375 from 60 37 deals of 5 million or more 21 deals of 10 million or more so a year ago the top 20 clients of the company were paying on average $49 million per year it went up to 55 million peray year in one single calendar year look at the gross margins 84% gross margin 50% almost 50% free cash flow margin customer Billings increased by 56% so you look at this company and sure you only see 20% Revenue growth but look at the amount of aips the amount of demos those are the sales funnels of the company and they're increasing by 500% a year it's going to take them another nine months to go through the sales funnel and actually reflect in the revenues why not it's going to keep the share price cheap enough for me to get more but I'm not worried about it because it's going to allow me to stay in this current share price and buy more of it before it spikes up. now one of the biggest risks for paler here is also kind of a non risk for me yes they're dealing in the most hyper competitive market of all time us software corporate these three words mean hell it means a jungle it means Hunger Games but nevertheless right now it's their Market to grab it's theirs and it's probably Microsoft so we're looking at the creation of a new dominant Market it's very similar to the cloud business back in the day when you had Amazon step in and then you had Google and Microsoft and all these other players who came in right now it's the same Market that's happening with AIP so sure they're probably going to have to split the market with Microsoft like anybody who does any sort of software but even if it's a two-headed monster three-headed monster we're talking about the new gold standard in a new industry in which they're going to be one of two or one of three I like that especially at $50 billion. and the same thing will happen with paler at a greater scale obviously because because they're way way earlier in their life cycle and the same people will complain that the share price is just too expensive the PE is too high the revenues are not enough and that's fine the stock is not for everyone in fact it's for the very few that actually get it if you're part of that group shout out to you much love I'll see you in the next one go po Ander.,1.0,1.0

Tom Nash,RcrMFf66rtI,2024-02-16T13:48:06Z,Why I am NOT Selling My Palantir Shares Until $500,Tesla,Tesla is one example but for the most part the gold standard is if you want to have a company that's sustainable that's stable that the share price doesn't go up and down like crazy you're probably looking for about 60 65% ownership by institution investors. just like Tesla people now will tell you look we love the company we love the business model we hate the price we hate that price now since February 2020 February 2020 not the IPO since February 2020 Tesla has done four times on the money for their investors 4X on their money since February 2020 not even talking about the thousands of percents from the IPO so as far as Tesla investors go I don't think any of them regrets buying expensive stock because look at what it done for the past few years and the same thing will happen with paler at a greater scale obviously because because they're way way earlier in their life cycle.,0.9,0.9

Tom Nash,bZ6ss8T80TU,2024-02-14T16:17:21Z,It's OVER | Selling ALL My Stocks,Federal Reserve,I think the main thing why we saw the market react so negatively to what happened is because it changes The Narrative of when we're going to see rate cuts from the Federal Reserve I think a rate cut in May that was the kind of the consensus 99% according to fedwatch may cut was 99% now it's down to 39% so it's completely changed narrative what you're seeing right now is very low unemployment very high growth rates on the GDP and a very stable Market but as you saw in the latest report cost of wages which is Services is way too high which means people are getting paid too much money for the FED I know everybody wants to make more money I get it but for the FID Reserve to declare victory for inflation to come down cost of wages must come down unfortunately but it's a very delicate balancing act because on the one hand you don't want to bring it down too much CU you don't want to crash the economy on the other hand if you live it elevated then infl won't come down to 2% so the FED has a tough job going forward from 3% to 2% that's the hardest part of the journey now they will get there but I don't think the journey is going to be linear and I don't think we're going to see rate Cuts in this climate until Q4 of this year I think until September there's nothing to talk about rate Cuts you see the reason is because rate cuts are usually a necessity usually rate cuts which is a more accommodative monetary policy they come when the FED Reserve feels the pressure when the economy is suff ating when they need that money like oxygen but right now what they're seeing is that the inflation is still quite high at 3% much higher than what they wanted to be which is 2% but the overall Market the overall macro is very very strong it's robust wages are high unemployment is very low and GDP growth the economic growth of the US is very high much higher than expected so with these numbers there's no pressure for the FED to come down on rates before they're convinced that there's not going to be a replay what happened before the most famous guy of the fed you know I'm talking about vuler came in and had to do what he had to do because if you remember before vulker what happened is that inflation came down they all relaxed they brought down interest rates and then inflation spiked up back to out of the stratosphere then vulker had to come in and crash the economy so Powell even though he understands there's a low probability of that happening that's his biggest fear so until he's certain that that's not going to happen he's going to remain at elevated interest rates just to make sure and as long as there's no necessity from the market to pull it down as long as the market is doing fine he's going to be very very cautious there's no urgency,1.0,0.0

I don't think that Tucker is doing anything to help Putin or to help Russia. he is a valuable tool right now with this interview for the Russian propaganda machine. a Playbook that is being used right now by Russia the same way like it was used by the KGB. this whole thing is the KGB fabrication that's now being appropriated and kind of updated to 20124 by this Russian Administration. the ultimate goal of the USSR is identical to the ultimate goal of this Russia. because this version of Russia has social media. right now we have daily Russian propaganda across Western social media. some paid actors that actually do this for a living that are being paid actively by Russia and its allies. people who shield for Russia not intentionally to help Putin but because it helps their ratings and their Cloud which is exactly what's going on right now with this interview and what's happening with Vladimir Putin. all this helps Russian propaganda.

Tom Nash,QdRR-4Tzr0c,2024-02-08T19:32:38Z,PLTR STOCK: Cathie Wood Just Dropped a MASSIVE BOMBSHELL about PLTR's Future | PLTR Stock Prediction,Palantir,Kathy Wood is buying 2 million shares of volunteer now we have Kramer saying bye byebye we have Kathy Wood buying 2 million shares we have every single analyst out there upgrading the price Target we have Den iives from W bush coming out with $30 price target for paler I think the sentiment of paler was never better not even in the good old days when the stock was in the 30s and the mid-30s and the 40s I can't even remember those days I think this is the real deal because now it's not about the meme stockish of this thing now it's coming from a place of fundamental understanding of the greatness of this company and the insane potential of its trajectory but the real question here is why Kathy Wood would buy so much shares at 52 we highs has she gone mad well not exactly allow me to explain I know the price right now is a little bit high and I know it's coming off of a crazy run but if you are playing the long game if you're playing the five to 10 year game it doesn't matter if you bought it for 30 or 35 or 25 or 45 allow me to explain you see paler is right now probably one of the very few pure real AI companies there's a lot of Pretenders there's a lot of copycats there's a lot of hype artists there's a lot of marketing I think right now we're kind of experiencing the second coming of the Doom bubble in the Doom bubble there were a lot of noise a lot of hype a lot of marketing but the very few companies that were for real became behemoths for the next 25 years it's the same thing that's happening right now if you can spot the ones that are real you're going to find the next Microsoft the next Google the next Amazon so I think that Kathy understands and rightfully so that penter which is a company that was built to be an AI company 17 years ago or 18 years ago before AI companies were even the thing it's probably one of the only real AI plays you have a few more but this is the one now that's not the only reason in fact there's a few more but that's just the beginning now she's also probably looking at the stable profitability of the company they're no longer kind of Staggering in the Lost territory five straight quarters of Gap profitability is not something that's easy to achieve for a company like paler she's also probably looking at the insane margins that the company's creating the margins has not only gotten better it has got mind-blowingly good 84% gross margin we have 50% free cash flow margin we have 20% of Revenue growth with absolutely no change in operating expenses this is a company that's printing money $3.7 billion in the bank no debt four times more assets and liabilities and I think the most exciting part about paler is the growth pipeline they have last year I mean 2022 right they did a 100 Pilots this year they did 500 pilots and I bet when we look at 2024 it's going to 5x again and and if you understand that this is the pipeline this is the funnel for paler to get AIP clients you can't help but get excited because you see like it's the same thing like Nvidia holding down the infrastructure AI Market by the balls Palante has the operating system so if envidia is essentially Priceless right now because the infrastructure play is quas monopolistic what about the guys who are doing the new windows the new operating system for AI who don't care which computer you have what Hardware you have they got the operating system if this is the new Gold Rush this is the shovels Nvidia is selling one type of shovel you know the infrastructure peners selling the software the operating system why would one be such an amazing company and the other one will have so much doubt and skepticism I think KY sees this now the thing with this company is that even if you buy it now and we have a recession or we have some bad times this is a company that has a Recession Proof business model because half of the stuff are coming in from the government which literally doesn't matter if the company goes into recessionary period High interest rates slow down economy the government business of paler will always be there like a warm blanket on top of it we have the main knock on paler the delusion the stock-based compensation literally slowing down to a halt and that's something we talked about two years ago when we explained that the stock base compensation spikes we've seen have more to do with building a new Salesforce for the company than anything else and that will eventually be phased out which is exactly what's on right now delusion isn't a thing anymore now on top of it you have to understand that peners business model is brilliant because they are absolutely agnostic they don't care which large language model wins the AI Awards they don't care if it's one if it's multiple they have the operating system to work with whoever wins this war on top of it we have the S&P inclusion at this point pretty much certain which means a lot of institutional interest will come in which means it's going to be a 50 to 60% institutionally own stock which give it a lot of stability and a lot of upside so I think she's looking at the combination of all these things and she's saying well look I might be buying this a little bit expensive right now but if I'm going to hold it for the next 5 years I think that might be my next Tesla jump which I can't argue with now it doesn't mean that the stock is cheap right now it is not cheap it is definitely not cheap but if you look at price to sales like I mentioned before it's definitely cheaper than snowflake than Cloud flare than zscaler and others and it will grow into its own price earnings much like Tesla did Tesla was a very expensive PE ratio company and then they eventually grew into their valuation the reason I'm so confident in saying that is because I'm looking at comparables I'm looking at CRM Salesforce a company that does B2B software they're $200 billion company if penter gets to that point which I believe is the floor the bearish case scenario for penter they're at least five or 4X away from the real valuation as we stand today now on top of it look the stock can go down it can be volatile this is a very very volatile stock I 100% agree but it is also a very good mechanism of transferring wealth from the impatient paper hands Traders which we've shown in the previous video and I'm not going to do it again to the patient long-term investors and it will always be that for me it's very very simple I dollar cost average I buy more when it's down I buy a little bit less when it's up and I do it every single month like I'm on the

Tom Nash,UStDJ2dUobc,2024-02-07T19:41:48Z,Palantir shareholders….GET READY!,Palantir,paler paler paler in the past few days we had a taste of the good life we had a great earnings call we had great numbers the stock went on the Rampage we saw a new 52 we High yesterday at $22 per share and the stock is currently up 162% over the past year now just yesterday we heard that paler signed another new contract worth $650 million absolute insanity but for paler it's almost a daily thing right now now obviously a lot of people will be taking profits over the next few days and I expect some correction but as a long-term investor I honestly could not care less what I'm more interested about is the amount of paler haters that are not having a good week so far and just to give you kind of a taste here's a few I have now sold out of Palante in every single one of my portfolios and I am now an ex shareholder of paler paler technology this is a company in which I criticize from the stock price because that other guy on YouTube was talking the world of it stock price is currently eight I haven't looked so in past videos I have shown that I believe paler is interesting at $5 as you can see our high price of 560 is getting pretty close to where we want to be o now on the other hand Jim Kramer actually said that this stock is a buy which in itself with his whole reverse Midas thing might bring down the stock back to $7 so that's actually pretty scary now jokes aside I think this is the beginning of the Tesla day for paler the day in which everything changes as far as Wall Street perception as far as Market sentiment as far as analysts at some point Tesla went from being this immature company that's going to be taken over by the Germans to a real thing same thing happened with Nvidia with their AI moment I believe this is the beginning for paler but I'm not here really to talk talk about that in this video I want to give you my price target for this stock right now based on my own DCF and for the next 5 years based on the bearish middle ground and bullish expectation and obviously these price targets will be the most accurate I've ever put out because they're going to be based on the numbers that we just saw come out of the earnings so before we talk about that we have to talk about the excitement right now on the street there's a lot of new price targets coming out from s side analysts you know with the exception of Dan IES I honestly don't trust any of them but you see right now Jeff has paler $22 City at 20 Bank of America 24 wed Bush the knives has it of course at 30 because he's the only guy who actually gets it the crazy part about paler is that if you understand what AIP is going to do to the market you understand that this is just a start for paler I'm not saying the stock is going to go straight from 30 to 40 to 50 to 60 to 100 that's not what I'm saying it's going to be a bumpy ride but I'm saying that palente here is now on the cusp of taking over another industry which nobody can compete with you look at these current price levels and you're like oh my God this thing is discounted as hell obviously obviously there's going to be a bumpy ride paler isn't going to go straight from 20 to 100 to 500 that's not how it works in fact I think that a lot of people will take profits especially over the next few days there's going to be a correction no stock ever goes up 30% and stays there but I'm personally not selling a single share for the simple reason I'm not a Trader you know I just don't believe in the idea of timing the market you can get it right three out of 10 times but more often than not you're going to get screwed so I'm not going to sell now and hope to buy better at a better price I've never done it with paler I'm not going to start now my strategy and it's out the open I'm like an open book is a dollar cost average which means I buy paler at all times but when the price target for me is below a certain threshold then I'm doubling down when the price Target goes above that threshold then I'm buying my regular amount it's called the double DCA strategy which is something we teach on our Academy at patreon.com Nash we teach you how to do on DCF how to look at balance sheets and how to dollar cost average smart without being an idiot trying to time the market now I think the bigger question here is what's next for paler because that's the one thing I'm interested in as a long-term investor and I think the real question is not specifically what would be the price of paler in six months I think the more interesting question for me as kind of a lifer in this stock is when is this company going to get that Tesla moment when is is going to get that Nvidia moment because it's definitely headed to the right place but when does it happen now look I look at this in a holistic approach and I and I see paler as a company kind of developing this whole new Niche quietly under the radar if you look beyond the numbers you'll notice that the US Commercial Business is growing at a 70% rate now the US Commercial Business literally means us Enterprise software which is the best software Market in the world that market is giving them 70% growth they're literally taking it over slowly now if you understand AIP which is the AI platform volunteer it is absolutely transforming the way people do business right now we're looking at a 500% growth in the amount of boot camps and Pilots pilers launching with AIP with potential prospects with potential clients and if you look at AIP the AI platform of paler what you're seeing is absolute insane Feeding Frenzy they are at 500% growth in pilots and in boot camps with AIP and once these new clients will go through the sales cycle of paler which takes 6 to 12 months we also see a huge impact on the revenue line as well for paler now the S cycle is something that needs to be talked about because a lot of people don't understand that you know getting a client from AIP doesn't mean that you have that Revenue registered in the next quarter that's not how it works these things take time they a little bit slow to progress but eventually you will see that but as I mentioned before once you see these numbers already reflected in the revenues that's where the price already spikes the smarter investors buy these things before the mass adoption happens before people understand what's going on I think there's an enormous market share here for paler with AIP because this is a business not just with better margins with better scaling and in which paler totally dominates like no other company it's just the sector in itself is highly sticky but also it is the future it is the way industry is going to work in the next 10 years and paler might not be the only company in this sector I get it we talked a lot about potential competition but it's definitely shaping up to be one of the top three companies imagine that now you're looking at one of the four Cloud providers before Cloud was a thing it's the same thing with AIP they're probably one of the top three companies to deliver a product like this maybe one of the top two companies let's assume they're going to be just as big as let's say Salesforce a B2B software you know $200 billion p is currently trading at 1/4 of that valuation which should give you kind of an understanding of how big paler can be just on the basis of some limited assumptions not even going too far with this whole taking over the world thing and just to kind of give you an idea of how fast paler is growing look paler just did 100 New Deals worth a million more in 2023 that's double than what they had in 2022 that trend is only going to continue now let's talk about my price targets for paler and those are based on a few assumptions assumption number one Legacy business versus the new commercial clients I spoke about it my previous video the video will be linked below and I've explained to you there's a huge difference between the commercial clients of the past and the new AIP clients this is bigger Tam bigger much more insane margins more scalable a lot more stickier this is the new business of paler and the margins in that business are going to be insane now number two if you look at price to sales of paler which is the right metric to look at a company like that not PE you look at crowd strike you look at data dog you look at Cloud flare you look at zscaler you look at all these companies they are more expensive than paler and by the way those are great companies companies but none of them have the massive potential the upside the ceiling of paler which is almost endless and of course number three is the profitability the margins of paler we've never seen anything like this and it's hard to see because it's just starting out but it's absolutely going crazy right now revenues are going up 20% operating expenses the same sgna comes down margins 84% gross margin we have cash from operations at 50% net income grows 100% in a year operating expenses the same and of course number four the balance sheet the cleanest we've ever seen $3.7 billion in cash no debt and four times more assets than liabilities clean as a whistle and in my model in stock MVP my DCF gives me a current valuation right now of $29 67 it's something you can go ahead and do in your models in stock MVP and also my fiveyear target is based on three options the bare option for the next 5 years is $66 the middle ground for five years is $150 and my optimistic is $233 for the next 5 years and it doesn't mean that paler won't get to $500 I'm just giving you my fiveyear price targets bare middle optimistic that's it now if you want to learn more about how paler if you want to educate yourself on this company we have an incredibly active Discord Community with penter rooms dedicated to talking every single day about the stock,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,Aoi459dK4q0,2024-02-06T17:36:26Z,Palantir CEO Alex Karp Proves Doubters Wrong,Palantir,"Hey this is Tom and over the past few years you know being a Palantir investor after earnings was not always an easy experience not today, today we're talking about great earnings great results and absolutely a fantastic quarter by Palantir. Now the stock is up 18% as of the making of this video, Palantir is up 115% over the past year which is a very impressive number. The earnings per share was in line, the revenue was a beat with 20% growth and really really good guidance, also completing five consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability which puts Palantir deep into that S&P 5 inclusion. The commercial growth of Palantir right now is 32% year-over-year, 133% quarter for quarter, that is the growth engine of Palantir. Palantir closed 103 New Deals worth 1 million or more in 2023, that is two times more than what they've closed in 2022. Palantir has easily the cleanest balance sheet in the stock market right now. Revenues are 2.25 billion in 2023 and the guidance for 2.65 billion for 2024 with 40% growth in the commercial sector. The US commercial revenue is up 70% year-over-year to $460 million, the company more than doubled its US commercial revenue in just two and a half years, that is absolutely insane. Palantir is a company that was built from the ground up to be an AI company before anybody knew what an AI company is. In 2023 Palantir held 600 Pilots of AIP and 500 boot camps, that is five times more than the previous year, the demand is insane. Palantir is going to win the AI Wars simply because they don't care who's going to have the best generative AI LLM, Palantir builds the operating system on which any platform will work, in 5 to 10 years this is going to be the biggest business in Corporate America and Palantir is going to be the Quasi Monopoly running it. Revenues are up 20%, operating expenses only up 3%, SG&A down 15%, net income goes by 300% from 33 to 100 while the revenues only go up 20%, the scalability, the margins, the gross margin up from 80 to 84%, operating income was negative 62 million last year now it's 65 million positive, cash for operations 80 million in Q4 just last year 301 million this quarter, the margin just went up from 15 to 50% in a single year. The price to sales for Palantir shows me that it's not expensive, it's still cheaper than CrowdStrike, Snowflake, Datadog, Cloudflare, Zscaler, all these companies don't have half of the potential of Palantir and they're more expensive on price to sales.",1.0,1.0

Tom Nash,vCdQET-d2wg,2024-01-31T19:05:55Z,Billionaire Ken Griffin Just Dropped MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Tesla,"so billionaire Ken Griffin just dropped a massive bombshell about Tesla and Elon Musk something you have never heard before also we have a shocking decision coming out out of the courton Delaware about said Elon Musk and Tesla which has blown everybody's mind. us companies your Fords and GMs are still trying to catch up with Tesla and Tesla has one great asset Elana is a phenomenal entrepreneur and I think that don't lose sight of the fact that Tesla makes a great car but there's an opportunity at Tesla to create the software platform for the future of automobiles the self-driving car good chance will first happen at Tesla. now these points are that the big three in the United States the four the GMs the stantis they're all still haven't caught up with Tesla they're light years behind and the pace at which they're running is significantly slower than the pace of Tesla when somebody is miles ahead and they're running faster and they increasing speed while you running significantly slower and you're slowing down you're not going to win this race essentially what he was alluding to even though he didn't want to outright say it is that Ford and GM in their current constellation Construction whatever you want to call organization they're finished they're going to have to come up with some sort of a way to maybe reorganize their business maybe combine it maybe merge because in the current constellation of Ford and GM they cannot compete with Tesla he was literally telling you gently that this is the end of Ford and GM and stantis the way we know it now stantis still has a lot of brands in Europe it's going to keep it afloat but for for GM the geographic concentration in the US market and the lack of ability to compete with Tesla is a whole different story. he then also said that the most important secret weapon of Tesla is Elon Musk the guy who everybody loves to hate on especially on mainstream media especially in the courts of law in Delaware the most hated person in the earth this guy is a billionaire he literally has no skin in this game and he's telling you this is the secret weapon this is the secret sauce this guy and I agree with him 100%. look at the end of the day we're talking about a guy who gave shareholders a 15,000 return on their Equity since Tesla went public I don't know a lot of companies that did that I don't know a lot of CEOs that did that and in fact right now as we speak Tesla is sitting literally on five or six different SC curves it literally can pick which ones they want to take next we've never seen a company like this before we've never seen a CEO like this before and the crazy part about us this wasn't even the most important Point K Griffin made because then he went ahead and actually said something absolutely brilliant which is that Tesla will most likely become the only provider of autonomous driving the same thing Ron Baron told you months ago the same thing that the Tesla Community have been telling you for years there's nobody else in the game there's no real competitors that are competing with Tesla about autonomous driving if autonomous driving isn't possible that's the only way in which Tesla doesn't monopolize this Market but if Humanity manages to get to autonomous driving to level four this is going to be the company to do that there's not going to be a second or a third they're essentially going to quasa monopolize this Market which means their technology is going to be in every single vehicle in the market that wants to have monopolis monopolis yeah sure monopolis driving sure autonomous driving and you know how much money we're talking about here this is a software business this is 80% margin what Ken is telling you hey the cars are great but think about the next thing think about the software they're literally writing code that nobody else will have and will become standard in the Auto industry and they the only ones who going to have it. now honestly this might be one of the most commonest decisions we've ever seen from a US court of law and I hope Tesla appeals this although I don't think so and I'll tell you in a second why there's an easy way to work around this stupidity but look you have to understand the package here that he got and by the way I'm not talking about the big package that's Alex karp with his steel Bol this guy got a $56 billion package fine but he never got cash that's the whole point this is performance-based equity he only gets paid if the company goes wild if the stock price goes crazy Elon doesn't get paid in cash he only gets paid if he gets the job done that's the whole beauty of this package we're talking about a guy who gave you 15,000 per return from the IPO to this day he literally did crazy things no other CEO has done in this industry slipping on the Factory floor getting 17 divorces 15,000 kids God knows how many bad personal life choices absolutely no work life balance No Tan overweightness cage matches with Mark Zuckerberg like craziness we've never seen before just to give you this and he never got paid without giving results so yes they might appeal this although I don't think it's likely I think it's more likely they go back and they revoted and they pass it in a way that technically matches something that the court of law cannot not overthrow because it was unfair they're going to go around the loopholes and going to give him a bigger package now because the company has been doing better than ever.",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,x8V2ktehSqY,2024-01-29T19:02:18Z,Dan Ives Leaves Entire CNBC Panel SPEECHLESS about Tesla,Evergrande,everr remember them from China they're getting liquidated so let's talk about the next item which is evergrand remember them so evergrand was still is I don't know I can't explain it it's you know they're in the limbo so evergr used to be the biggest developer in China and they kind of became a zombie company lately I've made many videos about it explaining why everr was a kind of a symptom of a larger problem in China because the entire Chinese real estate market which actually is about 35% of the entire Chinese GDP is nothing but a huge Ponzi scheme people buy these homes they never live in them and the reason they buy them is basically to resell them and there's just ghost towns ghost neighborhoods ghost cities in China all over the place and it's just basically a Ponzi scheme that's just bound to collapse one day so everg Grand collapsing is just the first step of it and now we have the final Judgment Day where the Hong Kong courts basically tell them to liquidate basically what happened is that today the court in Hong Kong actually ruled that evergr must be liquidated it's not a real company anymore you're the real boy what happened immediately is that stock plunged by 20% immediately it got halted and now the big question is what happens next what happens to the lenders to the people who actually bought homes from them there's a lot of questions what happens back in the mainland in China look H the crazy part about us is that the Chinese government actually tried to bail out and save them literally days before this happened by pumping money into everr to prevent this from happening that didn't help imagine how bad of a situation this is that the Chinese government couldn't pump enough money into it to keep it alive so evergr is falling apart which is a huge problem because it literally drives the Chinese property Market which literally drives the Chinese GDP so it's going to start a chain reaction which the Chinese try to prevent by pumping money to this but now it's not going to happen so we get to do more videos about the collapse of China yay,1.0,-1.0

Tom Nash,q5ecraltSEQ,2024-01-25T16:48:29Z,Tesla is FINISHED,Tesla,"well let's talk about the Tesla earnings and it's safe to say it could have gone a little bit better the stock has dropped 8% after these earnings and everybody's talking about the failure of Tesla and how everything is now over the story is over the stock is dead it's the end of electric vehicles in general Run for the hills and in this video I'm actually going to show you why it's not the case you know I don't like to keep you hostage in these videos so the bottom line is there's nothing wrong with Tesla in fact this might be the best buying opportunity we've had in a long time not Financial advice just my own uneducated opinion so first of all let's talk about what happened here look obviously there was a Miss Top Line Miss and bottom line Miss we had 71 cents EPS earnings per share versus 74 expected and we had 25.1 billion of revenues versus 2 wife 2 wife 2 wife happy life 25.6 billion have expected so obviously slight misses stop Top Line and bottom line so you did Miss Market expectations you deserve to get the hit in aftermarket fine that's okay now where I think Tesla took the brunt of the hit here is in two areas one is the margins the other one is the guidance not specifically the misses I think were the problem again the misses is never the problem I know what's going on today it's Freud look the operating margin for Tesla in this quarter was 88.2% now talking about the margins what I think freak people out is the fact that Tesla went from 16% operating margin last year to 8.2% in this quarter which is a huge drop but it ain't nothing new they actually improved operating margin compared to last quarter last quarter they came in at 7 and a half% and everybody was ready to jump from the hills but this time they're actually improving the operating margin by 6% so yes it's not as great as it it used to be nothing is but it's actually getting better compared to last quarter and at 88.2% operating margin there's still light years ahead of any other auto manufacturer anyways so it's nothing really to be concerned about especially when you cutting prices to eliminate competition and your cutting prices to increase the amount of sales you have so lower margins with more money coming in is actually not a bad idea now if you look at the automotive Revenue which I think is the bread and butter for this company right now they came in at 21.6 billion which is identical to what they had in Q4 last year so nothing really horrible happened here now I think the biggest concern even more than the margin was the fact that Elon Musk is a very unexpected guy and we never know which side of the bet he's going to roll off before the earnings call we never know what's he going to say we're never know what kind of Bombshells we're going to hear from him and yes again Elon Musk is being Elon Musk and that's part of the business here look the guidance for the upcoming year right now was was not great they basically said look it's going to be notably lower than 2023 so we're not going to do as good in 2023 and that sent people running for the hills like you haven't seen before a total Stampede out of the stock now what people forgot to do is to listen to the end of the sentence because in that statement they've also said why and the reason is because we are working on actual new Next Generation vehicles and additional factories so by saying that Tesla actually confirmed the report that came out 24 hours ahead of this call from Reuters telling us that Tesla is in full-blown ramp towards the $25,000 car now in this call they've actually confirmed this saying yeah Tesla is focused on the new Mass adoption vehicle on new factors and that's why 2024 isn't going to be as great and 2023 is faring selling specific Vehicles now people kind of take it for granted but look Tesla still delivered 1.8 million vehicles in 2023 that's not bad for a company that hasn't sold a single pickup truck or a single $25,000 car the two best markets to be in in North America is the sedan $25,000 and the pickup truck Tesla is selling 2 million Vehicles almost per year without being in either of these categories which is now changing we have the Cyber Tru rolling out a lot of critics there about the range about the shape about the design whatever people are always going to hate on things that Elon Musk does and now we have news confirmation from Tesla themselves that they are working on a new $25,000 car so this means that by 2025 2026 Tesla is going to be competing in two additional categories within pickup trucks and the $25,000 sedan which is going to be extremely lucrative from a revenue perspective and definitely given what Tesla have done in the past from a margin perspective compared to its competitors now look the analysts on this stock are really really predictable every time the stock price goes up because the Euphoria sets in the analyst rate ra their Target price of course there's a few exceptions of great analysts but I'm talking about the mass and every time that something bad happens that sends people for the hills there's a lot of panic a lot of fear all of a sudden price targets drop don't be fooled by this crap and in fact Barclay's just dropped their Target price from 250 to 225 there's going to be more of this these analysts only reflect the State of Mind the mood on the street about a stock now we're getting to the interesting part we talk about margins coming down we talk about test cutting prices but look at something that happened that most people missed the net income for the quarter for Tesla was 8 billion in itself that is kind of impressive I am struggling to think of a company that actually is building tangibles that generates $25 billion in Revenue 21.5 from vehicles and gives me8 billion in net income that's a very high margin in any industry but they're crazy part is that this 8 billion that they've generated in net income for this quarter that's actually double than what they've done in the same quarter last year that number used to be 3.7 billion in Q4 last year so despite cutting prices despite lowering margins despite all of this Tesla has doubled its net income from the previous year to this year and people tend to ignore these sort of things because they're complicated to explain it's much easier to listen to CNBC and listen to the misses and the bad guides and all the stuff that people want to focus on and they want to tell you how you need to sell sell sell right now because the company's doing bad but look at the end of the day we're talking about a company that's sitting on $30 billion in cash but a company that virtually has no debt but a company that's launching the Cyber truck now they're working on a $25,000 car they're selling 2 million cars a year on top of it they have robotics they have the energy business and they have the Monopoly or the next scurve of the entire Auto industry which will full self driving nobody's even close there's no second so these guys are going to dominate the Auto industry from a software perspective and they're already dominating from a hardware perspective and we haven't said a word about robotics or energy or the other million things they're working on so for me I'm not scared at all for me this is an opportunity but again here's a word of caution here and it's important that you guys listen Tesla is like a mousetrap it will punish and it will abuse people who try to time this stock it is insanely irrational it has a very irrational and unexpected CEO but in all the existence of Tesla it did one thing and one thing perfectly which is transfer wealth from the impatient traders to the patient long-term loyal investors that stuck with the stock for years and years making lifechanging money for long-term investors that are not easily spooked",1.0,0.85
Tom Nash,Sy8RCaoElGs,2024-01-24T17:00:59Z,Tesla shareholders….GET READY!,Tesla,"well this is huge the news we've all been waiting for from Tesla are finally here also we have Netflix exploding out of the stratosphere incredible earnings they little shot out of Cannon we have Boeing nose diving as boing usually does and we have some surprising news from Apple now you know me I don't like to keep you hostage so let's go through this quickly so we can get you out of here to the rest of your day now look Tesla is the first thing on my mind when I wake up along with paler of course my two big loves and I'm sure it is for you the same so let's start with Tesla first and then we'll talk about Apple Netflix and God help me boing so Tesla royalties just came out with a very interesting report according to Reuters Tesla is starting to prepare for the manufacturing of the new Mass adoption vehicle that $25,000 car are now in the plans according to Reuters and according to their sources numerous suppliers of Tesla Tesla is starting to set up the supply chain for the production of the new Mass adoption vehicle now they haven't said the price we don't know you know if it's going to be $25,000 or $35,000 right most likely it's going to be 25 to match the Toyota Corollas of the world right but we do have a code name for this vehicle it will be called Redwood for now and the planning is to release the vehicle in the middle of 2025 which is literally 18 months away now look when news like this go out there's a few things you have to keep in mind number one when Tesla is talking about mid 2025 planned estimated release date add another six months to it just as a matter of caution Elon Musk has never released anything on time and that's good because he's not the sort of guy Bo to release something that's half asked or Half Baked sorry just because the release date is here now El has no problem in delaying as much as needed until the product is perfect and I expect there's going to be some delays I don't think we're going to see it in mid 2025 at the earliest beginning of 2026 most likely middle of 2026 which is still quite remarkable because if you think about it the strength of Tesla in the Auto industry is of margins Tesla have developed this new manufacturing process that no other autom manufacturer has this modular instead of linear production where they assemble the vehicles and they've talked about about it in the last few earnings calls about how this new Mass adoption vehicle is going to be even better at that the amount of margin Tesla will be able to squeeze out out of this $25,000 car is going to be way better than what they do with the model 3 compared to the rest of the industry and the model 3 already has the best margins so Tesla is going to kill the margins on this vehicle the demand is going to be massive because when Tesla puts out a $25,000 vehicle obviously the demand is going to be through the roof and if you follow kind of Tesla's logic it's exactly the plan that El set out 10 years ago Model S premium vehicle right if you don't kind of think about the Roadster right then you have the model 3 and the model y then you go for the mass adoption vehicle which is the classic way to price your way into the market you start with the best products and then you slowly expand and actually lower the prices when people talk about margin erosion and they're talking about price erosion for Tesla they're actually ignoring the fact that this is done on purpose as an aggressive move to wipe out the competition right now as stands Tesla has no competitions in margins in any of the categories at least in which they compete speaking about categories in which Tesla are not competing yet the cybert TR is about to launch which means that Tesla will enter the pickup Market in USA which is the best market for auto manufacturers in North America on top of it the FSD is coming along nicely while on the other hand I'll show you in a second what happened with other companies FSD is going to be an industry standard whether it takes them six months or a year or year and a half to finish this and go fully operational there's nobody in second place nobody has FSD equivalent these guys are going to be the industry standard Ron Baron talked about us multiple times every single OEM that wants to have level four autonomy will have to license it from Tesla it's going to be a massive boost for the company we haven't even said a word about robotics we haven't even said about energy storage and all that stuff in fact I would argue that Tesla is the perfect example of a phrase that Warren Buffett coined although we attribute a lot of phrases to this man he hasn't said but one I believe he did which is the the stock market is a transfer mechanism from the impatient to the patient basically the patient investors keep killing Slowly by Thousand Cuts the impatient Traders and I think Tesla is the best example of that anybody who's been long in Tesla the Dave Le the RO Myers the Steven M Ryan all of these guys who have been longterm the Warren ridicks um Tesla Boomer Mama all of them I'm probably forgetting a few right all of these guys who've been there from the start Farzad right all of them have made a lot of money in fact life-changing amounts by being a Tesla investor the people who you hear getting screwed by this stock is people who trying to time it and trade it and you know they usually get burned because this is an extremely volatile stock now if you're looking for something to retire on and to add to your kid college fund and stuff like that I think this is a good stock to look at if you're not going to touch it for the next 10 years for Traders I think Tesla is an extremely complicated stock because of how irrational it is how irrational its CEO is but for long-term investing this is definitely worth your time to look into to research and obviously make your own decisions don't do anything because I said so",1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,Sy8RCaoElGs,2024-01-24T17:00:59Z,Tesla shareholders….GET READY!,Netflix,also we have Netflix exploding out of the stratosphere incredible earnings they little shot out of Cannon so let's start with Tesla first and then we'll talk about Apple Netflix and God help me boing now let's talk about Netflix now Netflix is a very interesting animal here Netflix just killed earnings absolutely insanely killed earnings added 13 million Subs they're currently at 200 60 million Subs the problem is that most of this money and the additional subscribers they came because of the Crackdown on the password sharing basically Netflix said look you can't share passwords anymore and I totally get it but I think it drove a lot of subscribership from these password sharing pulls back into the freay but the problem is if you kind of look into the nuts and bolts of this thing sure a lot of password crackdowns are converted to subscribers they also have this great WWE deal and they're talking about price hikes in the future sure but Netflix still has the hamster problem hamster wheel problem that they haven't solved yet because look at the end of the day the power of of Netflix the kind of bread and butter The Wheelhouse was the fact that Netflix was the content aggregator of the world right every single content producer also let Netflix have a piece of it because why not they make some extra bucks right and obviously right now that's not happening everybody have their own service in which they actually show exclusively their stuff so Netflix doesn't have a Content aggregation system anymore to sell to its client so now it has pivoted into making their own content they're spending a lot of money creating original films and original series and that will be the greatest test I don't think the test will be WWE or the password crackdowns or even the ad supported system I think the success of Netflix will be tested over time by the ability to produce good content and not to overspend because so far every single Netflix original suffered from the same problem they overpaid for the product and the product wasn't good enough the films they put out were just not good enough and they were extremely expensive if they can Master this if they can become kind of a quasi studio and create a library of content of their own they have a chance but it's too early to tell all these analysts are now you know de writing this company obviously analysts are really smart right after earnings I would just cool my Jets on this one and be very very careful,1.0,0.2

Tom Nash,ke859Dle_7M,2024-01-10T19:44:12Z,A Once in a Lifetime Financial Event Is Starting,S&P 500,my own portfolio is comprised out of three elements three elements only Tesla paler and the S&P 500. but I didn't fall through the floor because I had a big chunk invested in the S&P 500 that kept me safe. my portfolio is only up 86% because the S&P is holding me back but I'm okay with that that insurance policy Works in my favor when times are tough and a little bit works against me when times are great. part one is is investing in great companies that is my way of trying to beat the S&P 500 with the companies I pick specifically for me I think that Tesla and paler have a good shot of beating the S&P 500 more often than not maybe true maybe untrue we'll find out. number two keep myself grounded by putting 40% in the S&P 500 you literally cannot lose if you put your money in the S&P 500 for 20 years no money manager has beaten the S&P 500 20 years trade you put at the S&P 500 you bet on the US economy which is hands down the best economy in the world and you make your 8 to 10% a year and you get super happy about it. I dollar cost average which means I buy the stocks that I like the S&P 500 the Teslas the peners and I buy it every single month no matter what price up price down I keep buying. number one which I think is the best way for 90% of people is buy the S&P 500 wait for 10 years open your app again and look how much money you've made by doing literally nothing Warren Buffett said this not me this is the best investment strategy for 90% of people you will never be wrong by betting on the US economy now of course there's another way of mixing that up which is what I'm doing and having 40% of my money in that strategy,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,a0tb0LeXQSQ,2023-12-26T16:49:12Z,What is Cathie Wood Doing in 2024? [its not what you think],Magnificent 7,I think magnificent 7 I believe it's up 30% over the next year but I think in terms of overall Tech we see the a year from now I think Tech's up another 25% because of this transformational AI Revolution that's now here Dan IES talks about a specific thing he says look Enterprise software is going to lead the charge in 2024 and then he also talks about a new bull market being led and he names a few companies pener included again he's also focusing both on AI but his specific is that he looks at expectations he said look in my opinion expectations are underestimated understated by 5 to 10% so if expectations are not as high as they should be that means a higher percentage of companies will beat earnings in 2024 leading to a very positive reaction from the stock market and that's why he's saying look in 2024 the Magnificent 7 which is the apples the microsofts the Google you know the Magnificent 7 right they'll do 30% but the entire Tech Market is not going to be far behind with about 25%,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,L5wI1bamdn4,2023-12-19T14:50:30Z,NVIDIA is The Biggest AI Investment Opportunity (Buy Now Or Regret Forever!),NVIDIA,well this you don't see every day a top 5% analysts just said that this is the cheapest AI play in the market right now it's actually trading cheaper than basically all of many if not all of its peers now of course he's talking about Nvidia the stock that did over 200% this year and is trading near all-time highs how can it be the cheapest AI play in the market right now listen to this The Firm believes Nvidia is the cheapest AI stock which may sound counterintuitive Shares are already up 235% so far this year and trading less than 3% from an all-time high the multiple has actually been cut by 2third Nvidia today is trading under 25 times it hasn't traded there since the crypto bubble burst in in in the end of 2018 and it's actually a discount to the overall semiconductor industry in the case of Nvidia you can see that if you look at the current price to earnings which is 64 which by the way in itself is not expensive for a company like this but the forward PE the forward price earnings based on estimates is 26 NVIDIA started off as a massively expensive play they were triple digits PE but as they've generated more and more revenues massive amounts of growth they literally grew into the valuation and they're now Trading at 26 forward PE that's not a high valuation um it is in fact the cheapest on a forward earnings basis the cheapest of all the stocks you would think about as AI plays AMD or or Intel or maybe Marvel Nvidia is at 25 times especially for a market leader and a quasi Monopoly like Nvidia and speaking about quasi monopolies listen to this I would say it's nvidia's game to lose though and but but what I like about Nvidia is they are not like laying back and getting f up and happy right they're continuing to push the envelope they're investing they're actually shaping the market and they've actually like they're they're accelerating their own product road so anything that's even out there today even if we're competitive like it's not going to be competitive for long nvidia's got like their their next gener it's called the h200 that launches in Q2 of next year they've got an entirely new architecture it's called Blackwell that launches in the second half of next year like this is a moving Target and Nvidia do their credit they they are continuing to push that if they screw something up I mean sure but like they haven't screwed anything up yet now what he's saying here is super important this is an Nvidia game to lose which means that this Market is being monopolized right now by Nvidia and unless they screw up somehow it's their market and Jensen Wing who I think is a top three CEO in the market doesn't have a track record of screwing up much so I think it's pretty safe to assume they not going to screw up now what's more important here is the second item which I want you to pay attention to listen to this like if Nvidia does 70 billion next year that will be viewed as disappointing what he's saying here is that the company is cheap if the estimates are true now if you look at the estimates of Nvidia the company has been spot on even when they gave crazy estimates where people were like this does not make any sense there's no way that this can be true and then they hit it every freaking time it's cheap because people are worried that the numbers are getting so big so quickly you just worry about sustainability the same thing with Nvidia yeah a year ago this was a $120 stock in 2022 but now it's no longer a $120 stock those days are long gone some of these big numbers we're seeing like I think nvidia's their current number is 300 billion at least nvidia's number I know includes it's not just the the chips it's also the chips and the servers and the networking and all the infrastructure that goes and they actually sell all of that stuff not not just Nvidia like lot lots of names right I don't think that's the case I don't think this company is slowing down anytime soon over the past five years they've increased research and development spending by 300% Nvidia has this DNA of not resting on its Laurels but more importantly I want you to take a look at the fundamentals revenues are up 150% of the past three years net income is up 34% over the past year cash is up 700% over the past 5 years return on Equity 59% return on equity for investors while this is true that this is a basically an infrastructure play in which Nvidia has the Monopoly but at some point while the upgrades will make a lot of money the cycle will end but Nvidia has reinvented itself so many times before to believe that it's just going to die out this time once this cycle ends in three and four years now look Nvidia is a great company obviously this is an individual decision this isn't financial advice do your own research find out for yourself if you want to be a part of this company because when you buy stock of a company company you become an owner of a piece of the company it's not a piece of paper it's not a number on your app do you want to be an owner of this company the next 5 years if the answer is no don't invest if the answer is yes consider investing,1.0,0.9

We're talking about a $200 billion Market in which Tesla has not played so far whatsoever now how much of a bite can Tesla take from this Market it solely dependent on Tesla's capacity the demand is there at least the first two million are there so the real question is how fast can take you know can Tesla make these cars. I don't think 2023 we're going to see any vehicles I think it's obvious 20 24 I believe Tesla can make anywhere from 30 to 50,000 vehicles but I believe that the real ramp up will start in 2025 to 2027 in those three years 25 26 27 and I believe that by 2027 Tesla can reach 400,000 cyber trucks 2025 I think we can see 100,000 the rampa for Tesla is not linear don't forget it go back and look at the model 3 go like go back and look at the model y it's never linear always starts slow and then it spikes these guys know how to ramp up Vehicles especially one that was built for the sort of ramp up like the Cyber truck. so tessla is currently making hundred billion dollar annual revenues that's 150% increase over the past 3 years there are at 13 billion of ibida which is 200% increase over the past three years and I think the Cyber TR will restart will kick start the percentage of growth because yes there is a deceleration in the profitability of Tesla and the Cyber truck once it hits ramp poop is going to restart that process all over again that's the new escar for Tesla not to mention the FSD and the other stuff that are coming but that's a whole different discussion. now looking at the pricing of Tesla and the my new price Target look glance at Nvidia for a second right they're 25 price to sales 60 PE and they're I think what you would say is an industry leader right so if you look at Tesla as another industry leader we have eight price to sales so three and a half times cheaper than Nvidia if you look at price to sales but even at PE Tesla is at 70 PE versus Nvidia 60p so Tesla isn't trading at exuberant amounts they're trading like a industry leader like they should like Invidia there's nothing wrong about that. now if you glance at my model here made on stock MVP the current price of Tesla based on the DCF remember DCFS give you current price not a five-year prediction not a 10-year prediction a current valuation of Tesla today based on what we know in the cybertruck is $600 that's my current price this means in my model Tesla is insanely undervalued and if you if you go even deeper and you look at our SCF model which gives you the fiveyear targets my fiveyear target best case scenario is1 1985 which means almost $2,000 with the Cyber truck now the medium case is 1300 and the bare case is 600 now obviously these are my models and you can build your own and there's nothing you need to learn about Finance or modeling. as far as Tesla goes look that's always going to be deniers cynics and people who missed the opportunity and then they cry about it and they complain about how irrational the market is I don't care I'm not a psychiatrist I don't care about why they did it I only care about making money so remember this is not Financial advice not telling you to buy Tesla just the rambling of a mad man but damn that cybert trck looks good",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,siSMbrmiiCI,2023-11-30T16:17:15Z,Elon Musk Leaves the Audience SPEECHLESS,X,ever since El took over X he's been under a brage of attack from the leftist from the woke the people who want him gone so the minute he engaged with that person which he shouldn't have and he knows it he made a mistake now look I don't think El is anti-Semitic I think that TW was taken out of context I think it was a horrible idea to post that reply and he knows it and he he admitted it I think he clearly posted plenty of content before and after this post showing he's very pro-jewish and pro-israel and he clearly said that anybody who's been going to saying this whole from the river to the seon x is pretty much calling for genocide that will be banned freedom of speech does not protect us from the czy and warm and nice things we love to hear we do not need the protection of freedom of speech from things that we all agree on freedom of speech protects the speech that is on The Fringe the speech that cringes you out that makes you angry that makes you mad that annoys you for the price of allowing everybody to speak their mind because once you start talking about well that's a right we shouldn't allow that to be said you start to close in that boundary now obviously you have to draw the line somewhere anti-semitic calls definitely 100% I think X should do a better job of doing that for sure a lot of misinformation yeah but he's already doing it with Community notes have you seen Community notes that's a great way to debunk a lot of the fud and misinformation we don't need to regulate content if within 10 minutes people come in and with Community notes destroy fud and lies and misinformation that's the right way to do it I think 's sitting up there with that chain of the kidnap held by Hamas and the way he was proud of it actually made me feel a little bit emotional he's definitely not an anti-semite he's not anti-jewish he's not anti-israel musk is a target you have to understand that and this is just another attempt to discredit the guy now look if you've been on social media and you post it on social media there's this very famous saying nobody has ever regretted a tweet they didn't tweet if you're going to be active on social media if you're going to have a platform if you're going to have an audience every once in a while you're going to say stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's just the way the world works this is how we as human interact social media if you it's the same thing with Warren Buffett he once said look if you if you put a cop on a guy and the cop drives behind him for the entire day he's going to catch that driver with a million fences just just the way the world works now El is the most visible guy on X whenever he's tweeting in the middle of the night maybe drunk maybe more I don't know and he says some stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of course people going to turn it and weaponize that against him that doesn't mean that we should be standing by and accepting the claims that he's an anti-semite just on the face of that stupid response that he did he has plenty of actions stacked that are basically more impactful than words showing the contrary the man is not an anti-semite he's just a very peculiar guy he's out there he likes freedom of speech he likes unusual opinions and he's entertaining a lot of different ideas that does not make him an anti-semite now I don't think that he went over to Israel for an apology tour I think that's preposterous I think what he was doing is trying to figure out what the hell is going on in that that part of the world because it's freaking complicated I think that his reply basically saying to Bob Iger and Disney to go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] themselves was the perfect reply because Financial bullying by advertisers have been weaponized for the past 40 years this is why broadcast TV looks the way it is right now because everybody's weaponizing their ad spend their ad money to force down your throat ideas that they believe in Bob berer has been doing this for years with Disney with the whole walk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he managed to destroy multiple Brands like Star Wars and like many others by shoving these woke ideas down their throat ramming it with his money he's trying to do the same thing on X the only problem is that you can't threaten Elon Musk with financial destruction he honestly does not give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's not about being rich he has plenty of money but you have to understand that he literally sits up there and says look you're trying to threaten me with money how ridiculous is that because number one he's the richest guy in the world but let's put that aside El honestly doesn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about money when he made his exit and he actually got paid hundreds of millions of dollars for PayPal did he buy real estate and rode off to the sunset to Forever live a privileged life no he bought a spaceship rocket company and invested in an electric vehicle company almost going broke literally taking loans is not the sort of guy who's financially motivated he's motivated by creating cool things for people to enjoy and changing the world when they asked him hey do you think you're like the new Howard Hughes and said no and it's not because he went mad it's because Howard use has never really changed the world Howard use inventions are not out there basically impacting our life in 2023 that's what he's all about so for Bob Iger and other advertisers to threatening with money that's the perfect response you double down you apologize for being an idiot and posting that thing you explain what you actually meant was not anti-semitic and you basically say hey I'm not afraid of you you're not going to threaten me because he knows and we know X is a headache for Elan he does not need X it's a public service he's doing for all y'all he does not need X he does not need the money it doesn't need nothing so it's Bally saying look if you the people of the world will allow these Financial bullies to destroy X so be it it's your problem because look as flawed as it may be X is a very important necessity it's a public service there's very few platforms that can give you what x can give you sure it has a lot of fixes that need to be had with content moderation sure with the way they enforce policies sure but it's an infant product El completely revolutionized it and sure yeah it needs work but we don't have anything else that comes close to this and he understands this but he's not going to be bullied and financially threatened to roll back the clock and go back to what x used to be because what's the whole point then let it die I totally understand this now look people on X are going to be very judgmental it's a very powerful platform lots of opinions and you know what they say about opinions opinions are like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everybody's got one sure you got people like Peter zahan saying that El is a schmuck and they're living ex so be it you have other people like me who respect him more for what he did this is not about popularity I don't think you should be taking action because of what will be popular and what will be mainstream some people will hate you some people will love you some people will leave new people will join it is what it is the bottom line here is very simple I respect him for being Unapologetic and standing for his values I do not think for the least that he's an anti-semite I think that he scares the establishment because of the way he handles himself and and I think that he's 100% real he's a flawed individual like all of us but unlike most of these Executives he's not trying to hide it and pretend that is 100% normal a okay he's out there his thing is on his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sleeve so I respect that as flawed as he is as flawed as X is I prefer that over what x used to be as Twitter suei see you the next video,1.0,0.7

Tom Nash,ZFbrOZY9xmw,2023-11-17T22:04:05Z,The END of Elon Musk,Tesla,the guy who's leading the pitch for gang is none other than Ross Gerber the Tesla investor. Ross Gerber who is well known to be one of the most vocal investors of Tesla he's the flagship of Tesla investors. he has Ste aside as CEO of Tesla none of his actions are for the benefit of Tesla at this moment. one has to look out at the long-term future of Tesla and say if the CEO is willing to do all this stuff and nobody can stop them founder whatever you want to call them well what's going to happen to Tesla over the next 10 years are they going to achieve their mission if the CEO isn't actually the CEO because he's certainly not acting as the CEO of Tesla at the moment. are you selling your Tesla stock no I'm not selling my Tesla stock. I'm an advisor for you know lots of people who own Tesla stock and my my job is to invest in great companies. I have to spend my day basically either talking people out of Tesla stock or in a lot of cases I just can't talk them out of it anymore. Ross has three arguments against Elon number one he's no longer obsessed about Tesla. number two that none not most none of his actions is for the benefit of Tesla and anymore. number three that elon's behavior is ruining the Tesla brand and it's killing that beautiful creation. Ros Gerber already made a play against elen and he tried to get on the board of Tesla because Elon Musk was in his opinion distracted by X. he tried to get on the Tesla board to babysit Ilan as he was trying to buy X. he wants El to focus on Tesla and that's a fair expectation from an investor. if you're saying that none of his actions is for the benefit of Tesla if you're saying that it's all about X if you're saying that is tarnishing the brand ruining the brand and then in the same interview you're saying I'm not selling my share that's a walking breathing running contradiction why are you not selling your shares if you think that that's the case. I don't think that buying a Tesla makes you one of these categories as well so don't fear about driving a Tesla it's not a bad brand. they can't attack Tesla they can't attack the business so they're attacking the person. he would not have taken $200 million or whatever he got from PayPal and bought a rocket company and an electric vehicle company. The first scops campaign against El was oh my God you don't have enough range on electric vehicles then El solved this problem with superchargers and the next campaign they ran was oh my God there's no demand nobody wants an EV he solved this by selling more model wise than Corollas.,1.0,0.4

Ross has three arguments against Elon number one he's no longer obsessed about Tesla he's obsessed about Twitter. number two that none not most none of his actions is for the benefit of Tesla and anymore it's all about X or Twitter whatever want to call it. Ros Gerber already made a play against elen and he tried to get on the board of Tesla because Elon Musk was in his opinion distracted by X. he tried to get on the Tesla board to babysit Ilan as he was trying to buy X. I don't think he likes the idea of el dealing with X he wants El to focus on Tesla. if you're saying that none of his actions is for the benefit of Tesla if you're saying that it's all about X if you're saying that is tarnishing the brand ruining the brand and then in the same interview you're saying I'm not selling my share that's a walking breathing running contradiction why are you not selling your shares if you think that that's the case. I think he also has this idea that Twitter is a distraction. Elon Musk says a lot of stuff on social media. if you want to go down the rabbit hole of pulling out every single post and tweet that Elon Musk has ever put out I'm sure there's a lot of crazy things there. in fact I just stole a post from him two days ago.,1.0,-0.5

Tom Nash,oZ-zZ_2C1u0,2023-11-16T12:46:15Z,Why I’m Concerned about Palantir?,Palantir,"okay so we need to have a real talk about palente here they got three challenges three major problems they got to solve within the next 12 months otherwise something isn't ticking. The net dollar retention for Palantir is currently 107%, which is not enough for a growth company and is currently moving in the wrong direction; it needs to get closer to 120-130% to generate more revenue growth. We're currently at 17% revenue growth, but with Palantir's price-to-sales ratio, you expect to see higher growth. Palantir is growing at 17% compared to Snowflake's 35%, yet they trade at similar multiples, making Palantir trade more like Oracle. The company's freemium model of establishing relationships first and monetizing later has to deliver results, showing increased revenue in the mid-20s percentage to justify its current valuation within the next 12 months. Item number three is the competition from Microsoft. Microsoft Fabric is a massive problem for Palantir and has to be solved within the next 12 months. The only scenario where Microsoft's strategy of driving people out of business does not work is if Palantir's product is so much superior that no amount of discounts or rebates will work. I believe Palantir will prove it, but the burden of proof is on them to show the world they are a legitimate player and won't be bullied by Microsoft Fabric. There's no need to overreact to Palantir's great earnings or S&P 500 inclusion; it's still a long way from where it needs to be and is highly volatile. If you believe in this company, you have to think long-term and believe they can solve these challenges.",1.0,-0.3
Tom Nash,oZ-zZ_2C1u0,2023-11-16T12:46:15Z,Why I’m Concerned about Palantir?,Snowflake,snowflake is giving you 151% net do retention and paler is giving you 107 it's a huge gap. Pante is growing at 177% snowflake is growing at 35% but they're trading at similar multiples. In order for penter to justify the current price to sales the current valuation it has to get closer to snowflake again not saying it has to go to 35% annual revenue growth but it's definitely has to be in the mid 20s to justify this current valuation.,0.9,0.4
Tom Nash,oZ-zZ_2C1u0,2023-11-16T12:46:15Z,Why I’m Concerned about Palantir?,Oracle,why does palen deserve this high price to sales multiple despite the fact that this trading more like Oracle than it's trading more like snowflake,0.8,-0.2
Tom Nash,oZ-zZ_2C1u0,2023-11-16T12:46:15Z,Why I’m Concerned about Palantir?,Microsoft,"item number three I want to mention today has to do more with another company which is called Microsoft. Over the past two years I've been banging the drum on Microsoft and I've been saying look the only competition for this company can come from Microsoft and the reason is that nobody really can compete with Palantir's products. Microsoft does not have to honestly compete because the whole modus operandi of Microsoft is to come into an established Market where somebody has a great product like Slack and take it away by bringing an inferior product to the market for free or through rebates, then wait for the other guys to go out of business. Microsoft has been screwing clients like this and making lots of money like this, but I totally respect what Microsoft is doing as it's legal, moral, and the right way to do business in Enterprise software Hardball business. Microsoft has this thing called Microsoft Fabric, which I think is a massive problem for Palantir and has to be solved within the next 12 months. The only scenario in which the Microsoft strategy of driving people slowly out of business does not work is when the gap of quality between the Microsoft inferior new product and the superior product in the industry is so massive. I believe Palantir will prove it, but they have 12 months to show they are a legitimate player and not going to be bullied by Microsoft Fabric.",1.0,-0.2

Tom Nash,5IQ8Fo1uaXM,2023-11-10T13:17:55Z,Billionaire Ron Baron Just Left CNBC Interviewer SPEECHLESS,Tesla,"so billionaire Ron Baron was on CNBC this morning at 6: a.m. and I can't believe I'm saying this at his age with his amount of money he's actually hustling at 6:00 a.m. and he was talking about Tesla now just when you think that Ron Baron cannot give you any more new insights about Tesla because of how much he talks about it on mainstream media and how much fun he is actually breaking apart he came on this morning and dropped a ton of Bombshells a ton of new info and a ton of new valuable insights about this company which we've never discussed before it's absolutely unbelievable how every time he goes on these shows he manages to do so he just spoke last week and he had new material this week given your very bullish views on Tesla but what was so interesting about the report was that they really were trying to define the company as an EV automobile maker is that the way you think about this company I think about it as a technology company that's providing services to other Auto their own company and to others they can't possibly be matched by anyone else um they have data technology they make cars cheaper than was when Ford makes one of these cars an electric car every car they make they lose $336,000 on $36,000 per car our company now makes about $8 or $9,000 in profit a car they were making $155,000 in profit a car but if they build a plant that cost $7 billion for a million cars that plant was making $15 million a year uh $15 billion a year on a $7 billion investment 15 billion on a 7 billion investment an ordinary Industrial company would make 15% on Capital 20% the most this guy's making his Capital twice a year now now he's making it once a year he's making $8 billion in a $7 billion plan so he's the lowest cost person everything about the business is tiing to drive prices lower talked about trying to bring prices down and that's something that Elon Musk has talked a lot about at the same time that he's going to try to bring prices down you have the potential the the potential for Tesla to become a target of the UAW which of course just made this new deal uh with the other big automakers at meaningfully higher prices in terms of what those employees are going to be getting what do you think about that I think tesas employees are the highest paid workers in the world as far as the automobile companies go because they own stock as a function of the stock and uh that stock option would not be present in all instances if it were a unionized company when the unions were control of Fremont as soon as they had trouble they ran from it Tesla took over that plant in Fremont after the unions had left after the company had gone bankrupt uh Tesla employees there's a a good story that uh one of the executives of and then I want to talk about yeah yeah no of course uh uh one of the executives who devised the pay plan for the employees was telling me that he's a small Jewish guy like me and he was walking through a plan and a large black man walks over to him shaved head tattoos all over the place and says Ira Ira are you the man uh who devised the pay plan for us and uh he says yes he said I want you to know that I'm the first man in my family the first person in my family to ever be able to afford a home and thank you very much and so the workers there make more than anyone else by far and their health care been all the benefits are better the unions have been trying to organize Tesla Toyota all the foreign companies for years they failed repeatedly why because those companies are not the unions not in business to keep the employees their unions have the power uh before we move off Tesla by the way the stock went down yesterday not because that report went down because of of Joe Biden President Biden who by the way I love what he's doing for Israel but I don't like that much what he's doing in business um some things I like uh but he's the one who said Union should organize Tesla that's what happened yesterday when the stockh town okay we'll come back to to the Biden piece in just a second Melissa Lee I think has a quick Tesla question because I know I want to talk to you about a whole bunch of other things Melissa yeah Ron thanks for taking my question um you know when you think about China how how do you think about the growth there because that's a key piece of the Tesla story um Tesla right now is doing about a million eight cars a year when we started investing in the company 7 years ago when we invested between 2014 and 2016 they were doing 41,000 cars a year so 41 ,000 cars a year to a million 8 they're on their way to 20 million cars China is about a million right now of their 2 million 8 uh but uh a large percentage of what they make in China is exported from China to Europe uh and uh the more they build in Europe of course the more they're going to save on Transportation costs and duties uh the idea is that China uh invited musk in and invited him in because the Chinese car companies had done very poorly for a long time and the promise was that he's going to help them uh become better cor manufacturers and going to he's not trying to take over the market in China better cor manufacturers and develop a local supply chain and so he's the only one that's ever been invited into China that's been able to not have a partner a local partner to operate their business so I'm convinced that they have good operations in China the person who runs their Chinese business the uh the Tesla business in uh uh in Austin in fact is probably in line to be a know important person uh at Tesla overall he's now he's Chinese and he runs he was brought from China to to Texas and uh uh runs the business there he's going to be in charge of all the automobile business so I think the relations they have with China are exceptionally good uh uh they both people are getting something from it uh and I think that that business will continue to grow but he's going to open Plants all around the world uh for lowcost cars and wait till you see what's going to happen when all of a sudden they start selling cars instead of for 40 $1,000 a piece for $25,000 a piece which is going to happen in past a year year and a half uh from their new model the new model they think is going to do 5 million cars a year 5 million cars a year for the model two that's coming I I I know we problems we move off Tesla by the way but I just want to know this do you believe that that autonomous cars and this whole idea of Robo taxes and the like has to happen is that part of the valuation plan for you and the reason I ask is you just saw that GM crws effectively shut down their autonomous vehicle program in the US at least temporarily because they haven't been able to get it to the right place clearly Tesla hasn't been able to hasn't gotten there yet either and so I'm curious but as far as Tesla that's software no one has that they have data no one has that Tesla is going to have that car they're going to be able to charge for autonomous $2 or $3,000 a car a year to have your car operate all by itself and it's virtually there and and I don't think people realize that they have any idea of what that's going to mean and that's a business that Tim that business alone is going to be worth a trillion dollars that business alone is going to be able to do $100 billion $80 billion a year revenues in three or four years and growing every time and they'll do 20 million cars a year ultimately for themselves and then addition to that of the 80 million cars probably another 30 million who use their technology Mary Barra who I'm friendly with asked me about um I don't know a year ago could I fix her up with Elon not a date but to fix her up and I said sure I'll set it up and they went to on the company conference and they met and uh and and she hadn't met before and and then afterwards uh then I saw her on your program and she quoted and she said uh oh yeah Elon we text all the time right we text all the time and the reason that's important is that the reason they do this with the uh charging as well the reason they're doing all that is because tessla doesn't want to put other guys out of business they're going to be his customers those people will make the metal ultimately for a lot of cars and he will supply the guts that Intel inside of of a computer that's going to be Tesla inside of cars that's going to be an amazing business for them so the first thing he was asked about is the HSBC negative rating so HSBC actually initiated coverage on Tesla and they basically said look we're having it at $146 it's basically a bad investment at 2110 it's not the first time we heard analysts talk bad about Tesla but the question was posed to Ron Baron and Andrew basically said look Ron HSBC is saying it's a bad stock what do you think and then Ron basically starts with the usual he says look it's a company it's going to sell a bunch of technology and services to the rest of the industry it's not just a car producer it's going to make money per car more than anybody can imagine it already makes right now the best margin in the industry in fact it's probably the only EV maker that's actually making money off of its cars it's return on capital for its investors is unbelievable in the past in the present and in the future and they're also the Front Runners for the next big scurve which is the the self-driving the autonomous driving they have the best technology they have the most amount of data and they have the best employees working on R&D so how can you think that this is a bad stock at $200 given the amount of massive upside they have the proven track record the number one CEO in the business and all this good stuff so basically he broke apart and basically said look he's not going to say it in so many words because he's not going to talk bad about HSBC but the idea was like look they don't know what they're talking about Andro that was the main point of what he said here but without trashing HSBC let's talk about the next item he also talked about the fact that maybe there's no demand because Andrew as a part of the mainstream media establishment he brought up the new scops against Tesla so Tesla has been basically dealing with the scops from mainstream media on behalf of Legacy auto claiming that the demand for EVS is going away and you shouldn't buy EVS because they're going to be gone in a few years basically it's just a big balloon is popping right now Etc ETA Etc now I know why Again The Big Three is pushing this narrative through Main media because they found out that making EVS is not as simple as advertising about EVS they've actually found out that making these is very hard it's very difficult and it's very hard to scale they're basically losing so much money per vehicle they've decided to say hey hold on a second we're going to go out of business trying to compete with Tesla so let's try to convince people they shouldn't buy an EV there's no demand for an EV and basically kill this narrative it's like saying hey remove this from the Internet it's such an old way of thinking about it but the question was posed to Ron Baron and say look Ron do you think there's a you know a decline in demand of EVS right now and he said look my guy right now uh in the world we're basically pushing 80 million Vehicles a year 8 z 80 million new vehicles per year cool ultimately the 100% of this pie will be electric make no mistake about it it's just a question of time so to tell me there's a demand problem is not seeing the future the idea here is like this 80 million will eventually be EVS how long it's going to take and how many years until we get there I don't know he didn't specify but the idea of a demand problem it's a fabrication by mainstream media on behalf of the big Auto the fact of the matter is Eves are here to stay EVS are here to become the new trend and the new standard and I'll explain right now what I think Ron Baron is talking about and why EVS are a little bit you know sluggish on demand it's not what you think it's not what main media is telling you and I'm going to add to what Ron said I by the way I agree 100% ran they will hold 100% of the market EVs and Tesla will be a big chunk of it but let me explain what's going on right now so ran is talking about two things here and I'm going to add my third Ron is saying look number one H people are you know kind of skittish about the price I mean the price of these EVS are now you know higher than a $225,000 base car and times are getting tougher etc etc etc etc right number two run says look the dealers aren't really pushing the EVS because it doesn't make sense the dealers make money on the repairs on on the parts on the maintenance there's no parts repairs and maintenance for Tesla there's just not so the dealers are not really incentivized to push Teslas sorry to push EVS right if it's a Ford or a GM or anybody else why would they push an EV when they can push the usual stuff shell sh reverse and basically then have it maintenance and replace Parts every year and make a ton of money basically by milking the customer in an aftermarket so Ron is talking about that is the fact look the EVS are not really pushing that from the distribution side on on the side of the dealerships and there's a price kind of fear but let me be more clear about this and I'll explain what I think he means you have to understand something there's a demand curve that is being created when a new product is launched whenever a new technology a new product is launched to the market there's a problem right you have to find out the best way to price it so the new technologies usually get priced the massive premium whenever you have the best computer the best graphics card you know Tesla Model S somebody will be willing to pay premium for this the new early adopters they'll pay a massive premium for this now once you sell to all the new early adopters then you have to move to stage two which is just sell to the excited newly adopters which are willing to pay a premium but not a super premium for the product then you sell to all of them and then you move one tier down and then so forth and so forth and so forth right now Tesla hit about level four or five after they clean house on level one two and three and four Tesla basically dominated 70% of the first three layers of customers all the early adopters all the new adopters all the excited people everybody who's willing to pay premium for an EV well let's say 70% of them now own a Tesla and Tesla brand loyalty shows they'll stay at Tesla customers for many many years now the question is what happens when you hit layer four layer four is the normal guy who's not excited about EVS is looking at an EV and is looking at as a comparable to a classic internal combustion engine car you know what do you do then well then you have to be competitive with pricing so when you're talking about a $40,000 car you now it's going to be a little bit too pricey for somebody who's looking for a base entry level vehicle at this point you have to start dropping prices it's just a matter of basically pricing as you go down the tiers the price has to come down but here's the crazy part it doesn't mean lack of demand it just means that there's more price sensitivity the lower you get on the pyramid when you get to the next level the total addressable Market gets much much bigger but the price sensitivity also becomes bigger but guess what and that's something I want to clarify here CU I don't think Ron made that point the only company that can afford to provide competitive pricing for EVS compared to Classic internal combustion engine is Tesla because Tesla has the margins to do that and still remain profitable the GMS the Ford and all the rest of them are already losing money per vehicle and the current price level which is the premium price level so Tesla dropping prices is not about demand it's about cleaning the fifth and sixth level which will clean house again because Ford and Gem simply can't compete if they try to they'll go out of business so that's all it is it's an offensive move by Tesla they're taking over the market literally by dropping prices and yes it's not going to sell as fast at the same earlier price but it's going to sell when it's $30,000 and Ron actually talked about this in the video when it's 25 remember at the end of the video he said wait wait until Tesla at $25,000 you'll see what happens then because then we're talking about layer seven layer eight out of 10 that's the mass adoption so I think that's a good point there's no demand problem it's a scop it's a complete horse manure ignore that now he also was asked about the UAW and he was like basically Andrew said look the UAW just basically bent over GM they bent over Ford I mean they're going to go for Tesla's neck right now what makes you think Tesla isn't you know susceptible to this and Ron said look you have to understand something and I agree with with him 100% And I said this in my earlier video I said this sentence I said Tesla has made more employees millionaires than any other car company in the world in existence and I think Ron was saying it in different words he said look there's no issue of U UAW UAW cannot get into Tesla because the employees in Tesla are the highest paid in the industry by a country mile without increasing the cost of goods and the cost of manufacturing through employee stock options all of them have options all of them stock in the company they're invested mentally and emotionally in the success of the product and for them to let the UAW in and lose the employee stock option plans is lunacy especially when they already have the best conditions the best the best health care and the most exciting place to work the amount of people who are applying for Tesla is like you what 100 to one actually get accepted so the idea is very simple you know UW goes where the weakness are Tesla's employees scoree is very very strong they're well compensated the conditions are great and they're absolutely Ely excited about the company UW doesn't stand a chance I 100% agree with him I think what they did to JM and Ford um is going to be a crime because what it does it pushes Jam Ford closer and faster to the brink of another bailout but that's neither here or there now um he did mention President Biden said look I love what President Biden is doing for Israel but what he's doing for Tesla is a little bit annoying and I'll explain what he means and I tweeted about this today because President Biden said look I think the uww should get into Tesla and that's his opinion and he's entitled to no problem but what I'm saying is look if you're talking about Tesla doing things the way they do right now which is not unionized right so if Tesla's not unionized and they literally gave America The dominance in the Global Auto industry back after losing it 40 years ago to the Chinese to the Japanese to the Koreans not that or they first it was Japanese then it was Koreans now it's Chinese so all of these car companies from around the world came in and took away the Global Auto industry from the Americans if you go to Europe if you go to anywhere in the world there's just not enough us made cars except Tesla Tesla brought back America to the front of the stage to dominance in the global vehicle industry and in the upside in the future so the reward for them doing that should not be changing the way they're doing business I'm not personal about what Biden said all I'm saying is like why would you want to change the way they do business the way they interact with employees when the current way they're doing is gave them the best margins in the industry and dominance in an industry that you guys for GM lost to the Japanese the Koreans and then the Chinese I'm just I'm in agreement with him I don't think it's a good idea and again nothing personal now uh he was also you know asked about China well there's also a demand problem China and another fabrication and he said look this is another narrative you know Tesla in 2016 sold 40,000 cars Tesla this year going to sell 2 million cars do at some point will sell 20 million cars that's just a fact so you can talk about a demand problem here or there because of a bad year or good year but Tesla is in route to making 20 million cars per year does it really matter I mean he's not worthy at all and you know he's basically saying look you have to understand that once the price hits $25,000 this is the part where he said wait for the $25,000 this demand problem goes away it's not a demand problem it's just a pricing strategy of how you collect the maximum amount of profit of each layer of of uh of early adopters now he also said something really interesting which I found really fascinating he said look in 10 15 20 years GM and Ford and the rest of them all of them are going to be building the metal the metal casings that that make up your usual car but Tesla will be the brain of every single car out there because Tesla is the only one who has FSD nobody else has it they talked about Cruise basically shutting down there operation and and Ron said look the cruise thing cost $250,000 per car equipment and they need pre-install maps that was really fun to use but it's not really practical in the real world environment when FSD we saw I hacked all ass FSD like early early version somebody hacked it in Ukraine in Kiev and the thing was driving itself it's literally you can drop it anywhere with a camera no Maps no crazy equipment just basic cameras so he also dropped a major bombshell on this he said look just the FSD alone because of all the licensing to the rest of the oems just the fs alone is going to be a trillion dollar business that's more than Tesla is worth today they have the best software and they have the best data and the fastest rate of collecting data so when you think about everything that Ron said in this interview he clearly understands Tesla better than 99% of investors and I think you guys should listen as well",1.0,0.9

text all the time and the reason that's important is that the reason they do this with the uh charging as well the reason they're doing all that is because tessla doesn't want to put other guys out of business they're going to be his customers those people will make the metal ultimately for a lot of cars and he will supply the guts that Intel inside of of a computer that's going to be Tesla inside of cars that's going to be an amazing business for them now he also said something really interesting which I found really fascinating he said look in 10 15 20 years GM and Ford and the rest of them all of them are going to be building the metal the metal casings that that make up your usual car but Tesla will be the brain of every single car out there because Tesla is the only one who has FSD nobody else has it,1.0,-0.7

Tom Nash,5IQ8Fo1uaXM,2023-11-10T13:17:55Z,Billionaire Ron Baron Just Left CNBC Interviewer SPEECHLESS,Cruise,"you just saw that GM crws effectively shut down their autonomous vehicle program in the US at least temporarily because they haven't been able to get it to the right place clearly Tesla hasn't been able to hasn't gotten there yet either and so I'm curious and you know we just had uh DK kahi on from Uber and he said look could be another 5 or 10 years before this type of technology is really ready and we've been talking that 5 or 10 years sort of path for 5 or 10 years uh we have a small investment in Cruise uh $30 million uh and made the investment because I wanted to learn about the process that they were doing every one of those cruise cars cost $250,000 $250,000 to have the equipment that's on it in order to operate autonomously uh they have to be specifically in mapping every city and it's it's it's a tougher business we were out there a couple of months ago uh to drive around in one it was pretty amazing you're driving along they they pick you up at 9:00 at night you drive around San Francisco you pull up and there's a car next to you that's also no driver in it and it pulls away and you pull away it's like the headless horsemen we really something so uh so we have a small investment in that I really like Kyle uh I like the executive who was there who left and goes to went to Exon uh I think ultimately Microsoft thought they were excellent and invested in it as well uh but we have a very small investment but as far as Tesla that's software no one has that they have data no one has that they talked about Cruise basically shutting down there operation and and Ron said look the cruise thing cost $250,000 per car equipment and they need pre-install maps that was really fun to use but it's not really practical in the real world environment when FSD we saw I hacked all ass FSD like early early version somebody hacked it in Ukraine in Kiev and the thing was driving itself it's literally you can drop it anywhere with a camera no Maps no crazy equipment just basic cameras",1.0,-0.6
Tom Nash,5IQ8Fo1uaXM,2023-11-10T13:17:55Z,Billionaire Ron Baron Just Left CNBC Interviewer SPEECHLESS,Toyota,the unions have been trying to organize Tesla Toyota all the foreign companies for years they failed repeatedly why because those companies are not the unions not in business to keep the employees their unions have the power I'm not personal about what Biden said all I'm saying is like why would you want to change the way they do business the way they interact with employees when the current way they're doing is gave them the best margins in the industry and dominance in an industry that you guys for GM lost to the Japanese the Koreans and then the Chinese not that or they first it was Japanese then it was Koreans now it's Chinese so all of these car companies from around the world came in and took away the Global Auto industry from the Americans if you go to Europe if you go to anywhere in the world there's just not enough us made cars except Tesla Tesla brought back America to the front of the stage to dominance in the global vehicle industry and in the upside in the future so the reward for them doing that should not be changing the way they're doing business I'm not personal about what Biden said all I'm saying is like why would you want to change the way they do business the way they interact with employees when the current way they're doing is gave them the best margins in the industry and dominance in an industry that you guys for GM lost to the Japanese the Koreans and then the Chinese I'm just I'm in agreement with him I don't think it's a good idea and again nothing personal,1.0,0.1

Tom Nash,W2RC0ghYVO0,2023-11-09T13:38:25Z,Palantir JUST Dropped A Massive Bombshell,Palantir,500 million reasons to be happy today that is of course if you're a paler shareholder because according to digital Health paler is to be named the winner of the 500 million pound NHS contract from the UK government worth about $580 million now according to the report the decision is made it is paler with Accenture and they've beat out Oracle and IBM and the final announcement is just days away whatever that means now this contract isn't about replacing the UK it Health Care Systems no no no that's not the point the point is to do exactly what pilot Foundry did with the airlines if you remember we covered skywise a project that started originally with Airbus and how it absolutely revolutionized the airline industry now this is the same thing but in healthcare this is going to be the pilot for a much much bigger project I'll talk about it in a second 500 million is Chum change towards the total addressable Market of this thing if it actually goes through let allow me to explain so the idea here is very simple instead of replacing every single bad it system in the UK that's not what this project is about it's about taking all of this data that's been generated by the various it systems in the United Kingdom which is now separate in its own silos and bring it all together in one holistic approach in which it actually talks to each other and a bunch of decision- making is allowed that will improve health care will improve the time of waiting will improve the cost and basically a win-win win the government spends less you get better treatment you get faster treatment and people are not bummed out because they're waiting for months and months for things probably they don't need so a total Improvement of the Health Care system in the UK all by combining all this massive data from all these separate systems across the UK Healthcare System into one system that talks to each other piler does not generate any new data that's not the point they'll take all this massive unused and completely misunderstood data and they will bring it in one poll which will allow the organization the government the company whatever that may be to make better decisions to save money to save lives to increase efficiency with skywise they reduce the time to actually produce an a350 by 33% which was insane this time they will do the same thing with the UK Healthcare System now the crazy part about it they've already done it according to a pilot they ran with two hospitals in the UK through the NHS as a pilot for this they've reduced the weight time for patients by 30% in those two hospitals that is insane weit time reduction UK these things not supposed to be in the same sentence I know why this thing has taken so long and I'll explain as somebody who's not from the UK as a US person you might be weirded out by this by saying well look paler is such a great company they work with all the three later agency with the US they're the most trustworthy company you can rely on to give all this data to but that's exactly the problem in Europe and in the UK included they look at this as a bad thing if this is kind of a cia. or some sort of a private spy company working for the US government if we give them our data it's going to be dangerous it's going to be used by the US government all this silly nonsense Bon it took a few months or a little bit longer for the UK government to understand that this argument was brought up by a bunch of Interest based advocacy groups that have now basically closed their doors and not no no longer being funded but this argument was baloney paler does not create data paler does not sell data and paler does not give anyone's data to anyone besides the person whose data that is that's the whole point of this company that's why they're getting all these massive contracts from skywise from the US Government from a bunch of companies in the United States it's because paler are the best safeguards for information now once this hurdle was passed and the UK government realized well paner isn't going to sell our data it's not going to lose our data it's not going to be hacked so in fact they're the best place to put our data and to trust this company the next stage started they ran this pilot and then the pilot penter absolutely killed it and now we're getting to the important part why is it so important to pente because we're talking about a company that's going to do $2.2 billion dollars in Revenue this year that's less than 5% it's not such a big deal is it well you shouldn't look at it from a monetary perspective now obviously every contract is a win I'm not going to sit here and say it's not every contract they secure is a win every revenue is a win but this one is not about the money the idea here is that pan is very very strong on the US side they're very strong on the US governmental side and the been for two decades now they're getting stronger and stronger every quarter on the US commercial side and you can see it in the latest earnings they're absolutely been killing it but the main weakness of paler is in Europe now obviously they're not going to work with China or Russia with enemies of the US the axes of evil so their two total rle markets are the US and the EU and little markets accept that as well but the idea here is that EU is the next place to conquer for paler but they have no relation ships they have no real dominance like they have in the US and has to start somewhere now they've done it on the commercial side skywise with Airbus was a massive success and the test cases from this are basically Paving the way for palen to start launching commercially but what about UK governments what about EU governments what about German governments what about the entire European Union nobody wants to be first they know that this is a great company they know the US government is happy with it but somebody has to go first somebody has to jump in the pool and see if the water are good and this contract opens the doors for two things for paler let me explain now once this contract is deployed and once paler delivers on the promise much like they've done with Airbus and the skywise system and results start coming out more governments are going to say look we want to save money we want to reduce waiting times we want to improve treatment let us use the same system as well the same thing that happen with the airand industry is going to happen with the healthc Care Systems around the European union now the second phase is once the entire European Union is working with paler on the Healthcare systems and the results are Stellar they can expand to other stuff many many many many doors will open to paler but the first one is the hardest unfortunately that's the way it is nobody wants to be first but once this door is busted the floodgates will be open for paler but the question here is what does it mean for paler investors current existing potential should everybody run right now and buy paler shares like there's no tomorrow now first of all I'm going to say this is not Financial advice this is just my opinion you have to do your own research and make your own decisions you're all grown-ups and not kids so don't be doing anything because I said so okay let's put this on the table first now my opinion is very very simple and I've been very very consistent about it penter has come a long way a long way in the past three years $2.2 billion Revenue a year this is what they're going to do this time four consecutive quarters of Gap profitability S&P 500 inclusion almost imminent stock based compensation went down from 6% of Revenue to 1% of Revenue within the past two years closing in on 20% Revenue growth year per year currently at 177% Great quarter they've beat results twice in a row already maybe even more I can't remember so they are getting better but there's still issues they have to address the net dollar retention has to improve the revenue growth is still not at 20% not at 20 25% where it should be so Peter needs to grow faster it needs to improve its net door retention and it needs to improve the geographies to go outside the scope of the US these three things are still in the making and we still have to see that they're actually making it so the idea here isn't to jump on and sell your house and buy paler shares tomorrow like don't do it just simply don't now what we do is we buy paler stock all the time down or up we ignore the price whatsoever where we are looking at the price is whether the price gets too high then we just buy normally but if the price gets too low we start buying a little bit faster increase the idea here have lowered their cost base in paler over the past three years even though the stock went crazy $6 $40 $7 $20 all of them are way closer to the bottom than to the top with this system without spending crazy money and gambling this is the right way to do long-term investing.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,I4G2CYSNT6E,2023-11-07T18:17:44Z,Billionaire Ron Baron Just Dropped another MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Tesla,"so Ron Baron the billionaire speaks for the first time since Elon had this really weird conference call about the earnings in which he basically said that the world is coming to an end everybody should run and hide etc etc crashing the stock price now Ron Baron comes out for the first time and talks about why he isn't selling any Tesla stock since you first invested the stock is up some, 1600% why did you first buy Tesla and why not sell it now and lock in these games now I'm not going to take a side on the conference call in fact I don't think El did anything wrong I thought he was a little bit Melancholy but I mean he always plays down he under promises and overd delivers that's what Elon does so I never felt any type of way about it but a lot of people get stressed out and Ron Baron is here for the rescue especially after Elon Musk is now worrying about the Cyber truck and the US consumer I met Elon in 2010 it took me four years of doing doing research before we ultimately decided to invest and we invested between 2014 and 2016 we invested a total of approximately uh $400 million $380 million in three years is when we were buying the stock and that was it and the average uh price and uh We've made about 20 times our money since then uh we made uh at the peak and we've probably made about five five and a half billion dollars in profits so far and I think we'll make another five times in the next seven or eight or nine or 10 years so basically in this clip they asked him one thing which is Hey Ron the stock is up 1, 1600% since you bought you've put in 400 million youve made 20x on your money why not sell your Tesla shares you're up 20x my guy kind of that's the question that they were asking and then he goes on this very interesting monologue in which he lists all the reasons why he's not selling any Tesla stock despite what seems to be a bad conference call what made us buy it is that uh he is a mission driven person uh his idea was to uh try to convert the United States the world from using petrol to using electricity uh I thought initially it was unlikely he'd be successful that's when I met him in 2010 2014 I had become convinced he would become successful so so basically we invested because I thought there was a big upside I thought he was a brilliant guy I still think that uh we continue to work on our research and Company all the time um virtually every week we're talking to someone there I was out in paloalto a week ago and I was there for an afternoon and I met with two Executives who were the people who were in charge of autonomous driving and also in charge of uh of compute of when inidia does the chips so what what we're always doing we're trying to understand how a business operates and what's special about it and why other people can't do the same thing and in the case of Tesla we are convinced that people cannot do what they're doing and that ultimately it's not just going to be a car company it's not just going to be a battery company but ultimately all the other car companies which 50 years ago elected to become much more profitable and Outsource supplies and compute to other people we're going to be like intel was inside of computers this is going to be Tesla inside of cars all the cars are going to be used in Tesla autonomous driving no one else can possibly compete I'm not going to sell Tesla shares because Elon Musk is the CEO he's the founder he's the living breathing Spirit of Tesla and he's a mission-driven guy who always delivers and he also says look I'm investing in people this guy is the best CEO in the business he's proven it time and time and time again I'm not going to bet against him in fact he said look we're going to make eight or nine times their money from this point on on Tesla how about that so if you kind of translate it what he's talking about is what $2,000 per share $1,500 per share I mean you do your math but what he also said look Elon made us a lot of money he made our clients a lot of money it's not as if Elon just lost the ability to generate cash flow and create evolu EV revolutionary products literally out of thin air I mean the guy knows what he's doing he has some sort of a quality of R&D which is unrivaled if you look at other car companies other energy companies other robotic companies they're all good companies but the quality of Tesla R&D research and development of Tesla is rivaled who else even comes close to Tesla full step driving autonomous driving right now is a wide open road for Tesla literally to conquer nobody is even second there's nobody close with Miles with amount of data with quality with how close they are to actual autonomous driving how about robotics how about energy how about all that stuff I don't want to regurgitate the same of things but he's the quality of R&D is so much better than anybody else so he's not only first and is leading he's getting a faster and he's leading more and more as time goes by so his lead actually grows exponentially who's going to catch him and even though the markets are not that good right now Tesla is still the best in the business why bet against it now he also said look Tesla is much more than a car company in fact it's much more than an energy company what he's talking about in his mind I think is the fact that he sees FSD full set driving is the real engine for this for the business for Tesla because it says look whether Tesla sells 5 million cars or 20 million cars it doesn't matter the way he sees it is that FSD becomes an industry standard much like in this example he used Intel chips became an example right they became a standard in the future every single car you're going to see on the road is going to have Tesla FSD in it why because there's nobody comes close and they're almost done so if Tesla is going to making so much money off of Licensing their FSD technology to every single car company out there they're much more than a car company and much more than an energy company they software company in fact a software company with a monopoly on a very valuable service you've invested essentially not only in these two companies in a big way but in one man um how do you account for that risk reward you know there's something known as a keyman risk H how do you how do you uh think about about that bet know um when I was in paloalto uh they gave us access Elon gave us access to meet with the head of compute uh and also over the head of autonomous driving and U for a half hour piece he doesn't want those people talking to investors he wants them working in the business and the compute person uh his dad was an immigrant coming from Ireland and uh he worked in a kitchen and he goes to school and he becomes the uh a computer a brilliant computer guy and he gets a job at Apple ultimately and he runs the Apple uh the Apple business Apple compute very very important business and then he gets recruited to go to to Tesla and he's now eight years at Tesla uh running that business he says he has no turnover this everyone there who works for him is wealthy uh but there's all a a mission so I said well so why did you leave Apple uh to go to Tesla he say Well Ron uh at Apple I had a very important role there and uh and Tim and Steve Jobs never came to visit me once not once and for when he's at Tesla Elon comes in every you know every quarter for a couple three hours and we talk and he comes off initially with a big broad question and then he drills down and uh question he he says I can answer question first and then gets to the keeps drilling down and and he says oh my God how could he ask that question how do I not know the answer to that one so so the basic is he says there is not another company that he is aware of where there's an engineering a brilliant engineer with a photographic memory who remembers everything and can transport information that he gets from one area to another so it's a brilliant guy he cares about everything he does and he he is interested in how everything works so U James Gman goes to visit him from Morgan Stanley goes to visit him and tells me about uh this the story about walking through the factory and stopping at every every station and him knowing the name of everyone there and what everyone does and warther Isaacson tells me who wrote the book on Elon tells me he's walking through he was with him for two years and he says one example Ron because I'm walking through a plant with them and some Engineers working on on a valve that they can't figure out how to make it work and Elon looks at it as he's just on the Fly looks at it he says do this do this and then keeps walking they try it and it works and so everything this guy does is uh is like that so so now how do I get comfortable with one person uh being so brilliant being in charge this is like Da Vinci this is like a businessman Da Vinci if you are an individual and you are a graduate of a top engineering school you want to work for either SpaceX or Tesla so you want to work with other billion people you want to work on a mission you want to work in something that's really important you want to work in something that you think is going to be relevant and uh and fascinating with other people like you and he gets the greatest people he has three and a half million people apply for jobs last year at SpaceX and Tesla three and a half million people 30,000 jobs it's harder to get into getting a job at Tesla and SpaceX than to go into Harvard so they have amazing Engineers that are all you know motivated highly motivated to accomplish a goal and that's what they're going to do so so whether Elon there of course it's riskier when the company's smaller than when it becomes larger but as you get as you grow I'm betting he's going to stay alive for at least five or 10 years I think that's a good bet we'll see you got plenty of security Ford GM and all they're basically hanging out by thread if Tesla survives and they go away Tesla makes a ton of money now um he also talks about the fact that he thinks Tesla sells 15 to 20 million cars in the future I know this sounds like a lot but he's talking about the way way far away future and even that is kind of insane to think about today but look if he's right if he's talking about 15 to 20 million cars and 100% of the licensing Market of FSD the current valuation is way way below where it should be now I don't know if he's right or wrong about this it's your choice I'm way closer to the opinion that he right that is wrong so on that Spectrum I'm way way way closer to Ron Baron than to the fact that he might be wrong but he also tells this interesting story about how engineering is so good at Tesla because they have literally the best people now the numbers are insane for every 3 and a half thousand jobs you got 3.5 million applicants they have literally the best people come in there so if you already have the best technology you have the best margins you have the best machinery and you have the best people I mean you're literally going to win obviously on top of it all he talks about El being kind of the Midas everything he touches becomes gold and he says look there's a keyman risk here when he talks about this little story I believe IL is going to stay alive for the next 5 to 10 years what is actually referring to is the keyman risk because IL is the living breathing Spirit of the company there's a fear that if he goes out and goes away or something happens to him the Tesla gets wrecked Tesla already has a self-sustained independent operation it's not about El anymore obviously it's great to have him there and he's a huge huge asset for Tesla but even if El steps away tomorrow remember he stepped away for a whole year working on this Twitter exting nothing happened to Tesla I mean Tesla has independent existence it's not just about IL anymore that's a fable now",1.0,0.9

battle this isn't the war yet and talking about War I want to say a few things about Alex karp about paler about the culture in that company the only company in the world that took out a whole ad and said we stand with Israel Point Blank period was paler and today on the call Alex karp reiterated that and he said we stand with Israel there's no two ways about it when the country is being attacked by a terrorist organization there's no false equivalency there's no justifications there's no weight but there's nothing only Justice only peace you cannot make peace with people who want to destroy you I'm glad to see there's a few voices of Reason in this in this universe and pener is one of them and I mean this with the absolute love to my Muslim Brothers we have no beef between Christians Jews Muslims Hindu or whatever religion this is beyond religion this is beyond borders this is a terrorist organization that should not exist and every member of it must be taken out has nothing to do with Israel or religion and I'm glad that paler gets it yesterday I saw Tim Kennedy on The Joe Rogan show Get It If You by the way if you have a chance I'm trying to get Tim Kennedy to come and

Tom Nash,Hb6yRskogF4,2023-10-31T17:40:31Z,"Enough with the excuses, Tesla Sucks…",Tesla,"okay enough with the excuses Tesla sucks simple at least that's what people who don't understand the stock and the company think now what happened why did Tesla drop 5% and is currently below $200 a share now for those of you who freaked out because of it I just want to let you know that in the past quarter Tesla sold 16,000 Model S and X combined while model Y and 3 sold about 420,000 so Tesla doesn't really sell X and S so that's really a nothing Burger now on the flip side of it we had some non- Tesla related news that seem to have tank Tesla stock again so again something that completely misunderstood now the thing is that El actually funded this with loans and a lot of these loans are collateralized by Tesla shares so the fear is that if fan you know can't make the loans the Tesla shares will have to be sold in order to pay for these loans it's going to tank the share price only thing is this has nothing to do on the cash flow the ability of el to pay how his loans it's an internal valuation process for stock based compensation it has nothing to do with the viability of Elon Musk to pay out these loans so again a nothing burger that freaks people out for no reason now another non- Tesla related story that kind of Tanked the stck again I don't understand why the UAW won surprise surprise they took GM and Stant T and Ford to the Woodshed and they won they got about a 25 to 30% raise and now you know everybody's convinced that Tesla is next Tesla employees will now be paid more because of what happened with UAW and the big three only thing is that's not necessarily the case for a lot of reasons the main reason is look Tesla has currently the lowest spend per employee in the industry lower than stantis lower the for lower than GM now the quality of employees that Tesla has is by far better than all the big three apologies for you guys but you know we know that HR quality in Tesla is superior so the expectation is that if everybody else has got a 30% raise a 30% bump the Tesla employees will unionize and they will ask to UAW to come in through the front door and get the same deal in Tesla but that's not necessarily what's going to happen you see the UAW tried to unionize Tesla employees before and failed multiple times and the reason is because Tesla employees number one have a different DNA they're kind of the people who are in the trenches together trying to get the company to succeed they're not there to do you know punch the clock come in at 9 live at five don't care they're all invested in company mentally physically emotionally and also financially because a lot of them most of them have stock based compensation that is completely correlated with the success of the company now that stock based compensation is where I think the big difference is not to mention that the conditions the working conditions the the whole experience of being A tes employee is 100x better than any of the big three but they're actually invested in the company and because Tesla doesn't give out dividends or does any serious BuyBacks the share price appreciates every year and because that their stock Bas competition is actually goes up every year so a lot of these employees are not looking for a meily 25% raise when they're actually becoming millionaires through stock based compensation which I think Tesla has made more employees millionaires than any other company in the history so happy employees well compensated and with equity in the company are not going to give a chunk of the salary to the UAW to try to get 25% more so that the company can underperform and they're going to lose that back on the Stock B compensation so again I don't think it's happening now there's a lot of talk about bad macro sure bad macro is definitely an option but you have to understand that for a industry leader like Tesla bad macro means that all the people who are barely holding on are going to drown and they're going to be the last on standing so bad times benefit industry leaders you have model y currently the bestselling vehicle model in the world they already are leading in cost they're leading in battery software energy we're talking about infrastructure we're talking about FSD God cyber TR is actually coming out at the end of this year and that's going to open up the floodgates that's the best category in the US to be in for vehicles and there's no demand problem there massive massive pre-orders for that and and that's going to sell even in bad times pickup trucks sell in the US always we're talking about the Highland coming out soon on a massive release at the end of the year again more margins because this vehicle even though it's more expensive it's actually cheaper for Tesla to make so margins expansions and potentially flexibility with price drops to deal with bad macro and of course I I also think macro severity is overplayed by El for 2024 I think is kind of taking a precautionary M measure here Tesla still has a mountain of cash it's still you know the best in the industry with cogs cost of goods and salaries look in my opinion it's the best time to get in and Tesla 200 why and again just my opinion not Financial advice doing research decide for itself but in my opinion which might be wrong might be the REM of a Madman in my opinion this 200 is exactly what we had in January in January 2023 Tesla stock was $120 everybody was saying rest in peace Tesla we'll see you at 70 we'll see you at 60 stock jump to 280 all these same clowns that said oh no I'm not going to buy this at 120 bought it at 280 now it's dropping against back to 200 same debate starts people who have macademia nuts that are shaking they're not doing the right thing they're basically saying well tessla is going to drop more I'm going to wait for 15 I'm going to wait 120 look it's not going to happen deal with it this is going to be very successful over the course of the next 10 years if you got the patience and you have the long-term investing mentality you're going to be just fine I'll see you next

Tom Nash,CmmJhG8xgfQ,2023-10-28T04:43:44Z,Why is the US economy so resilient?,United States,let's talk about why the US economy is so resilient we just got the core PC numbers 3% this month in line with expectations slightly cooler and the next FMC meetings in in 5 days it seems you know if you look at fed watch 97% of no rate hikes in November 80% of no rate hikes in December so it means that pretty much for the year of 2023 no more rate hikes cool at the same time three days ago or few days ago I may be losing count the GDP the gross domestic product came out at 4.9% annualized as of Q3 which is the best we've seen in three years so the US is doing better better than ever maybe better than three years ago at the same time the inflation numbers are not that bad 3.7% CPI for the month of September not ideal but definitely manageable so two years of the highest pay case of rate increases that we've seen in the last 40 years and $100 billion spent on the war in Ukraine and coid and lockdowns and 9% inflation just in June 2022 and somehow we end up with 5% GDP and 3.7% inflation how in the world does that happen how is the US so strong economically now one thing is clear that all the know doom and gloomer predicting the end of the United States the end of the dollar the de dollarization and the the rise of China and they're writing books and they're making podcasts they're making great money off of these clicks but now we know they don't know what the hell they're talking about it's a very humbling experience for them to see these numbers of course they're not ever going to admit it but still is China is on the brink of collapse we have a crazy demographic crisis a crazy real estate crisis they're really struggling to keep the lights on and feed their people while the US is doing fine how about that now look any other country when you have 11 times in a row where the Central Bank raises interest rates you would have seen the economy the toilet not the US turkey needs the US to bail them out out of this predicament they need the US and they're doing all this showboating much like the Saudis to get a better deal from the United States this isn't the video about turkey this is a video about the United States so why is the economy so strong so number one the first reason is obviously consumption right it's a cultural thing the consum the consumer spending in the US is insane and we may criticize it but it's good for the economy you have Christmas which is literally a a boost that doubles the revenue of businesses over the entire year with have a culture of not being jealous of people who buy new stuff basically the only thing you do is buy that new stuff for yourself as well unlike the East European culture where I came from and we have crazy things like the 1031 like kind exchange where in the 1031 like kind you literally get a tax exemption if you buy more expensive houses or real estate um and also you know the consumer spending over the past year and a half in the US even though we had the rate hikes the the wars the co it just shows a lot of confidence of the US consumer in the economy um you see the earnings of the companies are fine the jobs are fine there's no unemployment right housing prices are fine stock prices are fine um it's a cycle when the US consumer is confident they spend more money they spend more money there's more Revenue there's more Revenue they hire more employees the employees have more money they spend more money ET ETA ETA that confidence in the US economy by the consumers is kind of a self- fulfilling prophecy and sure some of it is still you know due to the excess coid money that was giving out and it will eventually burn through that that's why the United States has to take care of its CPI the inflation they have to bring it down to 2% they have to make things cheaper in the US before this confidence is lost so you know by the time people eat through their savings this thing has to be solved but they do have time but the bigger reason why the United States is in this position where the economy can take all of this punishment and still be absolutely insanely strong is the ability to print endless money you see there's two types of economies in the world the economies that consume money and the economies that print money and there's only one economy that prints money and that's whoever is the reserve currency of the world and currently this is the United States now the reason it's still has the status is because of what is called the Petro dollar because the only way to buy oil right now still in 2023 is is really through dollars and if you need dollars to buy oil and everybody needs oil there's high demand for the dollars then you can print more of it and you know etc etc etc the reason is because the Saudi Arabians literally hold OPEC by the balls and the Saudi Arabians promised to Richard Nixon in the 70s that they will make a law law that you can only buy oil in dollars now initially this was a political agreement but now there's a lot of talk about how the Saudis are stepping away from this etc etc etc well a few facts here number one 90% of the global oil trade is still done in US dollars India is way way closer right now to the US than it's been so India is really is starting to drift away from the breaks towards the US they need the US to provide security for them they have the US equipment the US military is literally the subcontractor of Saudi security and they have the whole transition of the next 20 years from oil into a service base based economy which the US is actually facilitating with the US technology and the US gear etc etc not to mention the entire Saudi oil industry is based on us technology us gear and US Personnel so the Saudis are playing hard to get right now and they're trying to get better conditions from the US but they're not actually going to leave the Petro dollar is not going away the world Reserve currency of the US dollar isn't going away because simply there's no substitution tol the US dollar you need a currency that's going to be massive in quantity supported by the best banking system the biggest military a due process a legal system that actually is fair everything that China and Russia isn't people run towards the dollar so the dollar is a stable currency there's not anywhere close to a candidate to replace the US dollar maybe it happens someday maybe India does that but not in a lifetime,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,p8T5x0avuRE,2023-10-19T17:38:37Z,Tesla's DISASTER Earnings Reveal a Serious Problem,Tesla,"I'm going to put it as a strange day for Tesla shareholders and I'll explain so Tesla missed on everything EPs and revenues every single metric and the share price dve off a cliff as we saw and in this video I'm going to explain what was good about the call what was bad about the call and the numbers what's the meaning for Tesla going forward and what my thesis is as far as an investor am I buying am I selling am I holding what this whole thing means and we're going to do it objectively without you know oh my God the sky is falling or on the other hand okay this is the best thing that could have happened and spin this into really really great earnings because I don't want to play that game and I don't want to play that game I want to give you the objective numbers I think this is why you come to my channel so let's start with the first thing I think the main thing that I was looking forward in this call is FSD full set driving update I wanted to see a clear schedule when is the finish line of this thing we didn't get it so this was number one the second thing that I think freaked out some of investors was that the margin compression was worse than what we anticipated in my video yesterday I said this is the second thing I'm going looking at is the margin compression and this was worse worse than all of us thought and again that was the second white investors freaked out and the other thing is beyond the margins and you know no FSD we did get Cyber TR schedule which was great November that's perfect and but El also mentioned the fact that the macroeconomic outlook for the auto market isn't great and with higher interest the price of an automobile or at least the lease of an automobile becomes so expensive that demand is going to be you know a little bit Troublesome so with macro outlooks and high interest not being the greatest you're looking at more price pressure for Tesla and that's important to note because from what I understand from the call this isn't going to get resolved anytime soon at least not for a few quarters so in the short term this is what we expect from Tesla and I got to be real with you here number one further margin erosion for sure that's going to continue the second thing is further growth slowdown that's also going to continue if going to Less sell cars for less price per vehicle you're going to suffer on growth and margins so for the short term we're going to see a slow down of growth to 20 to 30% that's just natural now ultimately I think what drove the share price to a knee-jerk over reaction was that was absolutely self-sabotaging the call I don't know why he was such in a shitty mood but he really didn't come in um with a great mood for this call and I think everybody just Dove off a cliff because of Elon having a bad day it is what it is look I'm not going to buy or sell stock because Elan sabotaged his on call this isn't the first time he did something like that he's not the most um rational guy when it comes to these things you know you have to take the good with the bad when you deal with Elon Musk now let's talk about the meaning of this uh number one it means means that from this point on for the next 12 to 18 months Tesla has to be way more strategic and surgical with its price cutting in the manufacturing it has to because the margins will depend on it number two the Cyber truck cramp is now more important than ever because that's the next kind of S curve they have because that demand isn't slowing down anytime soon lots of pre-orders lots of demand lots of excitement this is the biggest category in the North America auto auto market right the subit truck is in the pickup trucks that's the best category to sell in they're going to sell a lot of cyber truck so the ramp up there is going to be very very critical number three you have to focus on FSD we're talking about 80% gross margin licensing lots of time lots of money lots of margin is hidden in FSD so to close that is going to be very very critical for Tesla and now on the financial side look Tesla is sitting on $26 billion of cash which is the mountain of cash with very little debt and they really don't have any interest exposure like other companies do Ford and GM have lots of Interest exposure which is good the cash flow is great they're going to invest a lot of money in R&D to make the cars better to cut the cost with the manufacturing process which is always good and in bad times you're going to see slowdown in the industry but ask yourself this question right how will it impact four and GM and all of the others I think Tesla out of them all will do the better but it's still going to be a very um iffy kind of 12 months if you know what I mean so the next 6 to 18 months are going to be very very bumpy probably closer to a year now then has actually lowered his price target for Tesla to $310 which is still significantly higher than what we are right now 220 as of the making of this video I don't think that you know the sky are falling and everybody just needs to chill this wasn't the best earnings we've seen and it definitely had a lot of issues but the sky are not falling and you know Tesla is still a great investment in my opinion now one of the things that impressed me the most and got really not a lot of coverage is the fact that the cost of goods per vehicle cogs per vehicle went down quite significantly over the past few quarters and you've seen that they went from $40,000 per vehicle just in Q4 2022 to 37,000 A5 right now in this quarter so they're cutting costs and they already have the best margins in the industry and that's actually very encouraging sign so the fact of the matter is that Tesla is actually delivering on the promise of getting into the cost cutting of the manufacturing process way way faster than the other guys I just want to remind you all the other guys they can't make electric vehicle that actually is profitable all of them are losing money on every single EV they're selling except Tesla and they're cutting cost so in this whole I guess meat grinder that will be the next year and a half of bad macro and high interest Tesla is probably one of the only ones who will come out of this sparkly clean again not as good as everybody anticipated three or four years ago but definitely better than the rest now look I think El is overplaying the macro a little bit that's I think I got him figured out he wants to over deliver and under promise or rather under promise and overd deliver so I think if gas prices remain high which it seems like they will with everything is going on with OPEC right now and the global geopolitical nonsense and all this Insanity so if gas prices remain high I mean Tesla is going to sell more cars than you know internal combustion Vehicles they already have a leading position and EVS nobody comes close to them they have the leading position FSD they will be the first one to come out with an actual full step driving the charging stations is a huge huge Monopoly which they kind of conquered now look just go back in history in 2015 just8 years ago this company was making $940 million $940 million per quarter right now we're talking about 23.3 billion so we're talking about a 23x 23x that's absolutely insane So within 8 years they 23x the revenues we're still having a debate if this is a good investment or not look at the end of the day EVS are going to sell a lot who comes in second I don't know in this market there isn't a single Tesla killer in the Horizon not on the as far as the specific model that is a Tesla killer not a specific company that is a Tesla killer and don't give me all this byd nonsense so looking in the Horizon I'm looking at the best company in the best industry which is going to go through some hard macro environments but they'll come out on top I think so at 220 plenty of cash a mountain of cash in a PO position I'm buying my to sense about it obviously this is not Financial advice you have to do in research you have to decide for yourself based on your parameters and your strategic decisions",1.0,0.3

Tom Nash,OIHC-stV_rk,2023-10-08T10:53:51Z,The War in Israel (What's REALLY Happening),Hamas,"so at 6:30 a.m. local Israeli time the Hamas launched attacks on a number of cities Villages and Military outposts by the Israeli Defense Forces killing civilians women children men taking hostages killing soldiers taking over whole bases around the border with Gaza at the same time Hamas fired 2,000 Rockets within the span of 24 hours into Israeli city centers including T Aviv killing civilians damaging buildings and to this point 24 hours later this is still a developing story we have about 300 dead confirmed on the Israeli side about 2,000 injured and 100 kidnapped civilians and soldiers into the Palestinian side of Gaza and at this point it's unknown where they are but theories are saying that they're within the tunnel system of Gaza which would make any ground operations by Israel in Gaza very very complex more about that in the second now the Israel response at this point has been very very slow and that's the weird part about it starting from the point of entry that was absolutely overran all the way to about four or five hours from the initial response to this whole event we had people basically running around and running over cities and bases and there was no military response for four to five hours absolute death no response everything was paralyzed why I don't know now to this point is response about 24 hours into it is still based on the previous cycles of violence which is basically bombing empty buildings and not doing a lot all strictly from the air no ground forces on the ground yet just aerial strikes into empty buildings now of course there's 250 dead on the Palestinian side but that's one of the world's most dense populated areas we're never going to be bombarding even empty buildings people are going to get hurt we have 250 dead 1,800 injured according to Palestinian sources The credibility of which is for you to decide now so what happened here really beyond the mainstream media and Bs that you hear on CNN and fxks and all the rest of them well the story here is much more complex than the age-old Israel versus the Palestinian conflict which I'm not going to get into in this video because this is going to be a Battleground for people to beef over history that's not a point in this video I want to talk about facts and what's happening right now on the ground now like what it seems like on mainstream media the Palestinians don't live in one single entity in fact there's two two separate Palestinians one is controlled by the Hamas which is Gaza the other one is controlled by the Palestinian Authority which is basically a descendant of the PLO and that controls the West Bank now both of them chose completely different approaches to this whole conflict on the one hand the Palestinian Authority is trying to shame Israel in diplomatic Avenues basically going to the UN and going to all these Avenues to get Israel to pack down and work through a diplomatic solution to allow them to have better borders on the other hand Hamas is going on all out War trying to destroy Israel not forsaking the way of violence now these two approaches birth absolutely different situations on the one hand the West Bank is prosperous they have a stock exchange they have nightclubs restaurant life in the West Bank is quasi normal at least for the most part and definitely way better than what's going on in Gaza Gaza is basically a refugee camp that's out of control people are starving it's dirt poor there's no resources no infrastructure it's absolutely chaotic now I'm not here to play the blame game I'm just giving you the situation on the ground people in the West Bank have a decent life somewhat people in Gaza have a horrible life now while the PLO dropped out of this violence route for the most part Hamas stayed in and about 10 years ago they had a beef with the Iranians but they figured out a way to make friends on the face of it Hamas and the Iranians should never get along you see the Iranians are Shiites and Hamas are sunnis they really hate each other and when they say really I mean really now the crazy part is that as much as they hate each other they both hate Israel more and that's why about 10 years ago they'd made a pack to work together to destroy Israel now effectively what happened is that Hamas became a proxy for the Iranians much like the hisbah up in the North of Israel and Lebanon and much like the hoodi rebels in Yemen Iranians love to operate why these proxies and Hamas basically taking the money of Iran became such proxy but the real question here is why now if Iran was running Hamas for over a decade why launch this offensive now what triggered this now on the face of it and what you see in mainstream media is that this was the 50th anniversary of the 1973 October War as it's called on the Arab side and the Yumi War as it's called on the Israeli side a war in which Israel was attacked by multiple front and still beat the living crap out of these countries which is a huge embarrassment and them basically doing it on the 50th Anniversary was some sort of an amends you know to fix the shame of the 1973 defeat the other reasons that were given is encroachments by the Israeli side on the alaa mosque which number one is not a new thing it keeps happening all the time you have militants basically throwing rocks and shooting at Israeli soldiers they chase them they walk into the alaxa mosque the Israeli police chases them into alaa mosque and then you know the whole festival starts about how Israel is encroaching on alaa mosque I'm not here to take sides I'm just describing why this isn't news this been happening for a while and Israel has no plans to demolish the alaka mamos nor to rebuild their own temple on that mountain which is a whole different story that the Palestinians are selling that narrative absolute nonsense they're also talking about you know their own agenda and how they've been imprisoned for so long and they they actually have you know finally blew up all this may be true they might actually got to a boiling point because of their relationship with Israel they might be annoyed more now by the Alamos encroachments they might be more mad right now because of the 50th anniversary of the 1973 yum kipur October War all this may be true but those are not the predominant reasons why now the reason why now actually has to do with a country far far away and it's not the United States it is the Saudi Arabians why Saudi Arabia well you see the Saudis are the most important important Arab nation in the world sorry all Arab Nations they are they have the most amount of influence money oil policymaking whatever the Saudi says goes they control OPC they control the Arabic narrative and the one enemy that they have in the world is actually Iran Iranians hate the Saudis and they've been very active at trying to hurt Saudi Arabia as much as they can including a drone strike on a ranco which is the Saudi company by the hoodi rebels which is a proxy of Iran just a little while ago so the Iranians they hate the Saudis the Saudis they hate the Iranians there's tensions there there's a lot of distrust there's a lot of fear and the Saudis are now looking at Iran racing towards a nuclear bomb by the way shout out to this Administration for allowing this to happen which is an absolute insanity but nevertheless this is the reality you can't sugar quote it so while the Iranians are basically racing to a nuclear bomb on behalf of the guidance of the US government thank you President Biden for that the Saudis are like oh my God we have to have a nuke of our own this can't happen and basically they went to the United States and said well look guys we need a nuke of our own if you're giving it to the Iranians give us our blessing as well we want a nuke just so we can counter these guys they want to kill us and the United States basically said you know what cool but here are the conditions for us to do this number one stop the shenanigans with OPEC give us cheap oil number two we can't give you nuke until you guys agree not to bomb the freaking state of Israel with that nuke we're going to give you so that means you have to make peace with Israel and normaliz relationship and that means that if you do it the rest of the Arab world with the exception of Iran and the Palestinians will follow your lead because you're the most important Saudi it is what it is now the Saudis don't really have any beef with Israel and they have no issues with controlling OPC so they basically said bet let's do it now the first thing that happened to lead into this is the Saudis never wanted to be first so they let the United Arab Emirates sign the Peace Accords the normalization Accords first so once the UAE signed this deal once the other Arab Nations signed this deal Saudi was next and you have to think about it like a three-way NBA trade every single team gets something it wants the United States gets cheap oil for Life Israel gets normalization with the Arab world massive Saudis get a nuke to counter Iran everybody wins in this trade everyone except Iran and the Palestinians you see for the Palestinians and the Iranians this cannot happen and mainly the Iranians because the Iranians are pushing their own little triangle they're trying to broker a triangle with China Iran and Saudi to counter the US proposal of us Israel and Saudi and they're offered a lot of car to Saudis to go that route but if the Saudis will buy that deal with the United States of Israel the Chinese Iranian Saudi triangle is rest and peace it's dead they can't have it it's a zero some game somebody wins somebody loses and the losers in this agreement would be the Iranians so right when this deal was supposed to be signed on the brink of its signature you have massive rocket attacks Saturday 6:00 in the morning everybody's asleep everybody's home minimal military presence border collapses cities bases overan absolute chaos now there's a lot of questions on the Israeli side how the hell did these people get in how do we have three 400 people just literally cross through the Border like it was nothing Israel invested billions of dollars in this system on the fence to prevent exactly this from happening and it failed so how did it happen did it undergo a huge cyber security attack did it have a drone strike against it basically eliminating the entire border was it a huge colossal failure and negligence whatever the case may be I don't know but there's one thing I can tell you the offensive was extremely coordinated well planned well funded well executed and absolutely grin lit by Iran against Israel via the proxy of Hamas there's no doubt about it but you see the thing is that once these horrific images which I mentioned in the beginning of the video Hit Israeli media the Israeli public is going to ask for a massive response there's not to waste about it this was a colossal failure for the Israel intelligence for the Israeli military and the failure of epic proportions that was almost as bad or maybe even worse than the 1973 yum kipur intelligence failure and yes even though Israel did win that war that was another massive intelligence failure this probably was even bigger or at least as big so Israel is currently in a catch 22 of swords on the one hand if they go out and they demolish Gaza they're basically jeopardizing the agreement with the Saudis which is historically important for the United States and Israel plus you have 100 hostages on the ground in Gaza plus the insanee complexity of fighting in a highly dense residential area massive casualties for the Israeli military the hostages will be dead the Saudi deal will be dead absolute Chaos on the flip side if you don't go to war for this and just bombarded from the air for a couple of days and let it go you basically lose this war but you get to keep the Saudi deal but here's the crazy part once you get shamed like this not sure that the Saudis even want to sign this deal with a wick Israel plus you got to be inviting as Israel many many future attacks on you if you are perceived to be weak you see Israel is living in a prison mentality they're surrounded by people that want to kill it much like in the prison violence right if they show weakness in that neighborhood that they live in they're going to get overrun by much much worse than what we've seen in the past two days so whatever the choice they make it's an impossible choice there's no good choices here and by the way the United States with the Biden's Mission will be pushing towards option number two which is save the Saudi agreement the Israel public is going to push to option number one one shortterm BB Netanyahu this prime minister of Israel that everybody keeps talking about he has a huge win on his hands because right now the whole colossal cluster [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that happened in Israel all these protests the legal reforms all this opposition his unpopularity that's all gone everybody's now United behind them to go to war but once the dust settles and there will be investigations and it will be actually looked at who was at fault here he's going to have a major disgrace on his hands and he will be out so long-term huge loss for BBY shortterm it's a win he gets to survive but I'm not looking out for BBY in a couple of years he's going to be out of the job the problem is that Israel has another dilemma which is the absolute Northern front of Israel right now what we're looking at is the southern front on the northern part of Israel you got hisbah which is the Lebanese organization completely funded and operated by the Iranians and the Hezbollah are sitting on an arsenal of 130,000 Precision rockets that can hit every point in Israel for days and days and weeks and weeks and there's no Iron Dome can stop 130,000 Rockets I mean 100% it's going to cause massive effect massive damage now why is the Israeli response being so slow at this point well some of it has to do with the fact that the fighting is still going on inside Israel until the Israeli Army clears out the last of these Hamas terrorists from its grounds it's not going to commence any operations in Gaza number two you have the hostages on the ground about 100 people you have to evaluate what you want to do with these guys guys number three the ground offensive requires a prep about 48 to 72 hours you have to call out reserves you have to work out a plan that has to take time plus you have hisbah dilemma right if you launch a ground offensive in Gaza what happens if hisbah joins the fight right they got a massive Arsenal but they depend on the Iranian trigger and here's the crazy part while Hamas shot a few mortars you know the past few hours if hisbah joins the fight you're going to know about it it's not going to be just a couple of mortars but here's the thing hisbah will not join this fight without the pre-approval and the guidance of Iran it's not going to happen and the Iranians will have to make a decision here if they pull the trigger on hisbah they lose leverage and I'll explain hisbah was armed to the thief by Iran as a quasi balance of Terror against Israel should Israel preemptively attack Iran and try to prevent it from getting to a nuclear weaponry then hisbah will act and basically deploys 130,000 missiles towards the entirety of Israel that's a balance of Terror right if you pull the trigger at now and you activate hisbah to help Hamas you lose that leverage because once hisbah pulls and Blows Its load Iran does not have that leverage anymore so they have to make a decision whether they want to keep hisbah basically on point still ready if Israel actually acts upon their threats against Iran or they want to launch them right now but it's a one shot once you launch them Isel is going to react in such a way that Hezbollah will not be recognizable yes Israel will have massive casualties but it's not going to leave Hezbollah and its current configuration

Tom Nash,cZWQlziBsgM,2023-10-05T15:54:53Z,If you are a Tesla shareholder….GET READY,Tesla,so in this video we're going to watch then Ives completely dismantle all the bear case arguments against Tesla and then at the end of the video I'm gonna give my personal comments as well as showing you why 270 dollars per share is the bottom for Tesla in my personal opinion let's watch the clip first and then let's go through it afterwards this is with us managing director S I mean we got these delivery numbers from Tesla and when you look at them sequentially a little disappointing but still year over year you're seeing the growth what did you make of it yeah I mean Nicole I just view it year over year it was strong especially relative to this environment the price culture work things specifically in China and if you look at the factory down times this sets up what I believe is going to be a very strong key before and I know that's why the street Shrugged off these numbers which clearly were disappointing you know when we talk about people start comparing other makers like rivian for example to Tesla because they get excited and they're seeing we're being on the road now but um you know rivian delivery 15 000 plus two Tesla's 435 000 plus um rivian's probably going to come out with 52 000 Vehicles this year versus 1.8 million for Tesla I mean is Tesla still I mean I know byd is on its heels too where does Tesla stand I mean to to the people who are the naysayers for Tesla what do you tell them I mean the scale and the scope is unmatched School Board I think when you look where Tesla is but I think look one of the biggest risks if you look at the thesis was GM Ford Detroit that was going to be competition in the US but now this UAW debacle that's actually been a win Professor I think when you look in China rights cuts that price wars happened by being Neo and others but Tessa's actually gained the share and I continue to go in 2024 they're in a massive position of strength despite the shaky Macker and when people say that Tesla trades more like a tech company versus an auto company to try and justify the valuation I mean you have a 350 Target it's a 247 today tell me why the valuation is Justified well I mean they're called miniature talk about this so I mean we disruptive technology player nine Auto Company I think if you look even at the sum of the parts that's now starting to play out supercharger battery ultimately fsbai which separates Tesla from others it's really the software and when I've used the secret sauce which is non-hardware and that's why more and more I think investors are starting to understand that this is not an auto companies this relative I believe it deserves that multiple that that I think it continues to attain go in 2024. right right I mean that's the whole point and that's why you know I ask you these questions because I get bombarded sometimes like oh full self-driving is so far away batteries they don't really make batteries they they do it in collaboration with other companies they're not really a battery company they're not an AI company it's just an auto company and it's not worth the current price um you know do we have actual statistics of any sort of how many batteries are made that they really are growing in AI that there really is potential I feel like I've spent a lot of time at Tesla factories around the world as well as other factories and that's why I think it's very easy to be bearish on Tesla sitting there in your spreadsheet in New York theater I think when you see what they're actually doing that's what's separate them and I think again again that's been going to give me a different feeling yeah yeah I mean the Cyber truck is coming that should be an exciting addition too right talk about the orders that line up for that right yeah look Weebly production begins later this year deliveries into next year and that's just going to be another I think when you look at their product portfolio that's just going to add to the growth it's going to add to the mood that I think continues to play out over the coming years look obviously we're going through a White Knuckle period in terms of multiples in terms of disruptive Tech I think we go into next year I view it that this is kind of the next phase of the testing drugstore yeah and I know you know Tesla's not unionized like foreign GM um so I'm just they get basically shares and such right I mean they get shares of the company and that's sort of the carrot that Elon Musk puts out there to make sure that they don't unionize what do you think of that I mean once the debacle that's happening the truth which is UAW that's really been a trip to you know for the Detroit big brick in terms of what you know a year in terms of 2024. Tesla's never going to have Union and I think that continues to really be one of their strengths in terms of how they built it how rivian's built it and I think the sad thing right now is that the winners in terms of what's happened is UAW age match at the Detroit big gray it's Tesla and it's the foreign automakers that are going to bench them a few things here worth mentioning first of all let's cover about the you know the main topics that Dan brought up and then I'll show you what I think is the bottom for the stock and what is the top assuming some very either bearish or conservative assumptions and it's going to blow a lot of haters mind so first of all I have to be honest this was probably one of the least anti-tesla biased interviews I've seen in a long long time so kudos to the interviewer not bad not bad obviously she had a few mishaps but overall she was kind of balanced and I got a good credit for that I mean that doesn't happen every day with Tesla media now obviously then again educates everybody on the fact that there's shutdowns planned shutdowns because of the phase out of the current well three and the move to the Highland which are exactly uh what Tesla communicate is going to happen and yet some investors and Traders misunderstood that and he is talking about a setup for a massive Q4 which if Tesla is going to hit 1.8 million Vehicles as they say they will they're gonna have to have a great Q4 which is just you know Logic on Dance behave I absolutely agree and the interviewer did mention that if you compare Tesla to Rivier and you see the huge differences in the life cycle right reviewing is at the beginning stage with 50 000 vehicles per year test has already almost 1.8 million vehicles per year so the difference is massive and I don't think it's even the biggest difference between reviewing the Tesla the fact of the matter is that Tesla is a much bigger potential company as far as AI as far as robotics as far as energetic um and Riven is a great car company in the making so you know he did mention that Ford and GM thesis is being viable competition for Tesla is now officially dead I think it's been dead for a long time but he's saying look the UAW strike has put the final nail in the coffin of that argument that Ford GM will compete with Tesla they're going to fight for scraps and byd is nice but Tesla is still winning despite not even competing with byd on their favorite Market segment which is the 25 000 car 100 I agree with him and he says the Tesla is a disruptive tech company and should be valued as such couldn't agree more unlike rivian that should be priced like a great car company in the making but they don't have the upside the level of ceiling that Tesla has is way higher than rivian so there's not a lot of companies that justify evaluation like Tesla because of all the potential s-curves this still haven't even hit it at all and he talks about his price Target being 350 and currently the stock is at 250 I'm going to show you why 270 is the bottom for the stock long term it might drop a little bit here and there but sustainably it's not going to go below to 70 for for a long long time and stay there I mean it might hit it I'm not saying it's never going to happen but as a long-term analysis we're currently at the bottom of Tesla before the new cycle starts and she did mention the fact that she's unsure of Tesla being an AI company I mean lady have you seen FSD or the Tesla bot I mean that's an AI company um it then said a beautiful sentence which I might put on a t-shirt is the fact that it's easy to be bearish on Tesla on your Excel spreadsheet in your air conditioned office and I couldn't agree more people who have no idea about you know what Tesla is doing are running Excel spreadsheets and now becoming buyers without understanding the massive potential of this company and they both they both actually mentioned the Cyber track as being a massive Catalyst for Tesla couldn't agree more and I think one of the more important overlooked aspects of Tesla is like why Tesla isn't unionized why the employees are getting paid less salaries right and work harder and make better products and not don't unionize this because Tesla has made a lot of people millionaires there isn't a single company in the world that made more employees millionaires than Tesla Tesla have made simple everyday workers millionaires by giving them stock based compensation options and the piece of the pie no other other company has done this and this is why number one people give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about their work the quality of what they do and also why Tesla will never face a union UAW problem like Ford GM because their employees are Partners in their journey and that's absolutely 100 on point now I do want to share with you my own kind of example of why 270 is the bottom on the screen right now what you're seeing is stock MVP which is a platform that I've created along with my partner Pete stock Dash mvp.com This is a all-around analysis tool that looks at companies from every possible angle as far as The Insider selling institutional buying and selling you can run a whole DCF on this you can look at the reportings at the financials we have this thing called MVP cards in which you can have a snapshot of how the company is doing now the reason I'm showing you this thing Beyond obviously I want to promote it of course I want people to use this I've built this but the reason I'm showing you this and I'm going to make a little bit bigger here because I want you to see the assumptions I've used to show you that 270 is the bottom for the stock and 1400 is the more optimistic version using some very conservative assumptions this isn't like even Tesla going crazy story this is a test of being normal and Tesla screwing things up so if Tesla screws up completely there are 270 stock in five years so that's the worst possible case if Tesla keeps you know growth at only 25 percent which is half of what's currently it's growing right if the net income margin drops from 12 to 8 percent if the free cash flow margin drops to six percent the PE drops to 50. the discount rate is 12 which means very high interest rates in the market for the next five years then Tesla is a 270 stock in five years so if the World falls apart pretty much and Tesla screws every single thing up they're at 270 dollars that's the bottom right but if you use just normal assumptions on the conservative side which is only 50 growth which is what they have right now a 12 net income margin which is what they have right now and eight percent free cash flow margin and adpe which is what they have right now and a discount rate of 10 assuming interest rates will go down a little bit over the next five years then all of a sudden that's a fourteen hundred dollar stock which is an upside of 434 percent so at the end of this analysis what seems to me to be the case beyond what Dan said which is on point is that people who buy Tesla right now in my opinion and this is not Financial advice in my own personal opinion they're getting tested at the very bottom in which you can own this stock and the upside is so lucrative it's almost like a no-brainer for me that's why I have a lot of my position in the stock.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,b2176IiGRNU,2023-10-01T14:42:30Z,Billionaire Steve Westly Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Tesla,"so Steve Wesley a guy who manages about a billion dollars and a former board member for Tesla just dropped a few massive Bombshells about Tesla's Future. first Ford and GM are both struggling to sell uh just 100,000 units in 2023 here and that's compared to 2 million units for Tesla. second Tesla's triggering a global price war and I I think we've seen it Tesla's had six cost reductions this year alone. not only is Tesla selling a lot more electric vehicles but their net margins are 12.9%. Tesla sees an advantage they're seizing it. Tesla's done that a little better than any uh one here to four. when Tesla is at 12.9% in Gross margins GM Ford lagging quite a bit. does Tesla make batteries yes or no have they made a battery what they do is they partner with the cats the Panasonics uh and the LG chem of the world but in increasingly they've taken battery production inhouse they have a cost advantage over virtually everybody else except for the Chinese and that is part of the reason they have such high uh gross margins which is great news. second they're the Masters it's selling OTA or over the year software Services that's great and third they lead the world in robotization so that's what's giving them the price Edge. right now here are the numbers Tesla has 21.7% of global EV market share. so the first thing you was talking about is the fact that Tesla is actually out selling Ford and GM as far as Electric vehicle sales about 22x so Ford and GM versus Tesla Tesla is selling 20 times more electric vehicles than both these companies combined so that's number one. number two he actually said something very smart is that the price Wars that Tesla is engaged in right now are only killing four GM and the rest of them VW because look at the end of the day Tesla has significantly higher margin as he pointed out correctly significantly higher margin so when Tesla goes into these price Wars It's essentially the same example of let's say open up a little hot dog stand and then Walmart decides they want to you know take you out of business so they set up a hot dog stand right next to you and they sell soda and a hot dog for like 10 cents a pop just to drive you out of business because they can afford to take a loss on this little stand just to drive you out of business this is essentially what Tesla is doing to the rest of the industry they can afford to take a loss with their margin not a problem at all. he did mention that byd the Chinese company is the real only competitor to Tesla it's not forign GM. byd is probably the closest thing to a Tesla competitor we have in the market right now. When Tesla drops the model 2 whatever it's going to be called the $25,000 car which won't have the same features then we will see the actual competition with byd right now. she said well does Tesla actually make their own batteries and of course we can talk about the 4680 but look at the end of the day um there's a very clear definition of what making your own battery means obviously Tesla makes its own 46 80s the thing is like if I make my own if I design my own if I control my own battery I have my own technology in it but I send it to contract manufacturing at a certain plant that's me manufacturing I don't have to physically build the battery myself if it's my design and I'm just using a contractor to produce the actual Hardware so that's what we're talking about here and probably at the end of the day within a few years Tesla will even do that completely 100% on grounds so yes Tesla makes their own batteries that should not even be a question a very ill-informed question by the host here I'm quite surprised that this even came up. he mentions look Tesla has 20% of the global market byd has 16% and there's there's there's a huge drop off there's nobody there who's going to be number three God knows it's wide open. but here's the thing as I mentioned earlier byd is number two but Tesla isn't competing with BD right now on the low $25,000 segment by isn't really even chasing full step driving at all which which will be the next big kind of esur for the next big auto manufacturer plus as I mentioned China is a train r so a Chinese company God forbid so I'm not really confident on byd for those reasons if byd can beat Tesla when Tesla actually plays in that segment it's going to be very interesting to see I don't think they can. he also talked about the fact that Tesla is currently valued at a reasonable rate because at the end of the day it's a tech company it's a tech company it's an energy company it's growing at a 40% rate and it's very cheap multiples if you consider it not a car company if you look at a car company yes it's expensive but that's again another misunder understanding of you know the the people who work on these talking head shows. so yes he also talked about the fact that Tesla has a huge manufacturing Advantage it takes them onethird of the time what it takes to rest the industry to assemble a car 10 hours versus about 30 hours for the rest of the industry. how can you catch somebody who's better at you at producing cars who's better at you at generating the next big thing which is FSD. Tesla is currently sitting at what almost 200 million miles and accumulating about a million miles a day nobody comes close to that they will solve FSD autonomy driving first before of everybody else. their manufacturing is the best it's getting better at the fastest space among all others. The Battery Technology is the best the 4680 is absolutely insane. their supercharging network is unrivaled. they also have insurance business they they obviously they're developing General AI they're talking about massive Global expansions with more factories underworld and they have Elon Musk the secret weapon which none of the other companies actually have. and look at end of the day who's going to be Tesla I don't I don't know even who's going to be number two so this race is over he's 100% right we're currently at this trying to figure out who's going to be number two and three because the Gap from number one is so massive and some people still refuse to understand that and that's fine.",1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,b2176IiGRNU,2023-10-01T14:42:30Z,Billionaire Steve Westly Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Ford,"first Ford and GM are both struggling to sell uh just 100,000 units in 2023 here and that's compared to 2 million units for Tesla so they're supposed to be catching up here they're at less than 5% so if those numbers drop down that hurts. General Motors Volkswagen Ford they're all trying to keep up. their net margins are 2.4% at for. if you're raising rates or costs at those companies that's coming at just the wrong time. it's going to put the squeeze on automakers with high cost structures so GM and Ford need to be careful. when Tesla is at 12.9% in Gross margins GM Ford lagging quite a bit something's got to give here. I'm hoping that with the new battery production and so on other efficiencies GM and Ford can bring margins up and be competitive but they're going to have to kick into a higher gear sooner rather than later. Tesla is actually out selling Ford and GM as far as Electric vehicle sales about 22x so Ford and GM versus Tesla Tesla is selling 20 times more electric vehicles than both these companies combined. the price Wars that Tesla is engaged in right now are only killing four GM and the rest of them VW. he did mention that byd the Chinese company is the real only competitor to Tesla it's not forign GM. forign GM is a train wack as we seeing right now with the UAW putting the final nail in their coffin. the UAW is killing whatever is left in Ford and GM I wholeheartedly agree here as well obviously forign GM cannot afford any more wage costs they're basically scraping by as it is their cost structure is absolutely abysmal they're literally losing money on every EV they're selling right now. now when your employees are asking to work one day less and get paid 30 40% more I mean there's no way you can do it sustainably obviously the UAW understands these numbers and what they're driving for is a bailout so the UW understands that what they're asking for is not affordable not sustainable but they know at the end of the day because the president and the government they love the UAW so much they're going to bail out forign GM politically and they will get paid on the backs of the American taxpayers. the problem is that this is not sustainable this communist way of thinking is not sustainable because you're essentially what you you're of making forign GM non-competitive on the global stage me there's only so many times you can bail them out. he said that for GM U should bring up margins and he's hoping they can do it how I can't see I mean they can't figure out a way to make EVS at the even at cost at this point how they're going to bring down cost I don't understand especially with what seems to be an imminent raise across the board for wages which is going to be absolutely insane. forign Jam is probably at the bottom of the barrel here unfortunately.",1.0,-0.9
Tom Nash,b2176IiGRNU,2023-10-01T14:42:30Z,Billionaire Steve Westly Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,General Motors,"first Ford and GM are both struggling to sell uh just 100,000 units in 2023 here and that's compared to 2 million units for Tesla so they're supposed to be catching up here they're at less than 5% so if those numbers drop down that hurts. General Motors Volkswagen Ford they're all trying to keep up. their net margins are 6% at GM. if you're raising rates or costs at those companies that's coming at just the wrong time. it's going to put the squeeze on automakers with high cost structures so GM and Ford need to be careful. when Tesla is at 12.9% in Gross margins GM Ford lagging quite a bit something's got to give here. I'm hoping that with the new battery production and so on other efficiencies GM and Ford can bring margins up and be competitive but they're going to have to kick into a higher gear sooner rather than later.

Tom Nash,RIdTS19RG6s,2023-09-27T12:57:47Z,Palantir Wins New $250 Million Contract!,Palantir,250 million dollars sold to the Einstein looking dude in the back from Colorado with one hell of a company called palantir now palantir just got awarded a 250 million contract from the US Army to research artificial intelligence and for those of you who may Wonder because you heard for the past few weeks from certain experts that palantir is not a real AI company yes they did just got paid a quarter of a billion dollars of the next three years to research AI so I guess yes volunteer is a real AI boy I think what's more important here number one it proves to a lot of people that the government business is still alive and kicking we heard some claims that the government business is slowing down no it's not it's always going to be there for volunteer like a warm blanking on a cold night to cover yourself when things get bad in a bad economy you best believe palantir will rely on the government business and when things get bad you always have this great money coming in from the government regardless of how bad the economy is now of course I believe that the upside of volunteer is in the commercial sector but this this is a huge proof of concept for those who doubted the AI capabilities of palantir now here's the thing of course palantir does not generate AI content they will not help you write articles like chat GPT that's not what they do a lot of these systems are great at generating data at generating content but they're absolutely horseshit in organizing that and making sense of it this is where patent Theory comes in this is where palantir always came in this world Foundry was always about and they've made billions doing that and once again they're going to coordinate this market and they're going to own it and some people are going to be sitting on the sidelines being all cynical talking about how they not chat GPT smirking and missing out on the opportunity they build the ecosystem the operating system the entire system in which AI works so if you're a company if you're a business if you're a government agency and you want to utilize AI in your operations you need something to make sense of it you need something to actually utilize this AI in the best way possible and in this aspect paladir is currently number one nobody comes close just like Foundry being number one in business intelligence this thing has no Rivals no AI system in the world right now has these features and it's not that easy to develop them contrary to some idiots telling you that on social media now the crazy part about this whole thing is that this is the shovel makers you remember a few weeks ago I explained to you that in the Gold Rush days much like we are right now the AI gold rush in the Gold Rush days the biggest money makers were not people who were digging gold on their knees were the people who's selling shovels palantiers selling you the shovels to this AI Gold Rush and for that reason they're gonna do just fine in fact here's the crazy part there was never a better time to own palantir yesterday was the best time to own palantir today is the best time to own Frontier and tomorrow will probably be the best time to own Talent here I mean you cannot compare the level of opportunity that talented has with any other company in the market now with the exception of perhaps Tesla the problem is that markets will punish those who are impatient and opportunistics and people who play like amateurs in every sport that's true and every business that's true and in the stock market it's 10 times truer now I'm not here to say that party is going to run to 20 today because they got a 250 million dollar deal that's obviously not the case if it happens great but most likely it's not gonna happen more likely that Talent is going to drop to 13 or 12 or 11 it's a very volatile stock it does not behave in a traditional manner it's going to go up and down in a really really mean way I mean if you're impatient if you're an amateur if you don't know what you're doing if you don't have conviction if you don't have confidence this stock is going to destroy you and while it is true that yesterday today and most likely tomorrow will be the best time to own volunteer shares the market is going to punish the impatient and the amateurs for sure a hundred percent now if that's the case and you do want to own palantir how do you overcome that how do you overcome the volatility the insanity of the stock because obviously this is one hell of a crazy stock to own well the only way to do it I'm going to keep it simple is by having a solid system a system that's proven it's objective and it cleans out the emotions because imagine buying palantir today on this beautiful deal and then all of a sudden waking up tomorrow to a 13 stock price you just lost 10 percent overnight what gives what do you do you panic you stressed you can't sleep you can't eat and I totally get it it's absolutely horrible to be in that position but the only way to overcome it is to build a system that cuts out all the emotions all this emotional crap out of your system and be absolutely objective and analytical about it that's the way I do it dollar cost average every single month an exact amount into palantir and this amount for everybody they have their own amount you build your budget your expenses your income and determine how much you want to put into palantir every single month that amount is fixed let's say it's a hundred dollars right and every month you invest 70 into volunteer and thirty dollars goes to the side to accumulate four percent interest why because you keep it to the side for something else here in a second and every month you buy 70 of 100 70 of 100 70 of 100 and you keep that 30 on the sideline the minute the palantir pops you keep just doing the same thing you don't follow in you don't work at your house you stay the course you stay disciplined but if palindeer drops to say 13 or 12 or 11 you don't run for the hills you don't panic you take that 30s you got accumulated on the sideline and now instead of buying seventy dollars every month you're buying a hundred and forty dollars every month and you keep doing that until palantir goes up again now I've talked about it many times we built a certain threshold a point a price point under which we double down and above which we just keep DCA dollar cost average in a normal amount and that way there's no motions there's no decision making it's all automatic like a bot if you do that over time over two three four years you're gonna accumulate a cost basis in volunteer which is going to be very very close to the bottom of the share price not to the top not to the average that's just a simple math and we have members in that group that have started palantir 23 dollars and ended at about 12 because they did that same system and by the way if you haven't yet go watch this video with Alex carp absolutely living the entire CNBC panel speechless breaking down the future of palantir and its AI capabilities I'll see you there in just a second.,1.0,0.9

I mean Tesla makes cars that makes the total perfect sense for fleets because of the cheap maintenance because of the operational efficiency because of the speed because of the technology because of the cameras Etc... not a guy who has 12 of his 150 billion invested in Tesla... helped Ilan steer the ship in the right direction... not only Tesla is currently way way way way ahead of everybody else... byd probably the only candidate to compete with Tesla on scale is basically pulling their hands from this project they're saying we're not chasing autonomous driving at all it's a waste of money not to mention the fact that GM that has the most amount of Miles except Tesla with 34 million miles only has highway miles because they don't do City miles at all... This only second player you can think of in this industry is probably Intel's subsidiary mobile eye that had a beef with Elon back in 2015 where Elon said two things they didn't agree on number one that lidar is absolutely redundant and number two that there will be autonomous fully autonomous level 5 driving these two things were the heart of the disagreement between Elon Musk and mobila in 2015 this is why they broke apart and now in 2023 it's clear that Elon was right... so we're talking about an 80 gross margin business a market that's estimated between 3 and 12 trillion dollars let's pick it in the middle at seven and we have a clear leader which is Tesla by a country mile and Tesla is running 10 times faster than the rest at a million miles per day... one trillion dollars of profit doesn't sound too crazy to me with an 80 gross margin and Total Domination of a six to seven trillion dollar market not saying it's going to happen tomorrow but I am saying that this is not priced in currently to the share price and I'm sure Larry Ellison is all giddy about it say New Zealand the same as myself same as every smart Tesla investor that understands this... now if we thought that police cars are not priced in if we thought that full self-driving autonomy isn't priced in this thing is absolutely not price stand and this thing is actually even bigger than everything Tesla will ever do... we're talking about the fact here that Tesla not only you know is leading the autonomous driving race they're literally leading the AGI race and its implementations with this Tesla bot and nobody's talking about it... if you're buying Tesla right now... there's three guarantees in life death taxes and success of Tesla... if trust is currently being sold at 250 dollars a pop you're literally buying the auto business which already Tesla absolutely annihilated the rest of the competition and now they're getting help from the UAW finishing off whatever left of the big three so Tesla is already the best auto manufacturer in the world best margins best scalability they're ramping up the fastest I said so Tesla's already owned in case you haven't noticed and they will be the biggest baddest auto manufacturer in the world so at 250 you're buying that at 250 you're getting for free Optimus you're getting for free AGI you're getting for free energy you're getting for free autonomous driving if it's coming next year you're getting it for free now with the forward-facing forces of the market,1.0,1.0

Tom Nash,Mn5oG83D1vs,2023-09-22T10:11:20Z,Palantir CEO Alex Karp Leaves CNBC Interviewer SPEECHLESS,Palantir,what is palantir's focus when it comes to its work with the US government well there are two things we're working on one is power chair related but arguably even more importantly um the U.S uh has every major provider of AI which is in every other Industrial Revolution you've had just diversity of countries that have had the talent and the products in this revolution they're really all in America so how do we get the US government to use innovation from providers very few of these providers uh work closely or closely enough with the US government now in part that that's because many of these providers have had a somewhat timid view of helping the US governments the the Silicon Valley motto has been get rich you get nothing and they've obviously often extended that to the US government so my focus and our focus in DC is one uh to basically embarrass other people in AI to work with the US government it's like we're doing very well here you should also get involved uh to talk to legislators to explain to them that uh way too few of our dollars are being spent on AI uh palantir um is one of I think the first company since the 50s that has produced government products that are in high demand commercially so how do we get more companies that have commercially available products meaning products that are proven on in the by in a competitive environment into the US government and how do we share knowledge so that's the part that we're doing here what am I doing in DC what am I doing every day both as an individual and as the co-founder and leader of palantir is pushing America to adopt AI with governance responsibly in the commercial context I'm curious though what it what it's going to mean for your business because there has been a lot of enthusiasm and excitement in the market around palantir as an AI play what does growth look like from governments from commercial from International as as we adopt generative AI um I think for us and for everyone what you're going to see is radical growth in the U.S slower growth in Europe um growth in the U.S because people are going to adopt the best uh most robust most useful Technologies um and very quickly um what you're going to see in the market and then I'll get to us is you're going to see in the market um you've had a massive interest in AI many of these products deliver poetry and will make allow me to do write an essay maybe I know nothing about the products that are going to do well in the sense that people are going to pay for them are going to have output differentials so you're going to change the margins of a business you're going to rebuild a supply chain you're going to move a company from uh individual point-based company to a portfolio way of managing it and and those companies are going to succeed uh in the U.S market um how are we doing it's very early days and that you know you don't want to be out there being too optimistic and we're being very careful to kind of move slower than we could but we de facto cannot keep up with demand for our AIP product we built these precursor technologies that are not understood yet but the clients understand them because they are asking how do I work with a large language model in a safe way a government way where I can make them more precise and change the underlying dynamics of my business within days um and what we've seen is a in the last month of 50 50 increase in people using our AIP product in a month not long ago we had one percent of the U.S hospital care market now we have 16 why do we have what is going on with this radical increase we're making doctors and nurses more effective we're making factory workers more effective by the way one of the most important attributes of AI That's not been discovered yet and will be discovered is you can take manufacturing that maybe has been culturally specific to Japan or Korea and we have one company that is a a Japanese company producing a highly technical product in America just like they produced in Japan with American workers and why can they do that because through enhanced software algorithms and AI we can control the manufacturing environment for Americans as if it was Japan that means American work the fact of the matter is that talentier is the first company in existence that have created high quality high-end government products that have bled on and evolved into very in-demand commercial products usually the commercial World leads the Innovation and then it trickles down into the government applications this was the other way around you know penalty was founded about you know two decades ago by Peter Thiel with the full intent of going commercial at some point but it started off as a government contractor it then expanded into companies like Airbus like quasi governments and now we're talking about commercial application when they brought in Sarah Eisen and she asked him about growth which is the important question about talenty right now because we know they have a lot of new clients but we don't really see their transparency in the translation to new Revenue flows you know the revenue growth is not the same level as the clan growth recently and that's the question she was going for and he gave it a little bit of a different answer now he did say they cannot keep up with demand for AIP and I'll explain for a second what he means now AIP is a shovel what do I mean by a shovel look back in the days of the gold prospectors everybody was trying to prospect for gold that was the big money but what people tend to forget that during the gold rush the biggest millionaires were not created by prospecting gold the biggest millionaires were created by people who sold shovels the shovel sellers for the prospecting made more money than the shovelers and that's true in every single industry so what AIP is AIP is the shovel in the Gold Rush AAP isn't really a generative generative well I said it so weird The Narrative I don't know my Russian comes out it's not really it doesn't really generate AI content right it's not what it does AIP is a tool to be used with whatever large language models of choice your company applies and it uses that llm large language model to basically um deploy a better business intelligence AI driven based AIP is kind of like a tool that people use and companies use to make better sense of their data using their existing AI generational tools we help people utilize their AI tools better and we have 50 increase in our clients month over month right now imagine what it means 50 increase in clients in the month that's just he was talking about the last month I can't even imagine what it means for an annual year-over-year growth now he's talking about clients not that he isn't talking about revenues because on the revenue side we really haven't seen that impact yet and they're very intentional about it if you read the book by Peter Thiel that he wrote six years ago zero to one which I highly recommend there's no affiliate links in my in my bio just go get it on Amazon in that book he said look we're going to generate this new industry that doesn't really exist yet and when we create this new industry New Market we're going to go so fast we're going to become a monopoly in this new market that does not yet exist which is literally what they're doing with AIP right now there's a lot of generative AI tools out there plenty of them but AAP is very very unique that's the only one of its kind really at this scale so they're rushing to get the entire Market as fast as they can it's very very similar to FSD for example if they're going to grab the entire Market it's going to be very hard to compete it's going to be way cheaper to just buy AIP or license AIP than to build something of your own so they're grabbing market share even at loss right as a lost leader so that they can later convert it to revenues the test of this will be in about I want to say two years in about two years we're gonna see if all this new clientele they acquired all this new market share they acquired can actually be monetized and translated to massive exponential Revenue growth that's going to be the big test of palantir but you shouldn't expect this in the next six to 12 months this is probably two years away,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,Mn5oG83D1vs,2023-09-22T10:11:20Z,Palantir CEO Alex Karp Leaves CNBC Interviewer SPEECHLESS,Chat GPT,he said look chat gbt can write you poems it can write you articles about things you have no idea about and that's great that's perfect that's really really good but um there's nothing in this that gives you a Competitive Edge as a business when you're going on the you know in a Cutthroat Market as a business you need an AI tool that's going to give you a Competitive Edge not write your poems and articles something that actually is transformative in a way that it generates not only like cool stuff actual business advantages so they're not competing with chat GPT by the way they're completely not I'll explain in a second what he was talking about but he's basically saying look Chachi PT is a nice little gimmickies thing but if you're looking for the next big player we haven't really seen any reveal on the global Mass stage yet,1.0,-0.4
Tom Nash,xQhAl2_2PqM,2023-09-21T14:33:04Z,The Federal Reserve Just F*cked The Entire Stock Market,The Federal Reserve,the same people who are managing the policy right now are the same people who flooded the market with too much money in 2020 caused this inflationary cycle then they waited sitting on their ass for a whole year claiming this was transitory and it's going to blow over like some cold which it didn't in 2021 and now they're keeping the throttle all the way through basically going full blast and neutral going nowhere besides ruining you the middle class. yesterday Paul comes out the FED comes out the fomc comes out and it basically let us know two things number one they're not raising rates which was expected no issues with that but the second thing they've said is that they're going to keep rates much much higher for much much longer including a rate hike in 2023 and only two rate decreases in 2024 by 0.25 each at the best case scenario so basically what this means is the Fed is going to keep a vice grip on the balls of the middle class for the next 15 months. My first problem with this is that these mother lovers in their suits and their nice makeup and all their correspondence and analysts and everybody there with you know sitting around this freaking press conference have no idea how hard this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. so piles up there on his pedestal in his Ivory Tower talking about you know we understand the pain and we have to do this to help you guys out and shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. you find out that the FED ain't doing nothing but cause you pain inflict damage on you the middle class and not doing nothing paying for inflation nothing. how will raising interest rates convince people to travel less in the past I'm just asking a legitimate question if people travel more in July and August which happened in the past unless you got a freaking DeLorean Mr Powell how is raising rates in freaking October September is going to freaking change the past we're looking at lagging data. All of this does not get solved by increasing rates further you're not going to encourage people to sell and buy more you're not going to stimulate the real estate market into actual transactional activity by making the problem worse and increasing rates even more to make the problem even worse this bizarre world right here I don't understand this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like why are we trying to ruin the middle class in America by putting more pressure on them when we know it has nothing to do with them. look at the surveys from the New York fed the percentages that people put on losing their job over the next 12 months are the highest we've seen since April 2021. the consumer is already terrified by the fed's own data that's the New York fed is telling you consumers are terrified. economically because you cannot raise rates and keep it at five percent and not cause unemployment and not cause a slow down a recession or whatever you want to call it it's already happened you just don't know it yet the question is why make it worse just so you you can pretend that you're solving the problem the problem is currently being sold by itself by the existing rates we already have and the oil prices in the shelter will have nothing to do with what you guys are doing right now why keep rates so high when it's absolutely unnecessary I don't understand this and this is by the way why the stock market is reacting the way it's reacting because when you have imbeciles running your policy people are selling their portfolios because there's no confidence I'll see you next video,1.0,-1.0
Tom Nash,xQhAl2_2PqM,2023-09-21T14:33:04Z,The Federal Reserve Just F*cked The Entire Stock Market,OPEC,add on top of it the fact that the Saudis and the Graco cartel known as OPEC I mean of course the oil cartel is actively shorting Supply so you guys have less gasoline at the pump so they can get a hundred dollars per barrel which is what they want. so if OPEC is actually reducing Supply to artificially Elevate prices and the seasonality here which is basically we're looking at lacking data from from August sorry it's not current data so what will interest rate hikes do for that how will raising interest rates convince OPEC in the Saudis not to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with your gasoline prices. it has everything to do with lag of shelter pricing and oil prices coming from OPEC and seasonality,1.0,-1.0
Tom Nash,xQhAl2_2PqM,2023-09-21T14:33:04Z,The Federal Reserve Just F*cked The Entire Stock Market,Saudi Arabia,add on top of it the fact that the Saudis and the Graco cartel known as OPEC I mean of course the oil cartel is actively shorting Supply so you guys have less gasoline at the pump so they can get a hundred dollars per barrel which is what they want. how will raising interest rates convince OPEC in the Saudis not to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with your gasoline prices,0.9,-0.9
Tom Nash,Zm6hUumUISE,2023-09-20T15:35:36Z,ARK Invest Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Tesla,Kind: captions Language: en and we do believe it's the biggest AI opportunity in the world today so Kathy Wood just said that Tesla is the greatest AI opportunity of our lifetime let's watch the clip uh the probably the stock that you've had to talk about to CNBC and everyone else more than any other stock ever it's without doubt I'm guessing here I think it's Tesla Kathy and one of the criticisms is your concentration of holding of that stock NOW last time I looked I think you thought it was a base case in our minimum scenario of something like 1400 bucks per share as well and we know you're a big fan but given what you just said about um the undervalued undervaluation of innovation more generally is it just not the case that I mean look we know it's a fantastic company and we know you've done brilliantly well out of it and you've backed it all the way through but but given the pricing of it now compared to the rivals who are really innovating as you say people are innovating a lot quicker uh than they had previously is the disparity between Tesla and the rest of the auto sector globally is it just too much um so are we are in print our price Target is two thousand dollars and that's a a 2027 um price Target uh so we think it has miles to go it has it has just started uh and we do believe it's the biggest AI opportunity in the world today uh the uh autonomous taxi platform opportunity is going to be a winner take most opportunity so the first company that gets uh people from point A to point B the fastest and the safest is probably going to be the biggest winner in the space in the United States We Believe Tesla's in the pole position and what's so interesting about autonomous taxi platform is the margin structure the margin structure is uh compared to EVS which are in the 20 to 30 percent gross profit margin range uh the profit margin of autonomous taxi platforms are sas-like software as a service like so eighty percent plus so we believe that Tesla will have a blended margin in the next five to ten years in the 50 to 60 perhaps higher range again this is an the biggest AI project in the world right now and we think it's incredibly undervalued Kathy are you worried about the Chinese Evie makers getting in the way I mean the Europeans already launched an investigation into subsidies from those Chinese automakers are you worried that they're also going to go after say the dominant U.S market position and prove a real challenge to some of those traditional players in the states I think EVS generally yes will and especially companies that are focused only on EVS um they're probably writing down the cost curve of electric vehicles and are going to be able to cut prices much like Tesla is doing many people when they see Tesla cutting prices they say oh that's terrible they must be losing a lot of business otherwise they wouldn't be pricing this way no Elon has always promised that he would pass along cost savings to Consumers and if the consumer is feeling a a bit uh weak right now or has lost some confidence those lower prices are making a difference in fact we've heard that the waiting time now for the model y has actually increased by several months look you can say what you want about Kathy Wood you can say she got a lot of calls wrong but when it comes to Tesla this lady was always ahead of the curve and she still is she just talked about a few things we have to cover here she was talking about the fact that Tesla is the greatest AI opportunity of her lifetime she was talking about the winner takes all or take most approach and she was talking about the margins and she was talking about how Tesla is so far ahead it's not even the question of who's going to win this race now look let me explain what I mean here you know how in the nature films there's this Lion of the pride and the lion of the pride is the only male that gets to mate with the females of the pride the rest of the males they get to watch this is the same thing that's going to happen with full self-driving autonomy Robo taxis somebody's gonna be the king lion somebody's going to be the alpha male who gets to mate with all the females and the rest of them are gonna watch which is exactly what she's talking about here now look the example comes from the jungle but the rules of nature are very very simple if you have the best technology and you have the best r d and the best deployment you're going to win this race now what she's talking about is very interesting in the beginning she was talking about the fact that she has a two thousand dollar price target for Tesla for 2027. I think she's referring to the more bullish price Target she has because in the clip a few days ago she was saying fourteen hundred dollars I think that was the medium case now whether it's 1400 or 2000 it doesn't really matter because she was actually bouncing off a lot of the BS that was coming from the panel for example within the questions that she was asked the panelists said that the rivals are getting better and catching up with Tesla now he was talking about AI which is even crazier to me to say than Automobiles and EVS or whatever and call it with AI who's catching up with Tesla we just made a video a few days ago showing you how nobody's catching up with Tesla and AI generative AI who GM with a 34 million highway miles no City miles whatsoever who waymo byd who self-admittedly are not playing this game not trying to develop FSD Nvidia that supports software that's being used by Pony AI with 8 million miles versus Tesla at this point they probably have what 170 180 million miles and they're generating a million miles every single day on highways and roads on back roads I mean my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] grandpa's garage they're everywhere who's gonna beat them so which Rivals are catching up which Rivals are getting better in generative AI I don't understand where this question came from but nevertheless she bounced it off really really well basically she said look this is the time to invest in AI the biggest opportunities are right now why because most markets don't understand how insane this opportunity is everybody is evaluating Tesla looking PE priced earnings now look some companies don't make no sense some companies it's worth to pay high PES for now I'm going to fund a lot of Nvidia fans here but I wouldn't pay high PE for NVIDIA because the data center business that Nvidia is actually building their cache on right now is a massive business but it's an infrastructure upgrade whether it takes two three four five six years eventually it's gonna run its course and then Nvidia will have to reinvent itself again paying massive B for this to me it's not a bad idea but Tesla has a way higher ceiling between robotics AI electric vehicles energy all of these things not to mention EVS like not to mention AGI the ceiling here is absolutely endless so she's right that this is the best time to invest in AI because the most well the market isn't getting it yet and she's 100 right on the fact that that's going to be the winner that's going to take most in fact I'm going to double down and I'm gonna say she's being very cautious I think Winner Takes all whoever wins the FSD autonomy race is going to get to dictate the rules you know how Elon said in a few days ago that the winners they write history in fact he had a little joke about it how losers have more time on their hands and they write Wikipedia pages but basically whoever wins the FSD race whoever wins autonomy gets to license their technology out to the rest of the auto manufacturers the rest of the oems much like the little lions of the pack of the pride and have to watch the other male get to mate with all the other females in the tribe or pack whatever it's called but basically this is what's going to happen it Tesla wins and they take over autonomy in FSD the rest of the oems will have to license the technology from Tesla it's just the rules of the game now if Tesla already has a massive lead as we've shown in the video just a few days ago with 140 150 160 170 I don't know at this point how much they have probably more like 180 million miles and they're generating a million miles a day so you already have a massive lead and you're running three four five times faster than the second and the third guy in fact you're running faster than all of them combined how are they going to win I mean there's no chance if this was a race the race is over it's just a question of time now the other thing she mentioned here which is I think is brilliant is something that doesn't get discussed a lot and I keep pounding my freaking hand in my notebook talking about these guys this is an 80 gross margin business this isn't selling cars this isn't 20 30 gross profit business this is an 80 gross profit business it's software now if we talk about software at 80 gross margin essentially all Tesla has to do is generate about one and a half trillion dollars of revenues from FSD to generate about 1.2 trillion dollars of profit which is exactly what Elon said in the Walton Isaacson book in the bio he literally said that he said that I think Tesla is not going to be the biggest company in the world it's not only going to be the most important company in the world it's going to generate one trillion dollars of profit annually per year Now with an 80 gross margin you don't have to generate three or four trillion dollars of Revenue you're probably need one and a half trillion for that number to become true and if the entire Market is five or six trillion dollars which is half of what Kathy Wood thinks she thinks it's a 12 trillion dollar market but if it's a five to six trillion dollar market and Tesla grabs most of it at 80 gross margin do the math then the mathematics of Elon Musk and Kathy with about the share price becomes on the low side it's not 1400 it's a whole different number now she also said something really important she said look it's not only going to impact the 80 gross margin coming from FSD the Blended margin of the company in between selling EVS energy Robotics and FSD is going to be about 50 to 60 percent now if Tesla ends up operating at 50 gross margin and the essentially they grab the autonomous the FSD Market I can't even start thinking about how massive this company is going to be now they did mention the fact that Chinese automakers might be challenging Tesla now to me it's a fair question but here's the problem the most of the Chinese automakers they're not anywhere near Tesla and scale to compete to generate enough data expand Lee Auto Neo minuscule miniature the only company in China that has the scale to compete with Tesla on data potentially is byd byd sells enough cars byd puts enough cars on the road to generate enough data to compete with Tesla potentially but byd themselves came out and said we're not playing this game byd admittedly themselves said we're not trying to develop full self-driving it's a waste of time and a waste of money for their clients it makes perfect sense they're targeting a demographic that does not require that they're targeting the low tier twenty thousand twenty five thousand dollar car their clientele is not going to be looking for FSD unless it's the absolute standard of the industry which it may become in 10 years but not now so if byd isn't changing this if the rest of the competition is in shambles light years behind Tesla I'm very bullish and I think she's absolutely 100 right now,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,d_3A0wRWj58,2023-09-18T16:14:05Z,Elon Musk Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Tesla,Elon Musk just said that and the even crazy part is I don't think he's nuts I think he's being modest and in this video I'll show you exactly why this comes from the newest biography of Elon Musk written by Walter Isaacson now as it stands today Tesla is generated about 80 to 90 billion dollars of revenues per year trailing 12 months is about 94 billion dollars now currently the gross profit of Tesla is about 20 billion dollars per year which means 50x profit from now and for the sixth biggest U.S public company in the world that's a tall order now let's break this down let me show you why I think he's being modest Tesla has the current business which is the automotive business which is doing fine and unlike all the haters and the Bears no the margins are fine thank you for asking the demand is fine thank you for asking I mean there's not gonna be a demand problem there's not gonna be a margin problem the automotive business is doing just fine but this isn't the next s-curve for the company and everybody knows that it's going to be a great business so the next s-curve is going to come from either energy robotics AGI or FSD the thing about this you have to understand is that nothing remains static in this world and the pace at which adoption of new technology happens has gotten really fast over the last 100 years when radio came out in 1920 it took America decades to adopt it we then had the TV in 1940 which took about 10 years to 90 percent of American household to adopt and then we had the smart cell phones in 2007 which took five years to get over 50 of ownership in the United States so Mass adoption of new technologies is getting faster and FSD is going to break all the records I'm going to show exactly how and why and when what gives us the certainty the test is going to have a big chunk of this because the one thing I hate seeing and you see that a lot on shows like Shark Tank right a person walks in and they're gonna be like yeah well the dog food market is about one billion dollars if we just grab 10 of it we're gonna be in a hundred billion dollar company uh shut the hell up that's the worst way of looking at things and this is not what we're about to do here but we will analyze the market in a little bit of a more nuanced way so the first question you have to ask yourself is how is the winner going to be decided in the FSD autonomous driver Market is it going to be many winners take some chunks of the market or is it gonna be one Winner Takes everything or at least the vast majority of it now I'll argue that with new technologies we have more of the latter as Technologies progress and people want to have the best it's very very hard for multiple winners take multiple chunks and it's probably going to be the latter one company is going to beat out all the rest so the question is who this company is going to be Nvidia isn't generated a lot of scale with respect to miles driven they definitely have the skills but not the scale of competing with Tesla and I'll show in a second Tesla's numbers byd has massive scale they're the only company that actually giving Tesla and run for its money at least in electric vehicles but byd themselves came out just five months ago and said literally I'm quoting full self driving is impossible so byd are not playing this game they don't think it can be done they don't have anything in development that can do this in fact they don't want it and they've themself said it so byd isn't even competing in this and for a good reason their market share is the lower tier I want an electric vehicle too but I want it much much cheaper so they're not gonna be competing with Tesla on quality of software on quality of the design on the ux UI plus they're not even self-admittedly competing in this market at all so GM is not even generating City miles right now so 34 million miles strictly on the highway zero miles in cities so they're definitely competing with Tesla what about mobileye the biggest competitor of Tesla and the guys who literally put out an article a few days ago on September 14th literally saying I'm not making this up I'm quoting that autonomous will never happen by neural networks end to end and it's always going to be cold literally the opposite of what Elon is saying and don't forget the fact that they really love lidar nobody comes close to test us 105 50 million miles of full self-driving even if we combine all of these mother lovers in one group they're not even close the craziest part is that Tesla generated 90 million miles 9-0 just a year ago and zero FSD miles in 2021 so in two years Tesla generated 150 million miles and it's currently running at about a million miles daily and we're not even talking about fsd12 which is a complete Game Changer because that's the first one that's actually going on neural networks and not specifically on heavy heavy coding to me it's clear that there's going to be one winner in this and that winner is going to have to license FSD or autonomous or full set driving to the rest of the industry why do I say it will have to why not destroy the rest of the industry by not giving this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well the main reason I think is going to come from Anti-Trust law I think the government in every single big country like the us is going to force Tesla to do it the way they did it with supercharging the infrastructure is going to be there the software is going to be there the anti-just authorities will mandate in my opinion Tesla to share this but sharing this means that nobody else is ever going to be competing with Tesla and it means that Tesla is going to be generating a lot of money from other people's lack of ability to develop the software where they have 500 000 vehicles on the road with FSD nobody comes close we're talking about 1 million FSD miles every single day 2 million cars sold in the last 12 months 5 million cars on the road imagine what happens when Elon actually decides to release this and actually let a bigger chunk of the public use FSD and generate more miles and generate more revenues and more profits for Tesla Tesla already has a massive advantage over the absolute rest of the industry and the craziest part is that massive advantage is getting bigger Tesla is literally miles ahead and it's running way faster than everybody else how could you not see this mainstream media and their analysts and that's not even talking about the fact that Tesla has another three big S curves in its eight pocket I don't know about an eight pocket means a back pocket is that a Russian thing I swear just I don't know I said eight pocket we're talking about energy another massive s-curve we're talking about robotics another massive s-curve we're talking about AGI the general AI we're talking about the car business is going to be generally massive silly amounts of Monopoly money so if we just focus on the FSD market and ignore cars Robotics and energy and AGI just look at FSD if Tesla manages to grab 50 of the FSD Market which currently I don't see who can grab the other 50 but let's give that out of 50 to somebody that 50 assuming on the low end of estimations of what the total addressable Market of this FSD will be we're talking about a trillion dollar income per year for Tesla just on that alone with 80 gross margin which this business will deliver they're going to have 800 billion of profit every year just from that loan we'll have the car business without the energy business whether the AGI Business Without The robotics business well none of this we're talking about FSD on Tesla vehicles on licensing to all other oems and on Robo taxis look Tesla has hit a lot of crazy Milestones that people didn't think it can in the past it went from 14 billion dollars in revenues just five years ago to 94 billion in revenues in the last 12 months that's a 7x in revenues you you think they can't make another 12x job from here I would say it's very probable especially with FSD and then AGI in the Robotics and then the car's been the energy six thousand dollars per share for Tesla definitely possible if you've got 10 to 15 years to wait on the other hand you can always buy Lucid I'll see you in the next video ah listen,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,d_3A0wRWj58,2023-09-18T16:14:05Z,Elon Musk Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Nvidia,There's a lot of formidable competitors in this market and video is one Nvidia has a platform called Hyperion which has been generating a lot of cash flow for the company but not nearly as much as the data center business Nvidia basically built a platform which other companies can use to develop full self-driving or autonomous driver or driver assistance whatever we're going to call it now for the past year Nvidia generated 250 million dollars of this platform which is very nice but it generated 13 and a half billion dollars of revenues so the main focus of Nvidia is the data center AI business and that's a fact but they are making massive progress on this field as well the problem is with Nvidia is that their clientele list as impressive as it may sound does not generate a lot of miles they got Mercedes using it Volvo Hyundai Pulsar Jaguar Land Rover a bunch of other companies but nobody has scale their biggest client Pony AI who's a startup in the autonomous taxi business generated 13 million miles so far in aggregate so we're talking about their biggest client has 13 million miles the rest of them they either don't have full self-driving or autonomous driving or very very limited miles so Nvidia isn't generated a lot of scale with respect to miles driven they definitely have the skills but not the scale of competing with Tesla and I'll show in a second Tesla's numbers,1.0,-0.1
Tom Nash,d_3A0wRWj58,2023-09-18T16:14:05Z,Elon Musk Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,BYD,If you're talking about scale you have to look at byd right byd has massive scale they're the only company that actually giving Tesla and run for its money at least in electric vehicles but byd themselves came out just five months ago and said literally I'm quoting full self driving is impossible so byd are not playing this game they don't think it can be done they don't have anything in development that can do this in fact they don't want it and they've themself said it so byd isn't even competing in this and for a good reason their market share is the lower tier I want an electric vehicle too but I want it much much cheaper so they're not gonna be competing with Tesla on quality of software on quality of the design on the ux UI plus they're not even self-admittedly competing in this market at all,1.0,-0.6
Tom Nash,d_3A0wRWj58,2023-09-18T16:14:05Z,Elon Musk Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Lucid,On the other hand we have lucid who's always striving for the best right but unlike getting the best door handles this is way way harder especially when you're just selling 5 000 vehicles per year where are your miles coming from a guy there's not a lot of it if you want to develop the best AI you have to have miles you have to have data so Nvidia isn't generating data byd is definitely not generic data and Lucid listen to this listen I mean we've talked about it what about GM they got 34 million miles of data which is a lot massive massive amounts of Miles definitely compared to Nvidia byd and Lucid probably more than all three combined on the other hand you can always buy Lucid I'll see you in the next video ah listen,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,d_3A0wRWj58,2023-09-18T16:14:05Z,Elon Musk Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,GM,what about GM they got 34 million miles of data which is a lot massive massive amounts of Miles definitely compared to Nvidia byd and Lucid probably more than all three combined but the problem with the super cruise I don't like that name a lot but it is what it is is that it only works on highways you have to have a divided highway for it to work and only on pre-map road so essentially you need pre-mapping and highway miles only so GM is not even generating City miles right now so 34 million miles strictly on the highway zero miles in cities so they're definitely competing with Tesla,1.0,-0.2
Tom Nash,d_3A0wRWj58,2023-09-18T16:14:05Z,Elon Musk Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Mobileye,what about mobileye the biggest competitor of Tesla and the guys who literally put out an article a few days ago on September 14th literally saying I'm not making this up I'm quoting that autonomous will never happen by neural networks end to end and it's always going to be cold literally the opposite of what Elon is saying and don't forget the fact that they really love lidar nobody comes close to test us 105 50 million miles of full self-driving even if we combine all of these mother lovers in one group they're not even close,1.0,-0.8
Tom Nash,jryXhBK1w_E,2023-09-13T11:52:57Z,Billionaire Ron Baron Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla,Tesla,"so Ron Baron the billionaire investor in Tesla just went on tnbc minutes ago and schooled the entire panel by dropping some massive Bombshells let's watch the interview and then I'm going to give my honest reaction to what just happened the Tesla is now at a similar stage where it was in 2014 2015 uh when I was investing 16 and they were doing 40,000 cars a year they're now doing a million eight on the way to 20 million and uh they been growing 50% a year and uh this year the probably be up uh you know 25 30% next year same about the same but there's a new uh car coming 25 30% Revenue uh no units units and uh and then they got the battery business which is $6 billion a year and that's going to be up a triple over the next three years and that's going to go up 30 times their cost basis is quite a bit higher than Tesla way higher and and uh so every time they sell an EV they sell one fewer gasoline core and the gasoline core they make money on and the EVS they lose money on the uh the traditional oems are uh are troubled right now and uh I think ultimately uh you know they're going to make metal they're going to make the units and ultimately they're going to buy software uh from Tesla Tesla is going to be like the uh like Intel inside of a Microsoft computer that's going to be Tesla Tesla is going to be everything that makes a car you know all the all the all the inside is going to be Tesla that's what's ultimately going to be licensed are you buying any additional Tesla or SpaceX or have you kind of maxed out where you feel comfortable with your fund which is a diversified fund um in the funds that I manage I've been maxed out we had uh when the stock went up 20 times after we bought it we sold for clients uh about a quarter of the shares I didn't sell a share personally I committed to the directors of our mutual funds I only invest in mutual funds normally uh I made an exception in this instance and I said that I would be I was the last in I would last out and I won't sell a single share for myself until we sell all of our client stock uh and as far as buying more uh I would buy more if I could but I can't and other guys at our firm nibbling they do things that this is a great price this is this is when they introduce this model 2 they're going to have the cost half of what it is right now half and uh and they're going to sell the car for I don't know maybe a third less than what it is right now and there's credits so this is an do do you at the same time think that the big three have their work cut out from given the uncertain future of whether Americans ever Embrace non-Tesla EVS I mean would you think that the the big three are have the work cut out for them would you at least acknowledge that do you think I would hate to compete against Tesla so Warren Buffett initially would say you know said you know 20 years ago 15 years ago he said that you know he wouldn't invest in Tesla and now he says he would hate to compete against Tesla uh so so so so to go on to this so model two this is coming within uh you know by 2025 when that comes that's going to be exactly the same thing as what happened when Tesla introduced the model S so you're going to see this tremendous change going on there and then as I said before the software core competency model 2 half price and then Dojo so Dojo oh right yes I said what is dojo so Dojo is a training and what that is that they have this massive amount of data for all these cars have been driving around for millions and millions of miles and and that keeps growing exponentially no one has that they have this data but to Crunch the data you need compute and compute is what Nvidia has uh and Nvidia has compute a chip which is for everyone to use I have all these different uh you know device all these different uh you know opportunities that this company has what our company has is they're making their own uh compute and they in 18 months they're going to have more compute than anyone in the world Tesla and compute the stuff that's in your basement as opposed to the chip that's in your car so what they're going to have is they will have some much massive capacity to provide services to cars and to be able to train this dat to train your car on this data so what's the competitive Advantage is the data and the training is going to be provided by uh by this compute and they're going to have more of it than anyone nobody can catch them last year by the way you read about uh the number of people that are uh seeking jobs and they're saying that uh there's you know there's too many too many people seeking the jobs or whatever they say it is with with uh with too too few people and uh what Tesla has is last year or this year I think they have 3 and a half million people seeking 30,000 jobs last year they had 3 million people seeking 20,000 jobs so there's 130,000 people so they yeah but Ron let let's jump to another stop okay thank you Ron Baron for this absolutely annihilated panel let's talk about everything he just talked about because he drops a massive Bombshells here number one so the first thing he said was very interesting note so he said look I invested in this company when they were making 40,000 Vehicles they're currently making 2 million Vehicles so we're currently in the point where I was when I invested 40,000 because they're about to make 20 million cars and this is that moment where you can invest when they only make tenth of that so basically saying hey this is the second jump the first jump happened from 40,000 to 2 million from 2 million to 20 million we're currently just before that happens and it's not yet priced in uh the other thing is he actually mentioned that the battery business can be 30 times bigger than what it is right now 100% agree one of the most undervalued things about Tesla and a whole new scurve in its own he mentioned the new model 2 whatever it's going to be called it's probably not going to be called Model 2 and he basically says look the this car is going to revolutionize the world it's going to cost half as much as the model 3 and it's going to so it third less than the model 3 which is going to make Tesla a whole lot of money now he also mentioned before he got interrupted and I don't know if it was intentional or not but he was about to say hey Toyota almost bankrupted the US Auto industry and Tesla is about to do the same but as he was saying this I don't know if somebody told the panel in the earpiece don't let him say this don't let him say this all of a sudden he got interrupted with a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] question about the UAV and how it you know it's going to impact the big three and basically you know they didn't let him finish that sentence but he was about to say hey Tesla is about to bankrupt the US Auto industry just like Toyota almost did now surprisingly enough Becky from the from from the panel she actually she called it right she said hey the cost for the big three for the gym the Fords to make an EV is so much higher than a Tesla how can they compete I can't believe she actually was allowed to ask that question on CNBC but essentially Ron Baron actually went even deeper and said yeah that's true but also don't forget the one thing that has in you know in standard Legacy automakers you have a lot of cannibalization so when he's right whenever is like for their GM they sell an electric vehicle which they're losing money on there's one last sale of an internal combustion engine vehicle which they're not selling and that's their core business so essentially there that's why he's saying nobody's going to catch Tesla because these two companies these three companies The Big Three they're caught in this mouse trap where if they don't sell EVS they can't catch up with Tesla if they sell EVS they're killing the only business that actually is profitable so they're in a way digging their own grave I know it sounds horrible but it kind of is now he also said you know he said that they're troubled but I think what it actually means they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and and he also said they're eventually going to have to license software from Tesla which is 100% per true Tesla is going to already is going to provide the infrastructure for the charging for the entire industry that's already the done deal they're also going to provide the software for that industry and then people will wake up one day and realize oh my God Tesla isn't a car company their energy software infrastructure robotics AI company Now on the AI side he actually did say that hey ER by the way um yeah they also have Dojo which is going to be a massive step in Tesla's dominance in AI with Tesla's data coming from FSD Which is far greater than anybody else the amount of data they collect and Dojo good luck to you catching Tesla nobody's catching Tesla not in AI not in full driving anywhere he actually said something very true Warren Buffett does not want to compete with Tesla go check out how many shares of byd Warren Buffett sold over the past two years over the past two years Warren Buffett have been selling heavy byd he's been getting out of that investment some of it maybe because of China but some of it because he knows he's not going to compete with Tesla and people get all excited about byd selling a lot of cars in China first of all half those are hybrids and the other part is Tesla is not competing with these guys once Tesla launches the model two let's have that talk then and then we'll see what's up.",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,JodrBB392Mg,2023-09-11T13:20:05Z,TESLA STOCK: Morgan Stanley Just Dropped a MASSIVE Bombshell About Tesla's Future,Tesla,so Tesla gets a huge upgrade from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley raising his price Target from 250 all the way to 400 with a 550 dollars as a bull case so Morgan Stanley shifted to an overweight rating on Tesla on The View that the biggest value driver looking ahead is the company's software and services Revenue Alice Adam Jonas said that the same forces that have driven Amazon's AWS to reach 70 of the company's total ebit can work for Tesla and help it open up new adjustable markets that extend well beyond selling vehicles at a fixed price basically what he's talking about here is that Tesla is not about to fund nvidia's 60 gross margin to build this thing they're going to build their own and gonna make it bigger and better and gonna create an extra 500 billion dollars of Enterprise Value now Morgan Stanley hiked its price Target in Tesla to 400 from prior price I guess 250 and call the electric vehicle stock a topic in the sector the 52-week hyper Tesla is 315 so that's well above that essentially what Adam Jonas for Morgan Stanley is saying here Beyond Dojo beyond the extra 500 billion dollars he's saying here one of the first analysts from like a sell side perspective that's saying the Tesla is far more than just a car company it's literally the first guy from the institutional side that's saying the same things that people out of the retail Community have been saying for the past three years but nevertheless it's better to be late than never to arrive so welcome to the club Adam Jonas and let's talk about what I see here as far as where this thing is headed um I think that someone in mainstream media will undoubtedly spin this as a negative story I don't know how exactly but I'm sure these mother lovers will find a way to take the story and turn this into something negative probably bad-mouthing Adam Jonas and Morgan Stanley they're gonna try and discredit what he's saying they're going to try to say that you know sell side analysts they don't know what they're talking about which is partially true but at the end of the day it's gonna be a negative story for Tesla and the mainstream media nobody is going to give Tesla its flowers now to me it's a huge sign it's a sea change we have a major Wall Street analyst that accepts that Tesla is not just a car company now according to what people think on Twitter or X or whatever you want to you know look for this is no inside information for sales side analysts so people tend to think well Adam Jonas must know something right he must have the inside track he must have some inside info and now he's raising his Target price on 250 to 400. I hate to break it to you but sell side analysts they're the bottom of the food chain and Wall Street they have absolutely no access to inside information whatsoever so I can guarantee you Adam knows nothing more than you it's just his analysis now is changing it almost like you woke up one day and realized oh my God Tesla has full self-driving dojo and Ai and Robo taxi oh he's like where were you for the past three years but hey at least you're here unlike some of the other analysts on Wall Street now I do want to clarify here something that's going to cool down the excitement about this because obviously there's going to be a lot of excitement here right this isn't a Target price that is based on in DCF this isn't an intrinsic value from Adam Jonas about what Tesla should be valued at even though they're trying to disguise it as such if you read the report it's going to sound as if there's intrinsic evaluation going on here and then Adam Jones is saying well yeah it's a 400 per stock based on this model that says that this is the value no this is not how sales hype analysts value companies so sell site analyst basically change their price targets according to how the wind blows so the only thing you can get out of a sales side analyst for the most part as far as an indication of where the market sentiment is going it's not any indication of intrinsic value whatsoever they only care about the trend the momentum what this trade says so this is not an intrinsic evaluation this is a comparable evaluation and it still has value even though it's only a reflection of what the market thinks about Tesla it's still very very important because it shows us that discrete is now starting to open up to the idea that Tesla is more than the car company for the first time this conversation is happening outside their regular Tesla circles now I wouldn't discount completely the value of comparable valuations based on what discrete is saying look if you want to sell your house right if you want to sell your condo you're going to do an intrinsic evaluation that condo you're going to do a DCF on that condo no you're gonna see how much other condos or how much other houses in your neighborhood with similar parameters are selling for and then you know what the price of your house is you know not going to run a DCF on your house right so sometimes intrinsic variation is dead on mayor and sometimes comparable valuations do have a lot of value so the fact of the matter is let's understand what this is this is Adam John is giving you a comparative valuation based on what the screen is thinking it has value but it doesn't have the value that some people would think it's not a model it's just what the sentiment is about Tesla now I just want to point out that the last time that Adam Jonas went balls deep into Tesla was September or October 2021 can't exactly recall the perfect date but last time it did it Tesla went to all-time highs so I assume it's going to be a very similar knee-jerk bullish reaction in the short term which is to me absolutely irrelevant and should be to you as a long-term investor as well now I think it's impressive and I'm I'm I'm going to be a little bit cynical here sorry Adam Jonas I think it's impressive when experts from the sell side analysts for for side like Morgan Stanley it can see something so obvious and uh you know so clear-cut to the level that middle school children could have seen this three years ago and now you know every time that this comes out all of a sudden the price spikes and the retail investing Community is crying oh my God we missed the bottom Tesla and it's now 400 bucks it used to be a hundred well where were you for the past three years we've been saying to you that this is insanely undervalued I mean this isn't news but again some people that were sitting on the sidelines will undoubtedly see this happening they're gonna sit out thinking the Tesla is too expensive it's running up too fast and they're gonna be sorry didn't get in now to that I want to say something that's going to again cool down the excitement here a little bit before you fall more into Tesla listen up look short-term volatility with Tesla is to be expected it ain't going to go to 400 on the straight line from 250 to 400 forget that that's not going to happen there's no way the Tesla goes from 250 to 400 on a straight line zero percent there's more chances of Grandpa quitting alcohol than this happening now what it most likely will do it will continue to be extremely volatile up and down in a very very unpredictable Manner and eventually the fundamentals which get you know which can clearly see the fundamentals are so strong for this company the fundamentals will catch up with the price and they will get to 400 and Way Beyond that but it's not going to be in a straight line so at the end of the day if you are thinking about investing in Tesla right now it's not too late it's not too late to invest in Tesla even if it runs up today if it goes crazy runs up like eight ten percent today it's not too late to invest in Tesla and I emphasize the word invest not trade invest it's not too late to invest in Tesla if you got patience if you got discipline if you got acceptance of uncertainty and extreme volatility if you can stomach all these things then it's not too late to invest in Tesla in fact it's never too late to invest in Tesla like Peter Lynch said decades ago it's never too late to invest in great companies now to me look Tesla is a leader in AI skills their leader in growing the best talent in the business they have a great track record of execution yes they're not batting 100 but neither does Steph Curry he doesn't shoot 100 from three right they have the best track record in the business they're the best skills they have the best people their best you know amounts of data are not even comparable to anybody else the amount of data that FSD generates for Tesla to train all these models and the AI stuff is absolutely insane nobody comes close to Tesla so I think that in the long run this is going to make a lot of people very very rich and a lot of people who stayed out you know you're going to see a divorce rate in the in the in the High Teens so to speak I'm just kidding obviously now look at the end of the day what would you do as a long-term investor looking at Tesla probably running up today I still don't know what's going on in the market today well as a long-term investor there's only one thing you can do if you like Tesla which I think you have to be an idiot not to like Tesla but if you like Tesla what do you do if it runs up right now well you just start dcing dollar cost averaging to the stock if you have already just keep going stay the course lower your head and keep going like a freaking bot DCA dollar cost average buy a certain amount every single week no matter what price goes up price go down you still buy the same amount of shares if price drops below a certain level where it becomes very attractive you can buy more if price goes up above a certain level when it's a little bit more expensive then you still keep buying but you buy a little bit less you adjust your dollar cost averaging activity based on the swings in price and how you do it which is the price points which levels all of these things we teach on our Academy me peyton.com forward slash Tom Nash we teach the system of how to dollar cost average to get to a lower cost basis in order not to overpay for really good companies we have members who started buying calendar in the high 20s and now they're sitting at single digit averages because they have dollar cost averages same with Tesla same with Nvidia same with asml all these companies they can be bought and held and invested long term without overpaying if you just dollar cost average slow and be opportunistic when the price declines now I would love to see you there we

Tom Nash,cwloMaAtq-U,2023-09-10T15:38:35Z,The Future of Palantir,Palantir,so here's my response to the video made by ticker symbol you about Palantir now take a simple you which is a terrific channel here on finance YouTube It's Ran by A friend of mine Alex and he makes some of the best content on the platform made a critical video about Palantir specifically criticizing the regional investing community of Palantir for misunderstanding what Palantir is and what Palantir AI is supposed to do. I don't want you to send any hate towards Alex because I think it's important to have contrasting opinions in this story because we don't want to be an echo chamber where people are not allowed to criticize Palantir it's management or even its investors it's absolutely fine and I think it's doing important work. now the first thing I want to explain here with Alex and Palantir so Alex actually had an opportunity to work and utilize the platform to test it out for himself. his main argument was very very simple it was a two-fold argument number one was that Palantir is currently being created with a lot of its future success already priced in into the stock. that's not really a criticism of Palantir just the criticism of the forward-facing markets that we operate in. I do have to point out I have no affiliation with Palantir I don't know anybody in the company I'm not getting paid to talk about this company my only understanding comes from what I see in the open source in you know public information so by the way the only contact I ever had with them they emailed me once offering for me to interview Shram Sankar and I missed the email for like six months then six months later I was like hey is this still relevant they never get back to me I think they got annoyed by that or whatever but you know that was the extent of my communications with Palantir so I have no Insight track about what's going on Palantir. now my main point here is that Alex from ticker symbol U not Alex carp is saying that a lot of the retail investment community things that Palantir is competing with open AI that it's a generative AI company it's generating its own Ai and therefore it's competing with open Ai and similar and he's essentially saying look Palantir isn't that it's AIP platform is essentially a package in which every company takes a large language model off the shelf and it uses the AIP platform to utilize that llm the large language model into its own business to make sense of its massive amounts of data. the open AIS the microsofts right they're going to incorporate these features into their own llm into their own product and therefore rendering Palantir irrelevance they're going to cut out the Palantir Services because they're going to build it themselves. Alex you're talking about something that's going to happen maybe in the future I agree that this is a possibility sure but it hasn't happened yet and you're talking about something that may happen how long it's going to take them to build AIP how good it's going to be how receptive the market is going to be the idea for Palantir right now and this is another thing it criticizes political force like Palantir isn't really monetizing AIP right now they're all about grabbing market share but I think the reason they're doing this is because now it's the time to grab that market share before the competition comes in if you establish relationships if you establish work operations with these companies then when certain competitors will appear Palantir is going to have a Stranglehold on the market so it makes total sense to me what Palantir is doing right now which is almost kind of do a lost lead essentially get into the front door deploy the system and then then start charging and once they're already in the business. but Palantir is selling the shovels it's selling aib which is a tool you use to dig for gold literally just data gold so my understanding is very very simple this is a gold rush and the company I like and I'm bullish on is selling the shovels historically speaking that's not a bad business are there going to be any other shovel sellers out there maybe who knows will they grab market share from Palantir depends on how much market share Palantir grabs right now how strong it becomes in the market if it becomes an industry standard it was a monopoly like Peter till projected about six years ago and it's gonna be very hard for competitors to come in and do that. now is there 100 guarantee that Palantir would Triumph and go 25x from now hell no nothing in this life is guaranteed tomorrow is not guaranteed the only thing that I guaranteed in this life are death and taxes everything else is up for crabs hope you have a great Sunday.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,_KhalUsffRQ,2023-09-05T12:56:24Z,Tom Nash Reacts To Lucid CEO’s $380 Million Salary,Lucid Motors,this is what Lucid Motors paid to Peter Rawlinson the current CEO and founder of the company. when your CEO makes 380 million dollars and your company barely sold 4 000 cars last year how in the world are going to tell me that this CEO gives a flying Frick about your company don't worry about you and your employment and the future of this business. is it linked to Performance in the case of Peter Rawlinson and Lucid Motors well let's look at the performance shall we. oh this company produced 7 000 vehicles in 2022 now originally when the company went back their projection for 2022 was 20 000 Vehicles so they were not exactly On Target let's put it this way. but the craziest part here is not the fact that they couldn't scale is the fact they couldn't sell because out of those 7 000 vehicles that they did manage to push out somehow from the production line they've only sold 4 400 Vehicles so what exactly is that performance they deserve so much credit for that's a far cry from the 20 000 Vehicles they promised in 2022 and there's five and a half billion dollars they promised in revenues in 2023. currently they did 700 million of revenues sold 4 400 cars I mean do you really want to pay this man 90 000 per every vehicle sold if he is willing to take this money in my opinion he clearly doesn't give a damn about this company why would you how could you how could you even imagine a company that generates 700 million dollars in revenue and the CEO takes 380 million as compensation. This is what happens when you obsess about air vents and door handles instead of actually making cars get out of the factory and being sold to the public you're obsessed about all these minutiae details and looking good on TV instead of actually pushing out cars. now in this case Lucid seems to be a transferring mechanism of funds from the Saudi government to the pockets of Peter Rawlinson there's no other way to explain this thing it's absolutely Bonkers to me. this is a company that lost two and a half billion dollars net income last year so this company loses two and a half billion in cash. all while the company has about 2.8 billion in the bank which is after the Saudis gave them a bunch of money they got enough money to last for another year and it seems that Peter Robinson is engaged in basically lining up his pockets as much as possible before this horror show comes to an end. I think this company should be renamed from the Lucid Motors to the Lucid fart because it will be soon forgotten and it will be remembered as an embarrassing event and nobody will care. this company was never profitable not operationally not even in a gross profit business margin this company has never made sense not from a business perspective not from an operational perspective. the only only reason it exists is because Peter Robinson sold in my opinion a pipe dream to the Saudis. The only thing that's keeping this company alive is the Saudi government's money at the moment the Saudis realized that this company is more embarrassing to them alive than dead they're gonna pull the plug and this company will be no more. it makes no sense from any business perspective now look at the share price right now it's even crazier it's trading at 20 time sales price to sales of 20. they can't make enough of these cars they can't sell enough of these cars they can't make any money they're being held on life support by the Saudis and they got a CEO who clearly doesn't care about the company in my opinion now this isn't a good future.,1.0,-0.9

Tom Nash,B9IQ7A-PSbg,2023-09-04T21:47:30Z,You WILL Regret Buying This Stock,Vinfast,"In this video, I want to show you a company that went public on August 15th, 2023. Now, this company is called Vinfast. Now, Vinfast is a 6-year-old car company out of Vietnam. In fact, they're actually registered in Singapore. But that's not the point here. The point is that this car company from Vietnam sold 7,500 vehicles last year, and all of them actually internal combustion engine vehicles, no EVs at all. Now, this year, they've decided to pivot into electric vehicles with a goal of producing 50,000 vehicles in a single year and delivering $2 billion in sales. In July of 2021, they went ahead and assembled the A team. They got the former CEO, chief executive officer of Opel. Now the new CEO of the company is actually a lady by the name of Madame Thui. The problem is now this company is worth $70 billion at least as of the making of this video which means it's bigger than Ford, bigger than GM and only second to Tesla. Now the first warning sign that you should have spotted here is that the fact that this company went public as a spack. But this company went spa in 2023. Well, apparently not because Winfast is now being tagged as the new Tesla out of Asia. So spaxs have pretty much died out, but not this company. Now, why would this company go spack? In my humble opinion, I think they didn't have a choice, and I'll explain in a second why. But here's the thing. Look at it this way. This is a company that just went public through a spa. Now, it's all hyped up as the next Tesla out of Asia. It has very little to no sales of electric vehicles. 7,500 vehicles sold, ICE vehicles in 2022. It's ballooning all the way up to $70 billion in market cap. It has a CEO that's a banker, not from the auto industry, and it has some strange outlook numbers that just don't add up. And you know what? Even if this outlook actually pans out and they do manage to sell $50,000 cars in 2023 and they actually manage to drive $2 billion of sales, that means they're now trading at 35x sales, price to sales of 35, which is identical to Nvidia with 36. So this company is currently trading on the same quality level as Nvidia. Imagine that. Now to me, that sounds a lot like that famous quote about not getting fooled twice. fooled me once. Shame on shame on you. It fooled me. We can't get fooled again. This thing is literally a play from the 2021 playbook of hype and Eevee bubbles and it's playing right in front of you and some people are still falling for that. I just don't understand how. Listen to the CEO itself. They've asked this lady why they went spack, especially when spacks are pretty much dead. And her answer was basically, look, we wanted to do an IPO. We didn't do an IPO because the market was bad. Now that the market is better after we cancel our IPO, we now have to go fast to catch the market. So, we're going spack. We we were ready to do a traditional IPO. We um uh we pursued the path for almost two years, but the markets uh have been challenging. So we decided to decouple the listing from uh from the fundraising. We got the financial biking from our parents' company. Um and we we went ahead with the listing uh by way of spack. Now to me that doesn't add up. To me it sounds more like nobody wanted to touch this IPO and they had to go spack because this was the only way for them to hit the public market and get that money. But forget the spack dog. What about the cars themselves? Well, the cars are truly a work of art. Pissimo Motor Trend actually reviewed this car the VF8 and it said it was nowhere near ready for deliveries titling the article return to sender. Now Kelly Blue Book actually put out an article titled Vinfast reviews are abysmal. Now hard to sugarcoat a piece of turret even with a really nice external design but that's what happens when you don't have any expertise in building cars. The parent company, Vin Group, was established way back in 93. And until 2017, all it did was investing, real estate investments, retail investments. In 2017, they decide to form a subsidiary, which will be an auto manufacturer in Vietnam. And in 2022, they've managed to push out 7,500 cars, internal combustion engine cars. Now, in 2023, all of a sudden, they're an EV expert, and they plan to sell 50,000 cars. Now look, if you think that 2 plus 2 plus 2 equals 571, this makes perfect sense. Otherwise, this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doesn't add up. Now look, the VF8, which is the car in question here, is currently retailing in the US for $46,000 with a range of 260 mi and no EV credit because it's produced in Vietnam. while the Model Y is actually retailing for $48,000 with a $7,500 credit, a range of 300 mi. So, in fact, the Model Y is currently cheaper than the VF8. Now, I can't think of a single person in the United States that's going to go, you know what? I don't want a Tesla. I want a VinFast for more money. How is this thing going to work? Look, as far as the quality, there's been many complaints. the driver assist system, the blinkers, the air conditioning, the accelerator. The funniest of them all was the seats overheating to the point of boiling people's ass. I mean, this thing ain't ready. In fact, every single car they sold in the US was already recalled for the screen just randomly shutting off. Now, these guys are ruthless, and I don't know what they'll do about my video, but in Vietnam, they filed a police report against a YouTuber who criticized their car. I mean, that reminds me a lot of Nicola, but as a Nicola case, this thing is not going to stop me. Now, if you open up the prospectus of this fine company, you'll find a warning from the company, and I'm quoting the company right now on page 17 of the prospectus. We have a significant additional capital through debt or selling shares requirement. Basically, they're telling you in the prospectus they're going to need way more money to survive, either through diluting you or through taking on more debt and paying interest. In any case, it's the company saying it, not me. And things get crazier when you keep looking at the perspectives. The spa initially had $285 million that were supposed to go into Vinfast. But like in every Spack, when the Spack announces the target, people can redeem their money if they don't like the target company. Now, out of the 285 million, only 150 million stayed in. The rest of them are gone. Half of the people just basically bolted. And I'm sure some of them are dead or they just forgot their password. They forgot they put the money there. But essentially the whole spa just brought in into Vinfast $150 million. Whoopde-doo. Their current cash position before that infusion was $158 million. Now their current liabilities at $3.5 billion. And in 2022, they lost $1.8 billion. In fact, in Q1 of this year, in just a single quarter, they lost $470 million, which is more than they have in their cash right now. in a single quarter. Now, where is this thing is going to come out of? How the hell are they going to survive next year? Forget next five years. Not to mention that their cost structure is abysmal. In 2022, they sold $525 million worth of cars. The cost of goods was $1 billion, which means they are losing money on every single car. In fact, they're losing double than what they're making. Now, who in their right mind is going to give this company money? Who, even if this guy, the owner, decides to personally bankroll this company out of his pocket, which is highly unlikely, and put every cent he has into this company, it's about two years worth of operations, and there it's gone. Not to mention the fact that this stock has three bad times coming. Number one, the lockup is going to expire. Every single Spack shareholder that's currently sitting in this valuation is waiting for the six-month lock up to expire. Within 6 months, they're allowed to sell their shares. And I guarantee you a lot of them will bolt. Number two, we have more delution coming. The company told you they have to sell more shares to get more money in. We have more debt coming. They have to raise capital. All of these things are going to crash this stock like a stone and the people who are left in it because they were greedy, they're going to pay a hefty price.",1.0,-0.9

Tom Nash,6mDV195JGsU,2023-08-27T17:14:31Z,The Unsettling Truth About Palantir,Palantir,"so if you listen to mainstream media over the past few days palantir is deluding its shareholders again everybody is in the news talking about how insiders and palantiras selling heavy how palantir is deluding the retail investors and the whole fur that we heard many many years in the past it's coming back because there's a lot of new investors in palantir that have not heard this fund so they're trying to play this again now look palantir as you can see on the screen right now and by the way this is powered by stock MVP it's my software you have a coupon code here for last 40 40 off it's your software my guy go get it 40 off and on stock MVP we have this little thing here that shows you how much insiders are selling how much insiders they're buying and how much institutional shareholders are buying into palantir now on the face of it if you take a look at this thing right here you see there's a red line that represents the sales of the past three months and the blue line that represents the buys and you might think that well Tom it shows that Talent interior insiders are dumping chairs look all this inside acquisition negativity is you know they bought 10 million shares and they sold 15.7 million shares so they're selling like crazy well not exactly predominantly I would say above 95 of this entire chart right here sales and buys are both not real sales and not real buys even though you see 10 million sales sorry 15 million sales and 10 million buys it's all Bs none of this is real and I'll explain why so planeteer has a stock based Compensation Plan they're awarding stock to their employees and then once the stock actually vest every quarter then the employee actually gets taxed and as the part of the conversion and you get taxed you have to sell a certain amount of stock to pay the tax liability because you're getting taxed out of pocket and you haven't really gotten any cash so whenever stocks that get vested I actually get converted well there's a tax event and these guys have to pay so they sell about half the stock to pay for the tax they keep that other half now I'm not saying that every single time this was happening but mostly 95 of the time every single sale and buy you see here the buy is most likely a conversion it's not real open market buy it's just a conversion of options and the sale is not a real open market sale it's just a sale for tax purposes of about half of the grand that's why you're seeing the Acquisitions versus the sales 15 to 10. now obviously it's not 100 but at the end of the day I would say about 10 of this is open market secondary Market 90 of this is just options activity and all these things are basically 10 B5 plans it means that all this selling activity and buying activity is pre-programmed into the activity of volunteer essentially if I get a grant for the next 10 years I pre-program for every single conversion that every single investing I pre-program a sale that's triggered upon the conversion so I can pay the taxes so none of this is actually people sitting in front of the computer screen saying oh I want to sell I want to dump my shares right now it's just absolutely normal so that's number one now there's also this debate about palantir whether you know palantir is absolutely deluding the shareholders it's been abusing retail investors and so forth and so forth now look I have to explain to you and again image is always more efficient these things than I am but let me show you something right here on the left hand side you see the amount of palliative shares and as you can see the shares that started at 600 and 600 million shares in 2020 now at 2.3 billion shares in 2023 so you might think that you know the share kind of volunteer you know quadruple in three years and that is technically true but again of course there's a Nuance here the first thing you have to notice here that it doubled twice and I'll show you why it doubled twice the first time it doubled it happened before the company even went public so the first jump from 640 million shares to almost a billion shares happened before palantir became a public company this company chose to go public by way of DPO direct public offering which means there's no big Banks involved there's no favoritism nepotism and all that good stuff there's no middlemen the company basically sold its shares directly from the employees from the executives from the directors anybody who had talented shares essentially made the market on day one of them going direct public offering now for that to happen the company literally had to do a split quasi-split so they increased the share count of the existing shareholders before the company went public from 600 million to 900 million in order to allow these employees and these insiders and whoever held volunteer shares to be able to make the market for the palantir shares so that's why when planetary went public they had a billion shares outstanding now the other thing here you have to understand is that in 2020 when this second gen happened it also happened for a reason the second jump was the expiration of the 10-year options plan so the executives in palantir they had a 10-year plan that they were granted in 2010 but eventually in 2020 it expired it expired and the company had to Grant a new plan for all these Executives and that Grant is essentially the second jump so the second jump from 900 billion so 900 million to 1.7 billion to 1.76 billion happened because of the secondary grant for the most part and other things like hiring a brand new sales force for the company which didn't really exist so imagine setting up a whole new division in your company that didn't really exist so as you can see the growth and the share count pretty much stopped once it had those two things since this point right here which is the end of all the housekeeping they had to do to they grow at a rate of nine percent per year so Planeteers diluting at nine percent per year now look you might say that's a lot you might say that that's too much but let's compare them to other companies and let's compare them on basis of you know as the percentage of revenues how much money is volunteer making versus how much stock based compensation is giving out and there's this wonderful chart I want to show right now it's it's done by my friend Amir so palantir is at 27 and this was an old an Old Chart ever since then palantir went down to 21 but look at other companies c3i is diluting at 63 percent a stock waste compensation as a percentage of Revenue so that means the amount of stock based comp they're giving out is two-thirds of the revenue snowflake is at 40 betadoc is a 22.8 servicenow is a 20 sales force ten percent now ever since that point Panther actually came down to 21 so they would be ranked below data dog and above servicenow between 19 and 22. So palantir based on his current dilution is not anything unusual compared to the other companies in its category the data dogs the snowflake the C3 AIS because at the end of the day this chart right here here in stock MVP shows you how much institutional shareholders are buying into palantir since it went public so this was 2020 this is currently right now so ever since it went public the share count went from 176 million to 815 million now at this point you might jump and say well Tom you know the share count also went from you know 640 million to 2.3 billion so that doesn't count in 2020 in Q3 2020 institutional shareholders held about 27 of palantir currently institutional shareholders just three years later are holding 36 percent of volunteer so palantir institutional shareholders increased their position in planetary by 31 in three years and that pace is has nothing to do with the delusion that's just a percentage so this has nothing to do with dilution institutional shareholders are buying into volunteer at a much faster Pace than the share count is increasing and even if you have arguments against the stock based compensation of volunteer the pilot is still the absolute king of Revenue per employee snowflake is generating 340 000 Revenue per employee c3i 380 000 a little bit better datadog 370 000 Salesforce 394 000 so you can see that companies operate with a range of 330 to 400 000 per employee of Revenue palantir with its stock base compensation is generating 520 520,000 per employee better than Salesforce better than the data dog better snowflake better 33i better than all these guys and to me it's quite clear that you know planetary is definitely allocating that stock based compensation correctly because they're literally they're having more Revenue per employee than their you know anybody you can compare them with look at the end of the day look at the numbers if institutional shareholders thought that penalty is dumping and it's uh it's abusing shareholders and it's a huge scheme by insiders to sell and dump would they have increased their holding in the company by almost five times in the past three years from 170 to 8 to 820 and of course you know I'm just saying even with the delusion it's a 31 increase in institutional shareholder over the past three years so all in all look there's obviously some you know factual incorrectness in these arguments but that's what they say you know you always the best way to create a lie is to mix in some truth with it so they take all this data that technically kind of makes sense and they wrap it around a nice little bow on top of of fud and inaccuracies so that way it sounds very reasonable because you look at the chart you see oh look at this all this Insider selling oh my God yeah yeah you're right no it's it's it's a lie mixed in with a little bit of Truth technically to make it sound a little bit better the the truth is in the numbers go a little bit deeper research for yourself find out what's actually going on don't let them fool you",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,2H1GgB7Oato,2023-08-24T19:06:54Z,Why I'm Buying SMCI Stock NOW (Over Nvidia),Nvidia,this notebook right here I have the one stock I'm buying over Nvidia right now but before we do that first of all we have to talk about the incredible earnings from Nvidia they blew everybody out of the water literally video game level earnings and not in that sense Revenue doubled the erroneated to 13.5 billion US Dollars higher than nvidia's own forecast and the market is all EPS 2.70 a share 429 year-on-year rise Frank and there are no signs of slowing the company forecasting for the September quarter revenue of 16 billion dollars blowing away estimates and representing if met at 170 year-on-year rise we're gonna review the numbers today we're gonna go over the business model and where Nvidia is headed and their very bright future and I'm going to explain to you why I'm not investing in the video right now despite the greatness of this company and I'm really a fan of what they're doing but at the end of the video I'll actually reveal to you which company I am investing right now for AI exposure and Nvidia exposure at a much better price with much more upside and no it's not AMD so relax over there the AMD Fanboys so Nvidia just beat earnings they beat Revenue David EPs and they got it for 16 billion dollars of Revenue in the next quarter with 250 percent increase in revenue from data centers now we're going to talk about data centers in a minute because that's the story in its own but they also announced 25 billion dollars of a buyback and at this point I think it's pretty safe to assume that Jason Hank is definitely up there with the top three CEOs in the market right now along with Elon Musk and probably Anthony nodo I know I'm gonna get a little hate for this but you know shout out to Anthony Auto you're in that list for me you're my top three CEO you know at the end of the day you have to look at CEOs with what they're working with what their roles do they have and how much championships they win you know Jensen hang is you know he has a top tier team Elon Musk has a top tier team Anthony Otto he took so far when it was hot trash and look what it's making it into so Anthony noro you're on my list now let's move on and by the way if you want to come on for an interview I'd love to have you now look let's dive a little bit deeper into the Nvidia numbers and then after that I'm going to reveal to you which stock I'm actually buying because I do want to show you how great the Nvidia numbers are but also where the chinks in the armor can be if you actually look a little bit deeper where the risks are and where the problems are now Nvidia numbers are some of the best we've seen recently revenue is up a hundred and one percent year over year but obviously data centers leading the charge I'll talk about that in a second we're going to do a deep dive into every single kpi of Nvidia the guidance out of this world they're getting for 16 billion dollars for the next quarter and that's absolutely insane because the estimates we're talking about 12 and a half billion that's a 30 increase in the guidance quarter of a quarter and a 20 increase from the already insane 13 and a half they did this quarter so the insanity of this is you know I can't put it better than Denise a friend of the channel and by the way I had an interview with him here in the channel go check it out then I said it the best jaw dropping demand so when we're talking about this jaw-dropping demand let's break it down because when you do break down these things into the kpis your head literally flies off how good this thing is look data center Revenue went from 2 billion in 2021 to 10.3 billion from q1 2021 to Q2 2023 to years up from 2 billion to 10.3 billion that's a 400 increase in two years now don't go two years back just go one quarterback core what I recorded they went from 4 billion to 10 billion that's 140 increase in revenues from data centers quarter over quarter so this jaw-dropping demand is definitely in the data center section not in the other stuff but hey the other stuff they do they actually are doing pretty well look the gaming sector actually suffered a little bit of a decline recently but it's bouncing back up it was a 2.8 billion in q1 of 2021 and it dropped all the way to 2 billion in Q2 of 2022 now it's bouncing back to two and a half billion so it's trending up it is down from the peak by 11 but it's up year over year by 25 so gaming is recovering it's not gonna be as huge as data centers but it is a major major impact on their financials now the professional visualization I can't say professional visualization I can't say it now in the professional visualization side absolutely insane q1 2021 370 million now here's the crazy part if you look at this number and you compare it to Q2 2023 they've only done 379 million so it's flat if you compare it to Q2 2021 but again there was a major drop they dropped massively to 200 million in Q3 2022 just nine months ago and now they're bounced back to 379 so the peak level they're up 90 on this sector within three quarters absolutely insane so all the trends are actually going up for NVIDIA not just data centers now a lot of people talk about the automotive side as their big next you know s-curve explosion implosion I don't know look at the end of the day it's still a minuscule amount of their business we're talking about 150 million out of you know 13 billion in Revenue so let's just pump the brakes on the Automotive side but the growth rate is actually impressive I'm not going to take this away from them they deserve their flowers in q1 2022 so in q1 2021 they had 154 million dollars in revenues from Automotive in Q2 2023 just two years later they're 253 so we're talking about 64 growth in two years it's not as crazy as the data centers but it is growing so you can't ignore this but it's still a tiny portion of the entire business right now if you're buying Nvidia you're buying it for the data center business everything else is just adjacent to this and as far as this increased jaw-dropping demand for the data center business where is it actually coming from well look the entire server world as we know is basically changing we're going from CPUs to gpus because of all this AI requirements now whether you're upgrading or building new ones you will have massive Capital expenditures changing your infrastructure to fit Ai and that's where Nvidia comes in because they have pretty much number one position in the market and the demand shows this nobody comes close but the problems here and we have to actually talk about the issues here is that it's not an infinite project and like palantir for example and I'm sorry to bring plant here back into The Fray because you didn't click this video to hear me talk about patent theater but palantir has pretty much an infinite demand as long as they provide these Services the companies at least in theory might need them forever with this project with the data center upgrade project or you know new builds we're talking about the massive total addressable Market of about one and a half trillion dollars it's a lot of money it's a lot of revenues but it's a finite project whether it takes two three four years at the end of the day it's gonna run out it's gonna dry out and that's something that you have to take into consideration this isn't a you know a start of a new 10-year cycle where these demands basically come back every year the other problem is there's gonna be a lot of competition where so much meat in the bone so much money in the market competition has to follow whether it's internal or external a lot of their clients probably going to start building their own because at these prices why not try and of course there's macro issues the economy can go to the toilet or a new working breakout geopolitical stuff and that obviously will hurt Nvidia because the demand for data centers it's not going to go as crazy if the economy is in the toilet you would agree with me here but still Nvidia is a terrific company with a bright future and the question here might be for you is if that's the case why am I not buying why I'm about to talk about a whole different company in about minute well number one they are a terrific company but the reason I'm not investing at this juncture is very very simple they're currently trading at 509 dollars per share that's implying an 85 growth every single year for the next five years I ran my DCF I reverse engineered this I use a 12 discount rate I'm getting 85 growth now look they might get it they might not it depends on how long this bull cycle continues with the upgrades of the data centers now to me their price right now as if that 85 growth is a lock I don't know that might take two or three years for the demand to dry out I don't know there's also obviously risk I mentioned geopolitical macro risks at this point Nvidia is priced for total Perfection for the next five years and I think there's other undervalued plays out there for you to invest in and myself of course this is not Financial advice doing research make your own decisions but I think for me there's better opportunities out there that a little bit more undervalued than misunderstood palantir being one but again this video is not about palantir,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,2H1GgB7Oato,2023-08-24T19:06:54Z,Why I'm Buying SMCI Stock NOW (Over Nvidia),Super Micro Computer,so I want to talk about a stock that's called super microcomputer smci now this company is currently trading 277 dollars per share they they are up 180 over the past six months yes I just said it they are up 180 over the past six months but they're still hella cheap hear me out before you laugh and make a decision I'm not just saying this I'll get to the numbers in a second now this company has massive Nvidia exposure because what they do is they build servers and they build servers with Nvidia components so whatever it is NVIDIA is doing whatever that Demand on the Nvidia side it's going to flow over to this company Supermarket computer is going to actually build the servers they have absolutely insanely good products companies love them they have a terrific relationship with Nvidia and they're pretty much the first to the market with all the newest Innovations coming out of Nvidia because of their insanely good relationship with the company now look at the end of the day let's look at the numbers I'm going to show right now even though they went up 180 over the past six months because of this Nvidia relationship and that Nvidia correlation which is there make no mistake about it they're still trading at 23 priced earnings 23pe my guy 23 not 230 like Nvidia 23pe they're only a 15 billion dollar cup company I know I just said only but compared to Nvidia 15 billion doesn't seem as much they're trading at twice price to sales two price to sales yes I just said it two 2x price to sales they have twice the assets and their liabilities they have more cash than debt 450 million of cash 290 of debt they have a nine percent net profit margin and that's a hardware company the revenue grew 37 of the past year and 113 of the past three years they have 80 of institutional shareholding their ebida grew 122 of the past year and 700 of the past three years and look at the efficiency their operating expenses while they just increase revenues by 37 only went up by 12 percent now they're also not capex heavy which is the part that blew my mind because at this point I'm expecting to see a lot of capital expenditures this is a hardware company there's massive capex their capex is currently 30 million per year 30 million per year for a company that generates seven billion dollars in revenues look Nvidia just gave you 13 billion in revenues and they're growing like crazy this company is generating 7 billion they're extreme expression they're you know built like a tank great margins great cash flow and they're trading at this be 23pe twice sales with all this relationship and correlation with Nvidia absolutely insane now I actually ran a DCF on this company and I assumed only 30 growth now nothing spectacular 30 growth at 12 discount rate I got a 450 per share price Target on a 30 growth imagine if Nvidia isn't bullshitting and Nvidia is actually going to fly up what do you think is going to happen to this company you don't think their demand is going to adapt like crazy because they're actually building the servers that Nvidia is building components for so these guys are going to fly up yes they're hyped but look at how cheap they're still trading it doesn't have to be a mutually exclusive Arrangement but look if you want to invest in this company you have to understand something very important it is a high top company smci is a hyped up company no company goes 180 in six months and it's not a hyped up company it is but there is a way to invest in high top companies without overpaying I literally made a video called how to invest in high top companies without overpaying showing you the entire system warning you from the pitfalls showing you how to do it I'm going to put it on the screen right now on the end screen go check it out right now and if you haven't yet make sure you subscribe to this Channel and if you have yet go to our patreon check it out and join our Academy there's final spots left before we go from 35 to 100 per month learn how to do a DCF learn how to become a better company evaluator join the academy try it out for 30 days for risk-free money back guaranteed I'll see you in the next video,1.0,0.85

Same thing for Tesla look his Tesla stuff is the same his average cost and test is 216 dollars way below what's currently trading even after the drop at 150 000 look look at his buys the buys it started when it was at 348 339 and he keep buying look as the stock drops he kept buying kept buying kept buying and he explains here about 400 a paycheck simple as that now this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works it works I'm not I'm not here to you know sell you a lie I mean this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works so what's the problem the problem is people don't have the discipline and unfortunately that's the biggest problem with this thing because they come late they haven't started buying these stocks when they were screaming it's undervalued at 2021 2022 when you were saying oh my God pilot here in Tesla so cheap at 100 a pop at seven dollars a pop they weren't buying then they were not in the community and they were basically sitting on the sidelines saying well you know it's too expensive I'm gonna wait until it drops more and then it flies up and now they're forming into the stock you know at twenty dollars a share for palantir and by the way there's the second flip side of that crowd the people who are like now sitting saying oh you know palantir is too expensive I'm gonna wait till it drops tests are so expensive I'm gonna wait till it drops more and then when it actually drops like we've seen you know planning to drop 30 percent their nuts become the size of a macadamia nut and they freeze up and like they they can't buy they freeze up because they get scared it's a lot easier to buy when the stock is running up it's really hard to buy the dip now I'm here to teach you a process not to tell you to buy into stocks not to tell you to buy to Hype or send it you know sell into a panic I'm just teaching you a process because I actually give a Frick about what happens to your money you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it I give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about what happens to my money I give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about you're retiring with the actual money that you can live on that's the whole story here. if you bet on Tesla 10 years ago you made 21 000 percent. I don't understand the complaints about Tesla and palantir dropping for 30 days I mean who cares. if you want to understand purely and accurately why I think Tesla and palantir is the next biggest thing you know and you want to understand the logic behind my absolute insane obsession with Tesla the video I'm gonna put right now on the end screen it's a video breaking down why Tesla is the next big absolute Bonanza project for you to invest in for the next 10 years if you got the patience I've set an interview I mean Tesla there's three certainties in life death taxes in Tesla if you have the patience to wait 10 years Tesla is going to absolutely knock it out of the park if you want to learn why I literally explained this in the video and it's a not long video like eight and nine minutes every single point that I love about this company all the stuff that I'm you know makes me passionate about it I'm gonna put it on the end screen right now go check out that video.,1.0,1.0
Tom Nash,bo134v1x16U,2023-08-18T14:29:02Z,The Tesla and Palantir Collapse Has Apparently Just Started,Palantir,Tom you told us that palantir is going to go to a trillion dollars the Tesla is going to be five trillion dollars and now the stocks are down for the past 30 days you've lied to us you misled us how dare you keep saying in your videos that palantir is a buy the Tesla is a buy at these price levels after what happened now look this video is not gonna get a lot of views I totally understand but check this out it ain't for the people who are here for the Casual stuff it's for my hardcore audience and this is probably one of the most important videos I'll ever make. I honestly believe it will but it's just here to tell you that the current valuation of volunteer is not 13 the market absolutely changed the economy change the macro change the interest this year and assuming they're going to grow at 35 which they're not currently it's a 10 stock so for me it's a very simple analysis I'm looking at this I'm saying well I haven't sold a single share I got in at 18 I stayed the course I bought more I'm not going to sell it in the next 10 years I don't care but if I have to analyze this and look at the share price currently objectively the share price right now with 13 dollars it's just way too high given the conditions the stock has to grow into its valuation now it might go to 20 30 40 on hype which it did already and it might not I don't know but if you want my honest opinion currently it should be valued around 10 bucks. Okay so you just heard it from the horse's mouth himself I literally told you three months ago that palantir should be valued at ten dollars as it pertains to its current valuation I've also explained that video why I think it's a trillion dollar company in the Long Haul why I'm investing but I clearly told you this is hype anything beyond ten dollars is hype just so you know it's literally on my page it's free it's not a patreon so you can't say I didn't warn you I literally told you this is going to happen now look uh I want to explain something here following into a stock when it's hyping like people did with palantir when they came late it's a bad idea no but the other flip side of it is even worse because the flip side of it might be that now you think the stock is going to zero you might sell everything or The Flip Flip Side of it might be well the stock just dropped 30 I'm going to load up the boat before it goes back up to 20 make a buttload of money every single approach I just described is a horrible idea and I don't want you to do that it's bad ideas do not do it slow DCA like we teach on our patreon every single day pickyour.com forward slash Tom Nash we teach you these things every day. Oh Captain Chuck this is his buys palantir he bought a 22 he bought at 15 he bought a 12. and he bought it 9. as you can see he went from buying eight shares to buying 300 shares as the stock dropped from 22 to 9. he was buying more when the share was dropping was DCA and was double down on his DCA as the share price was dropping and you know what happened it went from starting entry point of 22 dollars to an average cost of 8.73 this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] literally works it's as simple as that it just you know it takes a while look it takes a while it takes it takes two years it took him two years but he reduced his average from 22 to 8.7 and it's at 13 portfolio thirteen thousand dollar portfolio so yes it needs patience but it works. they haven't started buying these stocks when they were screaming it's undervalued at 2021 2022 when you were saying oh my God pilot here in Tesla so cheap at 100 a pop at seven dollars a pop they weren't buying then they were not in the community and they were basically sitting on the sidelines saying well you know it's too expensive I'm gonna wait until it drops more and then it flies up and now they're forming into the stock you know at twenty dollars a share for palantir and by the way there's the second flip side of that crowd the people who are like now sitting saying oh you know palantir is too expensive I'm gonna wait till it drops tests are so expensive I'm gonna wait till it drops more and then when it actually drops like we've seen you know planning to drop 30 percent their nuts become the size of a macadamia nut and they freeze up and like they they can't buy they freeze up because they get scared it's a lot easier to buy when the stock is running up it's really hard to buy the dip now I'm here to teach you a process not to tell you to buy into stocks not to tell you to buy to Hype or send it you know sell into a panic I'm just teaching you a process because I actually give a Frick about what happens to your money you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it I give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about what happens to my money I give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about you're retiring with the actual money that you can live on that's the whole story here.

Tom Nash,AMZCJtWXMds,2023-08-16T16:26:58Z,Tesla Stock Is F*cked,Tesla,Tesla is finished this is the end now that's what they want you to think now Tesla just announced that there are cutting prices in China again for the existing Model S and model X inventories the price cut is going to be about seven to eight thousand dollars a pop and there will be joining the new standing range for the model S and model X which will also be discounted now look this Sparks a whole new debate from the Cockroaches who hate Tesla the Bears and the little haters and of course over the next few days they will be on social media explaining to you how these price cuts are basically a sign that Tesla is finished it's over it's done it's kaput and how this proves that Tesla simply cannot compete with the industry and they're getting annihilated now look the share price is down 20 for the past month currently at 228 as of the making of this video and it seems like it might drop even further but here's the deal the news about the demise of Tesla are a little bit premature now let me clue you in on a little secret Tesla has no issues of competing with the industry and in my little notebook I prepared a few facts to go along with your theories about how Tesla is done now look Tesla is currently shorted at about 2.8 percent I just want to remind you that Tesla used to be the most shorted company in the market and a lot of people lost their pants and underwear and a little bit more shorting Tesla so at least the shorts have learned their lesson not to bet against Tesla and it's currently below three percent sure interest the stock price is kind of a thing that people talk about right now with Tesla because people constantly measure the fact that that it's up 115 year to date sure Tesla stock is up 115 year-to-date that is 100 correct but the thing is it's still down 25 on a 12-month basis so the stock is not even up yet it's still you know it's down 25 from the you know what it was a year ago now as far as Tesla being able to compete in the market which I found hilariously ridiculous that argument that test is dropping prices because they can't compete it's a little bit of a misunderstanding of what's going on here what Tesla is doing is they're suffocating the competition they've done it in the US now they're doing it in China the idea is you drop prices you Corner the market you create a pressure on your competitors by the way which none of can scale a vehicle at this price there's not a single EV in the market that is retailing at the price of Tesla and has similar margins there's no competitor byd included that has Tesla scalability compatibility and ability to charge these prices so you basically Corner in the market you're taking over market share you're killing a competition you're bringing in more revenues and since you have the best margins in the business you can afford it because the margins will drop look Tesla is currently operating on 18 EB down margin if you compare that to Ford with their measly eight percent and GM with their 10 percent I mean Tesla is really not in their league they're in the whole class of their own and may I just mention here that Tesla has better EB down margin than VW and Toyota as well The net income per employee which is an interesting statistic it's currently the hundred thousand dollars net income per employee a hundred thousand dollars it's five times higher than Ford The revenue growth is 40 it doesn't seem to me like they're struggling especially when Ford grew by 14 GM grew by 27 so it doesn't seem like they have a lot of trouble selling cars now it's true that they're trading at adpe which isn't cheap but look Tesla is never going to be a cheap stock why because the numbers are phenomenal they're the best in the business you always got to pay premium to get Michael Jordan to play on your team it's the same thing it's never going to be a cheap stock but adpe I'm going to make an argument here that it's not expensive compared to what you're getting and if you are a single person that cannot wrap your hand around this and you think that this is ridiculous and you should not buy something above 20pe just don't get the stock the same people who said that in 2013 just 10 years ago they missed out on 21 000 of appreciation in stock so here you go hey look Tesla has no problem competing their numbers are out of this world net income Tesla's net income in 2019 was negative 900 million dollars people forgot that part they had negative 900 negative billion pretty much just in 2019. they're currently at positive 12.2 billion dollars of net income cash and cash equivalent question cash equivalents and short-term Investments back in 2019 was six billion dollars currently at 23 billion long-term debt long-term debt doesn't have long-term debt of 10 billion dollars in 2019. currently at half a billion from 10 billion to half a billion 48 000 employees in 2019 currently 130 000 employees now it doesn't sound to me based on these very raw superficial numbers that Tesla is struggling in every sort of way of fashion it seems to me that they're doing just fine now look we haven't even said a word about the fact that Tesla is the only car company with an ecosystem we haven't even said the fact that cybertrack is going to be revolutionary it's going to change the market and it's going to put Tesla for the first time in the pickup truck category which is the best category in the US which they're not even competing in yet we haven't even said a word about the supercharger Network being a massive industry standard right now we haven't said a word about SAS the only company with the SAS software is a Surface income which is the full set of driving is Tesla that's 80 margin they have the most amount of miles they have the best system nobody comes close to them they'll have the best driver assist system in the market for decades and they will license it out which will bring more money as well as the supercharger Network it's going to bring more money it's a behemoth of a company not to mention the energy the mega pack not to mention the solars not to mention the robo taxi the robotics the AI AGI whatever I mean are we really going to have the stock the test is falling apart over a seven thousand dollar discount on Model S and X which they really don't sell yet even look at how much Model S and model X this company sold in the past year this uh really irrelevant numbers the money is in the model Y and model three model y by the way right now is the best selling car in the world so are we really going to talk here about discounts really we're talking about discounts.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,dP-JjzgBaTE,2023-08-15T15:22:46Z,MORE Tesla Price Cuts REVEALED,Tesla,hey this is Tom Nash and we got a huge bombshell coming out out of Elon Musk and Tesla today so Tesla just announced they're gonna be releasing the standard Range model S and model X and they're gonna be pricing those at ten thousand dollars cheaper versus the normal s and X now a lot of people are going to make some hoopla around this and I want to come on here and explain to you what this actually means without all this noise now look there's gonna be people saying that this proves that Tesla is losing demand they have to drop prices to get some sales etc etc the normal you know pavlovian response from all the Tesla Q crowd and all the haters and the Bears they're gonna come out swimming today basically saying oh this is proof that Tesla you know can't push the cars out Etc look the truth is very simple here number one the model S and the model X barely make it dent in Tesla's Automotive revenues the automotive revenues are mainly comprised by the model y mainly and the model 3. the S and the X are a bug on the windshield of Tesla they're not really money making um Revenue centers right now it's it's kind of an expensive premium product the money is in the model Y and the model 3. now obviously Tesla wants to get more sales from these cars and that's why they're making that push and I totally get where they're coming from so it's not going to take over the model y the model 3 it's still going to be a tiny percentage of their revenues but no why not take more money by lowering the price by ten thousand dollars now here's how I think this thing is going to be played out the share price is going to react negatively because people are going to make some hoopla around this but at the end of the day what's gonna happen with the company with the business forget the share price and the stock market in the posts on X formerly known as Twitter what's going to happen to the company well the company is going to sell more cars the company is going to sell more expensive cars that make more money more revenue for the company their revenue is going to grow the net income is going to grow demand is going to grow and the business is going to benefit from this so no matter how the short-sighted Traders are going to treat this which I couldn't care you know less about you know you have limited amounts of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in life and this is the least of my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now no matter what the short-term Traders are going to do about this this benefits the business greatly it's a smart move the company will make more money and eventually these fundamentals will be reflected in the share price which always happens with Tesla you know people distrust this they don't believe they can see it happening the noise is getting to them and then eventually the share price catches up with the fundamentals which are extremely strong so this is not a great move by Tesla again don't listen to all the hype and the noise as a long-term investor I think you should be focusing strictly on fundamentals and ignoring all this noise around the social networks Etc et cetera companies lowering prices by ten thousand dollars more sales more revenues God knows Tesla has the margins to do it look 10 years ago before the gym we're creating a hundred billion dollars Tesla was trading at four billion dollars 10 years later you know what the story is don't be a sucker don't let them fool you have a great day,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,ogYhe0Vwnc4,2023-08-13T15:54:53Z,Bad News,Tesla,look at Tesla Blue Chip stocks are now trading as if they were penny stocks because this Market is getting excessively volatile because of all the short sidedness now he's saying that and I'm hearing money I'm hearing opportunity to make a lot of money this is what this dude is saying between the lines listen to what he says because he's not saying that just because he's not bitter about the market this isn't the get off my loan Grandpa he's telling you that this is a money making opportunity and I'll explain in a second why because look if the market has become very extremely short-sighted you have two options option number one is Rampage yourself shoehorn yourself and basically Stampede to the point where everybody are playing that short-term game and play with everybody in the same little Arena or you can take advantage of this because when the market is extremely short-sighted which it is right now I completely agree with Seth clarman not that Seth freaking clarman needs my approval I mean come on but look when the market is so inefficient when the market is so short what's going on well that creates a lot of Arbitrage now the first thing they teach in business school now when I got my MBA that's the first little first thing they taught us is the Assumption of the perfect Market the market is perfect which means everybody has all the information at real time and all the stocks are priced perfectly all the time because all this information is immediately priced in that's a nice assumption for business school and thank you for my MBA Professor for that but that doesn't happen in real life if it was the real life we didn't have the stock market the way we know it today now Arbitrage exists opportunities exist specific individual companies get mispriced all the time the overall Market is kind of good at pricing overall what's going on but individual stocks get mispriced all the time Tesla is a great example that shows you how insanely undervalued stocks with so much open source information can be,1.0,0.5

Tom Nash,oyJRIaRGeMY,2023-08-11T12:38:08Z,We need to talk about Palantir,Palantir,hey this is Tom Nash and let's talk about the future of palantir and I'm gonna guarantee something here a lot of you are not gonna like to hear what I have to say about this company now look when then eyes the famous Wall Street analyst went on TV and he called palantir the Messi of AI everybody got excited overnight and if you were one of those people who bought a lot of volunteer shares on the frenzy out of fomo on the eve of their knives palantir slash Messi craziness then you deserve to get hammered because everybody who chased this stock and followed into it on that twenty dollar prize and went balls deep into the stock without understanding what they're doing they got destroyed by professional Traders and you know what they deserve that same fate every single time chasing following fear of missing out into stocks about understanding what you're doing is a bad idea buyers of 20 dollars per share palantir shares went absolutely horribly destroyed by professionals by Traders by people who knew what they're doing in just a matter of two days don't ever Chase stocks don't ever follow into stuff without understanding what you're doing now what happened with palantir why did it drop 20 in a matter of two days well first of all earnings were not bad earnings were actually in line with expectations but you know this stock still dipped quite heavy as you can see here on the screen so what happened well number one we had a lot of macro issues which I covered before in the previous video now palantir had solid second quarter earnings no doubt very exciting stuff about the AAP platform very interesting future facing potential mind-blowing stuff we heard from Alex team but there was never anything absolutely mind-blowing from a fundamental perspective on the numbers a very good balance sheet still stays intact with three billion dollars in cash no debt so where is the problem where's the disappointment well it's more on the narrative side well number one we had the share buyback announcement palantir comes out and said hey we're gonna buy back a billion dollar worth of shares and that's very exciting because palette is actually talking the language of the institutional shareholders which there's so much interested in attracting to the stock instead they got a lot of retail Traders opportunists speculators they want the steady solid institutional investors in the game so a share buyback is actually a good way of doing this the company buys back its own shares pays shareholders money and that also is a signal that the company thinks that the intrinsic value of shares is very low now obviously the criticism for volunteer here came from the point of look you guys could have done this at seven dollars per share you will be doing this now at 15 16 per share it makes no sense and people get upset about it but the fact of the matter is you have to understand that BuyBacks are a psychological move you want to transmit and project strength if you're doing BuyBacks when you share drop from 35 to 7 you're basically transmitting and communicating fear and panic you're trying to artificially inflate the share price when you're doing this coming off of a 180 swing year to date that's coming from a place of strength that's the right way to do it theoretically if you could have done it at seven dollars and actually still project strength and not weakness sure but there was no way to do it so I have no issues with what I done here now the company also mentioned multiple times the S P 500 probable inclusion at the end of the year when they actually hit four you know consecutive quarters of Gap of stability palantir meets all the conditions for the inclusion except that four quarters of consecutive profitability on the generally accepted accounting principles now obviously they've mentioned this multiple times and a lot of criticism from investors that said look why are you hyping this up and I never understood that criticism because this is a huge deal I also never understood the part where these guys were complaining last year that time of year was not speaking the language of Wall Street and was not speaking the language of institutional investors and now that they're doing this and they're talking about the inclusion they get criticized for it it's actually very funny to me now there was also lots of criticism for the growth of the company and the net or retention so the business if you segmented grew 15 on the government side 10 on the commercial side combined 13 and there was 110 net dollar retention which is a decline what you have to understand is comparing the snowflake retention to planetary intention is not a good comparison because snowflake is selling kind of a low tier item more in the consumption side palantir is selling a high ticket item it's a very different business but also the strategy here it plays a huge role pollen theater has completely shifted its strategy of the past two years basically going from a place of trying to grab as much as they can into this Trojan Horse kind of pricing model you get in you're under price underperformed you lost leader your way into a business but then when your product becomes sticky enough you raise the prices and actually generate cash flow revenues and profits I mean that's currently misunderstood by the markets but it will be understood when they see the reveal when that aha moment happens in three four five years whenever palantir does that pivot but again Wall Street Media and CNBC and all the Talking Heads they're not going to get it until they see it clearly in the financials which will take three to five years and by that time probably is going to be trading at a lot higher multiples and that's why they will miss the boat on this and that's okay they always do but look if you want a hint at how quickly palantir is growing behind the scenes look at the customer account customer count went up by 30 eight percent year over year this quarter that's not something you see every day customer accounts going by almost 40 percent now another issue that we have to talk about that kind of puts a damper on the palantir numbers is the stock based compensation the options the rsus that they're giving out to employees now look this is another case where retail investors have done a much better job than institutional investors at analyzing what's actually going on here you see if you look at Stockbridge compensation for palantir as a percentage of Revenue what you learn is something very interesting you learned that the stockist compensation palantir in Q4 of 2020 three years ago was 75 so 75 percent of revenues went to stock base comp currently this quarter where 21.4 according to Emir M my friend from Twitter I want you guys to go and follow him he does one of the best charts of palantir in fact I once saw his chart and I thought it was an official palantir chart it was that good so he shows this beautiful chart how Starbucks comp is coming down every single quarter for the past two years every single quarter it's coming down it's currently at 21.4 percent now the thing is that 21.4 is literally on par with the rest of the industry so there's no complaint currently to the stock based on compensation of a sorry component of palantir so that's all news that's kind of a rehashed regurgitated argument now it doesn't really make a lot of sense that 21 of Revenue is absolutely normal now there's another complaint here about client concentration look the top 20 clients of palantir Drive have their business about a billion dollars the other 400 clients are responsible for the other billion so it's a valid point when all of your business is concentrated in the hands of a few clients that's risky I get it it's a valid point but you have to understand that the percentage of overall Revenue actually went down so the top 20 clients gave you about 470 million dollars in 2020. they currently give you a billion but they're currently 51 of revenues back in 2020 they were 61 percent so you see this thing where the revenue for the top 10 clients keeps climbing from 470 million to 1 billion within three years but the percentage of Revenue is actually going down from 61 to 51 again this beautiful chart is from mrm go follow him on Twitter so stock based comp is one thing that's regurgitated Clan concentration is a valid point but look they are getting better at this and also not every company can drive one billion dollars from 20 clients it's proof that their largest clients are spending more and more every year in three years they went from 500 to a billion so they've doubled this spend for the top clients that means that the products and the services are sticky they're spending more every every year it's not a huge issue if the trend line is going up it's a major growth Catalyst for the company now rpos is another thing where Planet D also gets hammered it's remaining performance obligations it went flat sure it was 550 million in Q3 last year it's currently 560 million so it's pretty much flat and you know but another thing that gets missed here look at the trend that we had 370 million in rpos in Q4 of 2022 so we went from 370 million in Q4 2022 to 560 million right now look it's a huge hint about where the future growth of the company is going to be at so as RPO is starting to Trend upwards again and yes sure they're not trading up in a huge base but they are trying to reverse the course from 370 to 560 million that's a good sign as far as the future Revenue growth now look can palantir potentially fall even lower yes it can it's possible can they drop to seven dollars per share I would say probably not okay they drop to 13 per share definitely so just award the warning here the same people who were forming into the stock at twenty dollars buying it blindly like crazy are going to be punished if they try to catch this now catching a falling knife and forming into a hype stock is two sides of a horrible act that you should never do as a long-term investor I don't know how low palantir can go in these circumstances I'm trying to catch it now to make a quick swing it's not a good idea now look palantir has been my biggest position for years since 2020 and it's not going to change unless something dramatic happens about this company that changes my thesis absolutely completely right I look at the company and I see strong financials strong foundations balance sheet clean as a whistle three billion in cash no debt I see gap profitability for three quarters going on four I see 80 gross margin I see double-digit growth in a horrible year where companies were busy spending less not spending more I see AI segment being dominated by palantir again something that's completely missed by mainstream media I see a massive government business that's going to drive dollars to palantir every economy not only that it's going to prove the concept to commercial clients and it creates a huge Network for volunteer for influence on cloud I see a sticker business look at their top 20 clients they went from spending 470 million to over 1 billion in just three years I see Pioneer quasi monopolizing this whole Foundry business and Gotham and not even to mention AIP so I see palantir as a company in Pre growth jump so basically what I see is that penalty hasn't done its growth jump yet it's not even there yet it's kind of ramping up amping up and that means that the road ahead until that jump happens it's going to be very treacherous and very painful and you know look at this stock it's up 140 percentage still even after that 20 correction with the exception of snowflake it's still expensive very expensive compared to the segment it still has very low institutional shareholding with 35 percent uh BuyBacks is a step Direction s p file inclusion is another but there's still long ways to go to 60 institutional shareholding macro is still very shaky Moody's predicting a recession who knows there's lots of Traders in this stock guys lots of speculators lots of short-term money that's going to punish you if you try to play their game their game is short your game has to be long but there's good news and the good news are is that every single bear of palantir says same goddamn thing I believe in the long-term business long-term story of palantir as a leader in AI I just don't like the share price so there's not a single bear out there that's saying that Talent here is a bad business that's saying apparently there isn't going to dominate all of them are saying penalty is a great business it's just trading at a higher multiple than I like that means that the long term of this company is very very bright it has a bright future so long-term investors in volunteer will be rewarded short-term investors that flip the switch and try to trade it are going to be punished so the way to do it and you know I'm gonna sound like a broken record now the way they do it correctly is by basically going out and buying a little bit of shares every single week every single month every single quarter whatever suits you and buy it at a very slow pace because you get three to five years to invest in the stock there's no rush just buy it a little bit every week and when it goes up you buy a little bit less when it goes down and it dips 20 two days you buy a little bit more it's very very simple shout out to the palantir community these are the true long-term investors and those of you who got punished short-term trading the stock I hope you don't listen I'll see you in the next video have a great weekend,1.0,0.75
Tom Nash,oyJRIaRGeMY,2023-08-11T12:38:08Z,We need to talk about Palantir,Moody's,Moody's the credit rating agency came out and said well we're looking forward to a recession in 2024 and that had to be priced in but that wasn't the sole factor that drove the share price down obviously there was a little bit of disappointment from the earnings,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,oyJRIaRGeMY,2023-08-11T12:38:08Z,We need to talk about Palantir,Snowflake,Now if you look at snowflake they're operating at 180 net door retention absolutely insanely better than palantir now what you have to understand is comparing the snowflake retention to planetary intention is not a good comparison because snowflake is selling kind of a low tier item more in the consumption side palantir is selling a high ticket item it's a very different business but also the strategy here it plays a huge role now it doesn't really make a lot of sense that 21 of Revenue is absolutely normal look at snowflake look at others,1.0,0.0
Tom Nash,FFvoj7KK02M,2023-08-10T20:54:32Z,Dan Ives Joins Tom Nash To Discuss Palantir's Future,Palantir,I have to ask you a question you've done this very famous interview where you said that Palantir's you know the the messy of AI did you expect that it will blow up the way it did on social media and like all this all this attention and everything did you know it's gonna this this tsunami of attention is Gonna Come or was it just another day at the office for you yeah I didn't I mean like I didn't expect that it was going to be that type of sort of impact I look I I just I'd say the thing that actually surprised me the most institutional just how heated Palantir is oh yeah you know from from an Institutional perspective and I think that continues to be a narrative right and look I mean time as you I think as ambassador of Nomi for 23 years I don't call stocks just for the next week or two for into earnings I mean we kind of we go for the themes the winners and ultimately we we really pound the table on them and that's how we've done with Microsoft and Apple and Tesla and you know Amazon and others and in my opinion Palantir is it's an Undiscovered gem from an AI perspective do you is there anything you think Palantir can do to change that narrative because you mentioned this correctly and I'm going to show people how bad it is right now um The Narrative is very very uh negatively skewed with Palantir and if you guys every all the viewers you take a look at this thing this is stock MVP by the way this is a platform I built I'm going to plug it here in the Stream but if you look at sucking VP you look at percentage of institutional shareholding obviously it's going up but it said 34 I mean it's super low for a company with you know half of its business coming from the government and that type of company you would expect to see way more think back and Tesla but do which is go back six seven years for Tesla institutional wouldn't touch it right retail is well ahead institutional and ultimately institutional then really start to better understand the story and obviously the rest is history is must built everything out and you know in my opinion with with Palantir this is not for the next day for the next week for the next month for them it it's them leveraging their success from government to Enterprise I think it's the best Pure Play AI platform out there I think AIP is a game changer I I think that's really necessarily say like a model 3 Model y times it would Tesla but in other words I think that's what's really going to put them on the map and when you look at how big the opportunity is around AI and I I view them as like we could talk about Nvidia and Microsoft Google but when you you on both hands you can name what I'll call like the first second derivative AI players I mean Palantir is there well I'm not gonna argue with that with you because we've been you know people who follow Palantir the first time I heard machine learning was in the Palantir presentation back in the day before I even knew what it meant and then we saw we saw it kind of become this gold standard but um I wanna I wanna ask you a little bit of a tougher question that doesn't get asked a lot oh and just one one thing just one thing before you could you just answer your question like could they do anything better I actually think they I think Karp and the team are starting from uh you know from conferences to getting out there yep um I I do believe there they're doing some of the right things and I think those are just block and tackling things that maybe they wouldn't have done a few years ago now they are doing so you think one of the things that drove that that announcement that they're gonna be buying back a billion dollars of shares is an attempt to talk that language of Wall Street to get institutions more interested or was it more of an uh kind of a retail play I I mean I think that's just a prudent move I mean if I look from Apple to Microsoft to Google I mean a company like Palantir given where I believe they could be from a cash flow generation did a direct listing right not an IPO I I think that's a prudent move that's something they're not doing that just to scare the short I think that's just from a capital allocation strategy that's something that they needed to put in the table so just as an Institutional Investor if you're talking a Palantir one of the top questions would be do you have a buyback all the time and he doesn't have a good answer yet different as you know well for a number of different reasons with Palantir I think that was like made a ton of sense and it goes back to like you know a lot of times and of course I'm sure and I love like the engagement on social media just to see it a lot of times like when stocks sell off after quarters you know everyone's like oh it's over done it's over it's finished yeah it's finished enjoy the whatever you enjoy the pump the knit I mean when you when I'm looking at names like this I'm looking memes like a Palantir for the next two three four five years exactly we and I gotta I gotta be honest with you you you're probably the most engaged uh Wall Street analyst on Twitter I can't think of anybody else except Gary Black who's very engaged with the Tesla Community one from macro Tom Tom Lee is very engaged you know from a macro perspective yeah I just did a video covering one of his predictions uh he's a superstar I like him a lot dude he's yeah he's the go like if he he's the definition of the good well he called The Bull Run of the first half of the year and nobody saw it coming at least like in our community nobody talked about the Bull Run um but yeah so I was saying you're super engaged in the in the community that's uh so weird to see because I learn a lot really I I work I learned a time I mean to me it's I like engage first of all it's like look I've done I've done this job going 23 years okay covering tech stocks going back to like you know late 90s institutional that's what I've always done retail has just become more and more important in terms of I I think not just in terms of like the market but I mean like I've talked about Palantir retail discovered ahead and institutional that's that's a fact I write I know that there's no dispute there and I do you think that that game changed in the pandemic pandemic switched the kind of the the script a little bit where you know when I was when I was uh working in the industry in the 2010 there it was all about institutional money driving the markets and retails just jumping on the ride and now I hear like institutional investors trying to figure out what Rito is going to do and they're kind of game yeah but but time it's like I mean just like I mean obviously like within the Palantir community there's you know yourself amid there's a number of other in Castle Community you know I mean local Gary Blackstone right like yeah you just think about as he's built it um you know look look what Troy's done like all I'm just trying to say is that to ignore it would be I I think would actually be like a super negative for that individual because I think you need eyes open and I actually like I and I think a lot of things from feedback we see on Twitter to things getting discovered I think you learn a lot from engaging that's at least that look that that's always been my DNA um do you think there's a in the case of Palantir um what like the BuyBacks uh you you think it's a smart play I tend to agree with you not that you know it's not I'm not interviewing myself here but the way I see it is somebody who's obsessed with this company um look Palantir isn't building factories they don't need a whole lot of capex it's a scalable product they're writing code so if you if you Palantir and you're sitting on three billion dollars of cash and you have virtually no debt uh it's a smart move and people ask me well why wouldn't they do that earlier when the stock price was at seven because it would have seemed desperate and would have signed the wrong message I mean you can't do it in weakness you have to do a group position but coming off of that what do you think Palantir can do better to attract more institutional investors in the future beyond the BuyBacks the biggest push but so let's walk through like the biggest pushbacks from from an ambassador perspective on Palantir it's queer evaluation right and evaluation as I've always talked about like if you try to put transformational growth names in a box and look at PE over the next year you would have missed Netflix Tesla and Microsoft Apple Amazon in other words I I just I believe transformational growth themes you can't look at them when you're out you got to look out on a normalized Model what the company is going to look like three five seven years now and then whether it's DCF or however you want to sort of value that I think that's what you got to do now the second big pushback is just okay you're talking about this messy of AI but they're growing 13 percent where what am I missing that's look that's what that's legit right like as a as a pushback so there's a question it's a good question no but but to that point my pushback to that is the accelerating growth story is is ahead of it in other words and it reminds me a lot like I could go up to instances for Tesla from Microsoft for Apple for Google where there were times where growth at the time didn't make sense relative to the opportunity but it came that's that's my view like that you're gonna have an accelerating growth story as we go into 24 25 26 and that's why I look like I've talked about AIP I got in my opinion that's what I've used sort of the the Holy Grail the game well it's the whole but but it's the Holy Grail because purling into Enterprise we could talk about Nvidia GPU chips yep and Cloud platforms all I want Microsoft Google where are the use cases I mean from a use case perspective I believe from a platform like that they're one of the first calls now that you're gonna get I get all the you know some of the negatives at least how it's viewed you know from a government perspective but those are the best reference customers the three letter agencies you'll ever have uh and by the way um I absolutely love your shirt your your Fashion Icon over another Community with your suits and the shirts I just want to mention to people you're on vacation so it's a the attire suits the the event um thank you um I love I love that choice um person makes it makes it fun because also it comes down to like it's always been and it's the way I go to meet it like go to meetings like if people see me in an airport or in the street but the point is I do because also it's like it's my personality it's fun I get it some people don't but it's just like and also I think it speaks to like it speaks to just my view of like you know I view things differently I'm not saying I'm right there's people I'm watching this be like dude everything that guy says I hate or disagree with that stuff I've been on YouTube for for five years I I know exactly what you mean I mean whenever you're gonna go out and say something in the public there's going to be an inherent percentage of people going to think you're a douchebag just by talking I mean it's normal but no but but the point is I I have a I have certain thesis on names we do a ton of work in terms of like talking to I.T talking to the channel talking to customers and then we pick our winners right like in other words like and that's how like our formula that's how we've done it whether it's cyber security Cloud we have a lot of cool names in cyber security you've covered a lot of Palo Alto networks uh Varonis I think like a lot of really cool names yeah at Fortinet I think fortunate you went early like a lot of these names like look nobody people forget but because like people have shorten their memory in 2018 nobody wanted to touch Tesla does the Tim Cook wouldn't take a meeting with Elon Musk I mean you're coming in with that buy rating that early people kind of forget I I want to come back to Palantir in a second I just want to touch on Tesla a little bit if you already kind of mentioned Tesla here because you are one of the OGs on the Tesla scene so you have a price target of 350 for Tesla in the Tesla bull community that's considered low I was interviewed by one of their main head bulls and my 1400 price target was considered embarrassing for them they were like oh that's too low but but um look I am I I I want to ask you something about Tesla as somebody who came in early when was that moment for you when you knew like Tesla was something special that Eureka moment for you when it happened to me it was it was really probably into that in probably 2018 it was being at one of their events for one of their introductions I forget what exactly what and and obviously the Cybertruck and the glass broke incident and I think it remind it's the only company that's ever reminded me and it's my view of Musk of like the 2007 movement when when Jobs released the iPhone and just seeing you store like do Euphoria there and I think that's something that you can find in a spreadsheet you can find when you're in office building and look like whatever three million miles Saloon like the point is like like we've traveled a lot but a lot of is like that's where we see things that maybe others don't right uh I and the thing about like what um I'm really envious of Tesla like Tesla and Palantir are two of the most I think misunderstood companies in the market but for Tesla the journey to that to fill that Gap from misunderstood to uh to Brilliance in the eyes of the investors simpler because there's a product there's a tangible product you can go and experience and you can benchmark it against a premium four-door sedan and then you have the Eureka moment so we I was just out on vacation and the buddy of mine was driving so totally earlier flying the Model Y and I was driving an E-class and Mercedes E-class and I can tell you his car was hands down better experience in every possible way so that benchmark makes it really easy with the company like it's a bit different because the it's a B2B uh category so it's hard to touch and feel you know it's not like Tesla an actual Palantir if I go if I go back like year like years ago you know I have strong strong roots relationships like you know within DC within you know a lot of individuals that formerly were in the military you know with special forces stuff like that and you know there's a lot of these people come out and they and they and they start companies they want to get funding right I think I've helped I've helped many of them over the decades right introducing them to people you know whether they're 8200 MI6 you know because and and what I've learned especially in that community like the the view of Palantir Within the defense community within military um Stella and look and I just keep coming down to like if Tom or Dan Tom Nash fan is a is a CIO of an Enterprise looking to build out AI solutions over the next year talk look me in the eye and tell me how they're not front and center in that engagement yeah so what do you think of like I agree with you here and it's kind of funny to see that happen I was I had you on the show a year ago and the year ago we were talking all about Tesla and then you said hey it's too I we didn't really talk about Palantir back in those days a year ago I was making videos and I was saying look Palantir is facing kind of this political um headwind in a sense uh they don't really have a competitor in the market per se but what's happening is like a lot of these CIOs they have their own kind of Frankenstein product set up which cost a ton of money to these companies and they're really embarrassed or apprehensive about bringing an extended solution after they spend so much money they don't want to look bad so they're basically blocking Palantir from getting in through the door it's kind of surprising how Enterprise software in America is more political than even the government In America which is kind of funny but I said look at the end of the day they're going to break through because there will be a few smart CIOs who will understand the value of this they'll utilize it they'll beat the competition then it's going to be even worse if you don't use it than just to embrace yourself I bring them on and then you're gonna like Palantir is gonna be getting phone calls hey come over show us what you got which is exactly what Sham and and Alex were talking about the conference call and who comes down to shots on goal like yep just anything that's what you're seeing with the hundred customers the 300 you know potential in the pipeline that that that ultimately where this is and that's why look I when I call stocks I just I don't call them for uh you know preview review okay this is what happened earnings this I view it as like far stood the trees disruptive Tech and it goes back to Tesla right like Tesla many continue they viewed as an auto company that's out to trade I've always viewed it simmers Apple disruptive Tech it's such a crazy misunderstanding of what they do I mean you can categorize them in a lot of ways and you cannot like the stock and it's okay you can say Well they're expensive or there's a lot of uncertainty that's fine but to say it's an auto company given what they've shown us so far uh just just on the energy side forget Robo taxi forget the robotics just on the energy side Mega packs are an industry Stranded by this point well that's why I think you know and and there's a whole another conversation but by the way you have a comment here from somebody from my community who is actually an ex ex-military and he's saying that's from first hand knowledge great uh so there's just a whole new point from earlier I heard it a hundred thousand times no but but it goes back but but I like even like when it comes like cyber security part of our calls if I just go back on like Palo Alto those Zscaler or yep you know CrowdStrike or whatever it comes down to like what do I team managers think what do Channel people think is it good is it great is it a wheat simple as that by the way what are your thoughts on Alex Karp he's been getting a lot of heat lately now as as Palantir is moving in into the you know business software Enterprise Corporate America unless in the government side people are calling oh he's not technical enough he's not a software engineer et cetera he's lacking the skills he's getting a lot of heat from the community like about not being technical enough what do you think about that I think he's like I put him in that category of like Visionaries that he has a vision he's built it maybe it's it's obviously been bumpy to get to this path but now I think there's like a golden path ahead and I think he's he's a vision it goes like I always say like there's some they play chess I'll just play checkers like he plays chess I think for me that again not to interview myself to me it's a very simple Story number one Peter Thiel just gave him another billion dollars in future comp for the next 10 years Peter Thiel is no idiot you cannot you know you cannot deny that Peter Thiel is he knows what he's doing so if Peter Thiel gave this dude a billion dollars for the next 10 years I think he did a good job um this guy delivers you know a TTM pays of 2.2 billion this year so he's gonna make 2.2 billion this year he's growing customers by 40 he's still growing in double digits in times where businesses are looking to cut spending not to increase spending people forget that about 2023. he's the living terrific results his his is absolutely killing it okay so he's not a classic yeah but also you have and then the other thing well first of the classic CEO if you look at the elite the special the Hall of Famers they're not you can't put them in a box you can't put an Adele in a box cook you can't like in other words you can't put Musk in a box or some are better talking that language like Jensen is good at it and but Jensen is so far is really good at talking that talk yeah but I wouldn't exactly exactly like Jensen is doing the difference the point is that is like extremely extremely rare I mean you're talking once every 25 years Jack well sure that that you have someone that like is an executor and can talk but I'm just saying like a lot of times you can't put them in a box but the other thing just just to like to round it out is like when when you also look at it is the biggest transformation intact since the internet AI you gotta make your back and it was like who which horses you're gonna bat yeah okay I'll bet I'll bet Nvidia I bet Microsoft I bet Snowflake you bet MongoDB the point is we're not talking a hundred companies and and I think one just one thing just like for anyone watching you know if you look like a lot of these tech stocks post earnings they've sold off you know people will talk about Microsoft saying it's it's gonna be a slower Ram that that's no one ever expected the Nvidia guidance heard around the world was going to be replicated across so these are knee-jerk type reactions you're talking about a trillion dollars of incremental spent over the next decade I think in the video as an outlier and it's very hard to judge everybody else based on the outlier short-term reaction in the stock price um again you mentioned Jensen is an outlier Nvidia is an outlier their terrific company no no disrespect to them I mean but you know companies don't behave like that but no but it's also the way it browser is the way that overnight when you're the only you're the only game in town that sells GPUs yeah and and obviously the way that we can like when I was a kid and video was a gaming company who would have thought that that you know the dude really like took him to a whole new Stratosphere I mean Microsoft was just the windows yeah PC mature company Kill Nadella Name by the way Microsoft is another great under undervalued AI play which which gets ignored a lot I mean that's been our in our opinion like we've talked about it's been our your top pick here and I think that was just another example like there's no way Microsoft should be worth 500 billion that is ridiculous it's worth a trillion trillion and a half what do you look the point is the bears will sit there in their right lane looking for Black Swan events every weekend some and the reality is is that soft landings occurred feds waving the white flag and it's a risk on in our opinion for attack um the thing about it is I always kind of feel like it sometimes people talk in different wavelengths like especially on Twitter which is a very opinionated platform as you know you have this very audible vocal aggressive discussions and sometimes I look at this guys you're talking about Aaron oranges and apples I mean you're a long-term investor you're a Trader you completely different realms and I think Palantir and similar companies like Tesla for a while there they were really judged based on you know oh what's the share price this year and instead of looking a little bit more kind of a and I do think that that those things happen right I go at times like you come in we have a great quarter great guidance stock sells off the narrative it's done it was but but I mean I could I could point to hundreds of examples of companies where then all of a sudden market further digests what's happening three six months from now fundamentals always win the fundamentals always beat narrative it it just how how long it takes is it's a question of well I can argue Palantir is really it's really going to be as some of the park story because what's going to happen is you you're gonna have give me a value for that you're gonna have the cash and then what's the value of AIP what's the value of that platform which because I can argue the value of that piece is extremely higher than maybe the rat you didn't and I think those are maybe some of the ways I think investors are gonna start to look at some of these names similar some of the parts as we've looked at you know Apple Amazon and others are you concerned by their customer concentration issues because that's been brought up a lot as a negative because like top top 20 clients are half their business if you work in the Beltway with the 202 area code customer concentration is like getting a cup of coffee at 8am like that's just by the way there if you actually look deeper in the numbers um the percentage like as the customer spend grows per the top 20 clients and it grows every quarter by the way they're now at a billion a year of spend per top 20 clients that number was 470 million in 2020. so as that number doubled the percentage from the entire revenue pie has gone down from 60 to 50 percent so it's the client is coming down as they're growing well and then as Enterprise it would just get more and more diverse I actually think look I think like something that like I've talked to a few investors about but I think what's going to be like a huge topic is going to be what is the federal fiscal year quarter look like what types of deals are we starting to see on defense AI driven within government within civilian agencies I think that's going to be that's going to be a little kind of breadcrumbs to to maybe what's on the horizon 24.25 so is that is there anything like no I'm sure there is but what would be like the the one thing if it comes down the pipeline you would change your mind about the company So currently you know one of the biggest bulls from the from the Wall Street community not a lot of people give it 25 per share so what what's what's the red flag that's gonna freak you out to say no no I'm out oh yeah I mean red flag things would be if Enterprise success so let's walk through like the risk yeah you know not able to monetize AIP at a level that you expected over the next 12 18 24 months two would be Palantir defense success 202 area code to Enterprise every second third would be okay like I'm going like macro Black Swan like budges get cut AI gets pushed out I look like when you look at those like I'm not saying like there's bumps in the road and there's risk in there but I look my my whole career I've always viewed it like what are the key themes you want to bet on pick your winners and then individually based on whatever you're really you know you pick your spots but that's how it's been a pretty simple formula how I've kind of covered names Palantir I just viewers like you have an AI basket they're like they're deep in that basket as one of those plays and I just don't think that you can just put and say my view is like okay if there's a trillion dollars of incremental spend 800 billion conservatively you're telling me this can't be a 50 billion dollar Mark cap in you know where would I view that you ultimately could have revenues at doubles next three four years so that's sort of but but those are the ways that you have to look at names like this you cannot put them in a box and just say typical stocks traded x times PE 19 times I feel like that's how you've missed every transformational growth in the last 20 years well that's the problem with value investors they tend to miss out on this on the Teslas and the in the Palantirs and the in the Nvidias even the Nvidia was expensive still is expensive I mean as a violent investor like once you go to PE ratios price to sales ratios it's very hard to to make a call like that,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,FFvoj7KK02M,2023-08-10T20:54:32Z,Dan Ives Joins Tom Nash To Discuss Palantir's Future,Tesla,I mean it's not surprising for the guy who called Tesla early and we'll talk about that I mean you can actually scroll down here and see that I think you got into Tesla in 2018 I think right and which was super early let me show people and I have this Tesla thing pulled up right here so I think this was it right so stock was at what because that was yeah again aggressive yeah 20 22 so you got it so you called Tesla early and you've been in a ton of great stocks and uh I have to ask you a question you've done this very famous interview where you said that Palantir is you know the the messy of AI did you expect that it will blow up the way it did on social media and like all this all this attention and everything did you know it's gonna this this tsunami of attention is Gonna Come or was it just another day at the office for you yeah I didn't I mean like I didn't expect that it was going to be that type of sort of impact I look I I just I'd say the thing that actually surprised me the most institutional just how heated Palantir is oh yeah you know from from an Institutional perspective and I think that continues to be a narrative right and look I mean time as you I think as ambassador of Nomi for 23 years I don't call stocks just for the next week or two for into earnings I mean we kind of we go for the themes the winners and ultimately we we really pound the table on them and that's how we've done with Microsoft and Apple and Tesla and you know Amazon and others and in my opinion Palantir is it's an Undiscovered gem from an AI perspective do you is there anything you think Palantir can do to change that narrative because you mentioned this correctly and I'm going to show people how bad it is right now um The Narrative is very very uh negatively skewed with Palantir and if you guys every all the viewers you take a look at this thing this is stock MVP by the way this is a platform I built I'm going to plug it here in the Stream but if you look at sucking VP you look at percentage of institutional shareholding obviously it's going up but it said 34 I mean it's super low for a company with you know half of its business coming from the government and that type of company you would expect to see way more think back and Tesla but do which is go back six seven years for Tesla institutional wouldn't touch it right retail is well ahead institutional and ultimately institutional then really start to better understand the story and obviously the rest is history is must built everything out and you know in my opinion with with Palantir this is not for the next day for the next week for the next month for them it it's them leveraging their success from government to Enterprise I think it's the best Pure Play AI platform out there I think AIP is a game changer I I think that's really necessarily say like a model 3 Model y times it would Tesla but in other words I think that's what's really going to put them on the map and when you look at how big the opportunity is around AI and I I view them as like we could talk about Nvidia and Microsoft Google but when you you on both hands you can name what I'll call like the first second derivative AI players I mean Palantir is there well I'm not gonna argue with that with you because we've been you know people who follow Palantir the first time I heard machine learning was in the Palantir presentation back in the day before I even knew what it meant and then we saw we saw it kind of become this gold standard but um I wanna I wanna ask you a little bit of a tougher question that doesn't get asked a lot oh and just one one thing just one thing before you could you just answer your question like could they do anything better I actually think they I think Karp and the team are starting from uh you know from conferences to getting out there yep um I I do believe there they're doing some of the right things and I think those are just block and tackling things that maybe they wouldn't have done a few years ago now they are doing so you think one of the things that drove that that announcement that they're gonna be buying back a billion dollars of shares is an attempt to talk that language of Wall Street to get institutions more interested or was it more of an uh kind of a retail play I I mean I think that's just a prudent move I mean if I look from Apple to Microsoft to Google I mean a company like Palantir given where I believe they could be from a cash flow generation did a direct listing right not an IPO I I think that's a prudent move that's something they're not doing that just to scare the short I think that's just from a capital allocation strategy that's something that they needed to put in the table so just as an Institutional Investor if you're talking a Palantir one of the top questions would be do you have a buyback all the time and he doesn't have a good answer yet different as you know well for a number of different reasons with Palantir I think that was like made a ton of sense and it goes back to like you know a lot of times and of course I'm sure and I love like the engagement on social media just to see it a lot of times like when stocks sell off after quarters you know everyone's like oh it's over done it's over it's finished yeah it's finished enjoy the whatever you enjoy the pump the knit I mean when you when I'm looking at names like this I'm looking memes like a Palantir for the next two three four five years exactly we and I gotta I gotta be honest with you you you're probably the most engaged uh Wall Street analyst on Twitter I can't think of anybody else except Gary Black who's very engaged with the Tesla Community one from macro Tom Tom Lee is very engaged you know from a macro perspective yeah I just did a video covering one of his predictions uh he's a superstar I like him a lot dude he's yeah he's the go like if he he's the definition of the good well he called The Bull Run of the first half of the year and nobody saw it coming at least like in our community nobody talked about the Bull Run um but yeah so I was saying you're super engaged in the in the community that's uh so weird to see because I learn a lot really I I work I learned a time I mean to me it's I like engage first of all it's like look I've done I've done this job going 23 years okay covering tech stocks going back to like you know late 90s institutional that's what I've always done retail has just become more and more important in terms of I I think not just in terms of like the market but I mean like I've talked about Palantir retail discovered ahead and institutional that's that's a fact I write I know that there's no dispute there and I do you think that that game changed in the pandemic pandemic switched the kind of the the script a little bit where you know when I was when I was uh working in the industry in the 2010 there it was all about institutional money driving the markets and retails just jumping on the ride and now I hear like institutional investors trying to figure out what Rito is going to do and they're kind of game yeah but but time it's like I mean just like I mean obviously like within the Palantir community there's you know yourself amid there's a number of other in Castle Community you know I mean local Gary Black stone right like yeah you just think about as he's built it um you know look look what Troy's done like all I'm just trying to say is that to ignore it would be I I think would actually be like a super negative for that individual because I think you need eyes open and I actually like I and I think a lot of things from feedback we see on Twitter to things getting discovered I think you learn a lot from engaging that's at least that look that that's always been my DNA um do you think there's a in the case of Palantir um what like the BuyBacks uh you you think it's a smart play I tend to agree with you not that you know it's not I'm not interviewing myself here but the way I see it is somebody who's obsessed with this company um look Palantir isn't building factories they don't need a whole lot of capex it's a scalable product they're writing code so if you if you Palantir and you're sitting on three billion dollars of cash and you have virtually no debt uh it's a smart move and people ask me well why wouldn't they do that earlier when the stock price was at seven because it would have seemed desperate and would have signed the wrong message I mean you can't do it in weakness you have to do a group position but coming off of that what do you think Palantir can do better to attract more institutional investors in the future beyond the BuyBacks the biggest push but so let's walk through like the biggest pushbacks from from an ambassador perspective on Palantir it's queer evaluation right and evaluation as I've always talked about like if you try to put transformational growth names in a box and look at PE over the next year you would have missed Netflix Tesla and Microsoft Apple Amazon in other words I I just I believe transformational growth themes you can't look at them when you're out you got to look out on a normalized Model what the company is going to look like three five seven years now and then whether it's DCF or however you want to sort of value that I think that's what you got to do now the second big pushback is just okay you're talking about this messy of AI but they're growing 13 percent where what am I missing that's look that's what that's legit right like as a as a pushback so there's a question it's a good question no but but to that point my pushback to that is the accelerating growth story is is ahead of it in other words and it reminds me a lot like I could go up to instances for Tesla from Microsoft for Apple for Google where there were times where growth at the time didn't make sense relative to the opportunity but it came that's that's my view like that you're gonna have an accelerating growth story as we go into 24 25 26 and that's why I look like I've talked about AIP I got in my opinion that's what I've used sort of the the Holy Grail the game well it's the whole but but it's the Holy Grail because purling into Enterprise we could talk about Nvidia GPU chips yep and Cloud platforms all I want Microsoft Google where are the use cases I mean from a use case perspective I believe from a platform like that they're one of the first calls now that you're gonna get I get all the you know some of the negatives at least how it's viewed you know from a government perspective but those are the best reference customers the three letter agencies you'll ever have uh and by the way um I absolutely love your shirt your your Fashion Icon over another Community with your suits and the shirts I just want to mention to people you're on vacation so it's a the attire suits the the event um thank you um I love I love that choice um person makes it makes it fun because also it comes down to like it's always been and it's the way I go to meet it like go to meetings like if people see me in an airport or in the street but the point is I do because also it's like it's my personality it's fun I get it some people don't but it's just like and also I think it speaks to like it speaks to just my view of like you know I view things differently I'm not saying I'm right there's people I'm watching this be like dude everything that guy says I hate or disagree with that stuff I've been on YouTube for for five years I I know exactly what you mean I mean whenever you're gonna go out and say something in the public there's going to be an inherent percentage of people going to think you're a douchebag just by talking I mean it's normal but no but but the point is I I have a I have certain thesis on names we do a ton of work in terms of like talking to I.T talking to the channel talking to customers and then we pick our winners right like in other words like and that's how like our formula that's how we've done it whether it's cyber security Cloud we have a lot of cool names in cyber security you've covered a lot of Palo Alto Networks uh Varonis I think like a lot of really cool names yeah at Fortinet I think fortunate you went early like a lot of these names like look nobody people forget but because like people have shorten their memory in 2018 nobody wanted to touch Tesla does the Tim Cook wouldn't take a meeting with Elon Musk I mean you're coming in with that buy rating that early people kind of forget I I want to come back to Palantir in a second I just want to touch on Tesla a little bit if you already kind of mentioned Tesla here because you are one of the OGs on the Tesla scene so you have a price target of 350 for Tesla in the Tesla bull community that's considered low I was interviewed by one of their main head bulls and my 1400 price target was considered embarrassing for them they were like oh that's too low but but um look I am I I I want to ask you something about Tesla as somebody who came in early when was that moment for you when you knew like Tesla was something special that Eureka moment for you when it happened to me it was it was really probably into that in probably 2018 it was being at one of their events for one of their introductions I forget what exactly what and and obviously the Cybertruck and the glass broke incident and I think it remind it's the only company that's ever reminded me and it's my view of Musk of like the 2007 movement when when Jobs released the iPhone and just seeing you store like do Euphoria there and I think that's something that you can find in a spreadsheet you can find when you're in office building and look like whatever three million miles Saloon like the point is like like we've traveled a lot but a lot of is like that's where we see things that maybe others don't right uh I and the thing about like what um I'm really envious of Tesla like Tesla and Palantir are two of the most I think misunderstood companies in the market but for Tesla the journey to that to fill that gap from misunderstood to uh to Brilliance in the eyes of the investors simpler because there's a product there's a tangible product you can go and experience and you can benchmark it against a premium four-door sedan and then you have the Eureka moment so we I was just out on vacation and the buddy of mine was driving so totally earlier flying the Model Y and I was driving an E-class and Mercedes E-class and I can tell you his car was hands down better experience in every possible way so that benchmark makes it really easy with the company like it's a bit different because the it's a B2B uh category so it's hard to touch and feel you know it's not like Tesla an actual Palantir if I go if I go back like year like years ago you know I have strong strong roots relationships like you know within DC within you know a lot of individuals that formerly were in the military you know with special forces stuff like that and you know there's a lot of these people come out and they and they and they start companies they want to get funding right I think I've helped I've helped many of them over the decades right introducing them to people you know whether they're 8200 MI6 you know because and and what I've learned especially in that community like the the view of Palantir Within the defense community within military um Stella and look and I just keep coming down to like if Tom or Dan Tom Nash fan is a is a CIO of an Enterprise looking to build out AI solutions over the next year talk look me in the eye and tell me how they're not front and center in that engagement yeah so what do you think of like I agree with you here and it's kind of funny to see that happen I was I had you on the show a year ago and the year ago we were talking all about Tesla and then you said hey it's too I we didn't really talk about Palantir back in those days a year ago I was making videos and I was saying look Palantir is facing kind of this political um headwind in a sense uh they don't really have a competitor in the market per se but what's happening is like a lot of these CIOs they have their own kind of Frankenstein product set up which cost a ton of money to these companies and they're really embarrassed or apprehensive about bringing an extended solution after they spend so much money they don't want to look bad so they're basically blocking Palantir from getting in through the door it's kind of surprising how Enterprise software in America is more political than even the government In America which is kind of funny but I said look at the end of the day they're going to break through because there will be a few smart CIOs who will understand the value of this they'll utilize it they'll beat the competition then it's going to be even worse if you don't use it than just to embrace yourself I bring them on and then you're gonna like Palantir is gonna be getting phone calls hey come over show us what you got which is exactly what Sham and and Alex were talking about the conference call and who comes down to shots on goal like yep just anything that's what you're seeing with the hundred customers the 300 you know potential in the pipeline that that that ultimately where this is and that's why look I when I call stocks I just I don't call them for uh you know preview review okay this is what happened earnings this I view it as like far stood the trees disruptive Tech and it goes back to Tesla right like Tesla many continue they viewed as an auto company that's out to trade I've always viewed it simmers Apple disruptive Tech it's such a crazy misunderstanding of what they do I mean you can categorize them in a lot of ways and you cannot like the stock and it's okay you can say Well they're expensive or there's a lot of uncertainty that's fine but to say it's an auto company given what they've shown us so far uh just just on the energy side forget Robo taxi forget the robotics just on the energy side Mega packs are an industry Stranded by this point well that's why I think you know and and there's a whole another conversation but by the way you have a comment here from somebody from my community who is actually an ex ex-military and he's saying that's from first hand knowledge great uh so there's just a whole new point from earlier I heard it a hundred thousand times no but but it goes back but but I like even like when it comes like cyber security part of our calls if I just go back on like Palo Alto those Zscaler or yep you know CrowdStrike or whatever it comes down to like what do I team managers think what do Channel people think is it good is it great is it a wheat simple as that by the way what are your thoughts on Alex Karp he's been getting a lot of heat lately now as as Palantir is moving in into the you know business software Enterprise Corporate America unless in the government side people are calling oh he's not technical enough he's not a software engineer et cetera he's lacking the skills he's getting a lot of heat from the community like about not being technical enough what do you think about that I think he's like I put him in that category of like Visionaries that he has a vision he's built it maybe it's it's obviously been bumpy to get to this path but now I think there's like a golden path ahead and I think he's he's a vision it goes like I always say like there's some they play chess I'll just play checkers like he plays chess I think for me that again not to interview myself to me it's a very simple Story number one Peter Thiel just gave him another billion dollars in future comp for the next 10 years Peter Thiel is no idiot you cannot you know you cannot deny that Peter Thiel is he knows what he's doing so if Peter Thiel gave this dude a billion dollars for the next 10 years I think he did a good job um this guy delivers you know a TTM pays of 2.2 billion this year so he's gonna make 2.2 billion this year he's growing customers by 40 he's still growing in double digits in times where businesses are looking to cut spending not to increase spending people forget that about 2023. he's the living terrific results his his is absolutely killing it okay so he's not a classic yeah but also you have and then the other thing well first of the classic CEO if you look at the elite the special the Hall of Famers they're not you can't put them in a box you can't put an Adele in a box cook you can't like in other words you can't put Musk in a box or some are better talking that language like Jensen is good at it and but Jensen is so far is really good at talking that talk yeah but I wouldn't exactly exactly like Jensen is doing the difference the point is that is like extremely extremely rare I mean you're talking once every 25 years Jack well sure that that you have someone that like is an executor and can talk but I'm just saying like a lot of times you can't put them in a box but the other thing just just to like to round it out is like when when you also look at it is the biggest transformation intact since the internet AI you gotta make your back and it was like who which horses you're gonna bat yeah okay I'll bet I'll bet Nvidia I bet Microsoft I bet Snowflake you bet MongoDB the point is we're not talking a hundred companies and and I think one just one thing just like for anyone watching you know if you look like a lot of these tech stocks post earnings they've sold off you know people will talk about Microsoft saying it's it's gonna be a slower Ram that that's no one ever expected the Nvidia guidance heard around the world was going to be replicated across so these are knee-jerk type reactions you're talking about a trillion dollars of incremental spent over the next decade I think in the video as an outlier and it's very hard to judge everybody else based on the outlier short-term reaction in the stock price um again you mentioned Jensen is an outlier Nvidia is an outlier their terrific company no no disrespect to them I mean but you know companies don't behave like that but no but it's also the way it browser is the way that overnight when you're the only you're the only game in town that sells GPUs yeah and and obviously the way that we can like when I was a kid and video was a gaming company who would have thought that that you know the dude really like took him to a whole new Stratosphere I mean Microsoft was just the windows yeah PC mature company Kill Nadella Name by the way Microsoft is another great under undervalued AI play which which gets ignored a lot I mean that's been our in our opinion like we've talked about it's been our your top pick here and I think that was just another example like there's no way Microsoft should be worth 500 billion that is ridiculous it's worth a trillion trillion and a half what do you look the point is the bears will sit there in their right lane looking for Black Swan events every weekend some and the reality is is that soft landings occurred feds waving the white flag and it's a risk on in our opinion for attack um the thing about it is I always kind of feel like it sometimes people talk in different wavelengths like especially on Twitter which is a very opinionated platform as you know you have this very audible vocal aggressive discussions and sometimes I look at this guys you're talking about Aaron oranges and apples I mean you're a long-term investor you're a Trader you completely different realms and I think Palantir and similar companies like Tesla for a while there they were really judged based on you know oh what's the share price this year and instead of looking a little bit more kind of a and I do think that that those things happen right I go at times like you come in we have a great quarter great guidance stock sells off the narrative it's done it was but but I mean I could I could point to hundreds of examples of companies where then all of a sudden market further digests what's happening three six months from now fundamentals always win the fundamentals always beat narrative it it just how how long it takes is it's a question of well I can argue Palantir is really it's really going to be as some of the park story because what's going to happen is you you're gonna have give me a value for that you're gonna have the cash and then what's the value of AIP what's the value of that platform which because I can argue the value of that piece is extremely higher than maybe the rat you didn't and I think those are maybe some of the ways I think investors are gonna start to look at some of these names similar some of the parts as we've looked at you know Apple Amazon and others are you concerned by their customer concentration issues because that's been brought up a lot as a negative because like top top 20 clients are half their business if you work in the Beltway with the 202 area code customer concentration is like getting a cup of coffee at 8am like that's just by the way there if you actually look deeper in the numbers um the percentage like as the customer spend grows per the top 20 clients and it grows every quarter by the way they're now at a billion a year of spend per top 20 clients that number was 470 million in 2020. so as that number doubled the percentage from the entire revenue pie has gone down from 60 to 50 percent so it's the client is coming down as they're growing well and then as Enterprise it would just get more and more diverse I actually think look I think like something that like I've talked to a few investors about but I think what's going to be like a huge topic is going to be what is the federal fiscal year quarter look like what types of deals are we starting to see on defense AI driven within government within civilian agencies I think that's going to be that's going to be a little kind of breadcrumbs to to maybe what's on the horizon 24.25 so is that is there anything like no I'm sure there is but what would be like the the one thing if it comes down the pipeline you would change your mind about the company So currently you know one of the biggest bulls from the from the Wall Street community not a lot of people give it 25 per share so what what's what's the red flag that's gonna freak you out to say no no I'm out oh yeah I mean red flag things would be if Enterprise success so let's walk through like the risk yeah you know not able to monetize AIP at a level that you expected over the next 12 18 24 months two would be Palantir defense success 202 area code to Enterprise every second third would be okay like I'm going like macro Black Swan like budges get cut AI gets pushed out I look like when you look at those like I'm not saying like there's bumps in the road and there's risk in there but I look my my whole career I've always viewed it like what are the key themes you want to bet on pick your winners and then individually based on whatever you're really you know you pick your spots but that's how it's been a pretty simple formula how I've kind of covered names Palantir I just viewers like you have an AI basket they're like they're deep in that basket as one of those plays and I just don't think that you can just put and say my view is like okay if there's a trillion dollars of incremental spend 800 billion conservatively you're telling me this can't be a 50 billion dollar Mark cap in you know where would I view that you ultimately could have revenues at doubles next three four years so that's sort of but but those are the ways that you have to look at names like this you cannot put them in a box and just say typical stocks traded x times PE 19 times I feel like that's how you've missed every transformational growth in the last 20 years well that's the problem with value investors they tend to miss out on this on the Teslas and the in the Palantirs and the in the Nvidias even the Nvidia was expensive still is expensive I mean as a violent investor like once you go to PE ratios price to sales ratios it's very hard to to make a call like that,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,FFvoj7KK02M,2023-08-10T20:54:32Z,Dan Ives Joins Tom Nash To Discuss Palantir's Future,Rivian,"like Rivian is a great example by the way of that like Rivian yeah Rivian's like another good example right like if you view it just don't like money they burn near-term whip okay now it's working on the other side like when they get actually to scale like not just on the commercial side with Amazon but just when you look at like when you start to get into 150 200,000 you get Atlanta up in terms of the factor bill that one with Illinois what does Rivian look like and I mean RJ is another one like just like Karp just like Musk just like the doubt like I might put in that and it's like but I'm saying RJ is someone like I bet on because it's a good CEO is like without that it's a I mean um I wouldn't invest in a company with with the bozo CEO no matter how good never look never underestimate how bad management teams could be EG Snap Lyft never overestimate how great managing teams are and what that means from the Delta monster Cook but even if you just if you just look at Rivian like a look I think Rivian is a sad story to me so far because in a sense they were a victim of their own kind of hype the hype the initial hype out of the gate valuation uh was so insanely out of this world that now they're they're tagged under this oh it's a they because people go oh Nikola and the and the Rivian but also Rivian did but also Rivian like they did like they had a lot of supply chain issues right yeah they remember the price increase that they they did and they took it back 24 hours later I mean that was a comedy of errors yeah the first young theme just being a young team but it did but but now now adulthood in the room it's a different story yeah they're starting to turn around look Uber I say the same thing go back to Uber since IPA now we'll get over attack well they kicked out the never mind but I'm saying like even even Tesla pre Larry Ellison and post Larry Ellison was a different story The Way corporate well because you had but also the way you when you have someone like that in the boardroom yeah it's the change the conversation and I mean that was like a Miyagi type movement to you know Ralph Macchio he doesn't get enough credit in the in the Tesla story you know it's funny when Ellison came on I've known Larry since the late 90s you know covering Oracle and gone to Gnome when he came on I remember we writing note and be like this is this is gold like this is huge and the amount of heat be like you're you're saying Ellison's gonna be a pot I mean Tom like I'm talking like oh my God but and then if you really think about it he really was the one where like strategically did things within the board then ultimately raise money that was the whole issue raise money again with the kid look I going back to Rivian simple analysis very Layman then trucks and SUVs two of the best categories to be in as an automaker in the United States they make great cars that people love every car review The Rivian car is Stellar the brand is good Marques Brownlee is like doing a reviews on it like an iPhone so it's an iPhone level kind of vanity product right they have top talent not Tesla level tile but like secondly really good talent they're getting better every quarter and I like in my opinion I think they can be great they're not the second coming of Tesla but they can be a great car company and I've spent a few days in their production you know uh up in uh in Illinois it's super impressive like in terms of what they're building out there",1.0,0.6
Tom Nash,FFvoj7KK02M,2023-08-10T20:54:32Z,Dan Ives Joins Tom Nash To Discuss Palantir's Future,Microsoft,and ultimately we we really pound the table on them and that's how we've done with Microsoft and Apple and Tesla and you know Amazon and others and in my opinion Palantir is it's an Undiscovered gem from an AI perspective... it reminds me a lot like I could go up to instances for Tesla from Microsoft for Apple for Google where there were times where growth at the time didn't make sense relative to the opportunity but it came that's that's my view like that you're gonna have an accelerating growth story as we go into 24 25 26 and that's why I look like I've talked about AIP I got in my opinion that's what I've used sort of the the Holy Grail the game well it's the whole but but it's the Holy Grail because purling into Enterprise we could talk about Nvidia GPU chips yep and Cloud platforms all I want Microsoft Google where are the use cases... I I mean I think that's just a prudent move I mean if I look from Apple to Microsoft to Google I mean a company like Palantir given where I believe they could be from a cash flow generation did a direct listing right not an IPO I I think that's a prudent move that's something they're not doing that just to scare the short I think that's just from a capital allocation strategy that's something that they needed to put in the table... yeah okay I'll bet I'll bet Nvidia I bet Microsoft I bet Snowflake you bet MongoDB the point is we're not talking a hundred companies and and I think one just one thing just like for anyone watching you know if you look like a lot of these tech stocks post earnings they've sold off you know people will talk about Microsoft saying it's it's gonna be a slower Ram that that's no one ever expected the Nvidia guidance heard around the world was going to be replicated across so these are knee-jerk type reactions you're talking about a trillion dollars of incremental spent over the next decade...

I've always viewed it simmers Apple disruptive Tech it's such a crazy misunderstanding of what they do... never overestimate how great managing teams are and what that means from the Delta monster Cook... I've been very critical of Apple in the streaming industry because of uh I mean Apple have struggled in my opinion to uh like Netflix have a legacy Library Disney has Legacy library Amazon and Apple they're in the same problem of they have to generate from scratch or buy something they have a mansion with no furniture yeah so app but Apple like How likely is that deal where Iger says well I don't need ESPN I need cash like we're we're drowning and then the Apple comes in swoops in it's a boat I mean if you get ESPN and Apple that's the most we talked we talked to I mean I did that Pac-12 situation which obviously blew up back 12 but the point when Apple having a deal on the table shows just more and more like live sports they recognize from a streaming perspective that's where it's all going and that's why like if if ESPN is on the table you know depending on on which way and how higher goes about it with Disney like Apple is going to take a serious seriously look at you know look they have an historically done acquisite I mean the biggest one they did was Beats three and a half billion yeah but I'm just saying like this is gonna be we're going to see massive changes in streaming linear as we're streaming you know next next few years well Tim Cook likes to build his own stuff because he thinks he can do it better of course I get it and and he has he has and if you look at Apple TV the content is really good they they like the original the qualities like Netflix is struggling to they're spending so much money and it's not as good Apple but the quantity of content they cannot grow it from scratch they need to acquire IP and ESPN is just a huge mode I mean that's something that people will subscribe look at how much Amazon spent on Thursday Night Football which is you think there's any other contenders that will come like maybe an Amazon for ESPN I mean look if something like that comes on I mean everyone's gonna have to look at in Tech but Apple would be the one that would make the most sense for a number of reasons yeah they have the cash they have massive amounts of cash they have the ecosystem within the streaming platform customer but also like that Pac-12 the fact that they had a deal out there shoes,1.0,0.6

that you're gonna have the cash and then what's the value of AIP what's the value of that platform which because I can argue the value of that piece is extremely higher than maybe the rat you didn't and I think those are maybe some of the ways I think investors are gonna start to look at some of these names similar some of the parts as we've looked at you know Apple Amazon and others are you concerned by their customer concentration issues because that's been brought up a lot as a negative because like top top 20 clients are half their business if you work in the Beltway with the 202 area code customer concentration is like getting a cup of coffee at 8am like that's just by the way there if you actually look deeper in the numbers um the percentage like as the customer spend grows per the top 20 clients and it grows every quarter by the way they're now at a billion a year of spend per top 20 clients that number was 470 million in 2020. so as that number doubled the percentage from the entire revenue pie has gone down from 60 to 50 percent so it's the client is coming down as they're growing well and then as Enterprise it would just get more and more diverse I actually think look I think like something that like I've talked to a few investors about but I think what's going to be like a huge topic is going to be what is the federal fiscal year quarter look like what types of deals are we starting to see on defense AI driven within government within civilian agencies I think that's going to be that's going to be a little kind of breadcrumbs to to maybe what's on the horizon 24.25 so is that is there anything like no I'm sure there is but what would be like the the one thing if it comes down the pipeline you would change your mind about the company So currently you know one of the biggest bulls from the from the Wall Street community not a lot of people give it 25 per share so what what's what's the red flag that's gonna freak you out to say no no I'm out oh yeah I mean red flag things would be if Enterprise success so let's walk through like the risk yeah you know not able to monetize AIP at a level that you expected over the next 12 18 24 months two would be Palantir defense success 202 area code to Enterprise every second third would be okay like I'm going like macro Black Swan like budges get cut AI gets pushed out I look like when you look at those like I'm not saying like there's bumps in the road and there's risk in there but I look my my whole career I've always viewed it like what are the key themes you want to bet on pick your winners and then individually based on whatever you're really you know you pick your spots but that's how it's been a pretty simple formula how I've kind of covered names Palantir I just viewers like you have an AI basket they're like they're deep in that basket as one of those plays and I just don't think that you can just put and say my view is like okay if there's a trillion dollars of incremental spend 800 billion conservatively you're telling me this can't be a 50 billion dollar Mark cap in you know where would I view that you ultimately could have revenues at doubles next three four years so that's sort of but but those are the ways that you have to look at names like this you cannot put them in a box and just say typical stocks traded x times PE 19 times I feel like that's how you've missed every transformational growth in the last 20 years well that's the problem with value investors they tend to miss out on this on the Teslas and the in the Palantirs and the in the Nvidias even the Nvidia was expensive still is expensive I mean as a violent investor like once you go to PE ratios price to sales ratios it's very hard to to make a call like that,1.0,0.9

I've been very critical of Apple in the streaming industry because of uh I mean Apple have struggled in my opinion to uh like Netflix have a legacy Library Disney has Legacy library Amazon and Apple they're in the same problem of they have to generate from scratch or buy something they have a mansion with no furniture yeah so app but Apple like How likely is that deal where Iger says well I don't need ESPN I need cash like we're we're drowning and then the Apple comes in swoops in it's a boat I mean if you get ESPN and Apple that's the most we talked we talked to I mean I did that Pac-12 situation which obviously blew up back 12 but the point when Apple having a deal on the table shows just more and more like live sports they recognize from a streaming perspective that's where it's all going and that's why like if if ESPN is on the table you know depending on on which way and how higher goes about it with Disney like Apple is going to take a serious seriously look at you know look they have an historically done acquisite I mean the biggest one they did was Beats three and a half billion yeah but I'm just saying like this is gonna be we're going to see massive changes in streaming linear as we're streaming you know next next few years well Tim Cook likes to build his own stuff because he thinks he can do it better of course I get it and and he has he has and if you look at Apple TV the content is really good they they like the original the qualities like Netflix is struggling to they're spending so much money and it's not as good Apple but the quantity of content they cannot grow it from scratch they need to acquire IP and ESPN is just a huge mode I mean that's something that people will subscribe look at how much Amazon spent on Thursday Night Football which is you think there's any other contenders that will come like maybe an Amazon for ESPN I mean look if something like that comes on I mean everyone's gonna have to look at in Tech but Apple would be the one that would make the most sense for a number of reasons yeah they have the cash they have massive amounts of cash they have the ecosystem within the streaming platform customer but also like that Pac-12 the fact that they had a deal out there shoes,1.0,-0.2

Tom Nash,kihRSYIljSQ,2023-08-07T23:09:53Z,Palantir Q2 Earnings Recap,Palantir,wow wow wow wow what an earnings call from palan Pier all my goodness the stock price is currently at 18 and a half dollars as of the making of this video giving it a nice three percent Spike not anything unusual not anything to write all about not explosive three percent increase but the one thing I have to explain here is that these earnings this earnings season is not forgiving for companies to screw up every single company that have screwed up in this earnings season paid dearly I can name a few names but there's no need for that the fact of the matter is palantir is up three percent after the earnings means that Wall Street studies it digested it and it said well good point here keep on doing the good work you're right on track nothing explosive came out of this obviously and also nothing negative good keep on going keep on moving keep behind the ball very good so this is not something to basically start posting Victory laps over as far as all palantiers none of this good job volunteer good earnings call great performance by carbon team we'll talk about that in a second absolutely phenomenal delivery on the presentation side of the things which is something I was asking for for months for years to palette here this was hand styled the best earnings call by palantir as far as comfort ease of presentation harp was in his element He was killing it the entire fall he was making fun of analysts he was joking around it was delivering value he was basically knocking it out of the park Sean was terrific the entire team was absolutely spot on they came prepared they were relaxed so hands down the best palantir call to date very impressive now more on the financial side of what happened in the school number one obviously we have talked a lot about the potential of SNP inclusion I don't think I've heard anybody from palantir talk about s p inclusion as much as they did in this call I think they mentioned sap inclusion at least 10 times or more this means that they are now on the path of actual sap enclosure this company and the team would not have mentioned s p inclusions for so many times if this wasn't honestly on the table now the conditions there just the dry conditions to get included in this v500 is so the company that four consecutive quarters of positive Gap basically be profitable from a gap perspective four quarters in a row pilot here just did the third consecutive reporter today all they have left is one single quarter to be eligible it doesn't mean they could be included there's no guarantees but the fact of the matter is they will be eligible in one quarter and they've said that the earnings call they expect to have another stability quarter way ahead of time by the way we expected this in 2025. so nobody's talking about the fact that planet is just basically beat the they're all the stupid like two years of achieving Gap portability early so the fact of the matter is management mentioned that multiple times makes me think they have a little bit more on the inside track of what's going on so I think they're pretty confident on that SNP included that's a very important thing because sap inclusion means that all the institutionals all the companies that cover palantir and are basically looking from the side getting interested will be much more excited it's really a lot more money going into pilot here so SSP inclusion remember what they did to test that it's probably going to do something similar for volunteer if it happens at this point we're literally one quarter away from the potential that happened very important the other thing that happens for the first time in history since I remember volunteer that management has announced that they're going to do a one billion dollar buyback it's a huge thing but before you jump off your chairs and get all excited nobody said one billion in a year nobody said one billion in 10 years for all I know this can be 1 billion over the course of the next 25 years they haven't set a time frame for this so nobody knows when how much so this one being million is just a declaration of intent it's a framework it's nothing binding there's no Clarity on how fast this happens now as far as the buyback is a good or bad look the arguments in either way on the one hand you might make the argument you know that buying back shares is bad for the company because it's taking away money from you know putting money back into the business by you know investing less than r d investing Less in capex capital expenditures basically if you're giving your money away to the shareholders the company about buying back shares less money is growing into the development of the company and they totally get that but the company like product here which is free cash flow positive for years they're making money they're generating cash flow and they're sitting on three billion dollars of cash they can use one billion of it over the course of the next 10 to 15 years I don't know how long to actually show Wall Street show institutional investors that they think that the share is cheap because that's what the purpose of BuyBacks is to show institutional investors that you think as a company that the share price is cheap now we're getting to the more interesting part carbon team talked about 5 000 AIP clients in 10 weeks absolutely insane just get these numbers and they talked about three times that number being interested in it right now kind of working around the process of being on board absolutely insane numbers now more important than that besides the potential of AAP which is absolutely out of this world we'll talk about that in a second is the carp drop a massive bombshell on the skull and nobody noticed he said hey we're now aligned with the I.T Departments of companies for the first time in history and we're seeing unprecedented interest from ID departments and you guys don't understand the scale of opportunity we're dealing with you and we're linking our future stock based competition of all employees to AIP success by him saying all these things what it actually means is companies are no longer basically battling palantir back in the day harp himself set out our biggest challenge is the point of contact the company's ID departments they don't want to let us in to Showcase to the management what we can do because we're going to make them look bad their own product whatever they built it's not going to hold up against our stuff so they're blocking us now they're saying well the ID departments are basically asking us to come on and because they need us exactly what I said a year ago was going to happen I said a year ago go back into my video I said at some point not having palantir is going to be much worse to your job than hiding the fact that your system is not good enough it's exactly that moment just happened right now massive massive development volunteer carpal Services said hey we're not for sale we're decades ahead of everybody else we're educating Market about the products that the market actually needs and we're going to be the world's most important software company in existence again you combine all these things he's saying hey we're the best in the business we're going to be a massive Behemoth of the company you ain't seen nothing yet here not nothing you haven't heard in this channel before a million times of course we have 13 Revenue girls look it's not as good as the previous quarter right that 18 in the previous quarter so there's a declining Revenue growth here for sure it's not amazing you have to take that in context in the context of this macro environment these interest rates this economy 13 double-digit Revenue growth is fine I'll take it obviously when you have 38 customer count it's even better and when you have 31 International Revenue growth from governments which is the point with the qcl companies that sort of volunteer that governments outside the United States especially you know from Europe kind of apprehensive about working with them now we have 31 growth in international governments massive move for volunteer top 20 clients keep on killing it car at least 15 percent up and that's 53 million dollar per client for the top 20 clients massive numbers but there's also in the keyless heel year it's a double-edged sword when your top 20 clients are basically in charge of about half of your Revenue it's a huge Thailand concentration risk which is very dangerous for the company this is the point where I like that it's a lot of money without a lot of cash flow but also you know when power plants are responsible for 50 Revenue you got to be careful with that that's something they have to be careful obviously with retention of 110 not a lot to worry about retention is flat if it hasn't gone up it hasn't gone down it was 111 the

Tom Nash,kihRSYIljSQ,2023-08-07T23:09:53Z,Palantir Q2 Earnings Recap,S&P,now more on the financial side of what happened in the school number one obviously we have talked a lot about the potential of SNP inclusion I don't think I've heard anybody from palantir talk about s p inclusion as much as they did in this call I think they mentioned sap inclusion at least 10 times or more this means that they are now on the path of actual sap enclosure this company and the team would not have mentioned s p inclusions for so many times if this wasn't honestly on the table now the conditions there just the dry conditions to get included in this v500 is so the company that four consecutive quarters of positive Gap basically be profitable from a gap perspective four quarters in a row pilot here just did the third consecutive reporter today all they have left is one single quarter to be eligible it doesn't mean they could be included there's no guarantees but the fact of the matter is they will be eligible in one quarter and they've said that the earnings call they expect to have another stability quarter way ahead of time by the way we expected this in 2025. so nobody's talking about the fact that planet is just basically beat the they're all the stupid like two years of achieving Gap portability early so the fact of the matter is management mentioned that multiple times makes me think they have a little bit more on the inside track of what's going on so I think they're pretty confident on that SNP included that's a very important thing because sap inclusion means that all the institutionals all the companies that cover palantir and are basically looking from the side getting interested will be much more excited it's really a lot more money going into pilot here,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,kihRSYIljSQ,2023-08-07T23:09:53Z,Palantir Q2 Earnings Recap,Tesla,so SSP inclusion remember what they did to test that it's probably going to do something similar for volunteer if it happens at this point we're literally one quarter away from the potential that happened very important,0.9,0.3
Tom Nash,8Wa2viHev38,2023-08-07T22:20:46Z,Palantir Earnings LIVE Stream | Tom Nash,Palantir,"Gap income from operations 10 million dollars two percent margin second consecutive quarter of Gap operating profitability, this is a huge milestone for palantir not to be discounted. Revenue grew by 13% year over year to 533 million. Looking at this 13% Revenue growth year over year to 533 is a little bit underwhelming because we expected them at least to maintain that 18% 16%, 13% is a little bit underwhelming but let's not uh for a pity party here because there's still Group 13% year of a year in a very challenging macro environment. 13% growth year over year is serviceable, it's nothing to write home about and that's why potentially we saw the initial stock drop a little bit but it's absolutely okay in this environment I'll accept it. Palantir needs to expand outside the United States. A lot of positivity on the bottom line numbers which is pretty cool for a company that was criticized for being pretty much unprofitable. S&P inclusion is now on the table, palantir just announced they're going to hit that within a quarter from now which is a huge huge milestone for the company. We are at a unique period at palantir, through the course of the last 20 years we built what isn't arguably one of the most interesting impactful product offerings in the world: PGA Foundry, our Target selection platform Apollo. Our goal at Palantir was to be the most impactful important software company in the world. Since we launched AIP, since we had AIP con and we have seen the way in which Technologies we've built that seem to be of moderate utility were built almost in anticipation of the AI Revolution, both algorithmatic and large language models, and that convergence has remade palantir. We are giving us the aspiration and realistic perspective of being the most valuable enterprise software company in the world. It is indisputable that palantir's software in that space is the is the most important in the world. We expect to be eligible for the S&P, for several quarters we've been profitable, that we have over three billion dollars in the bank that positions us to fulfill our new aspiration, which is to Simply Be the most valuable enterprise software company in the world. We introduced palantir's AI platform (AIP) a core set of Technologies designed to bring LLMs to your Enterprise to supercharge and accelerate your experiences. AIP and LLMs radically accelerate the solutions we are building on nearly 20 years of our products and experience solving these problems across more than 50 Industries. The second quarter of 2023 was exceptionally strong, we're proud to report our third consecutive quarter of Gap profitability and second consecutive quarter of Gap operating profitability generating 28 million of net income and 10 million of operating income. This also marked the third consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins highlighting the operating leverage in our business. We surpassed the high end of our guidance for both revenue and adjusted income from operations yet again. We also achieved this significant Revenue Milestone surpassing 2 billion in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand, trailing 12-month Revenue per customer from our top 20 customers increased 15% year-over-year to 53 million per customer. Customer account grew 38% year over year and 8% sequentially to 421 customers, demonstrating the momentum in our ability to onboard and convert new customers. We delivered on Gap profitability two years before people thought it was coming, and then if you look to the last three quarters we have three consecutive quarters of Gap profitability. We've now guided to Q3 and Q4 of Gap profitability, we're here with 3.1 billion on the balance sheet and we're doing this all while we're investing heavily in AIP. We believe in ourselves which is why we've authorized a buyback to align with disbelief in ourselves. Our belief with profitability aligns with our desire to be on the S&P, we are going to invest in ourselves and not at a small scale in the billion dollar range. Palantir is optimally positioned for AI because the value is going to increase the incumbents, it's our ability to acquire future customers, it's the 20 years of experience that we have solving the problems that matter. We launched AIP just 10 weeks ago, we're already seeing unprecedented interest both from top of funnel new customers and from existing customers. We have the product to do that and we have 20 years of experience deploying our products in the Enterprise and being able to do that safely and securely so while sometimes in the past we may have had misalignment with IT Department now we're fully aligned with what they're trying to achieve so in short we're seeing sales Cycles shorten. We built a company that no one understood, we went deep on technology that's Foundry, we went deep on the logical extension of that which is all these precursor technologies that we've now begun building into AIP and that we went deep against the Playbook and in fact the Playbook Now does not exist. The latest is we expect to be eligible for S&P 500 inclusion after we report Q3, and so we're proud to say we're less than a quarter away from eligibility. AIP is going to be transformative, we've talked about reorienting the company around it, earlier I spoke about how we're orienting our compensation about it. The board just authorized a billion dollar stock buyback which aligns with our goal of S&P 500 inclusion, we are very focused on investing in ourselves. We believe we have the right products and or we will build them so we are investing in what we do what we believe are the best in the world. We have over 5,000 monthly users, the users are growing 50% a month over month obviously we've been doing this for 10 weeks now that's quite a bit in the Enterprise for the pace that we're going at here. The real focus on the AIP product strategy is to make sure that you can use AIP without Gotham Foundry or Apollo. We built this original project our first product Gotham off the ground made us famous in a very small market called clandestine services and that project for product PG did something really interesting: it de facto taught the world what the use case is that you would need to solve and then provided the product that solved it and that's exactly what we're doing with AIP. Palantir is guilty of many things, we have no problem monetizing, we make 2.9 million dollars per commercial customer across the world. We will figure out how to monetize it, first we're teaching the market what it is, we're getting people on board, we're showing people that these are the kind of problems you'll have to solve if you want to engage in actually making money. Carp was out there explaining to you why this thing is going to go and become a one trillion dollar company, he literally told you we're two decades ahead of the competition. It's a race to who can get palantir faster and better. Palantir is literally two decades ahead of the competition. He literally told you twice we are the best in the business by a country mile. The fact that they're linking stock-based comp to the success of AIP so the entire compensation structure of all employees will now fully be linked to the success of AIP. You cannot buy out palantir for the one reason that they have class F shares, it's impossible. They have so much government business that depends on them being exclusive for the west. It took palantir 20 years and tens and hundreds of billions of dollars of governmental budgets to build this thing. Palantir is probably the best artificial intelligence play in the entire Market, better than Nvidia probably comparable to Tesla. Palantir has been doing AI Developers for the past 20 years, finally there was the first one to even mention like but the first time I heard machine learning came for palantir. With palantir, with positive cash flow, with three billion dollars in the bank, I think they got plenty. We're building products that companies won't know they need for another five years. Palantir is always playing ahead of the game and Wall Street has a tough time to catch up with that.",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,3hmoq_1zBJM,2023-08-06T10:04:23Z,PLTR Q2 Earnings Preview,Palantir,so pollen Theory delivers earnings on Monday huge event for the palantir community and an even bigger event for palantir as a company these are the most important earnings in the history of palantir that is because palak theater is literally in an Uncharted Territory now we have never seen this before every time we've seen earnings from palatineers so far it came after disappointment disappointments disappointments so we had a surprise great earnings and then we had another great earnings and now everybody's looking at Valentine saying well look that two Gap profitable quarters they really did well for the past two times the delivery results can they sustain the success can they stay consistent it's not that easy now the expectations are very high for volunteer for this quarter which means that if they fall short the disappointment is going to be very big and the share price is going to be absolutely insanely impacted by any negativity now in this video I want to talk about two things number one what's going to happen with the share price around earnings and number two what I'm personally looking at on the business metrics of the earnings what I care about now let's start with the share price because you know this is what most of you are here for let's not get ourselves so as far as the share price look the share price is going to be extremely volatile pilotir is known to be a volatile stock it reacts very validly upwards and downwards you've seen it happen year to date with 180 Spike but it also has that downside if the results are not good enough it's going to have a very painful negative drop you can drop all the way to 14 13 who knows palantir you never know where the floor is it's one of them crazy games you know you never know how far you can fall now again if the earnings are great we might see panthers back to 20 21 22 who knows but here are I think the key metrics and I think if quality can hit those we almost certainly are guaranteed to have a spike upwards after earnings but no matter what happens it's going to be a volatile time it ain't gonna be flat so apparently needs to probably hit between 550 and 600 million in quarterly Revenue that's not going to be easy they cannot fall behind that 18 growth if we see another quarter of declining Revenue growth last time they had 18 if we have anything below 18 growth it's going to be a red flag and a lot of people are going to use this for negativity around volunteers so The Benchmark is about 550 to 600 million in quarterly revenues and 18 or above of Revenue growth they cannot fall below 18 it's not going to be good of course we're going to be looking at the guidance we cannot see the guidance coming lower if the guiding comes even lower again it's going to have another negative impact on the share price obviously we want to see the share count sorry the account obviously drop with the SBC the stock waste compensation everybody talks about the share count the stock base comp the dilution that has been coming down significantly especially if you look at that as a percentage of Revenue palantir has been robbing their SBC this dog based compensation we want to see that Trend continue if stock based competition keeps jumping up again like it did in the you know couple of years before that it's going to have another negative impact of course we want to look at the net dollar retention palantir has been losing net throwing tension for the past few quarters they started with 119 they're currently at 111. it's a Far Far Cry from Snowflake we want to make sure that the net the retention the amount of dollars customers spend in the following year goes above 111 which is what they are right now the customer account has to keep going up obviously we have to look at about you know let's say 300 us commercial and overall we want to see 450 clients that has to be the Benchmark for volunteer they have to make it obviously the balance sheet has to remain strong 3 billion in cash we want to see a little bit an increase in that free cash flow has to go up and of course the two main issues of pilanteer has to be a little bit addressed in the sense of you know the management either has to talk about it or show results which is number one Geo risk palantir is concentrated in the United States we want to see a little bit more of an expansionist kind of flow of money not just one single country and the other thing is that you know dope you know their top 20 clients are absolutely impressive we want to see more growth in that obviously so they delivered 50 million per client per year in the previous quarter that's the average but that also means that the top 20 clients are basically driving the entire business we want to see a little bit more uh disbursement less client concentration on the business side of volunteer of course these are not things are going to be solved overnight but we want to see the trend get little bit better in this this is specifically the things I'm going to be looking at but if you ask me what Wall Street is going to be looking at look they want to see Revenue growth not below 18 they definitely don't want to see any guidance that goes below the current growth rate and they want to see about 550 to 600 million of Revenue in the quarter and that's I think where the Benchmark is going to be for palantir but here's the most important part of this video and and this is the crazy part if you ask me why I've never sold palantir even when it dropped to seven dollars when everybody was screaming that the world is coming to an end and the stock is about to go bankrupt and all that stuff well look the best investors the best long-term investors in the world and they have one thing that they work with which is much better than anything else anybody else has basically there's one thing that separates the world's greatest long-term investors from you know the normal folk and that is the ability to sustain and absorb and digest whatever and call it red days whenever you have red days it unfortunately it's true you know 90 of retail investors they freak out and if you have two red days God forbid well that's the the end of the world and if you have a red week or red month oh my God you know it's time to move to New Zealand and sell all your portfolio and become a sheep herder you know what I mean so the best long-term investors they get to neutralize that and I think you can do it as well again I posted this you don't need my patreon for this you don't need to buy any bunny videos for this you just need to listen to what I can say right now it's absolutely a free advice if you want to you know Master the art of sustaining red days because if you can sustain red days you will be able to buy the dip unnecessary and not sell out because a lot of people missed out on palantir they sold out when it was seven and eight dollars and they missed out on their opportunity so the way you do it is very very simple number one you have to have a process you have to have a discipline so that process is very simple find the method that works for you to evaluate good companies you can use a DCF model you can use multiples you can use whatever system that's proven an objective to evaluate good from bad once you know your good stocks make sure you have a process to invest automatically like a robot without emotions into these good stocks now I use the DCA method with an asterisk a DCA that goes up wdca when the share price drops below a certain threshold let's say 10 of the 52-week high but you can use whatever it is you you know works for you as long as it's objective as long as there's no emotions and just stick to the plan the most important part is discipline discipline discipline discipline it's like the same thing when you go to the gym discipline is everything if you pick good stocks and you DCA during the bad times more and you keep this saying during the good times a little bit less and you just stay consistent and take emotions out of it and ignore the red days then you'll be fine you don't need patreon for this do not sign for anybody's course this is not very complicated things the main part of this is just discipline because learning how to do DCF you can do online for free learning how to use multiples you can go online for free learning how to DCA you can do for free there's no need to pay anybody for this just learn the skill understand the discipline trust the process you'll be able to see these you know red days like a bug on your freaking windshield now congratulations to the publicity Community for 180 year-to-day success I mean it's absolutely insane I mean I love to see that it was still down from the highs I mean the stock was in the 30s back in the day they're still there's still a long ways to go I believe this is a trillion dollar company in

Tom Nash,u9QQNBB4oec,2023-08-04T09:55:18Z,Why I Never Sold Palantir,Palantir,"April 18, 2023, the share price of Pilenteer was $8.80. It was already up 38%. And I told you literally, I told you this is your last chance to invest. I said it. Now, this isn't financial advice. This was not and is not a recommendation to buy or sell Talenteer. It's just my own personal opinion. But I said, ""Hey, this is just getting started at $8.80. This is your last chance."" And of course, you know, this aged like fine wine and this stock is currently at $20 per share. And at this point, the same people who were telling you that this is a bad idea to buy a stock that just skyrocketed 40%. They're now saying, ""Well, look, this stock used to be $9. Why would I pay 20 bucks on this stock?"" Because currently, look, it's trading at $20 per share. $20 per share for a stock that used to be $9 per share just four months ago, three and a half months ago. That is too expensive, Tom. We're not going to buy that. And I get it. I get it. I get where you're coming from, but look, there's a chance that this keeps running. There's a chance it pulls back. I don't know what happens, but when you get into the psychological mindset of chasing a stock and trying to wait for pullback, timing the market, it's a very dangerous place. Now, why did I keep buying Palanteer when it was dropping like a stone? Look, Palanteer, this is when I came in November 2020. $18.15 was my like my entry point. The first video I've ever made, Palanteer was here. Stock drives up to $35 per share. Everybody says Tom's a genius. I get so much love. Then stock drops all the way to $8, all the way to $7 in 2022. Everybody says Tom's an idiot, right? Tom's a genius. A year later, Tom's an idiot. Now Tom's a genius again. By the way, I don't know if you noticed. And first of all, if you are one of the people who called me a genius, then call me an idiot and I was calling me a genius again. Please unsubscribe for my channel. I don't want you as a viewer. I don't want you as a follower. It's nothing emotional. It's just you're not a long-term investor and my channel isn't going to give you any value. So, if you are one of the people who are hating on me and now like me again, just move away to a different channel. This is a long-term investing channel. I mean, I serve no purpose for you. No hard feelings at all. Just unsubscribe. It's It's okay. I don't mind. Now, let's So, why did I not sell here at $7.40? uh you know stocks stocks go up and down but a drop like this from 35 to 7 that means you know the company's done for right I had YouTubers telling me sell this stock it's reputational damage you're associated with Palunteer you have to you know stay away from it we had YouTubers famous YouTubers who sold Palunteer just for the clout it was fashionable to hate on it etc etc but you know I never sold why because I had genuine belief in the company I had faith based on my due diligence my process, my method, my system, my own discipline. So I was using my system to stay disciplined. I have faith. I have conviction. I don't care that the stock drop. Very, very simple. The only thing I've done through that time is dollar cost average into the stock no matter the price. Price goes up, price goes down. Buy the stock at all times. But you know, buy more when it dips. Buy a little bit less when it raises the price a little bit higher. Very, very simple. So my dollar cost average, my weighted average have come down significantly because I kept on buying when the stock was lower. But now we're at another juncture here. So now we're at the second juncture right now because now uh Palenteer is facing earnings again. And as you know, Palanteer during earnings season is a very volatile stock. It's almost kind of manic depressive, very very volatile stock. You never know where this, you know, it's going to go. It might dip like crazy. It might drop to $14 a share. might even go lower, god forbid, or it might spike and go to $30 like SFI did. Who knows? There's no way for me to tell you where this thing is going to go in the short term. It's impossible. I'm a long-term investor. So, the the reason, you know, I stayed true to myself is because when it was, you know, $7, my process didn't change. So, what happens in earnings right now for me? Very, very simple. I see this company, I see the numbers. In December 2020, this company generated $1 billion of revenue. Currently, it's on pace to deliver $2 billion of revenue at the end of this year. Now, a company that doubles its revenues in three years during a pandemic, a macro environment with a lot of challenges, high interest rates, a lot of issues, and they double their revenue in three years during that time. I feel very confident about the stability of the business and the growth trajectory of the business. But for me, you know, it's very very simple. If the earnings are such that the stock dips and it goes below $18, and I've explained multiple times why 18 is that number for me. If it drops below $18 per share, I'm going to start doubling down on my dollar cost average. I'm going to dollar cost average a little bit faster. If the stock stays above $18 or even spikes, I'm going to keep dollar cost averaging at my normal pace, at my slower pace. Why would I sell now? Whether it goes down or up, if it goes to $14 or goes to $30, why would I sell now? Why stop buying now when I know this company has a lot more potential? We haven't even talked about the fact that we have many catalysts coming up for Palanteer for the next year. We have the Titan deal, we have the NHS deal, we have the S&P inclusion. All these things are going to be major catalyst for Palanteer over the next year. Why would they sell now? Especially when this is a bulletproof company. We've just seen that through the pandemic and through the macro environment. They have the, you know, 50% of the business is coming from the Department of Defense, which is an anchor. They're going to get, you know, projects no matter how bad the economy is. They have 111% retention rate. Three billion in cash, no debt, massive pricing power. Top 20 clients are paying 50 million per year on average, 80% gross margin. I mean, all that with a price to sales 20% lower than Snowflake. I mean, come on. This is a no-brainer. Now, to me, you know, this isn't for anybody. Palunteer is a very unique stock. My bottom line here is number one, make sure you make a binary decision. The binary decision should be, do I invest in the stock or not? It is an expensive stock. It's priced for perfection. And the only way you should be investing in Palanteer, in my opinion, this isn't financial advice, is if you have high conviction and you think that this is the next trillion dollar company. If you don't see that with Palunteer and you're trying to play the greater fool theory to buy it now because you think it might go up, don't do it. It's a bad idea. You're going to be slammed. Do not do it.",1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,zJvGIgXrHB0,2023-08-02T11:34:05Z,This could send Tesla to $450,Tesla,hey this is Tom and this thing can literally send Tesla to 450 dollars per share. DCF value of 450 today not a price Target in a year not a price tagging five years today 450 all it needs is one little Catalyst to actually materialize and it's not that far-fetched. The first question I get asked almost on the daily basis are that with Tesla before we go to that 450 price tag it's like Tom is it a good idea to buy this right now look it up 600 you know 600 percent dude it's not up 600 it's up 64 over the past three months it's still down significantly it's down 12 on the year and in fact it pulled back from 300 all the way to 260 lately so it's not expensive it's not over Heist. If we compare this to Nvidia I mean this is absolutely insane numbers. I mean Tesla it's not expensive so first of all let's get that out of the way the current violation of Tesla is not expensive based on what you're getting right. Tesla is not overvalued. The other thing about this before that 450 price tag is that you have to understand that there's not a lot of companies out there like Tesla even even Nvidia is not as good in that metric I'm about to tell right now and Tesla is financially bulletproof it's sitting on a pile of cash it has no debt it has an insane amount of demand and the best margins in the business it's literally bulletproof. If there's good times in the economy and people are spending Tesla is going to do well if there's bad times in the economy and people are not spending as much Tesla is going to get wet but they're not going to drown like foreign GM and the other companies. So Tesla is very very financially sound whatever times are you know happening Tesla will be okay they'll do better in the good economy but they're not going to drown in a bad economy. And as it stands right now Tesla is already dominating the global stage definitely in the US North America but even on the global stage model Y is already the best selling car in the world and they don't even have a truck yet which is the most important category in the United States they don't have a 25 000 car yet out they're already dominating imagine what happens when that thing adds. Look Tesla is literally one full self-driving licensing deal with a large OEM away from hitting 450 per share. Tesla has already become you know an industry standard in charging in EV charging the next thing is Tesla coming in Industry standard in FSD full self driving autonomous driving a driver assist whatever you want to call it. Nobody has capabilities nobody has the mileage Tesla has so many more miles every single day so the gap between Tesla and everybody else is not just huge it's getting bigger by the day. So at some point it's inevitable not a question of if but when at some point there's a large OEM like Ford did with the supercharging that's going to come in and it's going to basically say hey Tesla sell us you know license to us your FSD we're going to put it in our cars once that happens the floodgates will be open. Because right now Tesla is basically trading at 50 growth. So Tesla based on the 50 line growth right here and based on 14 discount rate it's trading at 250 per share. So the moment the moment the next OEM comes in and says hey we're licensing FSD test is a 450 stock right there and then this minute. Now that we talk about the fact that the energy business of this is going to be way bigger than all of this combined. I mean look not talking about the fact that I have a price target of fourteen hundred dollars and twenty four hundred fourteen twenty for this company. So based on the most conservative estimations right here we're talking about a company that's literally away from 450 training to 60. So that's a 72 upside in the one very probable event. Jim Cramer told you 13 years ago that Tesla is all hype Tesla's all air and he told you to stay away from the IPO if you listen to Jim Cramer in 2010 you've lost on 21 000 of gains give Tesla is cloud give Tesla what it deserves. Tesla is literally one FSD deal away from blowing the lid out of the sock right now. My own personal opinion is that Tesla could be 450 very quickly assuming FSD matures and gets license out. If you invest investor today and you have the patience and you don't need to take out the money and you can stomach the volatility in 10 years time putting money in Tesla is going to make you a very nice return. Even if Tesla is just a car company if Elon leaves tomorrow Tesla stays a car company they don't develop anything else they just remain the model 3D model Y for the next five years it's still going to give you 10 percent a year basically which is the s p so the floor of this company is The Benchmark or the S P index but it has so much more upside it's absolutely exciting. A huge shout out to the Tesla community and everybody who educating the retail crowd and at this point you know test is kind of a so it impressed me so much over the past few years if the retail investors are now more educated about Tesla than institutional investors. Recently I've showed you this Tesla on the institutional side it's it's happening it's happening and it's happening quietly. Institutional investors they don't like to tell you when they're pummeling into a stock because they don't want to pump up the price but you know just go on stock MVP scroll down on Insider look at institutional shareholding and you're gonna find what's going on with Tesla over the past two years look even over the past year this is institution I'm not even going to say anything this chart tells you everything need to know about how much institutional investors are buying Tesla recently over the past year so you know don't say I didn't warn you.,1.0,1.0
Tom Nash,zJvGIgXrHB0,2023-08-02T11:34:05Z,This could send Tesla to $450,Nvidia,if we compare this to Nvidia I mean this is absolutely insane numbers look at Nvidia which I think is not as good of a company from an AI perspective as Tesla I mean Nvidia has a lot of AI capabilities but I mean comparing it to Tesla is kind of funny look Nvidia is definitely a great company but let's hold the horses here for a second right so Nvidia is creating it I mean I would let's say that Nvidia is as good as Tesla right let's not say anything is better or worse so if anybody isn't as good as this all right look Nvidia is trading Priceless 44 price to earnings of 240. I mean come on dude I mean Tesla it's not expensive so first of all let's get that out of the way the current violation of Tesla is not expensive based on what you're getting right. The other thing about this before that 450 price tag is that you have to understand that there's not a lot of companies out there like Tesla even even Nvidia is not as good in that metric I'm about to tell right now.,0.9,-0.2
Tom Nash,zJvGIgXrHB0,2023-08-02T11:34:05Z,This could send Tesla to $450,Ford,We saw Ford we saw the other companies we saw everybody succumb to the Tesla Supercharger standard so Tesla has already become you know an industry standard in charging in EV charging. So at some point it's inevitable not a question of if but when at some point there's a large OEM like Ford did with the supercharging that's going to come in and it's going to basically say hey Tesla sell us you know license to us your FSD we're going to put it in our cars once that happens the floodgates will be open.,0.9,0.0

Tom Nash,Su1ODZTQkTY,2023-07-31T20:05:29Z,URGENT WARNING TO PALANTIR INVESTORS,Palantir,hey this is Tom and this is an urgent important warning to every single palantir shareholder out there listen to me this is critical now look it's fun to be a palantir shareholder right now the stock is up 200 percent year-to-date it's up yesterday 10 it's up to date 10 it just almost scratched that 20 Mark for the first time and God knows how long I know it's a lot of fun but hold on a second let's talk about what's going on so this is going to be a very volatile week for palantir we have about seven days leading up to the earnings and those seven days are going to be extremely volatile messy and absolutely noisy every week that leads to palantir earnings is incredibly crazy if palantir does not deliver a home run out of the park earnings like so if I just did a few moments ago this stock has a good chance of correcting pulling back especially after a 200 year-to-date run no stock goes up endlessly without correcting it does not happen and currently because Palin theater is that at 200 year-to-date Spike it's on the hot seat if the earnings are not perfect if we're not going to get a home run the stock has a good chance of pulling back so what needs to happen for the stock to keep running well it needs to deliver Perfection a bit on earnings a beat on top and bottom line and great guidance going forward if palantir delivers on all of these it will keep running up and it's going to accelerate the process for palantir moving towards the gate where I think it actually should be I think palantir is still undervalued but the pace which is going to catch evaluation depends on how good these earnings are number one the extent of the pullback is going to be very limited compared to what we've seen during the drought of 2022 you see palantir is no longer the same stock it was when it was trading at six and seven and eight dollars the fact is yes it did run up by 200 percent due to date but it's still a long ways away from its real evaluation which should be much higher it is still undervalued and it's still far are far away from the all-time highs so the fact of the matter is palantir isn't in the bubble despite what some bears want you to think number two if a pullback does happen if we get a correction on palantir that is a good thing for long-term investors I'm not talking about Traders swing Traders day Traders options Traders none of that for long term Buy and Hold palantir heads like me a pullback is an opportunity I'm not telling you to buy or sell volunteer it's just my opinion for me palantir is the Holy Grail so when my Holy Grail goes down in price all of a sudden and allows me a second and third and fourth dip to buy some more at a reduced price this excites me I get to Double Down when times are bad look you have to just remember how things used to be in 2021 when I was saying palantir is a trillion dollar company everybody was calling me a genius the stock ran up from 18 to 35 and everybody was saying well Tom you nailed it in 2022 people were saying well Tom you're an idiot the stock went down from 35 to six dollars Tom you have no idea what you're talking about 2023 comes in and now I'm a genius again it went up from six to twenty dollars again Tom you knew it you called it the only people I care to serve is long-term patented investors with high conviction in this stock if you are a long-term investor in palantir the only thing you need to understand is number one relax everything will be okay number two stay the course dollar cost average into the stock slowly according to our system our system which we teach on our patient page every single day in our dedicated palantiron patreon.com forward slash Tom Nash 5 000 members and Counting and honestly the system is quite simple you look at the 52-week high for palantir now it's at almost 20 bucks now if palette is 18 per share threshold which is the 10 below the 52-week high is crossed and palantir is trading above 18 per share this is the normal dollar cost average for the share if penalty's threshold gets crossed towards the bottom which means 18 and Below then this is the double down time this is the time where you take your money and your DCA Pace increases in order for you to create a weighted average in your cost basis in the stock which is much lower than the eventual stock price in two or three years currently volunteer is obviously above its threshold line that means I'm buying but I'm buying normally I'm not doubling down we're going to keep an eye on the stock and if indeed air earnings are not perfect and it does pull back below 18 we're gonna start doubling down very very simple.,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,Su1ODZTQkTY,2023-07-31T20:05:29Z,URGENT WARNING TO PALANTIR INVESTORS,Sofi,like what we've seen today from Sofi today Sofi blew the earnings out of the water incredible earnings in every single parameter possible if palantir does not deliver a home run out of the park earnings like so if I just did a few moments ago this stock has a good chance of correcting pulling back especially after a 200 year-to-date run,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,U_8AMHVw5e8,2023-07-28T22:26:03Z,The *Actual* Smartest Palantir Stock Analyst Of ALL TIME,Palantir,"Dan the Messi of AI I mean that's a that's a tall order right there I think that's really what Karp's built and in my opinion it's still undiscovered as just a broader AI play which is why I believe they're the Messiah I think there's a golden path right now for them to monetize what we view is potentially a trillion dollar market opportunity and I think investors still have not recognized what this Golden Goose could be hey Palantir investor on the one hand this stock just flew up by 10 just today on the other hand Dan Ives one of the most respected analysts in the market and the guy who's been one of the main Tesla bulls for the past five years just call Palantir the Messi Lionel Messi that is of AI when you think about some of these newer AI applications in real time they're already being applied on the battlefield case in point Ukraine, Palantir is a key example of that do you think this is a situation where investors don't fully understand what this company does because so much of it is defense Tech and yes I realize it's expanding out to the commercial side too but there's a lot that they can't talk about for example well I think that's the biggest misperception I can tell you you know we're talking to many in the 202 area code the reputation of Palantir is speaks for itself in terms of you know any sort of operations three-letter agencies now if you're an Enterprise CIO and this is the conversations I've had you're looking toward AI platform approach, Palantir is potentially the first call so just the commercial business of Palantir is driving almost 240 million per quarter in revenues the U.S clients are growing by 50 per year U.S revenue is going by 26 per year and the net dollar retention even though it's been declining a little bit lately is it 111 percent now this number right here is where I think it's most interesting 50 million dollars per client for the top 20 clients of Palantir so imagine what I'm talking about here and that's why I think in this AI Gold Rush where I view is the fourth industrial revolution of course it's Nvidia Microsoft top of the mound with Nadella you look at second third fourth derivatives right now Palantir front and center and that's why I think this is a stock you look at our bulkheads model I think this is ultimately 25 dollars and I think as they execute more investors start to look at it the top 20 clients of Palantir are paying 50 million dollars each on average to this company to do whatever it does so let me ask you a question if you're a Fortune 500 company who would you pay 50 million a year it has to be somebody who drives results and results they drive indeed the other thing Dan I was kind of curious for your take on this because there is a meme stockiness to Palantir too I'm wondering how much of that factors in into your calculation yeah no doubt I mean there's a huge retail presence right I think but also I think this is one where maybe retail has been ahead institutional in terms of understanding the actual potential AI story I can tell you my conversations today it's really institutional investors being like okay what am I missing in this story where is the actual total addressable market opportunity and can they go from government to commercial so in 2015 Palantir started working with Airbus on their Flagship plane the A350 they've made it faster safer better cheaper but mainly they've cut the production time of This Plane by 33 percent now carrying this production Time by 33 percent it's kind of a big deal let me show you why because we're talking about a lot of moving Parts these are the moving Parts we're talking about ladies and gentlemen five million Parts literally in this plane it's manufactured over four countries hundreds of teams eight different factories Palantir came in made this whole thing into one holistic View and with its AI system they've managed to cut the production time of This Plane by 33 percent they looked at the production lines at the schedules the parts the deliveries defects Human Resources work orders quality everything went into one big pile data goes into the pile AI finds the answers allows you to cut production Time by 33 percent on this massive plane data piled up into one big pile AI drives better decisions that's literally the business model of Palantir that's all it is the Simplicity of it is actually quite insane take all the data you can find it's all siled completely separately put it all together get an AI to help you make better decisions with the massive amounts of data that you have but you don't know how to apply to get things faster cheaper better well then what you get 33 33 decline in the production time of the A350 because I think when you start to look at that for them is really the opportunity and if you're a CIO of an Enterprise there's no better reference accounts than those and there's the 202 areas but what does that look like I mean if you think about it okay so we have it's very opaque what they're doing on the on the military side of it I'm just curious what does that look like on the commercial side like what are you seeing there and especially I know they're growing some clients and so forth what are you seeing there I'd seen from a platform first in terms of scale and in terms of actually use cases they're probably the first call I I think they're probably in this market the purest AI play out there now they built it others are coming but it just speaks to our view in this fourth Industrial Revolution Palantir is going to be a big player the first time I ever heard a major company say machine learning came from Palantir yeah this is a company that gives me 350 million dollars in free cash flow so they have three billion dollars of cash with only 250 million of debt 10 times more cash than that they have assets of 3.7 billion 3.7 billion of assets liabilities of 880 million four times more assets than liabilities 10 times more cash than debt gross margin of 80 percent growth currently at 20 year over year in a bad year I don't think Palantir keeps growing at 20 for long I think their growth is going to be exponential but even now in this horrible year high interest rates the FED all that good stuff 20 growth I don't think there's anybody who looks at this objectively without the hate and the preconceived notions about this company who says this is a bad setup if I showed you this financials without Palantir in the headline you wouldn't say this is a bad company now there's another thing that people like to bash Palantir for which is the stock based compensation now there's a few things I want you to understand here number one Palantir started off with massive stock-based compensation because it went a very unusual path it went to the market not as an initial public offering not as an IPO it didn't go to the market as a SPAC God forbid of course because it's not a trash company it did something very unique Palantir does things different instead of being in the Silicon Valley they're up in Denver in Colorado I don't know where they are right instead of going an IPO route they did a DPO a DPO is a direct public offering can't recall a lot of these basically what it does it cuts out the middlemen instead of the banks giving the stock to their friends and VIPs and then you only getting it is an IPO later much overpriced Palantir decided to cut out the middlemen, cut banks, and the way they did it very simple have the employees and the current shareholders create the market for the stock so to do that they had to do a massive dilution in order for these guys to be able to create the market for the retail investors and the institutional investors but all of this dilution happened before Palantir went public so this dilution that everybody keeps showing that's massive dilution it all happened before the DPO well mainly before the DPO in order to allow for the DPO to even happen since the DPO since the direct public offering Palantir has been consistently coming down on SBC in fact if you look at stock-based compensation options RSUs what not as a percentage of Revenue of Palantir just three years ago it was 75 of the revenues of Palantir right now it's at 22 percent so if Snowflake has 18 of its revenues go back as a stock based compensation and Palantir is at 22 percent I'm gonna say you know it's not too far it seems on par with Snowflake and Snowflake is a Warren Buffett investment so if Snowflake is good for 22 percent sorry 18 I apologize Palantir is good for 22 it's in the same realm it's within the realm of reason so I don't see any issue with that I think it's absolutely normal now going a little bit deeper here look the company is already GAAP profitable for two quarters in a row and it's supposed to be another two quarters profitable until the end of the year the customer profitability went up 41 year over year in the last quarter the price of sales of Palantir is 19. it's not cheap it's not a cheap company this isn't a value play let's put it this way it's a growth stock 19 price to sales is not cheap it's very expensive but again how expensive well again let's look at Snowflake, Snowflake is currently trading at 25. so if we compare Palantir to Snowflake just a reasonable comparison as far as you know the amount of revenues the style of the market they're in although they have absolutely different products that has nothing to do with each other right Snowflake is trading at 25 price to sales and Warren Buffett is investing in it Palantir is at 19 it's cheaper stock-based compensation as a percentage Revenue well Snowflake is 18 Palantir is at 22 they're in the same neighborhood so I would say this isn't unusual for a high potential high growth company and now we're getting to the interesting part this is my bear case from Palantir where I think Palantir is going to be in five years on the bear case assuming it doesn't get to exponential growth assuming it stays with 20 growth so if Palantir only grows 20 per year for the next five years in 2028 you have 6.2 billion dollars of revenues if they get to 35 EBITDA which for a software company is absolutely normal then we're talking about 2.2 billion dollars of EBITDA at the 25 multiple which is okay for a software company for a high growth stock company 54 billion is the valuation I'm getting for my bear case in five years so at the very least if Palantir maintains 20 which I think it can do a lot more but if anything gets stuck it stagnates on 20 per year it doesn't grow much and it becomes an average SAS business with 35 EBITDA margin Palantir is worth 54 billion in five years which gives it a 46 upside 46 upside from today so if my bear case my bear case absolute bear case says that Palantir will give me 46 of return in the next five years which is about nine percent per year if the S&P 500 is giving me nine percent per year and this company on the bear case gives me nine percent per year but this company has the potential in my personal opinion not financial advice my personal opinion it has the potential to go to a trillion dollar valuation but in the bear case it's going to give me the same as the S&P 500 I'm going to play this card now again as a long-term investor there's something you should know recently the stock went up like crazy now how crazy I've made a little chart to show you how insane and how fast this happened now this thing makes sense to me it doesn't get to you but hold on a second it will in a second because this thing is super super important now this is what happened to the stock give or take year to date it started with a 52-week low about six dollars it drove up to 19 about a week ago which is the 52-week high and it's currently settled in at 17.8 dollars which is today's end of trade day now here's how I look at it as a long-term investor in my opinion the best way to invest in a stock like Palantir is to dollar cost average over time that means I don't panic sell I don't FOMO I don't lump sum every single week I take a certain amount of money which I calculate for my budget and I put it in the stock market and I divide it in between the stocks I want to invest in a Tesla a Palantir the S&P 500 all by the way things I have in my portfolio and then they just put it in and I make sure that I put 30 of the money on the side so if my allocation says that I can spend a thousand dollars investing in the stock market every single week okay cool so if a thousand bucks is what I have to put in the market every single week so I'm gonna take seven hundred dollars and I'm gonna put it to work 300 is going to go to the side those seven hundred dollars which I am putting into the market they will go towards Palantir towards Tesla towards S&P 500 in your case it's different stocks and that's okay everybody have their own stocks right that 300 stays to the side now I'm dollar cost averaging I'm dollar cost averaging but then something happens the minute the stock whether it's Palantir or Tesla drops below the threshold line the 10 threshold line right here the 10 threshold line which is a line that signifies 10 below the 52-week high right here so if this is the 52-week high 10 below it is 17 and 10 cents 17 and 10 cents is going to be right here so the minute the stock drops below 17 and 10 cents I'm in the green zone in the green zone I'm now dollar cost averaging at a double pace and where's this double coming from from that 300 from that thirty percent I've put to the side every time I've allocated money to the stock market I'm now taking money out of that 30 pool that I have lying on the side and now I'm doubling down I'm doubling down I'm doubling down the whole time this thing is in the green zone I'm dollar cost averaging every single week but at the Double Pace instead of a hundred dollars each week two hundred dollars each week but the moment this stock goes into the Red Zone it goes above 17.10 above the 10 threshold line it goes to the Red Zone and dollar cost averaging normally I'm no longer doubling down I'm all dollar cost averaging normally as long as it stays in the red zone right now the stock as you can see right here is in the red zone it's above seventy dollars and ten cents it's currently flying up as long as this thing is in the red zone I'm not doubling down on the stock I'm normally DCA buy more of the stock when it's dropping that's the right way to do it buying a little bit less of the stock when it's flying up that's also the right way to do it the absolute wrong way to do it is to sell and ignore the stock when it's dropping and buy like crazy because it just went up because you have this fear of missing out oh my god I've missed the crane oh no guys if you are excited about Palantir and you may or maybe not this isn't financial advice I'm not telling you to buy yourself Palantir but if you are excited about Palantir I'm going to say right now you have five years to invest into the stock this thing has time if your dollar cost average over the next five years slowly using the green zone in the Red Zone you'll be fine there's no reason to rush into anything in the stock market definitely not a growth stock like Palantir we have dedicated rooms for Palantir and Tesla and a bunch of other stocks but you know if you're watching this video join our

Tom Nash,U_8AMHVw5e8,2023-07-28T22:26:03Z,The *Actual* Smartest Palantir Stock Analyst Of ALL TIME,Airbus,so in 2015 Palantir started working with Airbus on their Flagship plane the A350 they've made it faster safer better cheaper but mainly they've cut the production time of This Plane by 33 percent now carrying this production Time by 33 percent it's kind of a big deal let me show you why because we're talking about a lot of moving Parts these are the moving Parts we're talking about ladies and gentlemen five million Parts literally in this plane it's manufactured over four countries hundreds of teams eight different factories Palantir came in made this whole thing into one holistic View and with its AI system they've managed to cut the production time of This Plane by 33 percent they looked at the production lines at the schedules the parts the deliveries defects Human Resources work orders quality everything went into one big pile data goes into the pile AI finds the answers allows you to cut production Time by 33 percent on this massive plane data piled up into one big pile AI drives better decisions that's literally the business model of Palantir that's all it is the Simplicity of it is actually quite insane take all the data you can find it's all siled completely separately put it all together get an AI to help you make better decisions with the massive amounts of data that you have but you don't know how to apply to get things faster cheaper better well then what you get 33 33 decline in the production time of the A350 because I think when you start to look at that for them is really the opportunity.,0.9,0.7
Tom Nash,U_8AMHVw5e8,2023-07-28T22:26:03Z,The *Actual* Smartest Palantir Stock Analyst Of ALL TIME,Snowflake,"so if Snowflake has 18 of its revenues go back as a stock based compensation and Palantir is at 22 percent I'm gonna say you know it's not too far it seems on par with Snowflake and Snowflake is a Warren Buffett investment so if Snowflake is good for 22 percent sorry 18 I apologize Palantir is good for 22 it's in the same realm it's within the realm of reason so I don't see any issue with that I think it's absolutely normal now going a little bit deeper here look the company is already GAAP profitable for two quarters in a row and it's supposed to be another two quarters profitable until the end of the year the customer profitability went up 41 year over year in the last quarter the price of sales of Palantir is 19. it's not cheap it's not a cheap company this isn't a value play let's put it this way it's a growth stock 19 price to sales is not cheap it's very expensive but again how expensive well again let's look at Snowflake, Snowflake is currently trading at 25. so if we compare Palantir to Snowflake just a reasonable comparison as far as you know the amount of revenues the style of the market they're in although they have absolutely different products that has nothing to do with each other right Snowflake is trading at 25 price to sales and Warren Buffett is investing in it Palantir is at 19 it's cheaper stock-based compensation as a percentage Revenue well Snowflake is 18 Palantir is at 22 they're in the same neighborhood so I would say this isn't unusual for a high potential high growth company.",1.0,0.6

Tom Nash,qliYDpM5AFw,2023-07-27T16:19:47Z,NEW Price Target For Tesla,Tesla,hey this is Tom Nash and I'm raising my price target for Tesla in the next three minutes you're going to see exactly why how and how much I see Tesla stock going in the next five years in the bear case the medium case and the bull case now Tesla's revenues are up almost 600 of the past five years gross profit up almost 900 for the past five years all while operating expenses only went up by 76 in just five years look at this return on capital for Tesla is actually very very high it's at 20 percent return on Equity is 26.5 percent the most profitable auto manufacturing the market although Tesla isn't exactly an auto manufacturer we talked about it multiple times the institutional shareholding for Tesla was pretty flat all the way until March 2022. institutions like BlackRock like Vanguard like State Street all of them started buying Tesla like crazy over the past year all of them they hate Tesla right but right now Tesla is at 45 institutional shareholding and look at the spike in institutional shareholding of Tesla this is isn't a coincidence you know they like to talk about how much they hate Tesla but you know judge people by their actions not about what they tell you that they're thinking or doing Middle Ground 914 and my bull case Tesla five years price started is fourteen hundred dollars which means I'm raising my price Target from 1200 to 1400 based on the latest earnings from Tesla which were phenomenal despite what the mainstream media is telling you the earnings were great the margins may have come down but the net income went up by the revenue went up the entire company is doing better than ever so don't let them fool you Tesla 1400 my new Target price,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,POvQDNoD0cM,2023-07-20T13:31:18Z,Elon Musk Just Dropped a Bombshell about Tesla's Future,Tesla,and we haven't even said a word about the fact that Tesla's still guiding for a 50 growth kegger we haven't said the word about the Bombshells that Elon dropped on the call that probably got him chewed out to the compliance department but he still said that that's Ilan for you hey this is style mash and yesterday Tesla came out with the second quarter financials now the qualities were amazing they broke a lot of Records they beat on Revenue they beat an earnings per share but somehow I still need these three apples to Simply explain to the Wall Street analyst that Tesla had a good quarter now one of the gripes of the Wall Street analyst with Tesla following their record-breaking financials that we saw yesterday was that Tesla has a declining margin the operating margin went down to 9.6 percent and that means bad news for Tesla and that basically sent the stock price down in aftermarket this is exactly what's going on with Tesla Tesla indeed had smaller margins but it had more revenue and it had more net income which means more apples despite having smaller pieces that's that way more apples in this quarter the model Y is now the best selling vehicle in the world not an AV the best-selling vehicle in the world they sold 270 000 units in q1 more than the Toyota Corolla by 10 000 Vehicles if Tesla's already beating out the queen of vehicles which is the dirt of Corolla and it's bidding it with a significantly more expensive vehicle what's gonna happen when Tesla actually rolls out the next gen platform the 25 000 car it's going to annihilate whatever's left of Toyota and that's not gonna be a good look for anybody that has a four-door sedan model out there so Tesla is already dominating and it doesn't even have the big weapon out imagine the potential this is nothing yet now talking about things that are in potential in development the Cyber truck is way more advanced the next gen platform I mean we already know the test has started tooling actually is stated in the financials and that means if tooling started we're about a year away from the beginning of ramp up that's huge because you have to understand that you know North America the best market for auto manufacturers is the pickup trucks Tesla's not even playing in that market yet so now Tesla is also joining into the best Market in America with this cyber truck it's not gonna happen 2023. I'm sorry if you want to ramp up you have to wait a little bit but luckily Tesla has plenty of pre-orders they're not going to be listed and going to be stuck with inventory that they can't move the Cyber truck is going to take a huge chunk out of whatever's left of Ford and GM in the place that it most hurts them the pickup trucks massive massive potential for Tesla and now boys and girls let's talk about the operating margin argument so all the analysts all the mainstream media Talking Heads running around telling you that Tesla is finished the operating margin of Tesla dropped to 9.6 it's over Tesla is losing margin it used to be 14 it's finished the only problem is that they don't understand how this thing works let's compare to the operating margin of other great companies like Toyota Toyota has an operating margin of eight percent lower than Tesla even though they make 10 million Vehicles a year Tesla with about 2 million a year has better margins in Toyota even at 9.6 or what about VW also eight percent eight million Vehicles a year I don't even talk about Ford GM with four to six percent operating margin and way more Vehicles than Tesla so if you look at the competition this is already beating them with 9.6 so even after the decline in operating margin Tesla still has the best margins in the industry and that's without the Cyber truck which is going to push margins up without the FSD which is going to roll out an 80 gross margin because it's a SAS service is a software model even before all these things Tesla is already annihilating data companies even with the decline margin so before you go ahead and tell the world that Tesla is finished and the growth story is busted look at the competition get some help get some context and now let's talk about the second part of this argument remember the Apple example well it's actually right in front of you Tesla just had a record beating quarter as far as revenues 25 billion dollars in revenues in a single quarter Tesla is currently on pays for a hundred billion dollars in revenues per year absolutely mind-blowing but that's not the point the point is looking at the bottom line look at net income the net income is up 20 from last year at 2.7 billion dollars so if I'm looking at this like a normal person Layman and I'm saying well look the operating margin went down to 9.6 that is true but if Tesla made more Revenue by 46 and more net income which is the bottom line by 20 and they've generated 2.7 billion dollars in net income I mean this is what happens when you can increase sales by 46 by dropping prices a little bit and still contain your costs only raising it 21 so when your revenues go up 47 and costs only go up 21 you still make lots of money even though the offer bring margin went down a little bit it's just a percentage at the end of the day you've made way more money Tesla is probably the most efficient company I've seen not the most efficient auto company that we knew a long time ago at this point it's mind-boggling to me how they're doing this and more on that later but you have to understand look at the financial stability of this company one billion dollars of free cash flow this year the cash is up 22 from 19 to 23 billion virtually no debt I mean Tesla's logo need to be in the dictionary next to the definition of a bulletproof company at this point who is going to destroy this tank and we haven't even said a word about the supercharger Network growing like crazy up 33 tens of thousands of charges who has that Network we haven't said a word about Tesla being the fastest growing EV brand in Europe we haven't even said a word about 222 increase in storage deployment what are we talking about here we haven't said a word about the amount of Miles this is getting talk about AI race this does the most amount of miles in the industry and it's actually exponentially growing nobody's going to catch them as far as Ai and real world data if anything we're talking about a massive AI company completely under the radar look at Nvidia Nvidia is trading at 44 price to sales Tesla's at 11. Nvidia is you know 240pe this is 80. if anything test this country way cheaper than it should be because when you understand that this is actually not just the car company which they seem to struggle with still in 2023 you realize that this company is not trading expensive at all and we haven't even said a word about the fact that Tesla's still guiding for a 50 growth kager we haven't said the word about the Bombshells that Elon dropped on the call one being the Tesla's gonna 5x or 10x from here that probably got him chilled out by the compliance department but he still said that that's Inland for you we haven't even said a word about them being in talks with other oems about licensing Out full self-driving software I mean this is like massive stuff and yet they're getting ignored for 9.6 operating margin which is still the best in the business is this for real look we're talking about a company that has the smallest volume of all the biggest oems they have the best margins they're investing in massive amount of copics massive amount of r d working on multiple expensive projects building factories building robots building AI building cars somehow they're not only profitable but they're still the most profitable in the business 25 billion dollars in Revenue 2.7 billion dollars in net income this quarter and actually the Cyber truck would improved margins FSD the 25 000 car all these things and the fact is we haven't even mentioned the most important stuff the fact is they already have the best selling vehicle in the world and the fact that we had a record-breaking quarter in almost every single category in the world and still somehow we are here talking about 9.6 operating margin we're talking about margin margin we're talking about margin these guys had record-breaking numbers record-breaking Revenue record-breaking net income best-selling car in the world massive amount of upside and we're talking about margins really.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,CNJJ5aNUPhc,2023-07-19T14:43:24Z,Palantir - Revealing New Investing Strategy,Palantir,hey everybody this is Tom Nash and palantir is hitting new highs. The 52-week high for Palantir is currently in the making yesterday we closed at 18 and 13 cents right now as you can see on the screen the price action is up to 18.4 and it's testing new highs what does this mean for me why am I issuing this warning and how does this completely change my dollar cost average about palantir. This is how the Palantir strategy for me looked like be before yesterday Seventeen dollars and sixteen cents was the 52-week high and for me ten percent below that was 15.44 the green area which is 10 below the 52-week high is where I doubled down on my dollar cost averaging the red area is anything above that threshold amount of 15.44 is where I normally DCA I don't cost average all the time but the amount changes based on the current price of the share if it's within the green zone I'm doubling within the red zone I'm DCA normally now yesterday Everything Has Changed I'm gonna do it in exactly one minute not more I don't want to waste your time you're busy I understand this so no fluff today look look at this thing right here Everything Changes today this is what it looked like when the trading stopped yesterday this is exactly how it looked like 18 and 13 cents became the new 52-week high which means that it raised the threshold amount from 15 to 16.3 Dollars now currently the new 50 is being formulated today so it might change for example if we go to 18.4 it's going to make our threshold amount 16.5 but for the purposes of this video Let's assume it's going to end at 1813. in that case my Red Zone starts from 16.3 anything below 16.3 I'm going to double down anything above 18.13 and between that range from 18.13 to 16.3 is my Red Zone in my red zone I'm normally dollar cost averaging the point here I'm making is very very simple the point is that I want a dollar cost average into the stock all the time but I want a dollar across average more when it's below the average when it's below the average I'm dollar cost averaging more hence at the end of the day in two years time three years time five years time 10 years time my average cost basis in the stock is way closer to the bottom than it is to the top and I haven't tried to time the market I spent little to no time on this stock whatsoever except researching it on the movements the technicals no anxiety no Panic no emotions absolute you know statistical Heaven almost to the point where it's a system it's a discipline and you just do it almost in a mechanic way. Palantir isn't the only company in the world. And don't forget palantir is the deal.,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,Y_hpp1PngkY,2023-07-18T15:14:57Z,URGENT Warning About Tesla,Tesla,hey this is Tom mash and I have an important warning for every single Tesla shareholder out there whether you're an existing shareholder or you're thinking about becoming a Tesla shareholder listen to this video I made a similar warning back in May of 2022 and I was right and a lot of people who didn't listen lost out on a lot of money so you better listen up this is important look the bottom line of my videos always comes first so before I dive deep into my actual analysis here is the bottom line if you don't want to watch the whole video I'm going to show you in this video why Tesla is the biggest opportunity right now in the stock market the most misunderstood company in the stock market and probably the most undervalued stock of every single big cap out there despite its Behemoth of an 880 billion dollar market cap I know that sounds crazy but follow through with me if you got time till the end of this video and I'll show you statistically logically based on the objective facts on calculations why this is indeed the case before we go into this deep dive analysis I want to explain to you something even if we follow through with the flawed logic where Tesla is just a car company and we ignore everything else we ignore the fact that Tesla is an energy company an AI company a robotics company a tech company a million different other things that it does well and we just go with the car business even based on that logic the current price is more than Justified look the total addressable Market of Tesla currently is still massively untapped right now in the United States only six percent of all vehicles sold are electric vehicles 94 of the market is still untapped now who's leading that market who sells the most amount of EVS in North America it's Tesla by Country Mile and it's going to continue to be so because it has the best products the best software the best infrastructure etc etc there's many reasons why Tesla you know more data than everybody else and it builds more factories than anybody else the biggest ramp up the best margins I can do this all day Tesla is going to remain the number one EV producer in the world specifically in North America is going to dominate because it's playing against bozos GM and Ford are not even trying I mean at least you got VW in Europe and you got byd in China somebody's trying over there in the US nobody's even giving in competition so even if you look at Tesla as a car company the car company that I'm talking about here is still fairly valued at 880 billion dollars look at my most recent DCF which I posted my most recent DCF only takes into account the auto business with this cyber truck now with this cyber truck this is a 270 dollar stock just based on the auto business and that confused a lot of people in my previous video because they said well Tom your DCF showed the Target price of 270 for Tesla the stock is currently 290 So based on your DCF Tesla is overvalued well this is kind of a misunderstanding of the point I was making number one I was running an extremely bearish this year looking what was the floor what was the bare case of Tesla based on just the auto business so in my DCF what I was showing you is that what Tesla is worth as a car company based on only 35 growth and if 14 discount rate based on these harsh parameters the stock price was 270 dollars so that's the floor of Tesla right now in my opinion this is not a recommendation to buy or still Tesla this is not Financial advice I'm just sharing with you my opinion might be inaccurate might be wrong might be the ram is of a Madman you know the drill but basically now we start adding layers on top of this and we're saying well Tom right if the car company Tesla at its worst is a 270 dollar stock how much is the stock actually worth to you now you're asking the right question and now you understand why I've been basically buying the crap out of the stock for the past three years along with palantir well here's the reason check it out look at what's going on right now with AI there's a massive AI hype cycle everybody's excited about AI what is the flagship of this AI hype cycle you know the answer it's Nvidia everybody's looking at Nvidia as the leader in Ai and rightfully so they're terrific company great CEO terrific products you know great strategy great Runway you name it Nvidia has got it and you know they're the best in their business but you have to understand that Tesla is also an AI company in fact Tesla has an AI product which is a b2c AI product that actually makes money actually is being used by millions of people every day which is the FSD and that FSD is getting better every single day because it acquires so much data every single day so we're talking about a company with massive amounts of data which is a leader in AI so I would say it's pretty comparable to Nvidia and virend Tesla are both leaders in Ai and now the rubber hits the road because now I'm going to show you how you can actually compare these two companies because at the end of the day a DCF a discounted cash flow valuation is not the only way to evaluate a company you look at the company for every single possible angle you do a DCF you run a comparables analysis you look at multiples you look at all these things together so if a DCF is not my only way what else can I look at well let's go back to our Nvidia versus Tesla if nvidian Tesla are somewhat comparable as leaders in AI then let's look at their multiples Nvidia is currently trading at a massive 44 price to sales now Tesla is trading at 11 price to sales so it's definitely four times worse than Nvidia based on these numbers we just looked at I don't think Nvidia is four times better accompanied than Tesla and I think most people would agree with me so if that's the case what are we doing here let's look at other metrics let's put aside price to sales which is one comparable we can use and let's look at price to earnings price to earnings this is trading at 80 Nvidia is trading at 240. so again is NVIDIA three times better than Tesla as a company I doubt it does Nvidia have more upside do they have better technology better AI better people I would argue Tesla has the best engineers in the business it has massive amounts of cash massive ramp up massive total addressable Market 90 percent of which isn't even yet you know tapped in yet even at my most pessimistic estimations at least 30 to 40 percent of the U.S market is going to be electric right now it's six all of it is up for grabs many many dollars that will count down the pipeline for Tesla many revenues and then if it a margin of 19 which I think they will keep it's massive amounts of profits and here's the problem here when I went to business school and did my MBA this is what they taught me on day one the market is perfect everybody have all the information and everybody knows everything at the same time and every stock is perfectly priced in this is the Assumption of the perfect market and you know if this assumption was 100 true then we couldn't make any money in the stock market to begin with so by definition this definition is faulty but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's complete BS the market as a whole is really good at pricing the entire Market on average but the market is notoriously bad at pricing in individual companies for a short period of time and when this is short I mean two to three four five years five years is a short period of time so at any given time point a certain company has a good chance of being mispriced by the market and if you can catch it when it's down you can ride the wave when it actually gets priced in this is how Warren Buffett made his money he bought cheap companies that were undervalued and eventually the market picked up on it and the companies gained value and he made money so even if you look at my own DCF in which I ran the Tesla DCF based on the car company assumption with just the Cyber truck you'll find out that on the side I had an ebitda multiple calculation and even a multiple calculation is something I always add to the mix to have a nice average not to be stuck just on my DCF and as you can see the number I used there was 10. I took the final year of massive growth of Tesla before it went long-term growth four percent I've multiplied it by 10 and I discounted it back to today using a 14 discount rate and the value I got for that was about 900 billion dollars and now let me ask you a question what happens if we change that number that 10 you see over there and we put in 21. but why would we do that Tom well because when you evaluate a tech company the right multiple for the ebitda multiple system is 21 not 10. the only reason I use 10 is to be cautious and to be an a-hole with my DCF and my valuation the proper way to evaluate a tech company is a 21 ebitda multiple so in a 21 ebitda multiple Tesla should be valued at 1.7 trillion dollars and that's with a 14 discount rate which is very harsh Tesla even at 800 plus billion dollars is still an incredible opportunity to make a lot of money in the stock market if you are patient and if you're willing to give time to the market to price it correctly I think it's still heavily mispriced that's why I'm dollar cost averaging into the stock every single day.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,jjapmUKHx3A,2023-07-17T13:16:02Z,Tesla is about to EXPLODE,Tesla,so how important is this cyber truck to Tesla's share price now we just heard the announcement the Cyber truck will commence production and 2024 will be the first year when we actually see some ramp up with regards to the Cyber truck but the real question here is how big is this for Tesla as a company and more importantly for investors how big is this for the share price because at the end of the day every single Tesla investor cares about the share price long term so how impactful is this on the share price of Tesla my name is Tom Nash and this is exactly the question we're going to answer today now I've made my own DCF a discounted cash flow valuation model of Tesla we're going to take a look at the DCF without the Cyber truck and the DCF after the Cyber truck gets into ramp up and we're gonna see the difference of the share price and don't forget the stock market is always forward looking so whatever I'm going to show you on the screen is quickly going to get priced in into the current share price of this stock it doesn't wait for the thing to happen but once that certainty level goes up it's going to get mostly priced in very very quickly especially with the stock like Tesla that tends to price in future success very very quickly so the opportunity window here isn't big as always in Tesla's case there will be people who will be cynical and negative and they will miss out and that's okay this video is not for them every DCF model at the end of the day is one thing and one thing only the sum of all the cash flows that Tesla will generate in its life cycle discounted back to today based on the risk profile of the company this is the calculation of the whack the weighted average cost of capital of Tesla so the weighted average cost of capital of Tesla is 14 now the reason it's 14 is very very simple just to keep things on a high level is because Tesla has no debt virtually so the cost of capital of Tesla will be primarily average of the cost of capital it has and since they don't have debt then it's pretty much 100 based on how much the equity cost is and the equity cost for Tesla is 14 now the way it's calculated is not very complicated you can see it here on the screen you can pause the video but essentially we take the risk-free rate we take the uh the equity percentage we take the overall Equity value the risk premium which is pretty much how much you can get in the s p minus the risky rate and we create a calculation that gives us 14 for Tesla now 14 isn't cheap it's a high cost of capital most people that do Tesla DCFS use either 10 or 12 and I think that's wrong I think 14 although it's very um harsh on Tesla this is the right way to do it so this I think Tesla is a 14 discount rate we have a 35 Revenue growth without the Cyber truck and at the end of the day we're going to base it on a 19 EB down margin this is what we're going to get as far as a DCF now this DCF includes a 73.3 billion dollars capex Capital expenditures mainly to build new factories again without the Cyber truck 730 billion I think is normal and an eight percent effective tax rate which is where Tesla operates in the general sense of the world now 133 billion dollars is what we get here and that is how much Tesla present value of all their future cash flows is worth 583 billion this is the total value of Tesla without the Cyber truck based on my DCF of course I'm also using here a multiple in a video multiple of 10 and that's going to give me 676 billion dollars so without the Cyber truck Tesla based on a very very conservative model with 4 fourteen percent discount which is very high 73 billion of spending on Capital expenditures is between 583 billion and 676 billion as it stands now obviously it's trading at 880 billion dollars but this is just to show you the impact now we're going to add in the Cyber truck the only thing we're going to change here is we're going to add another 20 billion dollars in capital expenditures we're going to go up to 94 billion dollars in capital expenditures from 73 because we believe that another 20 billion is what it will take to build more factories to make these extra cyber trucks and we're going to assume that Tesla will eventually ramp up to 100 300 to 500 000 units of cyber trucks at the maximum level capacity for the near future again same data same discount rates same everything but look at what the difference is here 773 billion dollars of total value and 916 in multiple value and now let's go back to the original DCF and look at the share price here in the original DCF without the Cyber truck Tesla currently 199 dollars per share but once you factor in just the Cyber truck no semi no insurance no the Tesla bot none of this AI stuff no Robo taxi we still have a lot of things to add to this DCF to actually make it make sense but just the Cyber cologne adds from 199 dollars to 266 dollars this is with the Cyber truck so we're talking about an ad of about 70 dollars per share just on the Delta between without the Cyber truck with the Cyber truck so that's a 70 bump in the share price which I see that will be reflected at the share price from this point on I don't know how long it's going to take with the case of Tesla it usually takes a lot faster than other companies because Tesla tends to price in future success now always always remember with Tesla it's always pricing in the future faster than most other companies so it will never be trading at the level that is the fair value Tesla is always trading forward it's always trading based on future success so when you get this fair market value of 266 dollars don't expect the company to drop to it it might it might not I don't know I don't have a crystal ball this is not Financial advice I'm not telling you to buy or sell Tesla I'm just telling you that I believe the difference the impact here if you were wondering what's the impact of the Cyber truck on the Tesla share price it's another 70 today to the share price again I don't know when it's going to be reflected how long it's going to take how much of it is already reflected but that's the difference I think it's massive for Tesla it's massive for the Auto industry because at the end of the day we're talking about Tesla entering for the first time in history into the most lucrative Target Market in the United States Auto industry the trucks I mean the pickup trucks this is the bread and butter of the US Auto industry in fact the North American not only industry and Tesla finally jumping in into that category for the first time in its history is going to rock everybody's World we're talking about a very cautious estimate here that 70 I think is just the start,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,m6XKQ7LU2GA,2023-07-12T12:52:26Z,Inflation Drops To 3% - This Changes Everything,Federal Reserve,the last two times John Powell the FED of the uh the chair of the Fed was asked about interest rates for the rest of 2023. the last two times he was asked about us he was categorically saying without any doubt that there will be 100 interest rate increases before the end of 2023. now for the two times that he said it nobody believed him the market ignored it the market basically called this a bluff now just last week when the employment numbers came out everything all of a sudden change employment numbers were hotter than expected which basically means that the economy is doing way better than expected it's too hot and all of a sudden there were cracks in the Jerome Powell is bluffing Theory and then you saw a few red days because the market started pricing in the option in fact the probable option right that Jerome Powell will indeed increase rates before the end of this year to cool down this Market but now with what just happened today it's a whole different ball game now the whole theory that was predicated on John Powell basically bluffing is becoming way more probable than before with three percent inflation the U.S economy is now one percent away from its Target we started off with nine percent exactly a year ago we're currently at three percent and our Target is two percent we're literally one percent away is there a reason for the Central Bank of the United States the Federal Reserve to increase rates in this scenario well realistically not so much because according to the gold standard of setting interest rates to battle inflation which is the Taylor rule the Taylor rule specifically states that the way to calculate how much interest rate you need is very very simple you calculate how much inflation you have which is three percent you deduct from that the good inflation the acceptable inflation which is two percent and you get one percent you multiply that by two you get two percent so according to the Taylor rule just roughly speaking we're okay with two to three percent interest rate to battle three percent inflation we are currently at 5.25 Federal fund rate we're way higher than where we should be given the fact that we're three percent inflation is there Central Bank in the world with a right mind and sound mind that would increase rate in this scenario probably not and that basically punches a massive hole in what Powell and his Compadres were trying to do for the past few weeks Powell has been trying to intimidate the market into submission by saying we're going to increase rates he was speaking it into existence scaring the market causing people to spend less causing businesses to fire more people and basically slowing down the economy by scaring it like a bouncer scares people in front of the club nobody fights the bouncer because he's big and menacing nobody fights it nobody wants to test the bouncer so the idea was powers to scare the market the market is going to drop down and then there were no no need would be for the interest rate hikes I don't think at any stage the Federal Reserve had any serious intentions of actually raising rates in 2023 maybe they still will that would be very stupid if they will but maybe they still will but we said this on our patreon community many times patreon.com forward slash top Nash on our Zoom calls our members Below in the comments if you're a remember comment below tell them what I'm saying is right I've been saying a hundred times in our zuncles for the past few weeks Powell is 100 full of it's not gonna raise rates in 2023 there's no need for that and the threat worked especially with how the employment numbers came out but it worked to an extent now it's absolutely redundant with three percent inflation with five percent interest the market is going to slowly tumble down into a complete Halt and there would be no need for more interest rate hikes this has massive implications on the stock market for the remaining of the year now this means that from this point on whatever that was whatever chance of Powell raising rates that was still priced and baked into the market will now have to be eaten up by the market so this would mean maybe not today maybe not next week from this point on till the end of this year because of that three percent number that we just saw right now the market will have to price that in so this is a very bullish sign for the market for the next few months this means that the market to an extent will have a much more longer bullish cycle than what people initially give it credit for obviously we've seen a lot of hype from AI this is another log in that fire adding a three percent inflation into this hype cycle basically means that there's more gasoline in the tank for this rally for this bullish cycle how long it continues I don't know it actually will not be linear obviously nobody thinks it's going to go up shooting up in a straight line there would be red days and red times for sure but what just happened today that three percent is a very important sign it basically is that positive Catalyst that people were waiting for on the macro level to support all this hype from the AI side and the growth side now this is the beginning I believe of a very bullish cycle for the market for the next few weeks few months obviously you know it's going to be up and down but in general the direction would be positive um I think that power raising rates at this point would be hella stupid of course they might do it they're the fed and they've done stupid stuff before but I would hope not at this point because now it just seems that the best thing is for them to just keep it at five percent until inflation comes down two percent and then slowly started you know probably dropping it not to zero but you know closer to two or three percent which is where it should be,1.0,-0.8
Tom Nash,5l4TCY6FoT4,2023-07-10T13:46:26Z,Why Palantir,Palantir,hey my name is Darwin how in the world these things I'll share with you in a second are not widely discussed these things that make Palantir a massive candidate to go from 30 billion to a trillion dollar valuation and yet somehow nobody talks about this I just don't understand now in this video I'm not going to regurgitate things I've talked about for the past two years the great balance sheet this thickness the terrific product I'm gonna let other people do that I'm going to talk about things major things that make Palantir great and give it a chance of going to that one trillion dollar valuation now is it certain hell no there's nothing certain in life anyways except death and taxes and grandpa being crazy but that's it but do they got a shot yes especially with what I'm about to show you right now now look Palantir for the most part is a company that was out the Limelight nobody talked about them until they went public they dpo'd and all of a sudden everybody wants a piece of that and while I was the only one pretty much making Palantir videos when they were down now the sport life is back on this company and the question a lot of you are wondering is this for real or is this part of the hype because there's no doubting this we are in the middle of a hype cycle for AI this is quasi 2000. in the.com bubble there were a lot of great companies a lot of Great Tech but a lot of free writers so the question is is Palantir for real or not how can you tell and that's the question you should be asking yourself more than anything else for the past 20 years Palantir ahead of everybody was developing AI products for the government and then for Airbus for the past seven years products that have no room for mistakes products that were Battlefield tested products AI products that if they make a mistake people die literally on the battlefield in an airline these industries and these environments have no room for mistakes so this is a company that's dedicated hundreds of billions of dollars of r d into building AI products that cannot make mistakes at least not often and at least not big ones name another company that did that for the past 20 years I don't think you can now the second thing I want you to understand is the fact that their government business the business that everybody likes to kick and Bash as if it's some sort of a dead weight the company's carrying now people starting to understand how big it is which company has solutions for these types of environments while everybody else were the piglets who didn't prepare Palantir is that piglet who bought the brick house or rather built a brick house and now everybody's trying to get in now it's not like Palantir is sitting there and saying oh yes thank you the world is going to crap that's exactly what we wanted no but they were warning you and they're the only ones who actually built solutions that are fitted to this instead of this Kumbaya around the campfire hugging trees this is the real world where people die where things happen where evil people exist and Palantir is actually offering you Solutions I'm okay with Palantir being on their right side of history and if you got a problem with that don't invest no issues but for me this is where it's perfect they're doing something that's important to me I morally agree with and they're gonna make a ton of money helping the United States and the West stay up front I'm totally fine with that and if you're not go right ahead invest in different companies I don't care but to me it's massive now Palantir doesn't care who wins this battle that's the crazy part they're selling you the shovels it's a gold rush and Palantir are really the shovel sellers they'll take whatever llm you got whoever wins this battle and they'll use that to upgrade your company to upgrade your performance just like they did with Airbus 33 faster production of the a350 the flagship plane millions of parts so they're agnostic to wins this battle between the AI Wars which makes them a perfect candidate to benefit them this whoever wins the AI battle now here's the crazy part about this people are still saying that Palantir is a consultancy for the love of God no consultancy is operating at 80 gross margin check me at this this should have been put to bed a long time ago people are saying Palantir is expensive sure it's not cheap at 16 price to sales but look at Snowflake it's showing in 24 price to sales I mean can you really say it's that expensive to me it's not to me it's investable people talking about institutional shareholding is low at 35 and I agree with that it's not as high as it should be it should be around the 60s but it's up 75 percent of the past three years it's getting better people talk about delusion yes it's a problem but it's getting slower now what am I doing here with Palantir so for me Palantir is a great company to hold for the next 20 years that doesn't mean I'm going to be blindly buying every time the price spikes because recently that's what happened I have a system and that system is very very simple I'm dollar cost averaging into Palantir based on the threshold amount I'm looking Palantir and I'm looking at what was the 52-week high for the stock the 52-week high for this stock was 17.16 17.16 what's the amount that's ten percent below that it's 15.44 that's my threshold amount anytime the stock price goes above that threshold amount and dollar cost averaging slower every time it goes below that amount and dollars cost averaging faster that's called dollar cost averaging using a weighted average basically what you're doing is you're creating a cost base over the course of a few years that's way lower to the bottom of the stock during that time than to the top without trying to guess the market without emotions without all this fluff without formal or anxiety or Panic you're taking out emotions out of the game and using discipline a system in the process to mathematically ensure you have a low cost basis in the stock and if you did pick out the right company which I have confidence in Palantir being so then you should be fine now Palantir isn't the world's only company in fact it's not the only company in my portfolio you want to be able to diversify to build a bulletproof portfolio for the next 20 years 15 years 10 years 25 years whatever it is you have until your time and the way to do it is locating identifying evaluating and dollar cost averaging into great companies slowly over time using a discipline a system and process with no emotions.,0.98,0.85

Tom Nash,c9wIxt5XQ9A,2023-07-05T14:21:39Z,The NEW And Improved 3 Fund Portfolio,S P 500,the US companies the ones that you have in the S P 500 all of them all of them are multinational corporations which means that although they are registered in the US and they possibly have U.S management these companies have massive exposures to every single Market that matters around the world. The S P 500 already includes companies that have exposure to all world and if you have that exposure N1 which is the S P 500 there's no need for an overlap by buying more World ETF. The S P 500 is for all intensive purposes it's a global ETF because it has companies that hire massive multinational corporations. So if we do not need an overlap so what do we replace the global with because so far you know it's been kind of the basic vocal strategy right S P 500 and then non-us including U.S stocks ETFs right? Now think about this way bonds us S P 500 us NASDAQ how to split it up well if you are under 30 which some of you are I have audience below 30 I hope then you shouldn't put more than 10 in bonds and then the rest is 45 45 even split between the S P 500 and the NASDAQ even Steven if you're between 30 and 40 then you should go up to 20 bonds and then they have 40 in S P 500 or other us broad market and then 40 in U.S growth again even Steven. But in the composition of s p 500 and NASDAQ you literally take 20 off you carve it out from the NASDAQ and you add it to the sp100 so that S P 500 is now your biggest chunk with 60 and then you have 20 bonds twenty percent of NASDAQ you de-risking your portfolio essentially prepping yourself as you get closer to retirement. Then 50 percent goes into bonds 25 in Broad Market 25 and basically a NASDAQ equivalent and then 16 above 60 is in bonds thirty percent is 500 and 10 is in the NASDAQ so you're seeing the pattern here. Of course you know you can inter swap anything here you don't have to use the S P 500 you can use whatever as long as this broad Market U.S anything here is possible to if everything here is interchangeable but the ideas are the same. Look at the S P 500 over the past 23 years since 1999 um the US had three major recessions and in those three major sessions there was a lot of pain but if you look at this 500 in the long range from 1999 until 2023. In those 23 24 years the sap funded gave you on average 10 a year now if you got an average annual return of 10 per year for Destiny 500 for 23 24 years even though it saw three recession periods massive ones.com mortgage covered and still it gave you 10. Sure there's been bad years there has been even a bad decade from 1999 to 2009 the S P 500 actually lost a percent in 10 years so there will be lost years there will be lost decades sometimes in extreme situations but over the course of 23 24 years which is what most of you have in your portfolio over that time it's very hard to beat the S P 500 if you stay long enough in it it's going to give you 10 a year and that's why I'm saying you don't need um xus stocks ETFs scp-500 NASDAQ pawns and then you just every few years rebalance it based on your age and increase bonds decrease the risk by you know decreasing NASDAQ and that's it as simple as that.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,c9wIxt5XQ9A,2023-07-05T14:21:39Z,The NEW And Improved 3 Fund Portfolio,NASDAQ,my own personal one is that you can add a lot of spies and Pizzazz to this thing by going NASDAQ. Now if you include the NASDAQ or similar high growth U.S based because remember U.S companies are multinational so you're getting all world if you're going high growth us at number two instead of non-us stocks what you're getting is a massive Global index with U.S growth U.S S P 500 which is Broad market and U.S bonds I think that's a better mixture than the old classic 1999 model. So Daddy is very simple so instead instead of having a non-us stock CTF what we're going to put in is that let's say the qqqm which is the NASDAQ 100. Now think about this way bonds us S P 500 us NASDAQ how to split it up well if you are under 30 which some of you are I have audience below 30 I hope then you shouldn't put more than 10 in bonds and then the rest is 45 45 even split between the S P 500 and the NASDAQ even Steven if you're between 30 and 40 then you should go up to 20 bonds and then they have 40 in S P 500 or other us broad market and then 40 in U.S growth again even Steven. But in the composition of s p 500 and NASDAQ you literally take 20 off you carve it out from the NASDAQ and you add it to the sp100 so that S P 500 is now your biggest chunk with 60 and then you have 20 bonds twenty percent of NASDAQ you de-risking your portfolio essentially prepping yourself as you get closer to retirement. Then 50 percent goes into bonds 25 in Broad Market 25 and basically a NASDAQ equivalent and then 16 above 60 is in bonds thirty percent is 500 and 10 is in the NASDAQ so you're seeing the pattern here. Of course you know you can inter swap anything here you don't have to use the NASDAQ you can use similar growth. Scp-500 NASDAQ pawns and then you just every few years rebalance it based on your age and increase bonds decrease the risk by you know decreasing NASDAQ and that's it as simple as that.,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,Pflwdtqm0Uw,2023-07-03T18:44:25Z,Revealing the Truth About Tesla,Tesla,hey everybody this is Tom Nash and today is a great day for you if you are a Tesla investor over the weekend Tesla smashed deliveries with 466 000 Vehicles delivered way more than anticipation and 480 000 Vehicles produced way more than the anticipation this is a theme that's recurring with Tesla although some experts are always surprised somehow every single time that happens but Tesla always always delivers and some now in this video I want to cover two things that are important to me as a test investor and I'm assuming they're important to you as a test investor number one what does it all mean for Tesla investors going forward and number two what is my personal strategy with my Tesla shares given what just happened and in this notebook I got all the answers so you want to stick around till the end of the video where I'll give you my strategy going forward as far as my Tesla shares and my investment plans going into the future with Tesla but before we do so we have to talk about what just happened Tesla over delivered again they prove that they're really good at executing again and yes I know Elon sometimes over promises things and he doesn't always give them to you on time but think about it this way would you rather Elon give you something that's Half Baked just to meet a deadline here's a large soundtrack for you right come on he wants it to be perfect and yes the Cyber track is delayed the semi is moving slow sure but he's not going to put out something that's not to his eyes good enough and I respect that now the same people who were telling you that Tesla will never give you 500 000 vehicles in a single year back in 2018 are now telling you that Tesla is never going to outperform VW and Toyota and all them companies out there which is some sort of a joke but let's talk about it so Tesla delivered more cars in the first two quarters of this year than they delivered in the entire three quarters of last year and currently they're on page to deliver 1.8 million Vehicles this year now obviously nothing is certainly life except death and taxes and there's no certainty of anything but they're on the right path their pace is absolutely phenomenal and yes I know this is exciting and you all want to jump on the train start buying Tesla stock like there's nothing more of it wait wait a second there are hurdles and there are challenges we have to talk about in this video because I'm not here to fluff the Tesla share price or hype it up or just ignore the things that you know raise doubts you have to be in the position to be able to doubt to be skeptic about your favorite company and Tesla is definitely one of my two favorite companies I'm not gonna lie about it but here's the problem what we got yesterday over the weekend is just half the picture but that half is beautiful don't get me wrong absolutely great deliveries but you have to remember that Tesla draw prices to get to that point when you drop prices the amount of demand goes up it's basic economics so when Tesla dropped prices and we got that spike in The Leverage that's great but now we have to wait and see for the quarterlies which are coming up soon what is the impact on the profitability of Tesla because if this profitability gets eroded and goes down way way lower than it was before this increase in the demand and sales is not going to be as important as it could have been if the margins stayed High what I'm trying to explain to you here is that margins matter so the question here is how do these deliveries look in the context of Tesla's financials how much money Tesla made off of all these extra cars that it sold and I have a number in my hand so Tesla if they can deliver about 20 gross margin for automotive gross margin minus credits is terrific and I have a feeling that we're going to be very happy with the results but they might just poop out some bad results who knows we won't find out until we see the quarries I'm not going to pretend here like I got all the keys to the Future because I don't I don't have a crystal ball now I heard all this chatter about Tesla is never going to outsell Toyota and VW and all that crap look Tesla is already on the path to becoming the you know the best-selling car in the world right now the model Y is almost an 800 000 vehicles per year the Corolla is at 1.2 million per year at the pace at which Tesla is growing that pace is phenomenal let me just remind you Tesla sold 500 000 vehicles in a year just three years ago in those three years they went from 500 000 vehicles to currently 1.65 million trading 12 months vehicle sales so Tesla tripled their vehicle sales in three years Toyota I can assure have not tripled their vehicle sales so if model Y is currently 800 000 Corolla is 1.2 million the model Y is going to outpace the Corolla within the next two years it's almost a certain again be careful with that word certainty but you know what I mean here so if Tesla overrides Corolla that's going to be just the first step in an inevitable process in which Tesla is going to become the world's largest auto manufacturer so do you buy now like crazy do you go oh my God we haven't even said anything about the robo taxi the insurance the AI the Robotics and Tom is already talking about Tesla overtaking the Corolla number is the Toyota oh hold your horses okay so this still has a huge constraint to overtake Toyota it still needs to go from 1.8 million cars a year to 10 million cars a year so it needs to 5x its production and although the only thing that's stopping Tesla from becoming the world's largest auto manufacturer in the world is their ability to produce those 10 million cars that is true that ability is not simple you can just like here's five more million cars here's my final it doesn't work like this it takes years so I mean hold your horses it's not happening that fast now as um a prudent objective bull of Tesla here's how you look at Tesla the first thing you take a look at is the fundamentals now at the current price level of Tesla currently ranging in that 270 to 280 dollars per share we have to take a look at what's the value here for the investors straight up without all the hype and if we take a look at stock MVP which is the platform I co-founded which has all these tools for you to evaluate companies that's why we built it and you put Tesla through the ringer you're going to see a few interesting data points number one you're going to see the Tesla is trading at 70 price to earnings that's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but that's not hella expensive like some other companies that are on the AI hype it's very far from it at 70p given the fact that we have 22 billion of cash virtually no debt a 14 operating margin this is a very very interesting stock now again you have to pay for quality and 70p isn't cheap but I would call it in the range of reason on the expensive side how expensive well again on Stockton VP we have this tool called the DCF this kind of cash Revolution model and it will auto calculate it for you if you just give it a growth percentage so if we give Tesla if 50 growth percentage for the next five years with a 14 discount rate we're getting a value of 244 dollars per share which is a little bit a little bit expensive given the current 280 dollars per share so Tesla currently is trading above the range of 50 growth for the next five years every single year it's a big ask for Tesla now they can get it they can get it but it's not going to be simple and by now at these prices is pricing in a lot of this risk you'll be swallowing a lot of that risk but of course you can run your own model and figure out what's the price for you stock Dash mvp.com use the code last 40 to get a 40 off lifetime the code expires soon because we're moving to the iOS and that place has no coupon codes not allowed so this will go away in a few days last chance to get it at 40 off last 40 is the code run you're on the CF decide for yourself but the one thing I can tell you is that no matter which DCF you run you're never going to get to the conclusion when Tesla is currently very very cheap it's currently trading on this slightly more expensive side it's just a matter of fact now whether you think it can get to twenty five hundred dollars per share or not which I think is possible currently at the existing fundamentals of this company it's not creating cheap and no matter how much you love this company it's just a fact so if it's not trading cheap but you still think it's a generationally insanely good company you want to own what do you do in this situation do you really buy it at 280 well yes and no I'm going to explain now we have a method of buying great companies that are a little bit on the expensive side with the lower cost bases than most I'm going to talk about in a second now just to show you that I'm not blowing smoke up your bum our opinion member Captain Chuck used this method and now three years after he started buying Tesla his cost basis in the company is 216 dollars in that time from which he started buying Tesla all the way to now the share price range from 147 to 407 dollars if he had tried to time it perfectly God knows what his cost basis would have looked like but because he used the system he's much closer to that 150 than to the 400 his basis is 216. it's almost at 150 so what is the system and how to use it for Tesla and how did Captain Chuck did it well very simple so look at Tesla it's 52-week high is currently 317 dollars per share if you calculate 10 below that that point is 280 dollars so you know the 280 dollars is that 10 line below the current 52-week high now if you already decided for yourself that you got a dollar cost average into Tesla by putting a fixed amount of dollars every single week into the stock as long as the stock is below that threshold amount the 280 dollars then you're putting double the amount that you've allocated and when the share price jumps above that 10 threshold in our case the 280 dollar line for Tesla at that point you go back and you start investing your regular fixed amount simple example if I invest a hundred dollars every week into Tesla as long as the share price is 10 below the 52-week high or lower I'm gonna go double and I'm gonna put in 200 but the moment the share price goes above 280 dollars above the threshold line that 10 off of the 52-week high and it goes inside that range I'm gonna go back into a hundred dollars no more 200 per week now I'm at 100 per week and I'm gonna stay at 100 per week as long as the share price stays above that threshold line and that way I'm creating a weighted average of my cost basis so when I look at it three years later I'm way closer to the bottom than to the top very very simple very effective that's how Captain Chuck did it now the system is not complicated I just showed you that you don't need my opinion for that but the hard part about the system is not the dollar cost average system the hard part is picking the right companies if your dog was average into a Lord's Town you're in trouble my guy that's all I'm saying so in my opinion the hardest part about the system isn't the discipline isn't the dollar cost average is picking the right company to DCA into for three years because if you made the right choice great if you made the wrong choice you're screwed so on our painting page 4 500

Tom Nash,Pflwdtqm0Uw,2023-07-03T18:44:25Z,Revealing the Truth About Tesla,Stock MVP,and if we take a look at stock MVP which is the platform I co-founded which has all these tools for you to evaluate companies that's why we built it and you put Tesla through the ringer you're going to see a few interesting data points number one you're going to see the Tesla is trading at 70 price to earnings that's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but that's not hella expensive like some other companies that are on the AI hype it's very far from it at 70p given the fact that we have 22 billion of cash virtually no debt a 14 operating margin this is a very very interesting stock now again you have to pay for quality and 70p isn't cheap but I would call it in the range of reason on the expensive side how expensive well again on Stockton VP we have this tool called the DCF this kind of cash Revolution model and it will auto calculate it for you if you just give it a growth percentage so if we give Tesla if 50 growth percentage for the next five years with a 14 discount rate we're getting a value of 244 dollars per share which is a little bit a little bit expensive given the current 280 dollars per share so Tesla currently is trading above the range of 50 growth for the next five years every single year it's a big ask for Tesla now they can get it they can get it but it's not going to be simple and by now at these prices is pricing in a lot of this risk you'll be swallowing a lot of that risk but of course you can run your own model and figure out what's the price for you stock Dash mvp.com use the code last 40 to get a 40 off lifetime the code expires soon because we're moving to the iOS and that place has no coupon codes not allowed so this will go away in a few days last chance to get it at 40 off last 40 is the code run you're on the CF decide for yourself but the one thing I can tell you is that no matter which DCF you run you're never going to get to the conclusion when Tesla is currently very very cheap it's currently trading on this slightly more expensive side it's just a matter of fact now whether you think it can get to twenty five hundred dollars per share or not which I think is possible currently at the existing fundamentals of this company it's not creating cheap and no matter how much you love this company it's just a fact,0.9,0.7
Tom Nash,Pflwdtqm0Uw,2023-07-03T18:44:25Z,Revealing the Truth About Tesla,Palantir,you're going to be part of a group which I'm teaching exactly that how to locate the next Tesla the next volunteer the next big company because as far as Tesla volunteer the secret is out just DCA to to Tesla descent to volunteer it's not Financial advice my opinion it might be an accurate might be wrong you know doing research but what the other companies out there there's still more opportunities out there so the way to find them is to locate these great companies and then they say into them,0.8,0.7
Tom Nash,1BjuVucVaFo,2023-06-30T12:53:17Z,Palantir: 7 Reasons To Invest Long Term,Palantir,hey this is Tom Nash and in this video I'm going to give you seven reasons why this is the perfect time to buy palantir stock now I know what you're going to say palampi ran up 140 year-to-date and you never want to buy into a spike that's the conventional wisdom but in case of palantir the thing is a little bit different because this company has the perfect setup to outperform everything in your portfolio for the next five years what I don't want people to do is Pile in into palantir right now at the current price level going YOLO basically going their kids fund money and putting it right into volunteer that's not the purpose of this video the fact remains that this stock is over hyped it's overbought and the current price level is a little bit too high than what it should be given that and given the fact that you know this is a good company you want to own for the next five years what do you do well wait till the end of the video and I explain how to buy into polenti right now the despite the hype and still keep your average cost very very low trust me not blowing smoke up your bum let's make a case of why palantir is going to outperform mostly everything you have in your portfolio I think for the next five years so the first thing I want to talk about as far as volunteer goes is the thing that doesn't get discussed often on mainstream media which is the US client acceleration now look at this this way in 2021 palantir had 20 clients on U.S commercial right now they have 155 clients so as far as U.S commercial clients palantir grew its customer base by eight times over the course of the last two years I don't know a lot of companies that can say that they have ax the customer base over two years especially given the craziness we've seen for the past two years given the bad macro we had still these guys have done an 8X on the client base now another thing I want to talk about is the Q over Q quarter over quarter average spend per commercial client palantir commercial clients have spent 28 more this quarter than they did in the previous quarter how many companies can give you 28 growth in commercial spend like that not a lot of companies policy commercial is literally on fire now the other thing I want to talk about is the fact that palletier had two consecutive quarters of positive Gap generally accepted accounting principles profitability for two quarters in a row that is something that people didn't believe Palatine can do even for one quarter but we just had two consecutive quarters and a guidance from the company basically saying hey the rest of this year the next three quarters will also be positive we're going to have a full year of Gap of stability in 2023. now that's awesome because it shows track record it shows trajectory but mostly it will fix the Achilles seal of palantir and one of the biggest weaknesses of volunteers so far has been the fact that institutional investors are not excited about this company for multiple reasons one being no gap of stability once we have four quarters of Gap profitability the institutional shareholding percentage of this company is going to go through the roof currently the institutional shareholding percentage of volunteer is around the mid-30s which is quite low now some companies can pull it off like a Tesla but for most companies a low shareholding percentage from institutional investors shows lack of stability shows volatility and basically scares off investors and it creates a volatile stock maybe volunteer can't but we would not mind seeing that percentage go to 40 50 maybe even 60 like in the case of most good companies if that happens the rest is history now another thing you have to understand if we do get four quarters consecutive quarters of Gap profitability this means palantir would be eligible for S P 500 inclusion which is a massive Milestone remember what happened to Tesla when Tesla got included in the S P 500 it went through the roof not saying it's going to happen in volunteer but it's going to be a major positive Catalyst we can't ignore now if you go back and you look at the business of volunteer look you may say that you don't fully understand what they do and I totally get it but look at the numbers and there's one thing I know nobody will pay 51 million dollars per year for 17 years for vaporware for stuff that don't work so if guys are paying 51 million a year over the course of the last 17 years that means their stuff work and not only that they have a network retention which is above 100 and their average spend for the top 20 clients is up 14 last year it was 44 million currently there's 51 million so they're not only growing Revenue by getting new clients which is important but you can clearly see that their existing clients are spending more every single year which is a sign of a good business it's a sign of stability and that is just the beginning of a trend but look I know what you're going to say right now if you look at the PE at least four would be for palantir it's above 60 which is very very high few companies justify that Tesla sure Nvidia probably but palantir look I know it ain't cheap but there's a solution to that you don't have to buy it at the top and keep the price levels High you don't have to guess you don't have to time the market I'm going to explain this isn't a cheap stock by any means but any stretch of the imagination but at 60p it's reasonably priced especially if you're going to use my system to dollar cost average and get a lower price space so yes 60pe isn't cheap but if you use the right system you can lower your cost basis and get it at effectively much much lower than that I'll show in a second how now look another thing I want to show you here is the revenue of the company so palantir did 446 in quarter one of last year we're talking about Millions this quarter they did 525 million so quarter one quarter one had to head 18 up which you should have known this by now but there's one thing they're not telling you look under the hood while the growth of revenues was 18 in a horrible macro year the growth of operating expenses was only five percent so this is a company that's able to grow 18 of revenues in a year with only spending five percent more on operating expenses this means that Gap is going to widen every year the profitability is only going to get better it's another sign that I'm dumbfounded we don't get to hear about mainstream media now obviously you know the fact that this company is sitting on three billion dollars of cash it has no debt which means it has massive amounts of opportunities no interest expenses no sensitivity or exposure to interest rates and stuff like that and it has one billion dollars of remaining obligations which means one billion of Revenue sitting in the bank which they will use for the next two years and it's going to spike up the revenue growth even more now another thing I want to talk about here is one of the you know battery Rams that people use against palantir which is stock based compensation the company is deluding shareholders yes it has a higher stock based computation than most companies and for good reasons which I've explained in previous videos now look at the end of the day look at the trend stock based compensation this year went down by 23 23 down and it keeps getting down every single quarter for the past year look at the comparison to the revenues the Stockbridge competition of palantir as a percentage of their revenues in 2021 was 57 which is insane I agree but last year it was 33 this year it is 22 and of course that number can come up but it's not going to go back to the 57 level that happened because of many reasons like going DPO like hiring a new sales force etc etc all these excuses don't matter because this problem is no longer a thing currently volunteer isn't unusual it has the same spend on Stockbridge compensation like any other company out there at least in the growth Tech space now look one thing I want to mention people talk about oh government business Etc et cetera look the government business of volunteer is not going to make them into a trillion dollar company it's not but it's a life vest it's there it's sticky it's not going anywhere if things get bad and if macro gets bad the government business of volunteer is going to keep it afloat while other companies will struggle so this company is not only Built For Good Times which of course people thriving it actually has downside protection by having 40 50 60 of his business in government that's going to protect them from bad times so you're not only getting the upside you're getting a lot of risk protection here and now to the trillion dollar question how do you buy this stock without the fomo without the emotions without all the craziness well look obviously you cannot buy the stock right now by going YOLO into the current share price that's a bad idea you play stupid games you win stupid prizes so what you do is you use our dollar cost average system you figure out what is the threshold amount for this company so if the 52-week high for volunteer is 17 and 16 cents you take out 10 below that which means 15.40 anytime the stock is below 15.40 you double down and you spend twice then your monthly allocation for palantir which you should have had by now watch the previous videos so anytime it goes up above 15.4 you spend half that and your dollar cost average more when it goes below the threshold amount your dollar costs average less when it goes above by the time it does settles in a couple of years whatever happens your cost basis because you double down more when the stock was down it's going to be way closer to the bottom than to the top and it will require discipline it will require patience and it's going to take a few years but you will get to the right spot without the phone without the hype without anxiety without all this answers.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,bnrBuW_JqFY,2023-06-28T21:50:34Z,I did a Tesla DCF (and the results blew me away!),Tesla,hey this is Tom Ash and let's do an objective no BS no hype no hate DCF real cash flow evaluation model on Tesla intrinsic value without all the nonsense all the noise I'm not going to be fanboying over the company I'm not going to be hating it you're not going to see crazy 3 000 price targets you're not going to see something silly like Gordon Johnson says like 50 a share no actual intrinsic value the value of the cash flows of Tesla over the life cycle of the company this counted back to today by adjusting it for risk let's say that we play a game and in that game you get a coin and you can throw this coin in the air and wherever it lands will determine how much money you get plans on heads you got a million dollars but if it lands on tails you get zero dollars and there's no do-overs you do it once and that's it so it's a 50 chance of winning a million bucks I mean it's a lot of money but what would you say if I told you that I'm gonna give you a choice and that choice would be to take a certain amount of money not to play the game instead of having a 50 chance in a million I'm gonna give you 100 chance 100 chance at something less how much money would you take to walk away from this game now most people will say two hundred thousand three hundred thousand dollars something in that range they would walk away from this game unless they're super risk hungry which most of us hear not so if 300 000 is your amount you're essentially replacement value then the risk adjustment you're putting on this game is seven hundred thousand dollars that's 700 is being adjusted for your risk because it's a lot of risk it's 50 risk of getting nothing so the risk adjustment here is seven hundred thousand out of a million that's all it is that's literally what this kind of cash evaluations are you tally up all the cash flows of the company and then you use a risk adjustment mechanic to figure out how much they're worth today when you eliminate all the risk simple as that or rather account for all the risk so let me pull this up on the screen I'm going to tell right away a lot of people going to be pissed at me for doing this because it's not going to make anybody specifically happy the Tesla Bulls are going to call it absolute nonsense they're going to say it's bearish the Tesla bears are going to call me a Tesla bull saying it's too bullish but the idea of a good model the idea of a good valuation is that we simply do not care simple as that we're gonna do something that serves us which is finding our own intrinsic value if you want to learn how to do this join our 4200 member patent community on painting.com Nash that community in my opinion is the best investing community in existence we have a lot of resources we have Tesla rooms palantir rooms and it's insanely active Discord an academy for Stock Investing so much going on I urge you to check it out and I'm going to talk about the academy towards the end this video I don't want to bore you with this so now I'm going to remove this little thing right here and let's go back to the data so for us to perform uh DCF on the Tesla we need to be able to know how to adjust the amount of cash flows we're going to find in a second what's the risk adjustment here well this is it it's called The weighted average cost of capital and this is how you adjust for it so number one you essentially have a mixture of debt and equity and your debt cost and your Equity cost are being Blended and then you get something that is representative of your weighted average cost of capital and we use that as a discount rate for our DCF so as you can see Tesla accidentally does not have any debt so the whole debt side of the Y calculation doesn't exist so Tesla's whack weighted average cost of capital will be determined solely by its Equity because it doesn't have any debt in that case the calculation becomes very very simple all we do is we look at the risk premium which is five percent which is S P 500 expected return this year minus 3.7 so I think it's very fair to say that this year we have a nine percent expectation from the stock market from the S P 500 so a five percent risk premium is totally okay so Tesla is operating at two beta a beta is the amount of volatility of a company compared to the index so two two beta is not low risky rate is 3.73 that's the 10-year Treasury and then the equity cost is a calculation by taking the risk-free rate and adding up to Beta multiplied by the risk premium and that's how we get 14 right here so 14 is the discount rate for Tesla now before you celebrate the higher the percent is the worse it is for the company the higher the percent is the lower the valuation will end up being so if 14 discount rate is considered very high very very conservative and it will work to the benefit of our model because it's going to make the model better because we're not using something silly like seven or eight percent discount rate it's actually higher than what it should be and that's good so what I've made here essentially I've made some assumptions you can go over them later but as you can see I'm focusing on Tesla auto I'm not talking about the insurance business the Optimus Prime the AI business the robot taxi none of this is here so I'm just looking at Tesla auto and how close is Tesla auto based on this valuation model to the price that I see in the market right now right so basically as you can see here you can check my my assumptions in a second but that's the sales I see this year so we have an ebitda of 23.5 billion dollars that's with a 19 margin and then on the right hand side there's little adjustments to higher growth of revenue for the next five years so 30 40 50 per year for the next five years and then at the bottom we have the tinkering ebitda that's based on that new Revenue so here on the screen you have the ebitda you have the effective tax rate of Tesla which is eight percent by the way if you want to get this data simply like the tax rate the ebitda numbers and all the stuff you can go to stock MVP I'm going to put it on the screen now stock Dash m3.com and code last 50 is the code to get it 50 off so all the data I'm looking at here was taken from stock MVP which is my platform so basically what we do here we'll look at this as a 30 growth per year it's the bear case for Tesla 73 billion dollars of capex for the next five years if 14 discount rate eight percent effective tax rate and what we get here is a valuation of 526 billion dollars that's the DCF valuation you can make it kind of a little bit more realistic by putting it side by side with the ebitda multiple evaluation which gives us 616 billion dollars and you can actually show us what's the blend the blend here below is 166 194 so the blend is 180 so bear case for Tesla the floor for Tesla seems to be 180 now the medium case everything that we did here is very very fairly simple all we did here is we increased the growth rate for the company from 30 to 40 and again we use the same 10 multiple for the ebitda everything is the same everything is identical so what we get here based on the multiple system is a value of 886 867 billion dollars sorry and then a DCF value of 774 billion dollars of course you have to add up all these cash flows from the five years and this present value of terminal value of the long-term growth rate and then whatever's left out of cash and cash equivalence um with the deduction of that obviously net of debt so in this medium case the value of the company ranges between 774 billion and eight six seven which means one thing the share price is ranging within 244 and 28 274. so the average is 260 bucks currently trading at 250 not a lot of meat on the bone as far as you know a trading opportunity however if you look at the 50 growth rate for revenues then you get something completely different at a 50 growth rate for Tesla which is doable we're still at 14 discount rate still at eight percent effective tax rate the number actually becomes 293 dollars to sixty four dollars because now we're looking at anywhere from 836 billion to 930 billion in valuation again 10 ebitda multiple and four percent long-term growth rate I urge you not to change that four percent it's gonna make your model absolutely berserk so basically on the bookcase test is currently worth 293 the high end and 264 on the low end so it's not a massive upside eleven and a half percent upside so as you can see here on the screen Tesla is either overvalued or fairly valued there's not a lot of opportunity here but here's the catch we haven't talked on sales about Robo taxi we haven't talked about AI we haven't talked about the Tesla bot we haven't talked about a lot of stuff the 25 000 car the improvements in margins Tesla will do and all that good stuff and I think it has to be part of this model at some point but this is a very cautious model so what I would argue here is that what we get here is the value of Tesla auto business without the robo taxi without all the stuff that's developing right now just the auto business is fairly valued right now and because the medium case right here with the 40 gives us literally 260 which is very close to where we are right now so if that is the case what does it show us it shows that Tesla is not a cheap company it's showing us that Tesla is rightfully so of course trading at a premium and now the question is right what do you do when the share price is ready 250 bucks and it's very very close to your ceiling of 260. what do you do do stop do you wait well here's what you do again at least according to my system that we actually talk about every single day in the patient people fed up with me explaining it so patreon forward slash Tom Nash we have a new feature called Palms Academy it's absolutely insane sign up check it out it's a one month free refund in case you don't like it for any reason so what I'm teaching in Tom's Academy is this even at 260 bucks it's still a good time to buy Tesla so there's two metrics here for evaluation either one is important so number one do you have the stomach to dollar cost average when the share price drops below certain threshold and buy more even if the company keeps diving right so if you have the stomach for it the more important question here is do you have a skill that allows you to pick a good company because you can dollar cost average in the perfect way into a really bad company so how is your company picking processes because if you're going to be this saying for three years into the wrong thing well you know it's not going to work out so well for you so the question is very simple how do you find these good companies so if Tesla is a great company we know that for a fact we know because there's so much information about this right so if Tesla is something that we can expect to see in 10 years dominate and the current stock price is not cheap do we wait on the sidelines for a dip and then buy all then no now if you do think that Tesla is the real deal here's what you do you start buying now you ignore the price and you buy every single week little by little piecemeal by piecemeal slowly building up your position and as the price dips you start to buy more and as the price climbs back to 270 to 80 you back to buying your original amount and you keep doing it again and again every single week until the stock price and your crawl spaces they converge you get the average and because you bought more when it was down you get way closer to the bottom of the stock in this entire time frame than anybody else so it's not a bad time to buy Tesla but I wanted to show you something really important which is a DCF model should not be a way for you to justify your biases so I have personal biases about this I think it's the best company except volunteer I love it I think it has massive rejected etc etc but I didn't let it sink in into my DCF as you can see the DCF says well this company is fairly valued that means that the DCF is probably right the company is probably fairly valued right now and it doesn't have a lot of room to run up like crazy but it doesn't mean it can't do it that's the crazy part so as long as you DCA and you don't play this gambling game you should be over the Long Haul quite okay I urge you to go to patreon.com check out every single tier we got there see the one that works for you of course I would love to see you in the academy but join whatever tier you want it's risk-free because everybody gets a refund within the first 30 days if they're not happy for any reason so as always thank you so much I hope this was helpful for you to see kind of the the way a real Tesla DCF would look like without all the hype and hoopla around it thank you so much I'll see you next video,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,e_LWdpBlPCI,2023-06-26T21:07:03Z,Extremely Important Video For All Tesla Investors.,Tesla,hey everybody welcome back to another video my name is Tom Nash and apparently this is the end of Tesla well at least if you ask Daniel Dowd apparently him and Ross Gerber a very unusual couple took a ride in the model S and that Odd Couple got into an accident or at least was about to get into an accident they had to manually intervene and now there's a whole hoopla about this on the internet and that along with the downgrade for the stock from Goldman Sachs of all places now there's some you know some new fight about Tesla and investors are kind of freaking out now I'm here to tell you how I'm playing this and how I'm going to be handling the situation so stick around till the end of this video I'm going to tell you my strategy but before I do so let me explain a few things number one if you want to join a real conversation about Tesla from Engineers from the Aerospace industry from the Auto industry join our patreon patron.com forward slash Tom Nash we have a disco room dedicated for Tesla with some of the smartest people in Industry talk about Tesla every single day so join the conversation we'd love to have you there now number one first of all I want to explain something to you Tesla Shares are very very volatile now I know it's easy to forget given the fact that the stock isn't currently at 256 dollars and it seems like it's always been there but no just six months ago the stock was trading at 108 now it's at 256. before that in August 22 it was trading at 309 before that the 52-week high was 314 dollars so as you can see the stock is very very volatile the one thing that is in common in its volatility it's the narrative I always hear this from people who say well Tom I wish I could buy stock of Tesla when it was so cheap now it's so expensive I'm just gonna wait for a dip and then a dip comes usually because of fud like this and there are two chicken bologna to do something about it let's put it this way and they see the dip they freak out you know they panic and they don't use the dip because they're thinking well Tesla's going to seventy dollars like Gordon Johnson is saying I'm just gonna wait a little bit more and then the stock spikes again they miss out again and they complain again that cycle continues now if you don't want this to happen to you listen to this video because in this video I'm gonna break everything down objective now obviously a disclaimer I am a Tesla bull I'm not gonna pretend like I'm not I like Elon I like Tesla I like the company I have shares of Tesla so I am a bowl of Tesla so everything I'm saying here you have to take with a grain of salt knowing that there's definitely bias here a little bit but let me just break it down to you like the way I see it number one what about FSD changed right now given what happened so you can argue a lot of arguments about the test they conducted I saw a lot of tweets about it the fact of the matter is some people are saying that Russ Gerber was actually deactivating accidentally it seems the FSD by pressing on the gas or it's not really the gas that's right but basically the acceleration pedal and there's other talk about you know the stop sign being mislocated about you know what 10 feet off of the intersection a car that was cutting into the intersection there's a million different things that people talk about I'm not talking about this let's just assume that you know the almost near accent actually happened and let's ask ourselves a simple question what does this mean for Tesla shares what does this mean for the company and what does it mean for investors well number one does it change the fact that we knew that FSD is experimental it isn't freaking beta my guide it's called a beta because it's not yet available for everyone it's being tested so it's not perfect we knew it would make mistakes we knew we would have to have driver intervention all the time you have to have awareness you don't go to sleep in a Tesla so that ain't nothing new I mean there's going to be more near accidents when you use something that's experimental into beta now that hasn't changed what about other stuff well does it change the fact that Tesla is miles ahead of everybody else in FSD if this is happening with you know with FSD with Tesla full set driving what will the other guy say Tesla is already miles ahead of these guys and if that's the problem with FSD imagine what the other guys are going through um Tesla has the most amount of Miles the most amount of cars the most amount of data their system is getting better every day exponentially faster than all the other competitors so the change because of this new accident I don't think so look there's a sold 800 000 model wise last year that's almost as good as selling Corollas they sold it over to Toyota at like 1.2 million Corollas last year this is already 800 000 of model wise and Tesla hasn't really even warmed up yet I mean does that change the fact that Moto Y is going to be the best selling car in the world within a few years maybe even sooner no I don't think it changes that does it change the fact that Tesla has better margins than Toyota and the rest of the industry not even talking about Ford GM their different story in the category of their own and this has the best margins in the industry much better than the Toyota that makes literally 10 times more cars than Tesla and does it change that does it change the fact that they have a massive hat start in EV production in EV equipment testing fabrication whatever you want to you know call it no it doesn't change any of that let's change the fact that Tesla is already a leader in a whole new industry which is called you know the energy storage for commercial applications the mega pack I'm gonna talk about that I mean that's part of the company as a shareholder you have to be aware of that we haven't even said a word about robotics AI the robo taxi all the things that Kathy Wood Raves about I mean we're not even including that in the conversation because like for me that ain't real enough yet so just let's explore that at all just use it as a bonus and we haven't talked about the balance sheet I mean does it change the fact that Tesla out of all the existing auto manufacturers has the cleanest valency I mean so much cash no debt and with every other auto manufacturer it's literally upside down does it change that obviously no so if nothing has changed for your thesis that's one case but I think at this point we should make kind of a fork in the role sort of conversation if you don't like Tesla if you don't like the thesis and if this accident cause you to change your thesis about Tesla then you should get out simple as that but if that accident or near accident and that downgrade from Goldman Sachs whatever that may be does not change your pieces now what do you do next well what do you do next is very very simple this is something I teach every single day I'm like a broken clock keep saying the same thing dollar cost average into good companies over the Long Haul slowly time over time now what I'm doing with this though it's very very simple look my thesis for Tesla is as strong as it's ever been every single month I put an exact dollar amount into Tesla whatever amount of shares I can get I can get so let's call it a hundred dollars so every month I put in a hundred dollars into Tesla and I have 12 times in which I understand 100 so every year I invest 1200 a Tesco just using a number and nothing changes that price goes up price goes down I don't care because I know that sometimes price will Spike sometimes it goes down but if I just keep adding 100 every single month I'm going to average out around the center of that average up or down now there is a little bit of a Nuance here because you can actually take it to the next level which I'm also doing with their stuff and I'm also saying here's something else I'm saying look as long as Tesla remains below 10 off of the 52-week high which if you check you see the 52-week high for Tesla is 314 and 10 below that is 283 dollars as long as Tesla remains correctly below 283 dollars I'm gonna spend 200 so I'm gonna double down so as long as Tesla is below 10 off of the 52-week high I'm buying double of my allowance instead of 100 200 every month and the moment Tesla goes out into that range of 10 off of the 352 week high whatever that is then I'm going back to 100. and even if it goes to the moon I'm still gonna buy a hundred and that way I insured myself that my weighted average of the cost places I have in Tesla is going to be very very close to the bottom and not to the top and I'm not doing any fomo I'm having anxiety I'm not gambling I'm not trading I'm not trying to guess the top or the bottom simply about the door cost averaging and doubling down when it's below the threshold below the 52 week high I'm insuring myself I'm going to go very close to the bottom price of the stock when everything is said and done in five and ten years this is a marathon it's not quick it's going to take time if you don't have patience some people may say well Tom I don't have 10 years that's the same for you simple go do something else if you got 10 years and you're trying to

Tom Nash,e_LWdpBlPCI,2023-06-26T21:07:03Z,Extremely Important Video For All Tesla Investors.,Goldman Sachs,and that along with the downgrade for the stock from Goldman Sachs of all places now there's some you know some new fight about Tesla and investors are kind of freaking out now I'm here to tell you how I'm playing this and how I'm going to be handling the situation so stick around till the end of this video I'm going to tell you my strategy but before I do so let me explain a few things number one if you want to join a real conversation about Tesla from Engineers from the Aerospace industry from the Auto industry join our patreon patron.com forward slash Tom Nash we have a disco room dedicated for Tesla with some of the smartest people in Industry talk about Tesla every single day so join the conversation we'd love to have you there now number one first of all I want to explain something to you Tesla Shares are very very volatile now I know it's easy to forget given the fact that the stock isn't currently at 256 dollars and it seems like it's always been there but no just six months ago the stock was trading at 108 now it's at 256. before that in August 22 it was trading at 309 before that the 52-week high was 314 dollars so as you can see the stock is very very volatile the one thing that is in common in its volatility it's the narrative I always hear this from people who say well Tom I wish I could buy stock of Tesla when it was so cheap now it's so expensive I'm just gonna wait for a dip and then a dip comes usually because of fud like this and there are two chicken bologna to do something about it let's put it this way and they see the dip they freak out you know they panic and they don't use the dip because they're thinking well Tesla's going to seventy dollars like Gordon Johnson is saying I'm just gonna wait a little bit more and then the stock spikes again they miss out again and they complain again that cycle continues now if you don't want this to happen to you listen to this video because in this video I'm gonna break everything down objective now obviously a disclaimer I am a Tesla bull I'm not gonna pretend like I'm not I like Elon I like Tesla I like the company I have shares of Tesla so I am a bowl of Tesla so everything I'm saying here you have to take with a grain of salt knowing that there's definitely bias here a

Tom Nash,AVO0p4PuX4w,2023-06-22T12:28:45Z,The RIGHT Way To Invest In Stocks Like Palantir,Palantir,"Yesterday, a lot of investors, specifically Palunteer investors, went into this spin cycle. The confusion was absolutely insane. The drop of this stock by 7 and a half% in a single day confuses a lot of investors. They don't know what they should do. Existing investors are basically wondering, well, should I sell out? I mean, I'm up a lot because the stock is up so big this year, and maybe this is the beginning of a correction, so maybe I should sell it all and wait to re-enter later. And new investors are now saying, well, look, maybe I should get in now. 7 and a half% drop. This is the time to buy the dip, right? What do I do? All of this confusion is unnecessary. This is not the way to invest long-term. Definitely not in stocks like Palanteer. And it's especially true for stocks like Palunteer and Tesla. This is the behavior of a stock like Palenteer, which is just one example, right? If you're trying to time pilot and find out where it's the best entry point, exit point, this is the game you're playing. I'm going to buy every month 100 shares of Palunteer just for the sake of example 100 shares each month right whatever the cost is it is what it is right cool and then you say okay so I'm buying 100 shares here 100 shares here 100 shares here and 100 shares here but whenever the stock price dips below the 52- week high below the green line right here. Whenever it's going to dip below that, I'm going to buy 200 shares. So, I'm buying 200 here, 200 here, 200 here. You see what I did here? So, and 200 here, obviously. So, whenever the stock price dips below the 52- week high, the all-time high, whatever, you decide the threshold line. Whatever you decide, it's for you to decide. I'm just using 52- week high as an example. It's actually very convenient, but you decide the line. Whenever that threshold amount gets crossed upwards, you go back 200. Whenever it goes below it, you go to 200. And you keep doing that. In fact, I'll show you by the end of the video an example of somebody who did just that and did very well in our community. What you're doing if you're using the system is you're creating a weighted average. So the palunteer cost basis which you have gets weighted averaged into the bottom because if you're buying more let's say buying X and 2X you're buying X when it's high you're buying 2X when it's low what happens to your average your average goes down so after a couple of years what you get is more investment into Palunteer complete disregard to the price no FOMO no anxiety no emotions no mental resources and your cost basis just went down because you bought twice as much when the stock was below your threshold amount. Now, I did promise you an example of how this thing works because this is, you know, might be just me blowing smoke up your ass. one of our community members, Captain Chuck. Captain Chuck, I'm going to put his stuff on the screen right now. Captain Chuck started buying Palunteer at $22. Now, what he did, as you can see on the screen right now, he was buying at $22. But as the stock price kept coming down because he had conviction in the stock, because he knew it was a good company, because he knew this company is now selling at a discount. He started buying more, more, more as the price was going down. And now he ended up with $8.7 cost. So, he started 2 years ago. two years ago with $22 per share. Two years later, he's at $8.7 per share and he did it slowly by buying more when the stock price was coming down. And now he's up massively on the stock as you can see here on the screen right now. It's not a coincidence. It's literally what Captain Chuck said on our Patreon when we asked him, ""Hey, Captain Chuck, congratulations. Tell us how you did it."" And basically said, ""Look, you eat an elephant piece by piece."" That's exactly how you invest. Long-term investing into good companies in which you have conviction in, you have confidence in slowly over time, peace meal by piece meal, slowly building your position in a weighted average situation so that you get lower cost basis at the end of the day.",1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,W1xh5iMnxo8,2023-06-21T14:11:24Z,ANET Stock Is The Next NVIDIA (Arista Networks Stock),Arista Networks,in today's video we're talking about a company which I think has a massive potential we're talking about anet a-n-e-t that's the ticker it's called Arista Arista is dominating the high speed data center switch Market they've taken Cisco's lunch forever and they continue to do so they have a strong momentum now at 50 billion market cap their Behemoth they have clients all over the place Microsoft Amazon meta all of them work for them their revenue growth is absolutely insane 2.3 billion then 3 billion then 4.3 billion last year they did 5 billion in sales almost 5 billion sales they're the market leader in the data center switch category and they're also at the Forefront of the a applications of data centers and with the increased spending that we're going to see on cloud computing and data centers and AI driven spending that's going to happen in this field this company is going to benefit now obviously there's macro risks here if the economy goes Kaboom and into the toilet they'll suffer but the rest of the market as well but I'm just saying to you look there's big time here total Supermarket this company has terrific fundamentals very similar to Nvidia and it has similar exposures and similar opportunities it's not exactly identical to Nvidia they're not competing with Nvidia in fact I would call this a completing product if Nvidia does well and if this industry goes into the stratosphere Arista is going to benefit. So it's not a cheap company but it's definitely not parabolic now you can see that the stock also did quite well over the past 30 months it's uh it's like down five percent but if you go to a one month mode you're gonna see it's up five percent one year mode 64 so depend how you spend this if I go back one year this thing was trading at 100 now a year later it's at 150 it had a big spike but nothing that comes close to Nvidia volunteer and the rest of these stocks it went absolutely ape wild because of this AI thing. Now we already talked about the fact that have ai exposure data center exposure their market leader they're working with the best clients and they will benefit from AI driven spending on data centers and look at the revenue 5 billion Revenue look at the growth 50 growth in a year they did 1.8 billion just five years ago they're currently at five look at the margin here operating income is 1.7 billion net income is 1.5 billion look at the numbers up to 100 of five years the net income was just 500 million five years ago now they've tripled that in just five years. Now that's the one part I also like here the debt is 55 million the cash is 1 billion so it's literally uh you know it kind of reminds me of palantir Tesla you know High cash virtually no debt operating margins 35 percent look at the this is incredible total asset 7.5 billion total abilities on this company is about 2.2 billion so three almost three and a half times access to liabilities excuse my math here and you know everything here checks out now 31pe again 31b isn't cheap but these fundamentals with the opportunity it has and the similarity it has it has very very interesting path I think. So currently our DC evaluation is 209 so as you can see this company has all the right pieces in place the fundamentals are off the charts the margins are great the guidance is great the company is growing and it has the right exposure to Data Centers and AI to benefit from this Spike and it's not competing with Nvidia in fact if Nvidia does well which I think well first company will also do well and have clients is Microsoft Amazon we just talked about it massive clients 50 billion market cap. Now all we have to do with this company is DCA to it slowly I don't say rush into it my system isn't to buy it up and now just pull everything into it slowly the Holocaust average over a couple of years build your position slowly.,1.0,0.9

It's not exactly identical to Nvidia they're not competing with Nvidia in fact I would call this a completing product if Nvidia does well and if this industry goes into the stratosphere Arista is going to benefit. The PE is 31 it's not cheap but compared to Nvidia 31 is sounding really really cute right now especially with the numbers you're about to see so it's not a cheap company but it's definitely not parabolic now you can see that the stock also did quite well over the past 30 months it's uh it's like down five percent but if you go to a one month mode you're gonna see it's up five percent one year mode 64 so depend how you spend this if I go back one year this thing was trading at 100 now a year later it's at 150 it had a big spike but nothing that comes close to Nvidia volunteer and the rest of these stocks it went absolutely ape wild because of this AI thing.

Tom Nash,Ga0aSSDsfAU,2023-06-19T15:05:55Z,SOFI is going to change personal finance forever,SOFI,hey this is Tom and let's talk about Sofi. Sofi which is the stock we're covering today is probably the most requested stock on my Channel with the exception of palantir and Tesla as you would expect and in this video we're gonna dissect it. now this video has to start with where sofa used to be back in 2021 when things were great now this stock used to be 25 a pop 25 a pop back in 2021. now ever since then it has gone down to eight and a half dollars and even though it had a phenomenal run over the last few weeks last few months it's currently down 10 but it has a crazy crazy run if I pull up the chart over the last three months it's done 60 over the past year it's done 57 over the past month alone it did 82 percent the stock went through some crazy crazy times but in the grand scheme of things the stock is still way way lower than the 25 price tag it had in 2021 so our system today we're going to evaluate the stock we're going to make sure if it's any good this stock has to go through the ringer in order for us to make that decision. in any case let's focus on so far not my platform here. what we're going to have to take a look at here is the quality of the CEO the balance sheet the growth rate the short interest the deal quality on the stock and the overall potential of Sofi. now look the stock is up 90 year-to-date that's not as crazy as palantir definitely not as crazy as Nvidia but still very very high and we're going to look at the numbers in just a second but there's other things here in this stock that are a little bit alarming to me and I'm going to list them and it doesn't mean I'm bearish on the stock don't jump to conclusions it just means that I am a balanced objective analyzer whenever you want to evaluate the stock properly whenever you want to be objective you have to look at the good and the bad you can't be absolutely ignorant to bad red flags Etc so the first red flag is for me obviously the parabolic spike same thing as palantir I've been vocal about palantir as well that's why the palantir community seems to hate me a little bit right now but you know whenever something goes parabolic real quick it's not super attractive for me you know as far as an investment at that point in time. the other thing is as I'm going to show you in a second this company is not profitable yet although they're flirting with profitability they're really close but they're not there yet their way to leverage for my taste with 6.3 billion dollars of debt which is way more than two and a half billions they have in cash they're bleeding like 300 million dollars a year which is kind of upsetting and not optimal for me and I think like palantir there's a lot of opportunistic dip buyers that have made a lot of profit over the past you know a few weeks few months and they're waiting for the opportunity to take their profits which is going to put a lot of pressure on the share price in the short term. now these are my dislikes and before we go through the numbers I also have some likes number one I think the stock has probably one of the best CEOs in existence I think any Anthony noro is definitely the top 10 CEO in the United States you can research the guy he knows what he's doing he completely turned around so far what it used to be what it is now what is going to be three completely different things and he has most of the cloud for that. student loans are coming back which is good although I think that's already kind of priced in a little bit into the share price it rates will come down as inflation comes down interest rates will have to come down especially with what's going on with the banking industry and that's a huge opportunity for Sofi because their business is refinancing interest rates go down a lot of refinancing activity has to come to the pipeline they have lots of potential they have a new bank Charter which you just got by acquiring a bank and you know this company is not trading at super expensive levels at eight and a half dollars it's four times price to sales much better than what it used to be at 25 bucks a pop it has 22 million sorry billion assets versus 17 billion in liabilities which is you know decent decent ratio and to be honest even though it's very leveraged it has enough cash to basically operate for eight to ten years without diluting shareholders which is really really helpful for me because I know they have stability there's no dilution or debt coming they're burning 300 a year they're sitting on 2.5 billion and even if they just keep burning cash they have eight years so that's not bad at all. revenue at 1.7 billion it really reminds me a lot of palantir but I think there's a 2 billion there's 1.7 billion very similar structure growth is actually way better than palantir at 53 incredible growth here but as you can see operating expenses are almost broke even 1.6 billion which leaves us operating income of 56 million so the company is technically operationally profitable which is a sign they're about to be profitable for tax purposes and for cash flow purposes so that's good but they're just on that borderline essentially this is a break-even company which is in itself quite impressive in this economy and what I do want to show you is this right here 2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents but 6.3 billion in debt very leveraged not a huge fan of that 22 billion in assets as you can see right here we talked about this versus 17 billion liabilities now the valuation here look we don't have price the earnings naturally because it's not a profitable company but you know 1.4 Price to Book 4.7 price to sales I mean it's not an expensive company I think I said earlier PE if I did I'm sorry I meant price to sales obviously it doesn't have a p but you know four to five price to sales at 1.4 Price to Book at a company that's borderline operationally profitable generating almost 1.8 billion in revenue and growing at 50 a year that's actually quite impressive I'm not gonna lie I think it's a it's a it's a cool number. what analysts are saying about the stock as you can see in the corner here we have the average analyst price Target the average analyst price Target right now and so far is ten dollars which is significantly higher than the current eight and a half dollar share price but you have low targets of all the way down to two and a half dollars and I'll show you why those also make sense and I'm not being hateful on the stock I'm just saying it's definitely it's possible it's possible that it goes to 10 or 22 but it's also possible to see it two and a half I'll show you why a lot of the assumptions about this company is going to drive the valuations it's not such a simple thing then you can just you know kind of assume and run the quick DCF it's not that simple this stock requires a lot of nuance. the conservative the bear case for the stock is a three dollar stock very similar to the analyst by the way and the five-year kind of Middle Ground which seems to be the most you know plausible or the most you know probable scenario is 15 a share which is quite higher than the eight and a half dollars and the you know optimistic Kathy Wood scenario that's the 27 per share so that's the range in which it's going to operate as a Growth Company a lot of speculation a lot of risk you know high risk High reward three dollars twenty eight dollars twenty seven dollars it's a big margin uh but the end of the day you have to make a decision if this stock is even good enough because I mean you can't just go based on the on hype and and just say oh this stock can go to 27 I'm just gonna buy it no you have to actually analyze it and see if you like it. right now rdcf gives us a 10 10.12 DC evaluation which is a 17 upside on the stock but of course you know for some people may find this annoying if you're a huge sofiable don't forget my DCF or palantir is about eight dollars a share so and I'm I'm the one you know making 500 thumbnails on palantir the DCF isn't everything yeah I'm investing in palantir expecting a 500 per share price even though I see a DCF of eight so it's an objective way to kind of gauge what's the current valuation of the company given its current numbers without taking into account any exponential growth in the future which I think Sofi has a lot of potential to do it much like palantir Sofi has that potential to create exponential growth and in that case the CCF is meaningless but as it says right now it's a 17 upside but it's definitely up there as far as potential massive massive potential with as far as the bank Charter the all the all-in-one app they're building it's absolutely insane what they can get to. one last thing here on stock MVP that I like to look at is what the institutional investors are doing with the stock that's the Achilles heel of this talk it's very similar to palantir in this aspect palantir also suffers from the same problem that's why I think the palantir investors are are feeling the pain of the sofa investors 37 institutional shareholding palantir has a similar percentage it's not optimal we want to see 60 at least institutional shareholding because it adds a lot of stability to a stock um and 37 is just too low there's too much retail action and unless you're Tesla um retail investors tend to be a little bit more volatile and then you see this crazy swings in the share price so not exciting to see that the craziness as far as you know um all this institutional investors not buying into the company as you would expect when you have a company that's not profitable speculative in times like these institutional shareholders they tend to take their time on this and that's okay. now in my view here this stock has a lot of potential it checks a lot of the boxes the CEO is great the balance sheet is okay the short interest um at 14 13 is it's it's a tad high for me and the main problem here is that the stock again it doesn't get institutional influx that's why it's being held back similarly to palantir and unfortunately when you have such a high retail participation much like palantir the moment the the buyers decide to jump off the ship because they think it's coming down it's going to send the stock price down and it's not going to be pretty but how do I invest in company like this if I have faith in it right same answer as volunteer if I like sofa and I think this is a great company and which a lot of you may think and I can't argue with you I mean there's definitely a case to be made of why this company is probably uh one of one of The Highest Potential companies in the market right now as far as fintech for sure. so again this is what I do what I do with sofa if I like this talk is something very simple I decide a dollar amount I'm going to invest every single month into the stock and I keep buying every single month no matter what the price does with one exception which is kind of the pro adjustment to this rule if I see the price goes below 10 percent off of the 52-week high I have on the stock then at that point I started doubling down I doubled my amount and I stayed doubled all the way until the stock price climbs back up and it gets to that 10 threshold again and it goes within that 10 range from the 52 week high at that point I go back to my original amount and I keep putting it every month the idea here is to slowly build your position over time slowly dollar cost averaging to a good stock when it goes down you benefit when it goes up you benefit at the end of the day because you create an average.,1.0,0.4
Tom Nash,Ga0aSSDsfAU,2023-06-19T15:05:55Z,SOFI is going to change personal finance forever,Palantir,Sofi which is the stock we're covering today is probably the most requested stock on my Channel with the exception of palantir and Tesla as you would expect. now look the stock is up 90 year-to-date that's not as crazy as palantir definitely not as crazy as Nvidia but still very very high. the first red flag is for me obviously the parabolic spike same thing as palantir I've been vocal about palantir as well that's why the palantir community seems to hate me a little bit right now but you know whenever something goes parabolic real quick it's not super attractive for me you know as far as an investment at that point in time. not excited to invest in a company with so much short interest even palantir that has a high short interest at eight eight and a half percent double-digit short interest scares me. and I think like palantir there's a lot of opportunistic dip buyers that have made a lot of profit over the past you know a few weeks few months and they're waiting for the opportunity to take their profits which is going to put a lot of pressure on the share price in the short term. revenue at 1.7 billion it really reminds me a lot of palantir but I think there's a 2 billion there's 1.7 billion very similar structure growth is actually way better than palantir at 53 incredible growth here. don't forget my DCF or palantir is about eight dollars a share so and I'm I'm the one you know making 500 thumbnails on palantir the DCF isn't everything yeah I'm investing in palantir expecting a 500 per share price even though I see a DCF of eight so it's an objective way to kind of gauge what's the current valuation of the company given its current numbers without taking into account any exponential growth in the future which I think Sofi has a lot of potential to do it much like palantir Sofi has that potential to create exponential growth and in that case the CCF is meaningless. one last thing here on stock MVP that I like to look at is what the institutional investors are doing with the stock that's the Achilles heel of this talk it's very similar to palantir in this aspect palantir also suffers from the same problem that's why I think the palantir investors are are feeling the pain of the sofa investors 37 institutional shareholding palantir has a similar percentage it's not optimal we want to see 60 at least institutional shareholding because it adds a lot of stability to a stock. the main problem here is that the stock again it doesn't get institutional influx that's why it's being held back similarly to palantir and unfortunately when you have such a high retail participation much like palantir the moment the the buyers decide to jump off the ship because they think it's coming down it's going to send the stock price down and it's not going to be pretty but how do I invest in company like this if I have faith in it right same answer as volunteer.,0.9,0.0

Tom Nash,OoD_mN-GAPY,2023-06-16T10:43:29Z,Attractive and UNDERVALUED Dividend Stock | BG Stock Review,Bunge Limited,I want to show you a company that I found which I think would be a great addition to any portfolio given its current price and its current parameters. Okay so this company is called bungee limited now I'm going to make the screen a little bit bigger so you can see the parameters here so this stock has taken the bidding of the past year it's been down 9.3 percent so while the entire Market has been going ape crazy this stock lost 10 percent of its value. Now that already shows me that this is the convertible in the winter. The first question really answered which is this company is bitten down it's hated everybody's dumping it in favor of Nvidia and the hype stocks and now is the right time to look at it. Let's look at what this company actually does. It operates an agribusiness and food company. What they do is essentially they they make soybeans wheat corn sugar mainly they process it they produce it they distribute it it's a food business but it's a base Food business. This is what I love about this company I love these base base products because they make a lot of sense especially in this market and I'll explain in a second why and there what I feel is that base food is anti-recessionary and when things go south and eventually they will companies like this with base food exposure they'll do better than the growth stocks and the hype stocks and the tech stocks you want to buy them when they are hated the most like they are right now. This is a dividend company as you can see right here on the screen the dividend yield is 2.6. This company has never ever cut its dividend the dividend of this company of Bungie always went up every single year they've never reduced a dividend in their history so it's not exciting but it always will keep going up at least historically speaking unless they change. It's a low margin business so the operating margin here is 3.5 percent the net profit margin is 2.3 percent so this business is not about high margins it's not exciting it's not sexy it's very very dumb to Earth 2.3 that margin it's built on quantity it's built on longevity it's built on discipline and it's not built on explosive results but it's going to keep grinding every single year for you and I think it's one of the best stocks as far as a dividend stock to add to your portfolio right now. Now for the past three quarters a bungee limited has beat its earnings which is something that in this economy shows you a lot. Revenues are 66.7 billion a year Revenue growth is seven percent last year or the past five years they grew revenues by 47 very very nice. Net income is 1.6 billion very nice net income that's the sort of business I'm talking about this is business 101 one and a half billion low margin but so much money that's what we love to see as investors money at the end of the day that what matters. Now its balance sheet is very clean we have total assets of 27 billion total abilities of 16 billion the ratio of assets to liabilities is very good. Now it is a little bit over leverage with 3 billion of cash with 6 billion of debt but four in agricultural production company like this one a high debt structure is kind of par for the course that's normal it's a high cash demanding business that's okay. Now what I do want to show you here with excites me the most is that we're talking about a dividend company where with 2.6 dividend which has been bitten down in the past year down 10 percent it's growing at seven percent a year fifty fifty percent of the past five years so it's giving you five to ten percent growth a year uh it's not income positive and it's trading at a multiple of nine price the earnings of nine price to sales of 0.2. We're talking about a company that's trading at point two price to sales it is an extremely low multiple 9be is again this is not an expensive company with everything we've just seen you're getting this at a very cheap price the price here is extremely attractive. This company has 88 institutional shareholding it means it's extremely stable. The amount of shares that over the course of the past three years of institutionals have went up so this is a chart that shows you the trend of how much institutional shareholding is in this company it's pretty steady but over the course of the past three years they went up from 110 million shares to 127 million shares in just three years so institutional shareholding is good it's going up it's staying steady and I think it's going to give this company a lot of stability. Most analysts are looking at this at 134 price per share and low Target is 120 High Target is 144 the shares country trading at 94 so at least analysts for whatever that worth are saying that this company is undervalued. This is in my opinion the fair market value of this company is 120 and 94 cents based on very conservative assumptions. Over the past few days we found out that this company is actually merging with another company of equal size and with absolutely complementary business model and I think it's absolutely brilliant especially since it was not price at all in the in the share price. A few days ago there was a merger that was announced between Bungie limited and vitera. Now Bungie is buying it for two billion dollars of cash 6 billion in stock essentially the shareholders of Vitara will get shares of Bungee and they're gonna be taking on 10 billion of debt essentially buying their debt. So while a Bungie Limited it mainly makes its money by processing uh sugars soybeans wheat and all that good stuff Victora is actually a logistics company their their business is 65 from handling and Merchandising which is exactly the things that bungee limited is not excelling at and the merging creaks the perfect mix in fact they're going to be more balanced as one unit and they're going to complete each other and somehow this is completely not reflected in the share price. So in my opinion my humble opinion this is a 120 stock and currently it's trading at 94. I think for me it's a buy. In my own personal opinion this is a hundred twenty dollar stock that you can buy at 94 get a 2.8 dividend yield you have growth here you have a cheap price and you have a catalyst which is not yet price somehow in the share price right which is absolutely phenomenal.,1.0,0.9

So a few days ago there was a merger that was announced between Bungie limited and vitera. Now vitera is an 18 billion dollar business very similar to Bungie. Now Bungie is buying it for two billion dollars of cash 6 billion in stock essentially the shareholders of Vitara will get shares of Bungee and they're gonna be taking on 10 billion of debt essentially buying their debt and it's an equal sized company. Vitera is an absolute phenomenal business they have 270 storage facilities 30 Port terminals 15 Crush plants around the world so they have a lot of logistics and that's the key point I want to explain here. Victora is actually a logistics company their their business is 65 from handling and Merchandising which is exactly the things that bungee limited is not excelling at and the merging creaks the perfect mix in fact they're going to be more balanced as one unit and they're going to complete each other and somehow this is completely not reflected in the share price.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,55v718c5wkI,2023-06-15T13:37:27Z,NEVER Do This With Palantir Stock,Palantir,so I've been thinking a lot about this over the past few weeks as palantir rallied 150 percent I kept thinking to myself how can I teach you guys the right way to invest in palantir even with the craziness that's going on right now. as far as palantir goes with our system let me give you a taste of what we teach on our Peyton Community now what do you do with Pelletier now do you wait do you buy more because you like the company do you sell because it ran up 150 especially if you have a bad day. I want to give you a taste today of what we teach a little bit deeper using palantir to show you that there's intricacies to this there's Nuance to this that makes it even better so let's say we have three types of investors right now one that's Uber confident like me for example who loves palantir and says this is the next trillion dollar company whether he's right or wrong it doesn't matter let's say we have a medium investor who likes volunteer but is not ecstatic about it like me who says well this can be a nice investment and let's say we have a low confidence investor who is in it for the hype who is in it for a quick Buck who doesn't believe in the company who doesn't have the conviction now here's what's going to happen they all put a hundred dollars every month like clockwork nothing changes but then at some point as it usually does with every stock the dip comes and the dip will come with any stock and right now let's say the stock dips 10 below the previous 52-week High okay it just dip so what does our low confidence investor does who has no confidence in volunteer because he doesn't like the stock he's just there for the hype well he goes to zero dollars investment he stops investing he keeps his investment he doesn't sell it because we didn't say he's a bear right but he stops adding money to this investor and it stays on zero our medium confidence guy he keeps putting a hundred dollars nothing changed for him he's still confident palantir is a great company so he keeps adding a hundred dollars. The Uber bull which is me in this case says oh my God this is now half the price it was just a week ago I'm gonna double down I'm going to add 200 every week because it's red right now and because it's red I want to double down and let's say we keep doing that we keep doing it eventually this talk like every other stock rebounds and then it goes back up and it goes back up the previous 52-week high and that point all investors are back to the hundred dollars the uberpool says well you know at these prices I'm gonna go back down from 200 to 100 the medium confidence investor he stays at 100 nothing changed for him and the low confidence jumps back in because now the stock is running up again so he wants to be part of the Ukraine so he's following back in so he feared himself out of the stock he feared himself back into the stock and that's how it played out now here's the crazy part what I just showed you I actually was tested thoroughly and you'll see this result in the back of my screen in a second so what I just showed you is an example is a private case of a study that was done by looking at three types of investors from 1998 to 2022 for 24 years now this study is published on sub stack I'm going to put on Market sentiment on snapstack I'm going to put the link to that in the description so you can go and read the study but basically what they did is they researched three types of investors in those three types of investors are as follows one type of investor keeps doubling down when the market goes below 10 of the previous all-time high one keeps investing no matter what and one stops investing until this stock goes back up and only then he resumes now same stuff as I showed you for palantir happen. this is proof that as long as you can find assuming you can find a good company and assuming you didn't get the company wrong that of course can happen but assuming you found the right company and you find the next generational cataclysmic stock that will change the world the best way to buy this stock over the course of the next 20 years as you work towards your retirement is by adding stock every single month at the same Pace 100 100 000 5000 whatever your budget is and when the stock dips just double down and when it goes back up stop and go back to your original DCA dollar cost average this system works I didn't make this up this is actual studies that show you what's the right strategy to long-term invest without getting emotions involved so right now you're using palantir going ape wild right 150 everybody's foaming what do you do this is what you do but you don't do it until you decide and until you have conviction that this is the next best things and sliced bread because if you don't have that confidence if you don't have that conviction about palantir you shouldn't be investing in this company to begin with because otherwise you're just playing the greater full Theory find another stock there's plenty of other stock for you find the one that you're in love with whether it's Tesla palantir or completely different stock and build this system on it.

Tom Nash,55v718c5wkI,2023-06-15T13:37:27Z,NEVER Do This With Palantir Stock,Palantir,so I've been thinking a lot about this over the past few weeks as Palantir rallied 150 percent I kept thinking to myself how can I teach you guys the right way to invest in Palantir even with the craziness that's going on right now. now as far as Palantir goes with our system let me give you a taste of what we teach on our Peyton Community. now what do you do with Palantir now do you wait do you buy more because you like the company do you sell because it ran up 150 especially if you have a bad day. using Palantir to show you that there's intricacies to this there's Nuance to this that makes it even better. one that's Uber confident like me for example who loves Palantir and says this is the next trillion dollar company whether he's right or wrong it doesn't matter. let's say we have a medium investor who likes Palantir but is not ecstatic about it like me who says well this can be a nice investment. who has no confidence in Palantir because he doesn't like the stock he's just there for the hype well he goes to zero dollars investment he stops investing he keeps his investment he doesn't sell it because we didn't say he's a bear right but he stops adding money to this investor and it stays on zero our medium confidence guy he keeps putting a hundred dollars nothing changed for him he's still confident Palantir is a great company so he keeps adding a hundred dollars. so right now you're using Palantir going ape wild right 150 everybody's foaming what do you do this is what you do. but you don't do it until you decide and until you have conviction that this is the next best things and sliced bread because if you don't have that confidence if you don't have that conviction about Palantir you shouldn't be investing in this company to begin with. find the one you're in love with whether it's Tesla Palantir or completely different stock and build this system on it.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,jNYBBx0wU3A,2023-05-30T15:14:00Z,The one thing EVERYONE is missing about Palantir,Palantir,"Over the past few weeks Palantir stock has gotten an influx of a new class of investors, people who have no idea what this company is, what it does, and just want to be a part of the gravy train. Their only logic to investing is stock going up must make money. The stock is up 113% year to date, it's running up non-stop, it's red hot. A lot of existing Palantir shareholders are trying to figure out what to do in this situation. I'm here to tell you how much Palantir is worth right now today. I was the original Palantir bull on YouTube, and back in November 2020 I made my first video about it where I said, 'this is a trillion dollar company potentially'. I said it's going to be that 10 years long term, but yes, it has potential to be a one trillion dollar company and that excites me. I sort of involuntarily became kind of the face of the Palantir community. A question I got today on Discord: 'I'm trying not to have more than 50 percent of my portfolio with Palantir, but the way the stock is increasing forces me to sell some stock'. The market is about to open in 20 minutes, let's see what the stock has done today in pre-market, it's up 7.6%, my goodness. There's three options right now for Palantir investors, and I think two of them are absolutely wrong. Option number one is to sell everything, wait for the stock to come down and try to repurchase it as a long-term investor, which is wrong. The other option is to go all in and say, 'well Palantir is on the verge of going to that one trillion dollar valuation', but that's also the wrong decision because this is a FOMO run. The stock has gotten way ahead of its valuation because of this latest run. Option number three, which is the right strategy, would be to slowly build your position in Palantir regardless of the price. Set an amount which you want to invest in the next year and break it down to 12 installments every month. The idea is at the end of 10 years if you do it every year, you're going to have a sizable position, and if indeed this stock is a one trillion dollar company in 10 years, which I think it may be, then you're going to have a nice little profit. If you have conviction in it, you're not going to panic when it goes down and you're not going to be basically grueling trying to take profits when it's not even close to its potential. What's the current valuation of Palantir? I've been on record multiple times, I've always said I'm a Palantir bull, I've never sold. I had criticism for the company when they had poor earnings, but I've never changed my opinion. I don't think it's a one trillion dollar company right now. When I look at Palantir right now as an objective evaluator, it's nowhere near one trillion dollars, not even close. For Palantir to justify a $14 valuation, you have to assume that their EBITDA is going to go to 700 million in a year, which is absolutely insane to assume, and 25% annual growth which is higher than what they are right now, and interest rates coming down. More realistically, if Palantir is going to grow at 15% and interest rates are going to stay elevated for a while, Palantir is a $7.5 dollar stock. The range for Palantir right now as it stands in 2023, before it made that quantum leap, is between $7.5 and $14 per share right now today. If Palantir manages to create exponential growth in its revenues and actually go to that valuation, then this model is absolutely relevant. But as it stands today, there's no rush. If you believe that Palantir can hit a trillion dollars, you have 10 years to invest, it's not going to happen tomorrow or in a year or two years. This is a 10-year project at minimum. This latest FOMO run, 130% in six months, that's all it is – it's a flash in the pan. Don't freak out, relax, keep buying Palantir at your pace, keep dollar cost averaging like nothing has happened. Ignore the price action if you have conviction in this stock.",1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,jNYBBx0wU3A,2023-05-30T15:14:00Z,The one thing EVERYONE is missing about Palantir,Palantir,"hey this is Tom Nash and I think that it's safe to assume that over the past few weeks volunteer stock has gotten an influx of a new class of investors people who have no idea what this company is what it does and what just to be a part of the gravy train their only logic to investing is spunk going up must make money greater full Theory buy it at 14 sell it to 20 make some money that's all they care about. The stock is up 113 year to date it's running up every single a Non-Stop it's red hot in fact it's giving Nvidia a run for its money right now with the amount of hype and fear of missing out that it has and a lot of existing pile and peer shareholders are trying to figure out what to do in this situation because we're talking about a lot of money. I'm gonna tell you how much palantir is worth right now today not in 10 years right now. Palantir is a very intriguing stock. I was the original kind of palantir bull on YouTube, I was the only one who went basically and said hey this thing is a Hidden Gem and back in November 2020 I've made my first video I think about it where I said well this is the trillion dollar company potentially and I said it's going to be that 10 years long term. The question in everybody's mind right now, like Dr Ali who is trying not to have more than 50 percent of his portfolio with Palantir but the way the stock is increasing forces him to sell some stock. I think there's three things you can do right now with palantir with this insane run; checking right now, the stock is up 7.6% today in pre-market. Three options right now for Palantir investors and I think two of them are absolutely wrong. Option number one, which I think would be wrong, is to sell everything wait for the stock to come down and try to repurchase it as a long-term investor. The other option you can do here, which I also think would be wrong, is to go all in and say well palantir is on the verge of going to that one trillion dollar valuation which Tom has told me about, so I'm gonna buy right now when it's only at 30 billion dollars and I'm gonna catch it on time because everybody's buying it right now. That's also going to be the wrong decision because this is a fomo run, hype, and the stock has gotten way ahead of its valuation, way way way ahead of its current valuation. Option number three would be to slowly build your position in Palantir regardless of the price, set an amount which you want to invest in the next year and break it down to 12 installments every month, a certain amount you're going to put into the volunteer stock and do it every month regardless of where the price is whether it's a 15 25 or 5. If indeed this stock is a one trillion dollar company in 10 years which I think it may be then you're gonna have a nice little profit. There's no point for me to take profits at fourteen dollars when the stock can go to Five Hundred. If you've been doing that for the past year or for the past six months this latest rally was good for you by the way; if you haven't and you've been sitting out waiting to time to Market you've missed the latest rally that you've been just in palantir and Nvidia and other stocks. What's the current valuation of palantir? I've been on record multiple times, I haven't flipped, I haven't sold when it was fashionable, I've been always consistent, I've always said I'm a palantir bull, I've never sold, I had criticism to the company when they had poor earnings but I've never changed my opinion. Having said that, I don't think it's a one trillion dollar company right now, when I look at Palantir right now as an objective evaluator, it's nowhere near one trillion dollars, not even close. Let's assume that palantir has 700 million in ebitda next year, which is a very aggressive assumption, and 25% annual growth. For palantir to justify a 14 valuation which is where it's at right now you have to assume that their ebitda is going to go to 700 million in a year which is absolutely insane to assume. If we assume that palantir is going to grow at 15% and interest rates are going to stay elevated for a while, palantir is a seven and a half dollar stock. The range for palantir right now as it stands in 2023, before it made that Quantum Leap, is between seven and a half and 14 per share. If Palantir manages to create exponential growth in its revenues and actually go to that valuation then this model is absolutely relevant, but as it stands today there's no rush. If you believe that Palantir can hit a trillion dollars, you have 10 years to invest, it's not gonna happen tomorrow, or in one or two years; this is a 10-year project at minimum. This latest fomo round that you're seeing right now, 130 percent in six months, that's all it is, it's a flash in the pan, it's a fomo run and eventually it's gonna pop and explode and fizzle out. Don't freak out, relax, keep buying Palantir at your pace, keep dollar cost averaging. If you have conviction in this stock, I would not think it's a good idea to try and swing trade this stock because I think it's absolutely irrational and don't forget the market can stay rational longer than any of you can stay solvent.",1.0,0.6

Tom Nash,6WdRJoRYF_o,2023-05-26T16:11:19Z,Palantir: There’s No Stopping It Now,Palantir,today's video I want to talk to you about palantir and why palantir is running up now the past few videos I've been warning people that parent here is basically going through a formal phase and it's running up too fast but nevertheless I've still been very consistent with saying that palantir is a 500 stock for me personally. let's talk about why I think this is a one trillion dollar company eventually not tomorrow but in a while and here's the thing palantir doesn't really compete with any particular brand or company. if palantir doesn't compete with anyone so how come you know they're not growing like 300 per year well that is because they're competing with their own clients and let me explain what it means. now palantir comes in with The Foundry platform to a Fortune 500 company which is you know their playground. and then here comes palantir just after this company has spent so much money on this and are offering for this company to basically reset everything and pay a whole new fee. don't forget that the top 20 clients of palantiers spend about 50 million dollars per year give or take so that's not a cheap system so it's A Hard Sell so they're competing with the clients themselves with whatever they have homegrown and there's a lot of psychological barriers to this thing. it's not always in my best interest to let palantir in and you know see the CEO and the board because you know it's going to make me look like an idiot so to speak right so they've been getting a lot of pushback because of that. that's why parent fear is running up right now because people are seeing what's going on in the financials but the financials are lagging so the financials for two quarters in a row were you know absolutely beautiful Gap profitability and growth projections everything is nice but these financials are just a result of what's actually going on you know if the company was not good if the product wasn't sticky then palantir wouldn't have had a two billion dollar annual sales cycle and it wouldn't have had 110 net dollar retention and they wouldn't have you know their top 20 clients spending 50 million dollars per year that's what I'm saying. I do believe that at this point um everybody understands that palantir has no competitors the product is sticky because it works and they'll only get better. I do believe that it's going to take them at least a decade to get to that point where I see them it's a 500 you know per stock company and in that process it's gonna be a lot of bumps a lot of bruises a lot of pain and I think penalty is going to punish a lot of Traders along these times and it's going to reward a lot of long-term investors like myself.,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,6WdRJoRYF_o,2023-05-26T16:11:19Z,Palantir: There’s No Stopping It Now,Airbus,One example is Airbus Airbus in 2017 basically built a whole new thing on Foundry and it has its own name it doesn't really matter for that video but that system basically not only made Airbus Production Way more efficient cutting production times for the a350 by tens of percents it also made things more efficient down the line everybody who's buying in you know jet from Airbus now is getting Foundry which means airplanes on the ground time is shorter and efficiencies with moqs with Logistics it's a scheduling and you name it. the few companies that have made that leap like Tyson Foods for example like Airbus and there's other examples they have basically increased their competitiveness in such a way that at this point these guys don't have a choice,0.9,0.8

Tom Nash,4NXD20AMpP0,2023-05-25T10:44:15Z,Palantir: The Next Tesla Stock?,Palantir,so checking my phone pilot here is currently trading at 26 billion dollars that's a far cry from the one trillion dollar price tag I put on it back in November 2020. now if you stay till the end of this video I'll explain exactly what needs to happen for palantir to actually hit that one trillion dollar market cap that's not a joke that's not clickbait that's what I honestly believe in now I want to talk about a few things that are related to palantir because over the past few days naturally there's been a lot of hoopla over palantir the stock has gone through a absolute Rampage a tear and it's on everybody's Minds people are talking about it Kathy Wood is buying back and chicken genius is selling a lot of people are talking about it now I was the original palantir investor who talked about it on YouTube I made my first video when it was 18 per share nobody was talking about it and I immediately said I think this has one trillion dollar potential people were laughing at me man then they kept laughing at me when it went to seven dollars etc etc now I've never changed my position on palantir but here's what I want to explain to you I made a few videos over the past few days explaining why I think palantir is running up too fast I'm looking at the stock price right now and it's not 100 year-to-date in fact it's up almost 57 basically over the past month and that's too much you can't have a stock go up by 50 over the past couple of weeks and just say it's normal and that's okay now a lot of you have been asking me this question which I want to address in this video before we go to the one trillion dollar evaluation Tom if you said back in November 2020 that this stock at 18 is cheap and it can go to a trillion dollars why are you not warning us that the stock price is running up too high when it's still below your entry point it's currently at 12 or 13 you entered at 18. so the question is is this a cognitive dissonance is this a contradiction no I'll explain look when I was talking about palantir I'm talking about the valuation evaluation is based on my DCF model discounted cash flow model valuation which means that the present values of the future cash flows of volunteer are now less valuable in this interest rate environment that is why I'm telling you that things have changed that is why you've seen multiples shrink so multiples of shrunk because of that and that is why 13 in this economy in this interest rate isn't the 18 in 2020. now that's something you have to understand that doesn't mean that the stock isn't going to get there at some point I honestly believe it will but it's just here to tell you that the current valuation of volunteer is not 13 the market absolutely changed the economy change the macro change the interest rates have changed the discount rate has changed so if you run a DCF model right now on stock MVP which is my platform I'm gonna put the link below if you go and you run on our model and do a quick DCF model on valuation on palantir what you're going to get is you know I'm just going to do it on the app but by the way we have an app for this so you can download it on the app store or you know for your Android so for a ten dollar stock price you'd need about 500 million in ebitda next year which is far away from where they are right now they're basically just almost broken even so 500 million dollars of ebitda and an annual growth rate of 35 percent at a discount rate of 12 so assuming they hit 500 million in ebitda which is not the case this year and assuming they're going to grow at 35 which they're not currently it's a 10 stock so for me it's a very simple analysis I'm looking at this I'm saying well I haven't sold a single share I got in at 18 I stayed the course I bought more I'm not gonna sell it in the next 10 years I don't care but if I have to analyze this and look at the share price currently objectively the share price right now with 13 dollars it's just way too high given the conditions the stock has to grow into its valuation now it might go to 20 30 40 on hype which you did already and it might not I don't know but if you want my honest opinion currently it should be valued around 10 bucks and when it gives us better quality results next time and next time and next time it's going to slowly grow into a better valuation that's how this should happen when the stock just hype and just formal and just gets ahead of its own honest valuation fair market value valuation I mean it's unhealthy for the stock and I don't like it as a long-term investor because you know this isn't going to hold now that's about that now the second thing I want to talk about is the question I asked in the beginning is this a one trillion dollar company now I believe it is but you have to understand what needs to happen for this to be a one trillion dollar company for this to be a one trillion dollar company here's what needs to happen we need to get to about 10 billion dollars of evida now ebida is very hard to get because ebitda is not revenues I mean just to give you a kind of a general assessment of where we at Tesla has an ebitda of about 3.5 billion dollars so for this company to get to one trillion dollars we need about two and a half times of the current ebitda of Tesla now pilot these revenues right now is about two billion dollars a year we're talking about 10 billion in ebitda so which means that this thing is at least probably 10 years away there's no way this happens like realistically optimistically the fastest they can get to 10 billion ebitda is 10 years and that's going to be super fast even then it assumes a 50 to 60 annual growth rate from that point on for the next five years after that so if you think that palantir can hit 10 billion dollars in ebitda with a 50 to 60 growth rate and then it's at one trillion dollar stock now a lot of you will tell me in the comments Tom there's no way in hell that this company can do these numbers and that's fine the stock isn't for you I believe it can I just have the patience to wait 10 years and see it happen I'm not in a hurry anywhere,1.0,0.2

Tom Nash,psFtlAiFJMA,2023-05-18T17:27:01Z,How High Can Palantir Stock Go?,Palantir,hey this is Tom and we got to talk about palantir the stock is up 11 just today that's after we had a massive 25 to 30 Spike right after q1 earnings just a couple of days ago and we're up 75 on this stock year to date now it's still a long ways away from the highs of the 20 and the 30 it used to get when Kathy Wood was all about that stock and the meme stocks and all that stuff and the hype stocks etc etc those days are long gone the question is how high can the stock go now at 11.4 dollars the question is what's the runway this stock has can it go back to its Glory how long will it take and do I still think that this is a 500 stock potentially I know this is a 50x from this point but do I still believe that and even more importantly was chicken genius wrong selling this stock he sold at nine and a half dollars he missed out on a lot of money the question is was he wrong now let's go back to palantir here for a second because this is absolutely insane so the question is now that palantir is up let me just pull it up on the screen right now if volunteer is up by 75 here to date is this now a good time to invest for all of you who stayed outside that's a question you're probably debating with and for all of you who already have position considering increasing the position and you know for some of you who are considering taking profits all of you are here to find out how much this stock can run up and here's the simple answer for you I have to go back and talk to you about what just happened look this stock jumped 75 year to date 25 post earnings we understand this right now first of all I have to be honest I'm not with the crowd that's hating on cheek ingenious for selling for two reasons number one he's a Trader not a long-term investor when it comes to palantir and that is 100 right to do whatever he wants if he decides to be a Trader one day and a long-term investor the other day it's his right he decided to be a Trader good for him mainly because of Reason number two which is he made a hundred thousand dollars on this trade so the man took a hundred thousand dollars in profit he got out the stock kept on running it lost another 15 whatever he already made a hundred thousand dollars so he did didn't do anything wrong there's nothing to criticize him for there's no hindsight in this game nobody really knows how stock behaves in the short term he took profits at that time for a Trader that was not a bad idea at all in fact I think if I was a Trader I probably would have done the same now look nobody can predict swings right he did the right call at the time for a Trader but that is why I personally don't trade I only invest long term because there's no way to predict these things short term now for me palantir has never been a trade you all know this right it's not news to you I've always been a long-term investment volunteer I started buying volunteer at 18 a lot of yahoos on the internet talking about me buying at forty dollars and just nonsense go back to my first videos I first did a DCF of volunteer when it was an 18 stock and it kept on buying in fact I kept on buying even as it went higher and I did not time it correctly sure a hundred percent guilty as charged no problem so my entry point was 18 that's fine it doesn't matter and I'll explain why did I miss time it yeah sure but do I care no and here's the answer for you if this is indeed a hundred dollar stock if this is indeed a 500 stock like I think it is already giving you a hint about my answer for the next question so if I think that this is a 500 stock and that's my right to think that that's my opinion might be inaccurate might be wrong might be the ramblings of a Madman from Russia but that's what I think so if I think that this is a 500 stock which I do still to this day and still when the stock was six dollars I was still thinking that that's why I never sold a single share of volunteer so if I think that this is a 500 stock does it matter if I entered 18 10 or 28 or 48 if this is a 500 stock not really it doesn't matter Peter Lynch has a freaking amazing lecture where he talks about the fun fact you all need to remember it's never too late to buy into good companies there's always room for good companies to make profits for long-term investors there's no point in trying to time your entry point if you're not a creator it's the wrong tool for that trade literally so let's talk about palantir for a second and why I think this is potentially is a 500 stock my mind has never changed you know me I've always been true to the sock I've never sold and everybody was hating on it some people were flip-flopping like a Wienerschnitzel basically starting to hit on the stock never changed for me and this is why so right now we had the q1 conference call I think this was one of the most exciting calls we had from palantir The trajectory that we've seen from the q1 numbers and the q1 presentation is incredible uh sure there's a good chance please listen to me there's a good chance this stock can retrace it can sell off it can drop back to seven eight dollars for sure a chicken genius salt that wasn't a bad move at that time hindsight judgment is not fair I don't care look at it I gotta rhyme right so it cannot race it can't fall nobody knows I don't play the game hence I don't care but here's the most interesting point this is the point where I find it fascinating and this is why I think they do have Runway now most analysts and professional investors were bearish on palantir up until the q1 call after the q1 call I don't know if you noticed but the narrative about the stock changed well nothing really changed dramatically for the numbers except gap of stability which is just an accounting number the company was free cash flow positive for multiple quarters already but Gap profitability changed the narrative for this stock so two consecutive quarters of positive Gap profits change a lot of minds on Wall Street about the stock and that's the beginning of a very interesting time for palantir if institutional investors and Wall Street starts looking at the stock seriously not as a meme stock from Hell Kathy Wood kind of thing right this is a support point for the stock that can really take it upwards I don't know if it's going to happen or when but this is a really different thing I'm seeing right now the whole narrative about the stock has absolutely changed now why is it changing now beyond the gap profitability for two consecutive quarters there's other things that going on that people are talking about first of all stock waste compensation coming down so this quarter was the seventh consecutive quarter where SBC stock based compensation delusion actually declined so for two years every single quarter the stock waste competition and dilution of volunteer is declining it's still very high and it can improve but it's coming down every single quarter just in Q2 2021 the percentage of stock based compensation of revenues of palantir was 62 percent this quarter it came down to 22 only 22 ratio between the delusion the SBC and the revenues so they went down by 3x in just under two years now the other thing that people complain about planetary scalability well they're just a government contractor they can't make any money in the commercial industry blah blah blah blah blah well commercial client growth is up 370 percent over the past two years currently 75 of their clients is commercial clients so to say it's a government contractor with 75 percent of the clients coming from the commercial sector is a little bit ridiculous and people starting to see this the other thing is that was a lot of talk about gatekeeping companies don't like palantir they have their own tools they have to admit that those not as good etc etc they're not going to give Valentine a chance well look at the companies that already implemented palantir like Tyson Foods for example at this point it's going to be very simple I've said it two years ago palantir will get to the point where if you don't use it and your competitors are you're gonna get screwed and you're gonna get wiped out you will lose so you don't have any choice but to level up and get Talent here as well which is exactly what's starting to happen right now the other point people talk about volunteer is not you know it's not a recession-proof company blah blah blah well guess what q1 palantir closed 64 new deals at a million dollars or more gave you a quarter of record-breaking revenues of 525 million in this economy when everybody is in the toilet now does it deserve the current price tag is it a good idea to buy into such strength I don't know it's your call I'm not here to decide for you but for me it's very obvious right now this valuation is not representative of the true kind of DCF classic validation of palantir if you can take a look at here on the screen I'm actually showing you this is talking VP this is my own platform but I can actually pull up my own valuation and show you why the valuation of the stock is not yet there but it will be I think it will be this is what I want to show you so this is our own evaluation tool right here and I'm going to make it a little bit smaller so you guys can see it so based on these metrics right here palletish is basically between four dollars and twelve dollars right now if you just do as plain Plains DCF valuation with multiples like textbook and don't assume any sort of you know trajectory of growth Etc et cetera this stock is between four and twelve dollars currently trading at what 11 and a half so there's not a lot of room there so if you're investing in the stock you have to understand it has to grow n into this valuation this company jumped up 75 percent in just the the you know the last five months and I know people say well Tom zoom out it's still down like 50 or whatever 60 yes but times has changed multiples have changed the economy has changed the the markets have changed every single company is in a different climate right now this is the penalty we're talking about not you know not the palantir of two years ago so if you're buying into the stock buy it with the mindset that number one it cannot raise it cancel off number two it still needs a couple of years to grow into its valuation and number three it's either gonna go to absolutely you know out of the stratosphere or it's not and in both options you should be okay with it I wouldn't put my life savings in but everything I have on this stock because like any other stock in the market it always have the potential to actually blow you up so this shouldn't be you know betting your kids college money on this thing no stock should be that position but I'm just here to show you that you know objectively this stock has a lot of progress to make they're not there yet they spiked a lot I don't know if this is the best time to invest or not right now I don't tie my investments long term because it doesn't really matter but you know you do you as always you know don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing I love you all see you next video.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,j_ZcmaYah3c,2023-05-09T13:01:00Z,The Next Tesla Stock Just Revealed Itself | This Changes Everything!,Palantir,palantir is the next Tesla I'm calling it right now what I saw yesterday proved to me beyond a shadow of a doubt this company is the next Tesla now in this video I'll show you exactly why I'll explain how but that's going to be at the end of the video for that you'll have to wait before we get to that point we have to do a few things first which is to analyze the financials analyze the results we cannot get to the final conclusion without me showing you the actual numbers. second consecutive quarter of Gap net income profitability for the company which is a huge milestone there's no point in talking about it again but if you take a look here this is the gap operating profitability for the first time in history another record-breaking milestone for this company. Revenue growth was 18 up to 525 million if you do a TTM calculation the pace right now for this company is over 2 billion dollars per year which is absolutely insane because when we were talking about the stock just a year ago it used to be a billion now to 2 billion U.S commercial customer growth 50 year over year which is another point I want to talk about there's good in this and it's also bad in this now just a quick shout out to palantir they definitely leveraged the AI hype everybody's talking about Ai and they did talk about that as expected in the financials I'm sure 30 40 was fluff just kind of to Hype up this AI thing but their platform is AI based and everybody knows it they've shown a few studies here which you can go and check and verify for yourself basically showing that this industry is basically being dominated by palantir not anybody else and you know they have the research to back it up. a gap of stability second consecutive quarter you can see how the chart looks negative negative negative and then they've stabilized the ship so finally this is a gap net profitable company it seems to be the new standard for volunteering that's incredible a gap operating profitability for the first time in history you can see that right here a U.S business this is very important 337 million dollars for the three months ended in March 23. so one quarter of U.S business generates 340 million for this company now you can hate on palantir all you want but if this company sells services at 340 million per quarter just in the United States imagine what they can do when they actually roll out in rest of the world absolutely insane and U.S commercial Revenue growth was 26 U.S government growth was 22 their bread and butter is the US it's not the rest of the world yet so I think that even though a lot of people are hating on them just showing U.S based geographical Revenue the kind of distribution but for them that's the bread and butter that's where they're targeting and for them that's the success I used to think it's a little bit Shady but now I understand why they're showing this and Alex harp talked about this and the prince conference he said guys we're going for the best Market the best Market is the US for government contracts the best market for commercial software is the us we're going to take over that market first then we're going to expand makes a lot of sense to me and they're definitely dominating in the US. The one thing I have here which kind of troubles me a little bit I want to see faster commercial Revenue growth I mean I want to see commercial Revenue growth uh at a pace that's higher than the government growth because I think that the future is in the commercial sector and when I see them only going 15 versus 20 on the government side it kind of makes me think that you know that that sales team isn't really doing its job properly the commercial growth has to be faster than government growth that's the that's the new direction of the company so that's the first Achilles heel that you can find in these financials so far total revenue growth 18 absolutely impressive this is very important Revenue per customers for the top 20 customers up 14 so their top 20 customers are now paying 50 million dollars each on average and it's up 14 now there's good in this and there's bad in this now I'll show you what I mean if you multiply this number by 20 50 million dollars times 20 you're gonna get half of palantir's revenues so half of volunteers revenues are coming from their top 20 clients now it's a good thing because it shows they have high ticket clients but it also is a huge risk it's called client concentration risk CCR not the band the actual risk and that's a problem when your top 20 customers are basically generating half of your revenues if you lose two customers it's a lot of pain so customer distribution has to be better for this company it's impressive that they can charge 50 million per client for the top clients but I would be much more comfortable with 100 clients carrying that load for the half of the revenues the company not 20. so client consideration is still a thing for palantir. customer account is getting better you can see from 184 commercials to 280 total customer ground is up 41 from 277 to 391 but then again just remember it's impressive it's great but you know the top 20 clients are carrying loads so these are small clients but I get what they're doing here they're accumulating clients eventually going to upsell them and you know it's a very long game and I get it and it's impressive to grow a customer list by 41 year over year but still as long as those 20 clients are making half of your venues that's a big problem as far as risk management goes a total contract value is up to 400 million in the quarter which is incredible Billings are 25 percent this is what's been saying to me in a single quarter they close 64 deals that are worth at least a million dollars so 64 million dollar deals in a single quarter absolutely insane 22 of them were 5 million or more and eight of those deals were 10 million contracts This sales team can improve should improve will improve but even at this point this is some really really impressive stuff. 2.9 billion in cash absolutely insane make sure that you understand that they've took a lot of this money and put it in U.S treasuries why not get free four percent and instead of just having it in the bank and getting nothing and no debt they have a credit facility of a billion dollars which they haven't even used yet you see that 950 Android so that just in case so they have access to four billion dollars and no debt um absolutely insane um so expectations going forward to be Gap profitable for the remainder of the year every single quarter in 2023 will be Gap net income profitable absolutely insane they've just guaranteed that and they're going at a pace of 2.2 billion dollars of revenues for the year absolutely incredible great results. cash flow from operating activities went up from 35 million to 187 million so imagine within a year going from 35 to 190 million dollars in cash flow from operations gross profit is absolutely insane went from 350 to 417 another Improvement income from operations for the first time right here you can see it actually being positive negative negative negative finally being positive absolutely great. total card assets so total current assets are 3.2 billion dollars up from 3.04 billion dollars just at the end of December 2022 So within three months this comes an increased its total current assets by seven percent seven percent absolutely incredible as you can see right here this is the breakdown of marketable Securities and cash and cash equivalents they went from 2.6 cash to basically putting half and half and putting half in marketable Securities which is essentially treasuries why not get a free four percent and now this is the crazy part if you just increase your assets current assets by seven percent and you increase your total assets by six and a half percent you did it with zero dollars that there's no debt but here's the actual important stuff here right now after improving their total current assets and having zero debt this is the reality of volunteer I wrote here Al 400 what does this mean that means they're assets to liabilities ratio is four hundred percent they have four times more assets than liabilities it's very very scarce to find I I challenge you to go and look for a company that has four times more assets and liabilities with zero debt and three billion dollars in the bank and another billion dollars in the credit facility which they've never used except Tesla again I have Tesla Tesla smell except Tesla it's really hard to find a company like that it's really going to be hard I challenge you to try and do that and comment below if you do. what happened to the cost while Revenue grew by 18 and it's really easy to look at because it's in the actual presentation I think what is being overlooked by a lot of analysts is what's going on with the cost structure of this company because I believe that the cost structure is even more impressive than the 18 growth in this economy now a lot okay so about the growth look the company was guiding for higher growth a couple years ago yes but the macroeconomics changed you have to take the revenue growth of palantir in context in context with the economy if the economy is in the toilet if companies are laying off if companies are talking about they're saving costs nobody's expending the economy is shrinking we're going into recession in that economy they did 20 of growth per year absolutely insane so have to be in context as far as Revenue growth 18 of this economy is Hell impressive now gross profit is up 14 which is another impressive thing now so you grew Revenue 18 you grew gross profit 14 now your sales and marketing only grew 16 percent but your r d is flat as you can see right here no extra r d expenses and less they've decreased General and administrative by four percent so just as an overall thing if you take all this together Opex five percent you see this here operating expenses of palantir went up five percent while revenues went up by 18 any company that grows revenues by 18 and grows operating expenses at the same time at five percent means scalable business that's growing like crazy that means that their margins will get better every single quarter very very impressive. and mainly this thing here is you see a double check mark this thing and for the first time we're actually seeing net income no loss this quarter last year they lost 100 million this quarter this year they just made 20 million in net income very very impressive that turnaround really reminds me of Tesla just ah they're in the corner and nobody noticed until it was too late a lot of people got you know became Tesla haters because they were too late to the party and I I suspect a lot of people will become a palantir haters because they will miss this party as well because they're still busy because of their ego they cannot admit they were wrong about this company and that's okay I don't mind either way. stock based compensation another point of critique towards this company which was not mentioned in in the presentation if you take a look at the presentation you'll find that stockbridgecomp isn't really in that um I want to show you this thing so stock based computation is negative 23 negative 23 so that means from one quarter to an to assertion from last year's first quarter to this year's first quarter the company actually decreased its stock based compensation by 23 now I know a lot of people are talking about this oh Stockbridge competition etc etc I get it I get it it's still high at 100 million but guys they've just dropped this thing by 23. so this is a chart by my good friend Emir M you can see his thing right here in the corner em013l on Twitter go check him out he made his charge chart which I initially by the way I thought this was a palantir chart because it looks like a palantir thing so I just tweeted it and he's like Yo dude I made this I was like oh I'm sorry I thought it's volunteer thing I didn't give you credit so now I'm giving credit as credit should be given and you know mistakes are definitely something to admit so Amir am made his beautiful chart and it shows you the percentage of stock based compensation of palantir as a percentage of Revenue so as you can see right here um we're absolutely going crazy right here 62 percent in 2021 then in 2022 33 now in 2023 22 so we went from 60 to 20 as a percentage of Revenue within just two years absolutely incredible incredible now I do want to show you a few other things we're not done with the presentation yet we're going to go back to the presentation so for that we're going to pop that back on the screen Emir thank you for that beautiful table so stock based competition is down 23 and it's now at its lowest as far as percentage of Revenue and as Revenue grows and this thing stays steady it's going to become a smaller and a smaller percentage until it's absolutely meaningful. these are the treasuries in case you were wondering where the company's money is at because you're not seeing cash and cash equivalents being the same as they were in the previous quarter that's where they are money market fans use treasury Securities you get treasury Securities Etc et cetera and this thing says four percent because hey why keep it in the bank and get zero percent when you can get four percent with zero risk that's palantir just being smart absolutely amazing beautiful. This is the credit facility I told you about I went into the actual you know part where they actually explained this if you want to read this pause the screen read this but essentially what this is a bank gave them 900 million dollars of a credit line they can withdraw anytime they haven't used it zero dollars used and that's been open since 2014. so since 2014 almost in 10 years they've not used a single dollar out of this they never had very very simple absolutely impressive. government is doing great but the fact of the matter is government is still 55 of the revenue last last year q1 government was 55 this year as you can see on the screen government is still 55 so I would like to see 60 commercial 40 government that's kind of my vision for this company they're still not there yet the commercial side needs to grow faster I've said it before going to say it again and this is a point that needs to be actually critiqued another point of criticism for me for palantir and again it's a good thing they're going for the U.S market the U.S business software Market is the best in the world it has the most amount of money the most amount of opportunity I get it why you go through the US market it's absolutely the best in the world sure but you cannot ignore the geographical risks that's why I said Geo risk here you cannot ignore the Geo risk here because if you're focused if you're 64 if two-thirds of your business is in one country that means that your Geographic risk is just too big ideally you would want to see 20 U.S 20 UK 20 rest of EU 20 rest of the world Etc et cetera so you would want to see more distribution around the world for this company not just be a us targeted company just to eliminate that risk another thing that needs to be addressed by volunteer I get it they're going for the US first they want to take over that market first and it makes sense but at some point we'll have to press them as investors on this issue as well Geographic risk needs to be attended to. they grew customers by 41 from 277 to 391 that's great but look at this thing right here I spoke about it before going to say it again but also risk why did I say why also risk because when your top 20 clients are giving you a billion dollars in Revenue that's very impressive but also it means half of your business is coming from your top 20 clients which is very dangerous it's huge amount of client concentration risk and it doesn't make me feel comfortable at all. My thoughts about this are very very simple I think that palantir is a great long-term investment I think that yesterday was a beautiful spike it will probably at some point have to correct itself after every 20 25 Spike there's always a correction whether it happens today or tomorrow next week I don't know I said it before gonna say it again I haven't gambled before earnings I don't buy or sell stock right before earnings I don't gamble like that my position is still very very big with palantir it's my biggest position and I was happy to see them succeed and I will be happy to stay a planetary investor as they're getting absolutely phenomenally better in every single category they in my opinion have presented a very strong case to being the next Tesla as far as the strength of the balance sheet as far as their clients as far as the management as far as the way the margins are starting to look as far as their strength in the category they seem to be basically breaking apart from the competition like Tesla did etc etc etc this smells a lot like Tesla to me.

Tom Nash,j_ZcmaYah3c,2023-05-09T13:01:00Z,The Next Tesla Stock Just Revealed Itself | This Changes Everything!,Tesla,palantir is the next Tesla I'm calling it right now what I saw yesterday proved to me beyond a shadow of a doubt this company is the next Tesla. This is a very Tesla like smell you see what I'm getting here this smells a lot like Tesla it's different stage different industry still has a long ways to go this ain't Tesla in 2023 but it smells a lot like Tesla did in the beginning when everybody was hating on it. I challenge you to go and look for a company that has four times more assets and liabilities with zero debt and three billion dollars in the bank and another billion dollars in the credit facility which they've never used except Tesla again I have Tesla Tesla smell except Tesla it's really hard to find a company like that it's really going to be hard I challenge you to try and do that and comment below if you do. very very impressive that turnaround really reminds me of Tesla just ah they're in the corner and nobody noticed until it was too late a lot of people got you know became Tesla haters because they were too late to the party and I I suspect a lot of people will become a palantir haters because they will miss this party as well because they're still busy because of their ego they cannot admit they were wrong about this company and that's okay I don't mind either way. they in my opinion have presented a very strong case to being the next Tesla as far as the strength of the balance sheet as far as their clients as far as the management as far as the way the margins are starting to look as far as their strength in the category they seem to be basically breaking apart from the competition like Tesla did etc etc etc this smells a lot like Tesla to me.

Tom Nash,lLlTlmpcmmM,2023-04-20T15:35:24Z,The END of Tesla's Reign?,Tesla,so Tesla reported q1 earnings yesterday and all hell broke loose the stock is down there's literally half and half the world is now divided into two camps people who are saying that this is the worst quarter in any company's history and people who are saying that this is the best quarter ever the cheerleaders and the haters now I honestly cannot find a single proper video with nuanced analysis of what happened with Tesla with the results with what's going forward it's either cheerleaders or haters I mean there's not a single proper analysis out there who has a little bit of Nuance a little bit of balance it's either Tesla is basically the best thing ever or this is the worst thing ever I was like what the is going on so if you're looking for a cheerleader or hater there's thousands of channels go right ahead if you want balance nuanced analysis of what happened the good and the bad and somebody to tell you that a piece of turret is a piece of third and not some chocolate bar step right in so let's talk about what happened number one um not the best Tesla quarter let's be honest this is not a record-breaking quarter like some people claim no no siree Bob the earnings call felt a little bit rushed the Q a part didn't feel very straightforwardy so earning call get for me probably a c plus not more the quality of the financials the quality of the results probably a B minus B plus somewhere in that range nothing anywhere close to an A but in that range probably closer to a B minus now look the numbers are lower than expected you cannot sit there and say that this is a record-breaking quarter when the numbers are lower than expected price cuts are also part of it price Cuts lower EPS lower margins these things will scare investors no matter how good the company is and as an investor you probably want to know this and a lot of these channels who are hyping it up are not saying that now I will get to the good part so the way we're going to do this I'm going to cover everything the good and the bad so stay with me there's also really good parts about these earnings goals now the EPS the earnings per share lower than expected not gonna sugarcoat a piece of turret and give you oh hey this is chocolate no EPS is lower than expected earnings per share which means profitability is not as good as expected ah not good however however there was a Hidden Gem in those earnings which is absolutely very much excites me which is the energy business specifically the storage the storage business the energy business is doing phenomenally well it's still relatively small a couple hundred million not compares to the Auto industry but it's growth its margins everything about it still small but the storage business is doing really really well it's trajectory now let's talk about raw numbers here a little bit Auto Sales give or take a couple right about 20 billion as expected Automotive gross margin went down to 18 oh my God I'm from 19 to 18. the world is ending the sky is falling no this isn't a sky's falling situation and it's not good that the margins are dropping but it's not necessarily a bad thing I'll explain obviously it's not ideal but you have to remember two things here number one at eighty percent one eight eighteen percent gross margin Tesla has doubled the margin than any other player in the Auto industry including Toyota so best margin in the business still yes it dropped it's not good still light years ahead of the pack number two margin erosion can happen when you're trying to increase volume if Tesla is trying to sell more cars and it's gonna you know use price cuts to do so margin erosion is part of the equation we won't find out until the end of the year how much it worked out if you sell the margin of 22 but you only said a thousand cars and if you reduce the margins to 18 and then you sell 3 000 cars it's a better deal for you as a manufacturer so remains to be seen TBD now 11 operating margin it's lower not a good thing price Cuts is where it's at everybody knows it but again it's not going to be negative if it leads to much more sales but unlike what some of these cheerleaders are saying there's no proof that more sales will come that we either need at DeLorean to go in the future and Doc Brown find out or wait but it it is a plausible scenario but again nobody ever wants to see margins getting eroded it's not a good thing it's not something to celebrate it's a very interesting gamble which I think Tesla is rightfully doing with increasing you know production and sales through the loss of margin Viet price Cuts but the proof is in the pudding and that pudding ain't going to be ready until the end of the year okay next operating expenses normal consistent as usual no drama Tesla somehow live through this whole inflationary cycle with absolutely no increased costs I have no idea how they freaking did it that alone is freaking impressive if you take anything from Tesla the fact of the matter is their operating expenses are pretty much flat and they're selling 20 more cars absolutely insane Gotta Give Them Credit in that also don't forget model y top selling car car not electric car multiple countries I mean this is going like hotcakes Tesla has its Ford F-150 now for the F-150 the best-selling truck in the United States model y That's the next Ford F-150 as far as sales Reliance that's the how should I put it the golden egg laying Goose for Tesla very nice and Auto Sales growth year over year a little bit shy of 20 percent look it's not good it's shrinking sure it's not 40 50 growth like we got accustomed to but hey the economy is in the toilet and the rest of the competition if you actually look at the benchmarks you look at the competition they're all bleeding these guys increase double digit sales 20 sales in this economy not brilliant but I'll take it compared to the competition it's actually pretty good now look the bad part about this and again I'm gonna say it like you know I'm gonna call it like I see it sorry and the market has been looking for reasons to be bearish on Tesla for a long time a water like this gives them just enough ammunition to go as fast and that's why you see price definitely because people are looking for better signals for Tesla and this is one of them and I don't agree that this is a bearish quarter but I mean there's enough in there to get people kind of worried which is exactly what they're trying to do and at the end of the day as an investor look at this and see a car so a company that yes I also see a car but a company that's doubling the margin compared to the competition that's growing at 20 percent 20 billion dollars in cash 400 million dollars of free cash flow this year yes Revenue growth is slowed margin is slowed it's not good but hey lots of profits lots of cash lots of sales nothing to worry about not as good as expected they can do better but hey this is not the end of the world at all look you have to remember macroeconomics they dictate issue like people don't buy cars it's forty thousand dollars when economy is bad so Tesla is holding up nicely with this economy and at their price level they're not selling a 20 000 car they're selling offensive cars so macro is hard people are basically not spending as much and they're still selling 20 more cars every year um I think there's a lot of overreaction to the margin erosion right now or the margin have dropped by one percent oh my God you know all the analysts are losing their minds come on bro and I think a lot of a lot of what people aren't really talking about is the fact that look Tesla consistently sells a lot of cars and obviously we can talk about the fact that they keep collecting more data through their FSD and through their autopilot and through their cars which is basically a walking sorry a driving computer Tesla is getting ahead of the pack as far as information as far as data as far as prepping the FSD God knows where it's going to be ready on Elon time it probably should have been ready this year but I mean so much data picked up because of all the cars they're selling and margins again probably not going to be as good as we got accustomed to but hey if their volume increases they won't care and I think it's important here to look at the big picture Gestalt and not the little details because sometimes you can look at the forest and not see the trees and look think about it this way there's two options from here either the economy gets good and Tesla sells way more cars because people are you know and more inclined to buy cars with the economy is good or the economy is bad if the economy is bad the first ones to get destroyed is Ford and GM it's not Tesla Tesla will weather any economy so Tesla wins no matter how you kind of twist it yes the earnings are not amazing but hey economy bad competition ties Tesla wins economy grade Tesla still outsells competition Tesla wins so hey and for those of you who are that worried about margins go Google how much money it costs to ramp up two Factories at the same time talking of course about Berlin and talking of course about taxes right 2 factories being ramped up at the same time will not only take it all in your margins it will bankrupt companies the fact of the matter that Tesla only lose like a couple percent of margin because of what's going on right now with ramping up two factors is hella impressive so for those of you who are looking for a cheerleading section of Tesla how it's amazing no could have done better not the best quarter but hey this guy isn't falling it's still on the same trajectory for those who are hating on this Lane would it be to take a dump on it not gonna happen the numbers are too good,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,4wXu84CJ9EY,2023-04-17T21:10:35Z,Palantir Stock Skyrockets 38%,Palantir,so it's been a hot minute since I spoke about palantir I know but it's time we raise an important question given the fact that the stock is up 38 year-to-date is this too late to get into palantir now look I don't want you to click nothing I don't want you to smash nothing I don't want you to buy nothing just listen with me and let's get this show on the road of course a fair disclosure before I get started I'm a palantir bull I'm a palantir investor palantir is my biggest position and none of what I'm about to say right now constitute any sort of financial advice just sharing my own opinion about a publicly traded company you all can research for yourself and I urge you to do so now here's the thing you look at palantir 38 give or take for the past few months you look at the snowflake stock a stock which was traditionally hyped to be way better than palantir almost seven percent at this same time you look at benchmarks like the S P 500 up 8.3 at that same time you look at the NASDAQ 16 double the S P 500 and then you go back and you look at palantir now you know that Old Spice commercial look at your man look at me hello ladies look at your man now back to me now back at you man now back to me sadly he isn't me this is literally it look at your other stocks look at the index look at palantir quietly under the radar almost 38 year-to-date now I'm always not super excited about getting in into a crowded trade because if everybody is actually buying palantir stock right now if everybody's hyped as an investor it's probably not a good time for me to open more position more exposure during times in which people are flocking into a stock and that's why the best times are usually when the stock is getting beaten down if you have a strong thesis which is something I've done consistently over the past two years now personally I got a lot of flack for supporting this stock for saying it's a great investment for me over the past few years people have taken some shots at me for saying that this stock is legit many videos have been made many things have been said and let's be honest I couldn't give less about what people say I do me you do you for me nothing has changed so let's take a look at palantir at eight dollars and 80 cents with a 37 Spike over the past few months is a good investment for a long-term investor named Tom Nash based on my own thesis hopefully it's going to spark a little sparking you to go and research this thing for yourself and decide for yourself so looking at the stock you can see that the majority of this Spike actually happened over the past three months so we're at 37 38 year-to-date and over the past three months it's actually went up 27 and a half percent now here's the first thing you should pay attention to with the stock like palantir a stock like palantir have a lot of short activity if you go and scroll down here you see that we have over seven percent right here of short interest on the stock this is not the highest shortest stock you'll find in the stock market but it's definitely heavily shorted at over seven percent and short selling interest in a stock usually applies downwards pressure in the short and medium term on any stock price and palantir is no different and as a long-term investor in the stock you should be aware of this because if you see fluctuation in the price you have to understand this stock is heavy on retail participation it is heavily shorted and that's why you will see a lot of volatility with the stock and if you are considering the stock Fair portfolio you have to have the right stomach for it it's not for everyone now some of you that are long-term presidential investors you've seen this but for those of you who are a little bit new to this stock I'm going to run through it in about a minute just to show you where things stand for the stock NOW palantir is a company volunteers management have always treated this segment Revenue as a segment that's supposed to bring about 35 year over year they later adjusted it they backtrack but in our own Original Gangster Minds we still remember that 35 year-over-year keger now they did 23.6 year over year and for us this was a disappointing number because we still remember that 35 they promised back in 2020 however what you do have to account here is the fact that this has been a horrible year business isn't good for anybody look at the layoffs look at the economy look at the cost of capital look at the banking sector everything is hurting so in a year like this to give me 23 and a half percent growth in Revenue I'll take it it's not the best but in this climate and this environment it's a pretty impressive number if you actually don't pay attention to what they said before the economy went tits up now the one impressive part for me here again as a long-term investor I love this trajectory what I'm looking here I want to see how much the revenue is growing and at the same time I'm looking at the expenses and I want to say in which direction they're headed and what's the trajectory so as Revenue growth is in the mid-20s and I expect it to remain in that area for a while I'm looking at the selling General and administrative expenses and I'm seeing 1.2 billion now this is a very high number if you compare it to 1.5 in Revenue so if I sold 1.5 billion and my sgna is 1.2 billion that's way too high it means I'm still a long ways away from proper profitability I know I know and there is Gap profitable for the first time but this is way way premature looking at this number they need to do more work on this but if you're looking for some good news and this is exactly what I'm about to show you while revenue is growing at a rate of 23.6 percent which is right here sgna is only growing at a rate of six percent this is something I personally love to see it tells me yeah things aren't great right now but the trajectory for the revenue is way faster than for sgna and that creates a lot of Arbitrage for me because investors are not impressed with 1.5 versus 1.2 as GNA but if you look under the hood you see that the trajectory is incredibly impressive and the same story even better happens when you expand the expenses and you actually take a look at operating expenses as a whole if you go and you expand operating expenses versus Revenue then you see again open expresses are 1.6 billion revenue is 1.5 billion not brilliant but look at the growth rate here operating expenses are growing at 2.8 percent 2.8 percent Revenue grew at 23.6 so the revenue of palantir this is the part I want you to listen very carefully forget about the numbers look at the percentages look at the trajectory the revenue growth of palantir is happening at a pace of 10 x compared to its operating expenses growth now as much as you may not like palantir and I know there's a lot of people who are bearish on the stock for whatever reason and that's okay there's good reasons not to like the stock but you can't tell me with a straight face that a company that grows Revenue 10 times faster than it grows operating expenses is going to be unprofitable for a very long time now the other thing I want you to attention to pay attention here pay attention pretension I might patent that I might pretension that sorry I don't know what's going on and look at this thing here and again the OG patented investors you all seen this a million times I know I know but for those of you a little bit new here peep this for a second cash in cash equivalence 2.6 billion totaled at 249 million that means that this company has 10 times more cash than it has debt it means that it can literally create that right now go to zero debt and send 2.4 billion of cash this second so the only reason I think they're keeping this debt is probably is cheap I'll be surprised if they have like what's their interest expenses I can't see it here so here's a great example of how you can customize these things so this is stuck MVP I don't have interest expense here and I'm curious to see how much palanti is paying so I can click right here this is actually organic I didn't plan to do this where's interest expenses let's find it okay here we go you see this interest expenses I add this feature I do create profile then I'm gonna get to see how much I don't have to dig around in the palantir financials to find that out that's the beauty of my platform sorry I'm not trying to promote it I'm just showing you how to use this okay so let's go to interest expenses now we have it interest income how the hell do they generate 20 million in interest income with a 249 billion a million loans sorry so this means oh man this means that this 249 million of loan is pretty much interest free this is incredible I every time I look under the hotels company I like it a lot more and look at the total assets total ability ratio again phenomenal you'll be stretched to find something like this um look liabilities are 800 million assets at 3.5 billion assets are growing at six and a half percent per year liabilities are dropping at 14 for a half percent per year per year I mean you couldn't have asked for a better setup as far as the health of the balance sheet and the health of their financial results I mean this company is definitely headed in the right direction has a lot of problems but definitely headed in the right direction now again I want to keep showing you some of the things that I think justify its incredible run and I think this time unlike what happened in 2020 there's no hype around the stock at all people are on Wall Street bets are not talking about it there's not a lot of excitement even I haven't made a lot of videos on it right so with the lack of excitement the company is slowly but surely building its growth and look I'm not going to celebrate here palantir at 8.8 dollars per share which is a long ways away from where it should be and still a dollar 20 below the DPO price but I will tell you that this is a step in the right direction and it's fun to see some positive momentum sure why not So based on what analysts are saying consensus wise there's still like a dollar in it maybe a little bit less like 67 cents in it per share which is still a considerable amount of profit and for the medium short term again analysts will tell you what this kind of the sentiment is analysts don't give you price targets for long-term investing I understand telling you what the street thinks about a stock so if Alice is saying nine and a half dollars that's a good representation of what the street thinks and what the retail thinks so that's that and this is also very important I want you to see this and I want you to really really pay attention one of the biggest knocks on palantir and still is is this that right here follow what I'm showing here this is the percentage of palantir shares held by institutional investors guys like Vanguard BlackRock Goldman Sachs the big boys now as a company you always want 60 to 65 70 of institutional ownership because these guys they don't flip-flop like a Wienerschnitzel they stay with an investment they believe in for a while they add a lot of stability to a stock NOW palantir is nowhere near where it should be I think the healthy ratio is about 60 percent they're way below at 34.77 I'm not going to sugarcoat a piece of turret and tell you that this is good this is not good and this has traditionally been the problem of palantir but again let's look at the trajectory because I think the Arbitrage on these Investments where there's gaps of kind of evaluation isn't trajectory not in the actual numbers everybody can see this percentage and they can see it's a low percentage but not a lot of investors can actually look at the trajectory look under the hood be a little bit smarter look at the bigger picture right we can debate all day about the freaking downfall of the US dollar it's an interesting topic but this actually makes people money not specifically about palleteer but looking at the details looking at the trajectory the reason I want you to look at this chart because it shows you the amount of institutionally held shares of palantir since September 2020 and as you can see right here I mean this thing is going up faster than a tourist is long in a Thailand brothel let's put it this way that's all I'm gonna say look at what's going on right here the trajectory is very clear institutional ownership is still low but it's going up it's going up every single quarter it had a little dip right here and then it climbed back up and now it's past the previous all-time high at a new all-time high so palantir institutional shareholding is an all-time high the trajectory is up institutionals are slowly buying up the stock and if you look at the biggest boys here some of these names I mean look Vanguard BlackRock this is absolutely incredible names again this doesn't say anything even BlackRock they own a piece of everything Vanguard again but the fact of the matter is they're buying up more shares I think that there's a good chance we might see planetary about 40 institutional shareholding at this space within a couple of quarters and that's again good trajectory for the stock now I want you to take a look at this tool we have right here it's called the safe and this is the relation tool we have in addition to this the CF model sorry and I'm not going to go through the details but this is basically what we're seeing here for the five-year Target price which is something that Atlas can give you right so for the five year Target price of volunteer the bear case is seven dollars which is about a dollar ninety below the current price the middle ground kind of Middle Ground is two I just said Middle Ground kind of underground I don't know what I was saying there so the middle case um is the plane rental case like 22 and a half dollars and the optimistic you know the bull case is 38 So based on this model you might lose the door now 90 but this is pretty much seems to be at this point the floor understanding changes there's a lot of upside for the stock if you're willing to wait for that five years again there's nothing guaranteed about this the only thing that's guaranteed in this world is two things that we're all gonna die one day and we're all gonna pay taxes every year everything else is a variable so at least based on these numbers it seems like palantir has a lot of margin to give this is my DCF quick DCF model which I ran right here not going to run through the details but basically my DCF value for the stock is right now and this interest rate environment above five percent interest which is about five percent higher than what it was when I did my last ECF is about 14 per share which means at least in my book as a long-term investor this is a 50 undervalued stock so the short answer here whether it's too late to get into palantir in these conditions is that probably not a good time to jump into a stock when everybody's crowding in when people are pouring in into a stock probably not the best time but as a long-term five-year investor you couldn't be bothered by this it doesn't really matter for a long-term investor the only thing that matters is fundamentals the question is is palantir worth more than eight dollars and 80 cents based on what we know today my own personal opinion which isn't financial advice on personal opinion is that it is and that's why I'm absolutely happy with my position and I don't think it's too late to become a long-term investor in palantir is it too late to swing Traders thing I don't know I don't care simple as that thank you so much for joining me I hope you enjoyed this little recap of what's going on palantir shout out to the palantir community I love you all again before you sign off don't click nothing don't buy nothing don't smash nothing but sign up stock MVP,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,8nNbLiwaD0w,2023-04-04T16:07:12Z,It’s Over: NATO Just Broke Russia,NATO,"Finland joins NATO over Russia's objection. Finland joined the NATO military alliance, dealing a major blow to Vladimir Putin with a historic realignment of the European security landscape due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. hey this is Tom Ash and here's a quick video about what just happened in Finland and NATO so Finland is now a part of NATO for All in This purposes Finland is jumping in. Finland joining NATO is a huge trophy for NATO and this is not only a dream come true it's actually a nightmare for Vladimir Putin. The whole reason Putin went to war in Ukraine because he was trying to eliminate more NATO borders on his back porch but now by Finland joining by Finland just Finland loan the Russian border with NATO has just doubled it just added 800 kilometers of massive Warriors. Now that's long history but ever since that moment Finland has never stepped foot into NATO they've always been neutral they never wanted to be a part of NATO. Most Finnish people did not express the desire to join NATO that is of course until Putin invaded Ukraine and all bets were off and now the idea of oh we're going to want to piss off Putin it's long long gone because we've just seen what he's capable of he'll just take over whatever he thinks he needs so now that status quo has been broken and Finland is more afraid than putting actually attacking them than pissing off Putin because he's unpredictable he's dangerous etc etc et cetera so Finland the entire public opinion in Finland changed due to the Ukraine war and now they won't end now it's not good news for Putin we'll talk about that in a second and his miscalculations but the main obstacle so you might ask yourself why did they take Finland a whole year to join because the worst out of the year ago well that is because one of the strongest members of NATO is actually turkey turkey is the second biggest military force in NATO believe it or not and geographically speaking they're sitting in a very very important position the nade organization relies have heavily on Turkey it's a big member it has veto on any country wanting to join and veto they did so turkey basically said no we do not accept Finland we do not accept Sweden they can jump through hoops we don't want them. Putin was running a very long con against NATO. Putin tried to take NATO apart by invading Ukraine but he made NATO even stronger because now Germany in the US is now together Finland is in and Sweden is just a matter of time and even the beef between Sweden Finland and turkey is now basically gone because they've actually struck a deal so this is a huge huge development it is massively important for NATO and a big blow to put in.",1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,8nNbLiwaD0w,2023-04-04T16:07:12Z,It’s Over: NATO Just Broke Russia,Nord Stream pipeline,he convinced the Germans to set up the Nordstrom pipeline this was the beginning of a long con eventually he got Angela Merkel on top of the Green Wave and the fears of nuclear energy to kill its entire energy independence with you know shutting down 17 nuclear power plants as this happened in 2022 Angela Merkel finished killing the entire German industry of nuclear energy this is the same year that Putin invaded Ukraine thinking that now that he is the provider of over 50 percent of the German energy he gets to tell Germany what to do and he's going to basically take NATO apart he's going to take Ukraine block NATO and then Germany will be basically dependent on Russia and it will do whatever Russia says and NATO will be toothless basically powerless meaningless and then that was the game plan but what ended up happening is that Germany said no we're calling your bluff and then Putin said well you know I kind of need the money money so I'm still going to sell energy to you so they call this Bluff he still kept selling them energy and also we had a very warm winter which played to the you know to the to the German side,0.9,-0.6

Tom Nash,ZsSGiUedGD4,2023-03-27T15:29:48Z,WARNING! Recession Will Start in a Few Months,SVB (Silicon Valley Bank),the svb Silicon Valley Bank sailed to First Citizens Bank is absolutely non-issue it changes nothing it doesn't solve anything for the banking crisis and it doesn't solve anything long term for the US economy we're still on the path to destruction here and I'm going to show you why now look svb Silicon Valley Bank was the biggest bank to collapse since 2008 since the Lehman Brothers FDIC took over today we finally got word that they sold it to First Citizens another U.S bank and they did it at a hefty discount of 23 percent and only on the good half of assets the bad half of assets gets to say with the fdsc because nobody wants that and that's kind of okay now look svb was the biggest collapse and then you add on top of it Signature Bank you are the top of it silvergate and then you talk about the potential almost collapse of First Republic then you add the top of it Credit Suisse you tap on top of the Deutsche Bank even though they're not American Banks Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank but basically it creates a lot of fear in the U.S banking system from a psychological standpoint then on top of it we had the svb collapse because of poor management also because svb was caught up in a really tight spot they had a lot of bonds which they had to sell off at last people freaked out they panicked and all of this led to a lot of extended withdrawals from these Banks and moving to bigger Banks so the smaller Banks which were already struggling now got hit with this massive fear and they were actually in the big big problem so the FED had to do something so now the hope of the fed and I'm going to tell you right now it's not going to work the hope of the FED is with the sale of Silicon Valley Bank Credit Suisse being sold to UBS and fresh Republic being saved and the whole Deutsche Bank thing actually seems to fizzle out the hope is that now with this sale of spb the First Republic we get quiet people relax and the money flow from smaller Banks stops so they can stabilize their stuff and get some liquidity Capital One nine percent svb had eight percent Signature Bank had seven percent First Republic two percent First Republic holds two percent in cash of their entire deposits meaning that if more than two percent of people want their money right now in First Republic this Bank does not have the money to repay them State Street 1.7 PNC 1.5 and what about First Citizens the bank that just bought SVP right SVP had eight percent of cash of their deposits and the bank that bought them First Citizens they have 5.8 percent you know what happened with svb when you know people realized that they're in trouble they went for the bank and basically they they you know they started the bank run and the bank collapsed now with other Banks is it possible in the US is svb an outlier no I just showed you a lot of these banks have one percent one and a half percent two percent that Signature Bank had seven percent First Citizens have 5.8 percent so no the other banks are not safe the other banks are not out of the woods and the banking crisis is far from over it's going to start another svb quasi process for all these other Banks so here's what's going to happen and unfortunately they're going to let inflation go crazy because they can't actually stop it right now because of the banking system by basically halting their process with interest rates inflation is going to start taking more tolls on the profitability of companies and or the margin rates Etc et cetera you know inflation is high your costs are up wages don't catch up with inflation nearly as fast so people will have less purchasing power companies will have less profit margins and worse performance so that's going to lead eventually to a Slowdown in the job market so when people are not buying and businesses have smaller margins people lose their jobs at the same time now all of these banks are not lending money because they're trying to pile up liquidity all these Banks just saw what happened to svb and these other Banks so they're filing cash as much as they can so the banks are not lending any money so with the bad one there's a kind of a credit crunch so all these companies now have no capital from the banks well as much capital from the banks the little Capital they have is now way more expensive because of elevated interest rates and people are slowly running out of purchasing power and their margins are eroding so there's going to be an unemployment Spike along with the existing inflation rate which is speculationary environment now speculation is on high unemployment and also High inflation now the good news sort of the good news here if you're looking for the silver line that stackflation eventually cures itself but it takes a long ass time so when you have declaration which means high unemployment High inflation eventually if you have high unemployment people don't spend and if people don't spend prices drop and eventually that kills inflation and you step out of it but last time we had speculation in the 70s it took five years to get out of it five years to get out of it and a very severe recession to the US so it's not from I think from 1975 all the way to 1981. so if it will fix itself but it's going to be a very painful process and unfortunately the people who will pay the price for all these policy mistakes by the FED are the middle class and the and the and the poor people they're going to be the ones you know left holding the back for this the rich people they will suffer a little bit but not nearly as much and unfortunately it is what it is for the U.S economy this means really bad times ahead now there might be a small spike in the stock market after John Paul actually finally admits they cannot raise any more rates whether it does it in a month or in six months whenever they actually feel comfortable to do it you might see a little bit of a spike in the stock market I don't know I don't trade so I don't care but long term looking at the next two years it's going to be an absolute show the best case scenario is going to be kind of a sideways Market based on everything that happens right now there's just not good Solutions out here let me know if you agree with me let me know if you disagree with me I would

Tom Nash,RqJVfwIJfnY,2023-03-24T20:47:39Z,Deutsche Bank Failing?,Silicon Valley Bank,The problem is that the price of these bonds is determined predominantly by the interest the FED sits as long as the interest is very low the price of these bonds is extremely high so these Banks were buying bonds at a very high price exactly what happened to svb now at some point the Federal Reserve went from well it's not transitory let's raise interest at the highest paid since Paul volcker Let's Go Crazy five percent in a single year the moment the FED decided to do that all of these Banks got slammed with their penis and their mousetrap pretty much they couldn't do jack [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] their interest rates drove the price of their bones down so low that they have a massive massive exposure right now in the US U.S banks are sitting on 1.7 trillion dollars of unrealized losses from bonds because of this exact situation this wasn't a Silicon Valley Bank limited situation this is an issue for every single U.S Bank 1.7 trillion dollars in total we have about 20 trillion dollars of deposits into us so this gives you kind of the figure of how bad things are now once the FED raise rates the banks that had zero risk profile and the worst management and were an absolute freak Show of management they collapsed signature bag and svb they got knocked out first because how gruesome the management was Zero price profile no interest swaps so they got wiped out,1.0,-0.9

Tom Nash,RqJVfwIJfnY,2023-03-24T20:47:39Z,Deutsche Bank Failing?,Bloomberg TV,now it doesn't help when the Federal Reserve basically sends out Jerome Powell yesterday to talk about what's going on and for the better part of his speech he does very well he talks about Bank security he talks about how important it is to keep Bank stability he starts his whole speech we talk about Banks but then in the Q a section the gentleman from Bloomberg TV asks him well John Powell do you think that you guys will drop rates sometime this year and instead of dodging the question instead of saying well we don't know we'll see he literally said no the minute he said no this means that this problem for the banks is not going away in 2023 this means that the whole confidence in the banking system goes back to the floor because now everybody would have a brain that are basically analyzing these Banks now know that they're sitting on a huge pile of unrealized losses and now the FED just said well we're not long rates so your problem your mismatch problem is going to continue all through 2023. congratulations John Powell you just played the entire banking system now again I don't know if he's actually going to you know walk the walk having talked to talk but the damage the confidence of the bank was done and that's why the next day you're seeing all the banks bleed because of what Jerome Powell said,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,Lb16QzpNS-E,2023-03-19T20:55:10Z,UBS Buying Credit Suisse: Everything You Need To Know!,Credit Suisse,hey this is Tom and we got some breaking news UBS is now confirmed to buy Credit Suisse the deal is happening 3.2 billion dollars and according to reports they're going to finalize everything to get this deal done and closed buy breakfast on Monday which is pretty insane given the fact that these deals sort of take like a year to carry out normal time but these are obviously not normal times in this video everything you need to know about this deal how it's going to be structured how it's going to work out what's going to happen to the shareholders what's the potential of a contagion in Europe and potentially in the banking industry in the US everything you need to know but first of all don't click nothing don't smash nothing and don't buy nothing and now let's get started so three days ago I posted a video saying that credit twist will be sold to UBS despite the reluctance of the latter to take this deal it will be forced upon UBS by the Swiss government by making this deal super sweet and impossible to refuse kind of a make him an offer they can refuse Vinnie sort of thing so basically it's exactly what happened so it's not like I'm a genius there's not a lot of options out here I mean the bank was going on there and it was either going to be sold to Deutsche Bank which had interest but the Swiss will never sell it to the Germans or they have to nationalize this and that they don't want to do so the only option is UBS by making this deal impossible to refuse so the current market cap of Credit Suisse is about seven to eight billion dollars credit twist is being sold to UBS for 3.2 billion you do the math but it's pretty much less than half price on top of that the Swiss government is going to make sure that up to nine billion dollars of BS and that's that credit twist has gotten themselves into will be born and recouped and actually taken care of by the Swiss government so up to 9 billion dollars of stupid mistakes made their credit to us is now the government's problems and not ubs's thing to worry about on top of that the government is extending a hundred billion dollars loan to Credit Suisse under the management of UBS to sort their act together I think this deal is impossible to refuse for UBS and that's why it's actually happening on top of that the Swiss government is actually circumventing the whole shareholder approval democracy free market thing and they're basically overriding the shareholders nobody's asking the shareholders of Credit Suisse nothing this deal is happening and it's happening fast faster than the heart attack in fact I've never seen a merger happen this fast in my life I mean this usually takes 6 to 12 months in a normal time but then again as I said these are not normal times and in case you're wondering what's going to happen to the shareholders of Credit Suisse well they're getting a haircut for every 22 shares of Credit Suisse they're getting one share of UBS which is about half of the financial value that they held on the eve of this deal they are getting a massive massive shortcut but on the other hand if you chose to invest your money in a company that got involved in tax evasions money laundering corporate Espionage archaicos Capital Etc et cetera et cetera I mean what were you thinking I mean this was bound to happen now the more important stuff that happened over the course of this deal actually materializing is that the Swiss Finance Minister held the press conference with the chairman of Credit Suisse in which they all basically blew smoke up of everybody's ass so the Swiss Finance Minister explained how this is not a bailout of course she called it a financial solution which I found very very funny yes it is a financial solution which is called a bailout you guys just spelled them out you extended a hundred billion dollars of credit and nine billion dollars of guarantees and gave it to them at Half Price without asking the shareholders that is available ladies and gentlemen also they admit that Credit Suisse was on the brink of collapse and bankruptcy which we kind of knew but that was never confirmed until now now Alex Lehman which is the chairman of Credit Suisse funny name by the way given what was going on right now so Alex Lehman I'm sure there's no connection to the Lehman Brothers but Alex Lehman the chairman of credit Swiss was also in that press conference explaining how this whole thing happened because of the U.S banking collapse so basically he was saying that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank collapsed credit twists and how the Americans are at fault of this etc etc which is probably one of the most laughable arguments I've heard in my lifetime because look you're ignoring a few important critical facts if that's what you want to argue number one credit Swiss lost 38 of their deposits 38 of their deposits in the last three months of 2022 long before the U.S banking crisis number two they lost seven billion dollars in 2022 which is the most they've lost in the year and actually the entire profits they had in the previous decade and they managed to lose five or five point five billion dollars in the archangos capital Scandal basically where everybody find out that they had no risk no idea what they were doing with the money and they just had PWC their own auditor file an adverse opinion on their own financials so I don't think none of this has to do with the U.S banking collapse because everything I just pointed out happened way before the U.S banking collapsed so I find that argument a little bit laughable but what do you expect from the chairman of Credit Suisse I mean not the best management now let's talk about the risk of contagion is this a risk of contingent for the U.S banking sector for the global banking sector let's talk about it so I guess the short answer is no and I want to show you a little bit why look the top three banks with the most amount of uninsured deposits in the United States before the collapse they were Silicon Valley Bank Signature Bank First Republic all of them de facto are bankrupt including First Republic that got bailout but that's a whole different story now on the flip side of that the top three bank with the least diverse business lines are silvergate Silicon Valley Bank and signature bank now you get where I'm going with this so as you can see these four Banks Silicon Valley Bank silvergate Signature Bank and First Republic are very unique cases that all got destroyed including First Republic now if you ask anybody in the banking industry what is the stinkiest worst performing Bank out of all the globally important systemic Banks out there and that's actually a definition Well everybody's going to say in the past five years credit Swiss in the past two years credit twist in the past year credit Swiss credit Swiss was substantially effectively the least performing the worst performing globally important systemic Bank in the world for years I'm gonna go as far as saying in the past 20 years so to see that collapse it's just kind of finally you get finally this thing collapsed how they stayed in business for so long with all the scrubs they had nobody knows but finally it's over,1.0,-0.9

over let's talk about it now look truth be told credit Swiss was a bad bank for years every Swiss friend I have hates that bank like it was Darth Vader from Star Wars and some of them actually work for credit Swiss so you can make up your own mind and conclusions about this bank but here's a quick executive summary of their Shenanigans recently working with a Nigerian dictator check laundering money for the exclusive check helping Iranians Bridge Financial sanctions check participating in a tax division scheme in Germany check and another little tax evasion scheme in the US check and just three years later another one in Italy just two years after that and then they got fined for money laundering in the US and Singapore got into another tax evasion scheme in Europe forged client signatures to take their money and bet it on stocks without clients knowledge shout out to Sam bankman freed then they got into a quick corruption scheme in Hong Kong a bit of corporate Espionage after that some small small drug trafficking Adventure in Bulgaria and of course they lost a 5.5 billion dollars in the archanges capital scandal in 2021 and eventually losing 7.3 billion dollars in 2022 which is pretty much everything they made for a decade so you must be wondering how are they still around I have no idea don't look at me so after the latest Scandal which included their own Auditors PWC pricewaterhousecoopers basically saying their financials are dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they can't be trusted it's great when your auditor says it about you as a public company as a bank after their biggest investors Harris sell out of the stock completely after the second biggest investor who's now the biggest investor says he isn't putting a single dollar to help these guys and after outflows of a hundred billion dollars in three months along with an annual loss of 7.3 billion in 2022 which evaporated the profits of the bank in the prior 10 years then we got this yesterday we saw credit Swiss ready to come apart at the seems like a chip cushion but like always these mother lovers who somehow they made it out alive again this morning this Swiss National Bank said it would provide a 50 billion Franc loan to Credit Suisse to save their ass from going under now the Saudi National Bank that same largest shareholder that said yesterday they aren't spending a single dollar to save credit Swiss is now saying that there's nothing to panic about which is what always relaxes people right nothing more relaxing than hearing someone scream Don't Panic on top of that the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss equivalent of the SEC made sure to put out a press release to assure that Credit Suisse had no trouble to meet Capital requirements and that the U.S banking crisis does not pose was a risk of contagion to any Swiss banks at all that actually made me more nervous since it's like your kid coming up to you and saying Hey Dad I didn't steal the chocolate from the pantry earlier I mean come on dude now in all seriousness this is actually very similar to what the US did with First Republic Bank by providing it with a 70 billion dollar credit facility to prevent it from collapsing essentially holding it on life support so we don't have another svb and Signature Bank so the question is how much did this 50 billion but for Credit Suisse well is this going to be a Band-Aid or this will actually help credit Swiss to get it act together now to be fair the last time this Swiss government did this was in 2008 and it worked they gave 60 billion dollars to UBS and in that case UBS got their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together but then again as you understand from the output to this video Credit Suisse is not UBS so the truly scary part here is that as the Credit Suisse crisis was playing out Jim Cramer apparently was on TV playing with his little buttons saying that the next week is going to be fantastic for your portfolio which means we're all pretty much screwed and talking about this function as this was happening Kathy Wood came back from the freezer apparently you know as people were taking money from Regional Banks hair fund actually got a piece of it she got 397 million in money going in Arc which is the biggest one day inflow she saw in two years so what's going on here well look here's the reality of it here's the executive summary a bank that lost 143 Million last year which is its biggest loss in history which is the Swiss National Bank is rescuing a bank that lost 7 billion last year which is everything it made in the past 10 years which is credit Swiss you know talk about the blind leading the blind but I do have to give credit to the Europeans on how they handle this situation when you think about it this is how a bank Grant should be handled I'm not even joking right no post collapse bailouts give these mother lovers a loan so they can regain liquidity and stabilize the markets and the fear within 24 hours and look I get it free markets should decide the fate of failing companies and with banks it's not like that it's different Banks actually feel a very important role in any freaking Society in an economy we can't just let them collapse like it was just another company especially when they have 600 billion dollars of deposits you can't let it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] evaporate you know that would have been the worst of all options to be honest now as much as I hate bankers and I do the reality is that Banks provide a critical function in the economy and I'm not saying that this was a good thing to bail out another bank it's simply the somewhat less worst option of them all given the circumstance and the question is what's next now you just gave 50 billion dollars to credit Swiss which was criminally mismanaged for 20 years and did every single mistake in the book including writing some new books about how to make mistakes so unless the Swiss government cleans the house inside that bank through possibly a sale of Credit Suisse to say UBS unfortunately no likelihood crevice Swiss will probably piss away this 50 billion in like five years so more long-term solutions would have to be employed here because otherwise Credit Suisse is going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up like they always do not sure how excited UBS is to buy this dumpster fire of a bank but with some support and guarantees from the government maybe this can happen and actually save their ass so how does this impact the U.S banking sector well look the the U.S Regulators have done a decent job at harming the fear right they've solved the problem with depositors they let First Republic have a credit line and it seems that things have died down having another bank collapse in Europe would not have helped having the other bank get a credit facility for 50 billion francs from their own kind of central bank that seems to kind of calm things down I don't think there's a big banking collapse happening in the US I think people who are talking about it don't understand how idiosyncratic these things are they're very isolated cases svb and Credit Suisse were just really good examples of horrible management I still think that the US should go back and focus on the really big problem here which is inflation we're still at six percent three times the norm that is the biggest problem that is the biggest concern I think this whole banking crisis stuff is starting to die down and hopefully we get to go back and focus on the vision very soon,1.0,-0.9

Tom Nash,oIATBwoBsqU,2023-03-15T12:51:34Z,February Inflation (PPI) Report Analysis and Breakdown,FED,now what this means for the FED what this means for the interest rate policy what this means for the stock market because there's a lot to unpack here and I'm gonna do it in about three minutes max I'm gonna save you a lot of time this morning check this out now this means that there's a high likelihood that the FED is going to combine all the three data points and will say well look Banks already having trouble inflation is slowing down ppi is actually negative I mean we should not be increasing more aggressively in fact we should either be increasing gently or stopping at all in fact this actually puts a realistic option on the table that we will see a certain amount a certain amount I don't know how much of interest rate decreases by the end of 2023 probably towards October November December not before but it also puts a real possibility that we will see a pause very very soon I still think that that will raise 25 basis points in the next hike but after that they might actually pause for a while given the fact that PPI and CPI are doing better and given what already happened with the banks because don't forget when the bank collapses the impact on the economy is extremely deflationary I heard somewhere that they're comparing it to 30 companies when Bank collapsed like 30 big companies collapsing because of all the overlapping things and the cascading effects of that so just my two cents I think it's a good sign for the market as well because if the FED will actually slow down and be more dovish and more accommodating and we're going to be actually going a little bit back more to less restrictive monetary policy it is better for the economy it is better for the stock market but I'm going to warn you once again there is no direct link it's not like when the FED immediately stopped raising rates or starts reducing rates the stock market flies forever it doesn't work like that there's no direct correlation but it is a good sign but all of this would be dependent on what happens in next few months if this is an isolated thing and the PPI goes spiking up again then everything is said here is not going to happen if the CPI does like a U-turn goes back up none of this would matter this is all assuming things will continue gradually to get better just my two cents,1.0,0.5
Tom Nash,oIATBwoBsqU,2023-03-15T12:51:34Z,February Inflation (PPI) Report Analysis and Breakdown,Silvergate,here's what happened over the past seven days on the the one hand we had a massive banking collapse three Banks fell and absolutely got annihilated silvergate which was more crypto related but whatever but Signature Bank and svb both collapsed because of a direct result of the interest rate increases they got caught with bonds that became pretty much worthless because of the interest rate hikes,1.0,-1.0

Tom Nash,X8JCuZ9-qhM,2023-03-14T14:12:57Z,6% February CPI: What FED Does Next?,FED,so with that being said what will the FED do with the interest rate hikes well we know the FED looks at the Consumer Price Index to determine its policy right that's kind of standard stuff but this February support along with tomorrow's producer price index which will show us the inflation on raw materials and goods should have been the key here but this time there's more to it than just looking at the CPI and the PPI data the Consumer Price Index and the producers price index because look so far this year the Fed was very aggressive with interested hikes we haven't seen since the 80s and during Fed chair Pals slash Beach he actually said that 50 basis points increase was on the table but all that was before the collapse of the three banks of the weekend now there's an old saying that a hawkish Fed is going to keep raising interest rates until something breaks so the question here would be did something break did the collapse of the silvergate bank Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank is breakage enough for the FED to chill the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down well according to the CME fed watch tool there's a 73 chance of a 25 basis point hike at the FED meeting next week and the 27th probability of no hike at all Just A Week Ago markets were seeing a 70 chance for a 50 basis hike and 30 chance for a 25 basis hikes but as I said the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the weekend basically have paved the way for what seems to be the 25 basis point hike territory it also might be zero but it seems more likely that 25 would be it now I suspect that the FED will be a bit more dovish this month both with the 25 basis points increase and the things that Powell will actually say and once banking stocks recover and once the overall Market fear subsides we might see a return to a little bit more of a hawkish stance from the FED unless of course inflation data comes in super low all of a sudden and basically we have no longer an inflation problem now that is of course more likely than grandpa having balls and becoming Grandma but again it is what it is,1.0,-0.1
Tom Nash,X8JCuZ9-qhM,2023-03-14T14:12:57Z,6% February CPI: What FED Does Next?,CME Group,well according to the CME fed watch tool there's a 73 chance of a 25 basis point hike at the FED meeting next week and the 27th probability of no hike at all,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,aYLC6znCzKY,2023-03-14T00:14:13Z,Former Goldman Sachs Manager Reveals Truth About Silicon Valley Bank Collapse,Goldman Sachs,Jay is a former Goldman Sachs manager with the experience of managing over two billion dollars I think 2.3 billion dollars right Jay that's right,1.0,0.2
Tom Nash,aYLC6znCzKY,2023-03-14T00:14:13Z,Former Goldman Sachs Manager Reveals Truth About Silicon Valley Bank Collapse,Silicon Valley Bank,which is the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank uh as well as some other collapses that happen with other banks that start with an S silver gay and signature which is it's himself kind of funny so uh Jay right off the bat I mean I don't want to waste your time and people can search your background you have I'm gonna pull up all your socials in the second you have almost 80 000 followers on Twitter you have a website which I'll show in a second and you have extensive experience so not to beat around the bush you as a professional were you surprised to to hear Silicon Valley Bank uh go belly up like that and get taken over by the FDIC absolutely I think that the speed of the decline you know we were already you know suspicious of how the government was going to deal okay with with sbny after the silvergate debacle and you know what happened you know what happened with with the send Network and the wind down of that bank um and then taking a step back and talking about Silicon Valley Bank sivb we were we were actually equally surprised with respect to the decline of sivb because you know our view was that over time people would understand that the quality of loans at the bank was not stellar and the bank was an actual almost a Ponzi scheme where it had collected 40 to 50 billion dollars of excess cash per year from Venture capitalists and because the portfolio companies of the 2500 Venture capitalists that we're banking with the firm we're actually burning through cash at 10 to 30 percent a month you know six to 18 month runways the only way for this bank to grow its deposits was actually to participate in new rounds and when the number of new rounds in the in the VC Capital raising peaked in the second quarter of last year it was very obvious to everyone that this bank was going to be losing deposits on a net basis and we saw them lose about 20 billion in the third quarter 10 billion in the fourth quarter and you know we think it was very obvious to management and that's why the CEO Becker set up a 10b51 plan to sell 3.6 million of a stock back in at the end of January and I think we think he was very strategic in doing that because he knew that they would have to raise Capital by selling the 21 billion dollars of EFS Securities in the first quarter so you know why was I surprised I was surprised by the fact that you know Peter Thiel you know in the middle of this Capital race you know they're supposed to raise 2.3 billion and we were thinking it would be kind of a slow burn you know Death By A Thousand Cuts you know over time people would uncover that this bank was going to lose deposits they had 7 billion of zero paying deposits and over several months you know people would figure this out but with Peter Thiel jumping up in his one of his deputies John Wu on national TV on Bloomberg um saying that everyone should pull money out of this Bank overnight in 24 hours you saw 42 billion dollars leave the bank by the end of Friday I had negative 985 million dollars entered receivership and we think that that was a shock to the entire Venture Capital system because 50 percent of companies in the venture-backed space banked with svb in a perverse way it's actually worse for Venture Capital firms they actually should have stood up and each contributed of the 500 billion in dry powder you know a small percentage you know to help Shore up Capital but you know now you're probably going to see pressure on Venture um valuations you're going to see a number of these companies potentially not have access to lines of credit potentially go bankrupt you know see layoffs you know and it's a multiplier effect because these companies are the biggest consumers of SAS products right so datadog twilio Microsoft Oracle these companies are all going to see lower demand for revenue and it's going to have a multiplicative effect um when it comes to the to the US economy and it's in fact very deflationary the most deflationary thing you can do to an economy people are worried about inflation they need to be looking six months ahead the most deflationary thing you can do for an economy outside of a nuclear bomb on a major city is very simply Bank runs and Bank uh you know Bank uh Bank centering receivership because it it's a multiplier effect and not only do you lose confidence in the banking system but people will spend less and you'll lose access to key sources of uh borrowing whether it's Venture debt credit lines traditional lending Etc careful you're going to trigger a lot of conspiracy theories with that talk well you know it's not even meant to be conspiracy it's really just meant to be using common sense you know we have about 4 950 banks in the United States 20 years ago we had 17 000 Banks um about 30 years ago actually before the you know right before the Savings and Loan crisis in the late 80s you know after um you know Michael Milken invented the junk bond then shoved all those junk bonds into savings and loan institutions and blew them up you know resolution trusts had to come up and you know essentially bail out these savings loans institutions as the first distressed hedge fund um you know ever since then we've seen a sharp uh Bank consolidation right you saw Fleet Bank by Bank Boston you saw Bank America by Fleet and you've had the number of banks Fall by 70 percent and you know as the banking systems gotten more concentrated you know the bigger Banks you know going into 2008 took more and more risk right then you know after the financial crisis you saw Dodd-Frank you saw basil III you saw the volcker rule and you know one of the things that led up to this decline of sivb um you know and it it's not meant to be partisan but it was under the Trump Administration it was the rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations um which made and actually the CEO Becker who was on the board of the San Francisco fed actually you know was was in big support of this you know was to essentially make it so you know this 220 Billion Dollar Bank was you know not a systemically important bank and as a result you know this was roughly the 14th largest bank in the United States was characterized as a non-systemically important bank so they didn't have to meet the same Capital requirements that JP Morgan or PNC or State Street or U.S bank had to meet so they're able to hide 15 billion dollars of HTM losses which this was the big biggest mistake the CEO made he bought 90 almost 90 billion dollars in mortgage-backed Securities with 10-year duration okay so if you have MBS that owns 30-year mortgages be you know you essentially have 10-year duration on average on those types of bonds for every one percent interest rates go up you lose 10 points on the bond this guy top ticked the bond market so that when interest rates Rose 300 basis points you know he was potentially looking at 25 to 30 billion dollars of losses as of December 31st he had already marked 15 billion of losses the tangible Equity of this company this company had tier one capital of 15 the actual AFS and HTM losses you know above 15 billion were actually higher than the equity of the actual bank so when it came to the run the moment feel said take out your money people realized okay after also seeing that they were selling EFS Securities at a 1.8 billion dollar loss that okay you have that 1.8 billion dollar loss plus plus what was going to become a 25 billion dollar loss the entire Equity of the bank was negative and that's how this happened so quickly and nobody had any chance um to come in and support the bank because you know when you have 25 of deposits leave a banking institution no one can no one can save that bank if it happens in a day when IndyMac Indy Indie Mac went bankrupt and wama went bankrupt 2008 it actually took 10 days for IndyMac to lose 1.3 billion and for WAMU to lose 16 billion so I agree with you there's no Bank on the planet that can withstand a 25 withdrawal in the day that it doesn't happen Banks need trust I mean we all know that all of us running to the ATMs means the collapse I mean that's that's another thing but I just want to point on something you you said earlier so you said you you mentioned Peter till twice so does not make that call and and screams fire does svb in your opinion collapses on Friday I think that the venture capitalist had a big um part in the collapse um think about Peter Thiel as a Warren Buffett a venture capital he was part of the PayPal Mafia he worked with Elon Musk right to build PayPal he then he was the uh founder of his own hedge fund and a number of uh Venture Capital firms he's probably one of the most brilliant men on uh on the planet so he knew exactly what he was doing when he said oh everyone should pull their money out and you know this has to be confirmed but what I'm hearing is that you know he was trying to push a deal with with sivb you know sivb funds most of the you know about half of the venture-backed companies they didn't agree with him on certain terms and he did the same thing by the way that he did to a publication um you know several years ago when they irked him and he basically did whatever he could to shut that that media publication down so I think that this is very calculated um and I hope I'm wrong by the way this is not fat this is conjecture so I hope I'm wrong but that I think was the biggest uh driver of the bankruptcy outside of the fact that Becker who by the way being on the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco should have known what an interest rate hedge is right if you're buying yeah we'll talk about that in a second that's an old Topic in itself exactly yeah that's a huge topic that's one of the things I wanted to bring you on for because that thing I can't just wrap my hand around but let's not get ahead of ourselves but you mentioned Becker getting a getting out of the underneath the Dodd-Frank regulation so I heard somewhere that he spent well no he personally but the bank spent over 500 million dollars on law being that to actually get it through and the Get Out Underneath that 200 billion to set the cap at 200 billion which is absolutely insane I don't know if it's true or not but I mean talk about the pro so proper use of funds so I you you you said earlier something very interesting and you said the highest return on Capital by the way is lobbying in Corporate America but please that's true yeah that's true that's true but the in this case he did it to himself if Greg Becker does not get underneath the regulation uh he gets stopped way earlier and doesn't destroy his career and everybody involved and a lot of people who will never work in the industry again um a lot of investors there's a lot you hear a lot of people I think but um you mentioned earlier uh something and I want to expand on that so uh I think we both agree that the you know a bankrant starts with the spark right that spark obviously with spiritual but as spark does nothing if there's no under underneath like underlying conditions for a fire correct so I'm saying and you either confirm or or contradict me here that in my opinion yes Peter Thiel started the spark and maybe even uh voluntarily knowingly exactly what's going to happen but the underneath the underlying conditions underneath were primed for that to happen and you you kind of alluded to this earlier and I would love for you to expand this I mean I talked about this in my video right so svb takes deposits what it does with these deposits like every bank right it buys something safe like treasuries and it holds these treasuries and basically makes money off the spread among other things and here's the crazy part right when they bought these treasuries well I'll let you explain the whole story including the lack of risk protocols because I think it's a fascinating topic and you're doing way better job than me okay okay so I'll continue to feel a little bit more and then I'll hand it over so basically uh I explained it like this because I'm not a banker so I explained it to myself as if and then because I'm a kind of a I'm not the smartest guy in the room so I the simple explanation is they basically they when they bought these bonds the prices were extremely cheap uh because of low interest rates uh sorry expensive because it's interesting buying them at like one and a half percent right so yeah interest rates were pretty much bottomed uh expensive bonds uh inverse relationship obviously of course as we talked about on the channel many times between the price of the bond and the interest rate so what happens is that the FED spikes interest rates within the year at record levels and then the price of the bonds plummets and then the bank which was planning to hold these bonds to maturity and be agnostic to this change is now all of a sudden forced to sell these and that sale basically triggers a lot of questions that leads to that background but my question to you and here's the part I cannot pain I don't have the expertise is how does the bank the 16th biggest bank in the U.S gets in this situation and doesn't have any backstops insurances and hedges to this kind of like does this is this sound normal to you it doesn't sound normal I mean if you if you go to Fifth Third Bank or if you go to PNC's you open up their 10K you know you open up Bank of America's 10K I know that they're bigger but they have something called you know fair value Hedges they have interest they has with interest rate Futures they use something called a interest rate swaptions fixed to float type Hedges where they're essentially you know taking their fixed rate exposure and then they're converting it to to floating right because most of the loans that Banks make you know tend to be floating rate loans so you want to match your floating rate loans with your floating rate liabilities in this situation this company had fixed rate assets right and high duration fixed rate assets and what it could have done you know is simply hedge those you know those fixed rate um those bonds and essentially reduce the amount of duration risk you know that it saw on its balance sheet so instead of losing you know 25 30 billion Mark to Market on the health and maturity portfolio you know even if it has two-thirds of the portfolio right the bank wouldn't wouldn't have had a reason to have that type of run that that it had um we're talking about insurance Jay right that's the whole thing here it's just yeah fancy talk for insurance they were cheap fancy top for insurance so there are various ways to interest rates you can use interest rate Futures right you can use um you know swaptions um you know and you could you know you could essentially the easiest way is just to buy floating rate assets right that that actually see their coupons rise when um when interest rates rise so I think you know another option is also a swap agreement which is when two parties exchange cash flows for a specific time period so it could have entered you know a a swap with a counterparty um so there's several ways to hedge another way is a interest rate cap or a caller um a caller is when you combine the purchase of an interest rate cap with the sale of an interest rate floor right so you're taking the premium from the sale of the floor and you're using that you know to buy the cap so there there's several even very cheap ways that they could have hedge rates and I'm just surprised given he had 40 Years of banking experience that he didn't even think of it and you know I'm running on no sleep because of the volatility in the in the banking markets I apologize I'll show you that space at 5am today and you're still on and I was I was on the space at 2 am so I apologize if I'm mumbling here but you know that's my interpretation of what happened and you know to take a step back you know banks at their core are facilitators right the deposit editors lend their money to the bank and before that their paid interest and then the banks lend that money they lend long they borrow short they lend long they naturally have an asset liability mismatch and you know the bank is profitable if the interest rates they charge for loans are obviously greater than the interest rates they pay for deposited depositors one of the issues that we haven't discussed yet is that on 70 billion of the 170 billion of deposits this bank was paying zero percent interest There's something in the market called the deposit beta so when interest rates rise as a bank in order to keep your customers your depositors you need to pass some of that interest the risk-free rate to your customers in the last three interest rate Cycles 1999 cycle the 2006 cycle and 2016 to 19. most people don't know we raise interest rates nine times between 2016 and 2019. we were actually entering a recession even before covet started and you know when in the first you know of the three examples I gave the deposit beta was around 37 percent and the second example is 36 percent and the third example is 22 percent you know in this type of rate hiking cycle where you see 400 basis points of rate hikes let's be conservative and say 40 deposit beta that means you know this company should have been paying at least two percent on its assets so if you're paying two percent on your assets that would have completely destroyed the bank's Nim so you know now we've we've talked about four catalysts for why this Bank saw the the problems that it saw it didn't it it top ticked buying 90 billion of MBS it didn't hedge they they weren't paying money on deposits so the depositors weren't sticky The Venture capitalists completely wrecked them and four you know we had this reversal of Dodd-Frank and all this lobbying money that the CEO spent the fifth thing which is not a driver but it shows you a little bit of potential guilt of Becker the CEO is on January 20 on January 27 if you look at the form four filings you go to SEC Edgar and you pull up sivb and you go into the form fours you'll see that the CFO and the CEO were selling stock now when you look at the number it's a big number the CEO sold 3.6 million of stock roughly 10 percent of his total Holdings and normally you're like okay well was it a scheduled sale was it a 10 you know uh b51 plan and when you look at it it originally looks like oh this guy had planned the sale it's a normal he was selling it every year like you know like Bill Gates sells Microsoft stock every year when you read when the plan was started the plan was started at the end of January and they sold the stop in February 27th and between January the end of January and February 27th he was doing a non-deal Roadshow talking to hedge funds about how his bank is so great and talking to all the sell side because he knew he would have to raise 2.3 billion so my view is this guy knew he needed to raise you know 2.3 billion back in the fourth quarter and he strategically sold this stock in January then waited a month a little bit more than a month to do this raise and he timed it horribly because you know the FED had been raising rates every single month and he was arrogant because instead of hedging rates he wanted to make that extra 20 30 basis points instead of paying for interest he wanted to make that an income and his greed and the culture of the bank you know forced him to blow himself up but I think his greed also came from obviously from the from that lack of insurance like if somebody is in the chat right now oh sorry it's Nick one of my community members is saying that the chief risk officer was on payroll until August 2022 but didn't work since April 2022. so that is absolutely right absolutely correct just to explain to folks in the chat uh I I don't have Jay's expertise I was uh far less in the industry than him but I still know what a risk officer is so the chief risk officer usually fights all day with the CEO that's the relationship they hate each other for the most part and the chief risk officer's job is to be the most anti-business person ever and he goes in there and imagines the worst possible scenario ever for the company and forces the CEO to buy insurance even though the CEO doesn't want to spend the money to do that um so that guy was not employed just to explain to you how bad this is now in my humble opinion what sounds to me here in tell me Jay if I'm right or wrong it sounds to me like Becker was saying look why spend all this money on inter swaps why spend all this money on insurance right when I'm agnostic to interest rates because I'm just going to hold these to maturity I don't care if interest rate Spike we're still going to sit on these as much as we need and then there's no problem I don't think you for foresaw when they did this that it's going to be for selling these things at rock bottom prices I think you're absolutely right and to just give you another example of poor risk management you probably are all aware of Alan Lane and silvergate which shut down a week prior to this the truths emerged on November 7th 2022 when silvergate actually announced the Unexplained emotion of its Chief risk officer guess who the chief risk officer of silvergate was I don't know it was his name was Tyler Pearson he was the son-in-law of the CEO right imagine that this is a multi-billion Dollar Bank and this guy this guy you know for his daughter's sake right hires her husband to be the chief that's the one position you know you don't know nepotism is a good idea exactly you do it for marketing you do it for sale that's where when I was working for associated general like all the people that was nepotized they went into Biz Dev that's how I know who came in you can never blame anybody for that I work by the way for stock gen in New York we'll talk about it later I'll tell you where I work for her alternative Investments uh um but now I want to ask you on that topic because this is a fascinating topic so we talked about the the lack of risk leading to this so can you elaborate a little bit on the unique uh and it's going to lead to my next question about contagion about the unique profile of this Bank like as far as how much is it's almost I would say uh 180 degrees different than any other Bank in the US as far as the lack of diversification and how it contributed to collapse the diversification was very very important now the CEO made a decision his decision was to focus on the Silicon Valley Elite right and that decision actually hurt him because the bank was not Diversified like most banks it didn't have a cni commercial industrial it didn't have a you know a big enough real estate diversification it didn't have a SBA you know a government guaranteed program right it didn't have you know a diversification even in the types of Securities right they should have split it into you know short-term t-bills you know maybe some munis it may be some shorter duration MBS or what they did with rate Hedges it was just not Diversified at all and when you have the same type of client everyone knows this in investing if you put all your money in energy stocks or all your money into real estate stocks or all of your money into unprofitable tech stocks you're going to see some unbelievable volatility when those sectors come into question so banks are supposed to be Diversified and they're supposed to be serving their depositors and their cost customers he did the exact opposite you know in order to focus on growth you know I this is a lovely graph right you can see JP Morgan the top left everything you need to know about this this is everything you need to know like you look at the bottom right you look at loans plus Securities as a percentage of deposits this guy was reaching because he is trying to offset losses by growing his asset side of his balance sheet right and loans plus Securities is a percentage of deposits were the worst for sivb and look at JPMorgan on the top right the most Diversified right with loans plus Securities as a percentage of deposits being very conservative and the estimated retail deposits being very high the one thing to note about sivb was that over 93 of their deposits because of the concentration in Silicon Valley businesses were uninsured now when you have uninsured deposits and you know that you can lose all your money above 250k and then some VC guy who has a vendetta against the firm you know points out that they have a hole and does everyone pull out your money that's what results in 42 billion dollars leaving a bank in less than four hours uh so just to clarify to the audience what we're talking about here is you know when you put your money in the bank you you don't supposed to worry about a bank run because the FDIC would ensure you make you whole but that amount is capped at 250 000 which is a different topic how come it's not adjusted higher uh for inflation that it's a archaic amount but it it covers 99 of people right 99 of people do not have more than 250 000 in the bank we saw stats that like 65 Americans are living paycheck to paycheck so for most people that's that's okay 250 000 is okay the problem was what Jay is pointing is that this specific bank was catered towards deposits that came from loans that startups and tech companies got that were funds used for payroll and operations so we're talking about millions of dollars tens of millions hundreds of millions in individual accounts which are by definition not insured because they're above 250 000 and that is the biggest problem here because FDIC cannot help these startups and the so now that's my next question Jay had the Federal Reserve sorry if we didn't have that backstop that we that we heard about yesterday and the ftic would have basically said hey it's your problem now with this special composition of this bank and it's a strong position in the startup Market in the US right 40 44 of startups are in that's right so what would have been the result what have been would have been the the outcome if there was no backstop and the government didn't came in and said well we're going to make everybody whole no matter how much money you have in the accounts 250 no 250 like what would have been the result it would have been catastrophic so to give you some background but the FDIC was created after the Great Recession it was created to avoid you know massive Bank runs and the fdic's deposit Insurance Fund as of the end of December 2022 was about 128 billion dollars the FDIC only guarantees deposits under 250k because most individuals have less than 250k at depository institutions it hasn't gone up with inflation since for the past 15 years but that's another topic you know um whether it was 250 or 400 or 500 wouldn't really have helped too much in this case so if you go to the fdic's website and they give you something called a waterfall so my background is bankruptcy in special situations when a company files for bankruptcy you normally have a dip loan right which is backed by accounts receivable and inventory then you have you know your first lien Term Loan that gets a recovery they get paid first then you know if if there's anything left over it goes to the unsecured bonds or the second lien then the unsecured bonds then the mezzanine then the preferred then the equity if there's anything left for the equity similarly there's a waterfall at the FDIC first the uninsured depositors get their their in the insured depositors get 250k then you get a receipt this tells you okay you have 2 million at the bank you got your 250k you have a receipt for 1.75 million that 1.75 million is returned to you over a period of time in the form of what they call FDIC dividends so because this bank had a lot of money in treasuries the idea is that even if you mark down those treasuries by about those MBS which are backed by Fannie Mae Freddie Mac in email which is why I was referring them to them as government securities when these government securities even if they mark down by 20 or 30 billion to 70 billion you could theoretically sell them in the market and return 30 to 50 percent of the cash to these guys in the first week so that's not terrible the terrible part is that what happens with the next 50 because you have all these loans nobody knows what these loans are worth oak tree's bidding 40 to 60 cents on them so you know there is a probability that if you were to liquidate this bank today um that the uninsured deposits may only may have only recovered you know 60 70 cents on the dollar right so that money is crucial to these companies because going into this rate cycle they didn't have the ability to raise money at the same valuations that they had in the past and so as it is these companies were running on borrowed time and they're using 62.5 billion dollars of off-balance sheet liabilities at sivb right as a backstop to essentially borrow on Venture debt borrow into revolving lines of credit to essentially fund payroll so it wasn't just the deposits that were important it was the fact that you know that they're burning through 10 to 30 of these deposits of deposits a month so if you only can return you know 30 to 50 percent of deposits in the first week there's a chance you run out of money after a month and the labor laws most of these companies are based in California some are in the midwest obviously some are in other parts of the US the labor laws are so strict in California that the board of directors of these companies once they've run out of money would be forced to fire people because they don't want to take liability in California for hiring people without paying them so it would have resulted in hundreds of thousands of mass layoffs you can kind of just estimate that if they're 2500 VCS right that bank with this company and each VC has you know 10 portfolio companies and let's say that's aggressive but let's just go with it for now this 25 000 companies and if those 25 000 companies right have five employees could be 125 000 uh people that are tied to this bank so and keep in mind this was systemically important in the tech business now I'm not saying it's systemically important as a bank given that it only had 220 billion of assets versus 30 trillion of banking Assets in America but it was systemically important for the tech sector and if if the government hadn't stepped in and I don't want to get political like we can go through both scenarios if the government hadn't stepped in the market would have been a lot lower today um bonds would have been a lot tighter there have been a big bid for treasury's gold would have been a lot higher and tech stocks would have been selling off because companies like Roku at half a billion dollars stuck at this firm now if all of a sudden you thought Roku was going to lose half a billion dollars there would be short sellers shorting Roku Roblox had over 100 billion dollars people would be shorting bill.com one of my favorite companies I love bill.com they're such a great wow company yeah if you ever work with bill.com you know that company is legit and they had money in there also not a lot but I mean significant amounts Oprah had money there right yeah Harry and Harry you know Prince Harry had money there I mean people didn't understand the type of risk they were taking um they're like oh yeah Venture you know Tech is so safe didn't realize that all these companies are burning cash and the CEO doesn't know what he's doing well I I yeah nobody know Greg was wasn't like the sharpest tool in the shadow apparently like in hindsight but he made so many videos right where he was he was almost crying so that makes it better yeah well yeah of course so uh Jay so now that this backstop was created uh for the positors and now that the FED said hey we're going to help the other banks that are kind of on the brink we're gonna set up a special facility and we're going to help them with those two things happening uh is there still any risk of further collapses in smaller Regional Banks you know what there are um and I I'm actually not going to name them in this because I don't want people to to freak out um but there are several Banks um that you can actually screen for using the percentage of uninsured deposits and percentage of AFS and HTM Securities versus you know total tier one and total assets so using those two metrics Alone um and then if you want to do a deeper dive you can actually look at the banks that have the biggest exposure to office and Mall which are the two biggest problem areas in the 21 trillion dollar commercial real estate market which we think is going to be in Decline for the next two or three years but those are kind of like the four categories that you can actually screen with to find banks that are at risk and it's not a lot of banks like I said they're 4 900 Banks um of those Banks you know there are a couple hundred that are publicly traded and of those Banks I would say that you know they're probably around you know over a dozen of these names um you can actually see by the trading activity and the halts today that you know short seller sellers are already targeting them but you know there are quite a few of these names and a few of them could you know could enter a receivership um but I think the majority you know the our overall banking system is very strong um if you look at the biggest banks in the United States you know with trillions of assets um they're only getting stronger a lot of the deposits that are leaving some of these regionals are going to JPMorgan they're going to be of a they're going to Wells Fargo and their liquidity is only improving so we're in a unique spot in the United States where the average tier one Capital ratio is 12.5 percent uh which even if you adjust it right by the 620 billion dollar number which is AFS and HTM losses across the entire banking system let's put it in perspective they're 30 trillion of assets 18 trillion dollar of deposits and five trillion of Securities the 620 billion dollar number is not uh a fully truthful number because half of it is AFS and half of it is HTM available for sale Securities through aoci already flow through and they're already in your Tier 1 Capital ratio so you're only looking at something like 300 million versus 30 trillion of assets and 18 trillion deposits so the overall U.S banking system my humble opinion um is actually stronger right than if you look at the Chinese banking system with with the shadow Banking and the real estate collapse and the buildings that are completely empty and secondary and tertiary cities and the demographic cluster demographic issues and much better than Credit Suisse and some of the banks in Europe that have very low uh capitalization ratios in in very very high leverage so you know India in two months I think that you know this specific issue may not be of importance and maybe six six months to 12 months from now we're talking about you know auto loan issues you know because the economy is going to slow down and we're going to be talking about commercial real estate but that's a much slower moving uh disaster and it's not something like this which can take a bank down overnight yeah I think when I hear people talk about the Contagion on the super Banks I find it laughable I mean if anything they're getting stronger off of this one I mean I move some money to some of the bigger things like if you're in JP Morgan if you're in Wells Fargo if you're Bank of America I mean you have nothing to worry about no it's it's these amounts are blip on the radar they people don't understand how little this is for them yes and another thing for me based on what you pointed out you know a lot of that 300 billion plus of HCM Securities is at the biggest banks JP Morgan's gonna have no reason to sell government securities right neither is B of A neither is Wells Fargo they're going to do what Becker wanted to do you just sit on there yeah it's just gonna pay you whatever it's worth yeah that was just master plan brilliant yeah you forgot it's not JP Morgan yeah except for the fact that he didn't realize that all his clients burn cash look there's a huge difference deposit is is it can mean different things deposit from Joe Schmo like me I don't withdraw more than five percent of my money no matter what it's always there it's a sticky thing a deposit from a from a startup it's it's operating cash it's a Capital it's are you crazy yes anyways I want to ask a to happen into your macro expertise you're a little bit with your permission because I heard you talk about this and I was super impressed I want to share this with the group so I wanted to ask your opinion everybody's trying to guess as always what the FED is going to do with interest rates next obviously it's always a topic Hot Topic now more than ever so I have to ask you this question I'm sorry to put you on the spot so what do you think the FED does freezes 25 bibs 50 bips it reduces maybe what do you think happens next so I think 50 basis points is off the table so what that means is that you know last week after the strong pce monthly data and the quarterly pce data that we saw along with the tight labor data there's if you look at fed fed funds Futures on the CME website there is as high as an 80 probability of a 50 basis point height right the market was very very confident and the two-year was about five percent even Powell said it pretty much already they admitted it yeah Paula was concerned right about inflation yeah and overnight right like I said at the beginning of of this discussion Bank defaults are extremely deflationary right they're just pulling money out of the system even if you return that money to people afterwards right if you reduce the number of of loans and credit lines in the system you're reducing money supply so when you're reducing money supply it's inherently deflationary and our view is that pal cares more about the stability of the banking system than he cares about inflation because yeah they're three big buckets of inflation and probably even talked about in the last three meetings there's Goods inflation There's real estate related inflation and then there's wage inflation our view is that Goods inflation you look at container ship rates down 90 you look at Lumber back at December lows you look at the cost of laptops and televisions all those categories are falling right you look at used car prices most of the year they're following they're a little a little bit higher in January because I think we had a very warm January and people are out actually one of the warmest januaries in history but we think later in the year car prices will come back down so the biggest categories of goods inflation we're actually going into deflation and when it comes to real estate we're talking about commercial real estate you know their Pimco defaulted on two buildings in San Francisco right we had Blackstone default on a building in Europe we had Starwood default on a tower in New York right and we had you know the largest Canadian property owner default on two properties in downtown L.A you know and so we think that commercial real estate you're going to see but by the way the name of that company is Brookfield you're going to see a number of you know commercial real estate defaults because there's several hundred billion dollars of maturities over the next two years um 2023 and 2024 resin corporate debt during covid because of the stimulus a lot of the corporations were able to refi debt you know through 2025 to 2027 with real estate because the lenders were so scared because these buildings weren't filled up um they weren't able to push the loans much further out so we think that real estate prices are going to be a big drag on inflation both uh commercial real estate prices but also residential real estate prices they're already down like 15 in San Francisco um and also rents are already falling the reason why we aren't seeing rents in uh CPI is that there's something called oer right owner's equivalent rent is 32 percent of CPI and 16 of PC what does that mean if you you have a lease a commercial lease or residential lease everybody's lease doesn't come up at the same point in the year right so when rents were Rising very quickly at the beginning of January everyone was like oh the government is Under reporting uh inflation of course they're under Under reporting inflation because even though you're seeing your rent go up 20 30 now everybody's rent's not going up 20 30 at the same time now this opposite is happening now now rents are falling but now you're seeing oh well some rents are still going up yeah some rents are still going up because you know they had December leases and they had to wait several months in order to restrike the lease I just remembered the condo conversation when you said that but my but my condo was so good yeah exactly right a little nikonda you know real estate is location location yeah you need to look at you know the 20 City averages right and the broad averages and the data we all have free access to from the government you know your and even you can go on zillow.com and look at azilla.com average or a Redfin average right the the bid ask spread in real estate is very high which means sellers don't want to sell right and buyers are reticent to buy because mortgage rates are so high so on average in a year two percent of real estate um is transferred right from buyers to sellers in this market when mortgage rates are six seven eight percent only one percent of real estate is transacting they could take several years for you to see real estate prices actually fall after 2008 real estate prices in most of the US didn't bought them until 2012. so we think that real estate is going to be deflationary for the next two or three years and that is going to weigh on inflation and the final thing is wages right so wages we think will go up a little bit this year but in the long run right if you imagine Bank bank failures and people losing access to loans and Venture Capital firms now being defensive and not raising rounds you're going to see hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs and that in itself is deflationary and by the way Paul almost said that's what he wants right he wants unemployment to go from what 3.4 percent to Four Points four and a half foreign so I mean I think we can reasonably get there by next year and that's basically all you need for the FED to for the FED to cut um so that's our view is that the FED is not going to do 50 they might do 25 they might pause but then in May if they if they do pause they might restart and they might hike in May June and July and get to that five and a half percent and you know that's in the scenario if you know this banking situation it only affects a few Banks now if you see more than five you know five to say six Banks you know enter receivership I think it's a much bigger issue and it might be if you might see a full pause I don't think we're necessarily going to see that but if you see several Banks enter receivership you know I do think that that's going to scare the living bejesus out of the Fed I think the FED is already scared I think they're scared too I mean you know yelling changed her mind in five hours she was like I saw that we are not going to do any bailouts no no but she didn't change your mind because this is not a bailout Jade only bailing out depositors not Equity holders I made a joke about it on Twitter I can't do it on without getting punished on on YouTube but there's a joke but a guy who's trying to convince a girl and anyways [Laughter] Jay one last question before I let you go and we'll wrap it up so what does this mean on the grow like not broader scale I mean we touched upon this on the space a little bit does this mess it translates because everybody the US is leading the way for all central banks look at the FED all Global Banks look at the U.S banks the U.S financial system is leading the way for everybody else so when people are looking out into the restaurant and seeing this kerfuffle happening does this weaken the the position of of the United States as far as the well-deserved currency as far as the desirability disability of the of the treasuries and the ability to do is to raise cheap Capital etc etc and all this nonsense I keep hearing sorry I already gave it away so let me let me ask you a question you know as a friend you know we're sitting you know we're sitting at a bar and we're talking about you know where where we want to put our money when we retire so I give I'm going to give you four options right let's do it okay so you can put your money in Chinese bonds right yeah um they're gonna pay you high single digit percentage um but anything you can never take out the money the money you can say no no no you're going to keep your money in here yeah um no option two you're gonna put your money in you know one of the five biggest economies in the world which is Japan at the beautiful interest rate of 50 basis points for the 10-year jgb so every year you're going to get half a percent okay that's not your option for number two uh your option for number three is to invest in European bonds where the banking system is much less capitalized than the United States and they just had brexit and frankly over the next 20 30 years we don't know if other countries are going to leave the Eurozone and what's going to happen okay so and then your fourth option unless they're engaging the war don't forget plus they're engaged with the war with Russia and they might have an energy crisis I hope they don't have an energy crisis this year but it will mean huge budget deficits and subsidizing fuel prices in Europe in the winter so and then I'll tell you okay it's the US it has 130 percent you know debt to GDP versus 200 in Japan they're gonna pay you five percent the interesting thing about the US is that the U.S you know treasury has essentially if you look at it like a stock it is the net present value of the future tax revenues from the wealthiest people on the planet and from the most Innovative companies on the planet and the biggest companies on the planet in fact two-thirds of the world's stock market is actually in the U.S and you are above stockholders and you are above creditors you have the first priority right to take cash from these companies and individuals above everybody what would you say you know I once uh aggregated a U.S tax collection is 5 trillion give or take 5 trillion a year that's tax dollars in the US so aggregated tax collections in the brics countries and it added up to about 700 billion so so just just to put it in perspective perspective yeah just to give a little bit perspective about the strength of the US economy so let's talk about Brazil people in the audience let's let's Engage The Audience we're talking about Brazil you just had a socialist ruler you know and he's taking over you know the biggest Energy company in Brazil and he's trying to divert dividends away from shareholders so I mean do you guys want to be part of a of a pure socialist government regime you know well there's a reason Jay why every time there's a big mess in the world there's a flight towards the dollar and towards U.S treasuries every time there's a big mess so because it's not a perfect setup but it's the best out there it's the what I call it is the best of the worst even as an American I say it's the best of the worst now will it be like that forever who knows I can't see that far I'm a Trader I can see one year maybe a couple quarters ahead I'm lucky but I think for the next couple years it is going to be continue to be the reserve currency if we see a global market crash you'll probably see people by gold you'll probably see people buy treasuries and you'll probably see people buy investment grade bonds and fix to float Bonds in some of the biggest companies in the world that's you know that's usually what happens and then if you think the Market's bottoming you buy the highest quality Blue Chip stocks at Big discounts it's not very complicated right so um you know thank you for the time

Tom Nash,aYLC6znCzKY,2023-03-14T00:14:13Z,Former Goldman Sachs Manager Reveals Truth About Silicon Valley Bank Collapse,FDIC,were you surprised to to hear Silicon Valley Bank uh go belly up like that and get taken over by the FDIC absolutely I think that the speed of the decline you know we were already you know suspicious of how the government was going to deal okay with with sbny after the silvergate debacle and you know what happened you know what happened with with the send Network and the wind down of that bank...you don't supposed to worry about a bank run because the FDIC would ensure you make you whole but that amount is capped at 250 000 which is a different topic how come it's not adjusted higher uh for inflation that it's a archaic amount but it it covers 99 of people right 99 of people do not have more than 250 000 in the bank we saw stats that like 65 Americans are living paycheck to paycheck so for most people that's that's okay 250 000 is okay the problem was what Jay is pointing is that this specific bank was catered towards deposits that came from loans that startups and tech companies got that were funds used for payroll and operations so we're talking about millions of dollars tens of millions hundreds of millions in individual accounts which are by definition not insured because they're above 250 000 and that is the biggest problem here because FDIC cannot help these startups and the so now that's my next question Jay had the Federal Reserve sorry if we didn't have that backstop that we that we heard about yesterday and the ftic would have basically said hey it's your problem now with this special composition of this bank and it's a strong position in the startup Market in the US right 40 44 of startups are in that's right so what would have been the result what have been would have been the the outcome if there was no backstop and the government didn't came in and said well we're going to make everybody whole no matter how much money you have in the accounts 250 no 250 like what would have been the result it would have been catastrophic so to give you some background but the FDIC was created after the Great Recession it was created to avoid you know massive Bank runs and the fdic's deposit Insurance Fund as of the end of December 2022 was about 128 billion dollars the FDIC only guarantees deposits under 250k because most individuals have less than 250k at depository institutions it hasn't gone up with inflation since for the past 15 years but that's another topic you know um whether it was 250 or 400 or 500 wouldn't really have helped too much in this case so if you go to the fdic's website and they give you something called a waterfall so my background is bankruptcy in special situations when a company files for bankruptcy you normally have a dip loan right which is backed by accounts receivable and inventory then you have you know your first lien Term Loan that gets a recovery they get paid first then you know if if there's anything left over it goes to the unsecured bonds or the second lien then the unsecured bonds then the mezzanine then the preferred then the equity if there's anything left for the equity similarly there's a waterfall at the FDIC first the uninsured depositors get their their in the insured depositors get 250k then you get a receipt this tells you okay you have 2 million at the bank you got your 250k you have a receipt for 1.75 million that 1.75 million is returned to you over a period of time in the form of what they call FDIC dividends so because this bank had a lot of money in treasuries the idea is that even if you mark down those treasuries by about those MBS which are backed by Fannie Mae Freddie Mac in email which is why I was referring them to them as government securities when these government securities even if they mark down by 20 or 30 billion to 70 billion you could theoretically sell them in the market and return 30 to 50 percent of the cash to these guys in the first week so that's not terrible the terrible part is that what happens with the next 50 because you have all these loans nobody knows what these loans are worth oak tree's bidding 40 to 60 cents on them so you know there is a probability that if you were to liquidate this bank today um that the uninsured deposits may only may have only recovered you know 60 70 cents on the dollar right so that money is crucial to these companies because going into this rate cycle they didn't have the ability to raise money at the same valuations that they had in the past and so as it is these companies were running on borrowed time and they're using 62.5 billion dollars of off-balance sheet liabilities at sivb right as a backstop to essentially borrow on Venture debt borrow into revolving lines of credit to essentially fund payroll so it wasn't just the deposits that were important it was the fact that you know that they're burning through 10 to 30 of these deposits of deposits a month so if you only can return you know 30 to 50 percent of deposits in the first week there's a chance you run out of money after a month and the labor laws most of these companies are based in California some are in the midwest obviously some are in other parts of the US the labor laws are so strict in California that the board of directors of these companies once they've run out of money would be forced to fire people because they don't want to take liability in California for hiring people without paying them so it would have resulted in hundreds of thousands of mass layoffs you can kind of just estimate that if they're 2500 VCS right that bank with this company and each VC has you know 10 portfolio companies and let's say that's aggressive but let's just go with it for now this 25 000 companies and if those 25 000 companies right have five employees could be 125 000 uh people that are tied to this bank so and keep in mind this was systemically important in the tech business now I'm not saying it's systemically important as a bank given that it only had 220 billion of assets versus 30 trillion of banking Assets in America but it was systemically important for the tech sector and if if the government hadn't stepped in and I don't want to get political like we can go through both scenarios if the government hadn't stepped in the market would have been a lot lower today um bonds would have been a lot tighter there have been a big bid for treasury's gold would have been a lot higher and tech stocks would have been selling off because companies like Roku at half a billion dollars stuck at this firm now if all of a sudden you thought Roku was going to lose half a billion dollars there would be short sellers shorting Roku Roblox had over 100 billion dollars people would be shorting bill.com one of my favorite companies I love bill.com they're such a great wow company yeah if you ever work with bill.com you know that company is legit and they had money in there also not a lot but I mean significant amounts Oprah had money there right yeah Harry and Harry you know Prince Harry had money there I mean people didn't understand the type of risk they were taking um they're like oh yeah Venture you know Tech is so safe didn't realize that all these companies are burning cash and the CEO doesn't know what he's doing well I I yeah nobody know Greg was wasn't like the sharpest tool in the shadow apparently like in hindsight but he made so many videos right where he was he was almost crying so that makes it better yeah well yeah of course so uh Jay so now that this backstop was created uh for the positors and now that the FED said hey we're going to help the other banks that are kind of on the brink we're gonna set up a special facility and we're going to help them with those two things happening uh is there still any risk of further collapses in smaller Regional Banks you know what there are um and I I'm actually not going to name them in this because I don't want people to to freak out,1.0,0.3

Tom Nash,QEvP2hqY4Qw,2023-03-12T21:14:34Z,The broader consequences of SVB’s collapse,Silicon Valley Bank,you may be shocked to find out that I'm not talking about Silicon Valley Bank here no no no. Washington Mutual was the largest Savings and Loans Bank in the US with over 300 billion in assets and it faced a bank run similar to svb and much like svb it ended up collapsing. now let's go back to svb we just witnessed the second biggest bank collapse in the U.S and it happened in 24 hours. you see svb is a unique Bank its main focus is Venture debt and it's the biggest of its kind in the entire world make no mistakes about it this is no chump oh what SBB was doing was actually pretty Innovative they were providing loans to startups and early stage companies with virtually no history no track record no real collateral. now enter svb the White Knight they gave these guys credit lines without any of that. that led to half of the U.S startups using svb for credit lines and Loans. when tech stocks and star evaluations were soaring back in 2021 Venture Capital firms were salivating they were funding lots of new exciting companies with a bunch of money like hotcakes and that funding flowed directly to s VB and became tasty yummy deposits. this was working so good that in 2021 svb's deposits increased by 90 percent. when the FED started actually raising interest rates the main clients of svb the startups and early stage companies they got absolutely destroyed. that stopped the flow of new deposits into svb. now svb was stuck with no new deposits and multiple money losing clients that were burning through cash the same cash that was a deposit just yesterday for svb. as a result SBB got more and more shortened capital in other words they ran out of cash. in addition it had its money tied up to government bonds which went from being a safe play to an anchor that dragged the entire Bank down and I'll explain exactly how when svb bought these Bonds in 2021 the interest rates were low and the price of bonds was high. same for svb and these bonds SBB could technically hold these bonds to maturity and get everything that loss will only be realized if svb decided to sell the Porsche or in this case sell these bonds. during 2022 and 2023 the svb deposit Hall became so big that in the middle of last week the credit rating agency Moody's actually woke up from its Slumber called svb and let them know hey we're coming for you we're about to downgrade your ass and you better do something about it. eventually svb sent a team to New York to meet with Moody's and resolve the issue. the war got out and scared the big clients like pirutil which withdrew their money and their company's money out of svb immediately and triggered an absolute pandemonium of a bank run. it didn't help that Greg Becker the CEO of svb and other Executives sold millions of dollars off their svb stock two weeks prior which was very uncharacteristic and also very strange given the fact that he told everybody to stay calm. oh by the end of Thursday customers would do a staggering 42 billion dollars of deposits from svb that happened in a single business day. that led to the bank going into fdse receivership as we now know. for 40 years svb was to go to bank for half of U.S startups but once that trust was lost the bank collapsed in 24 hours. the FDIC holds svb in receivership although let's be honest they will not likely get all of their money back that's the whole definition of insolvency. 96 of deposits in SVP are greater than 250 000 and for good reason it's not because these are rich frickers that have more than 250 000 in their accounts it's much worse half of the U.S startup industry and early stage Tech is relying on svb for credit facilities. 65 of them rely on svb credit lines and deposits to pay salaries. video streaming company Roku which Kathy would loves they got eight billion dollars of market cap and 500 million in cash sitting in svb which is about a quarter of their entire cash reserves. Roblox you know about them five percent of their money is an svb. bill.com a great company seven billion dollar company 300 million sitting in svb it's a lot of money. it needs that svb credit line to survive at this point the U.S startup and Tech sector seems to be the first line of contagion here or in other words they're royally screwed and that's going to be extremely bad for both the economy and this stock market. what happens next with svb so the question here is can svb be saved and can this mess be avoided. at this point svb needs a white knight to come and save the bank a deal like that might involve selling the bank in its entirety or chopping off the pieces selling it one by one. this bank svb is full of startups and not profitable risky debt that is not the style that super banks in the US are looking for. on the other hand if svb will be chopped up to little pieces and sold piece by piece guess what everything will be sold except the startups and the early stage tech companies which nobody wants. the size of svb means that the only ones that can swallow this massive big whale are super Banks. is svb is a kind of similar Washington Mutual moment here. medium-sized Regional Banks which might be in trouble in the near future due to similar issues that played svb. startups that had svb credit lines will be unable to pay employees. 50 of U.S startups are sitting right now waiting to see what solution they come up with because they're operationally dependent on svb and unless svb functions in some capacity or other under the FDIC receivership or a new ownership they will be in a world of trouble. the fed the FED is going to take some hit for being the culprit in the collapse of svb because of raising interest.,1.0,-0.9

Tom Nash,AMdQjHiZE7c,2023-03-10T12:47:27Z,The Silicon Valley Bank Scandal: What You Need To Know!,Silicon Valley Bank,hey this is Tom and I got a question for you how does a little-known bank out of California that I would assume 80 of you have never heard about before today's video takes the entire global banking industry with it for a crazy ride within 24 hours all right let's take another look at shares of Silicon Valley after hours we have new reporting on companies pulling money out of the struggling Bank over the past 24 hours shares of Silicon Valley Bank drop by 60 we'll talk about why the shares drop by 60 and they're actually down 30 in pre-market as of the making of this video. there's a reason you've never heard about Silicon Valley Bank and the reason is because this Bank works specifically exclusively with growth companies with startups and with Venture Capital firms it's basically a niche product located in Santa Clara California and it's not supposed to be something you know about but over the ballooning of the entire growth tech industry since the pandemic 2020 2021 the bank ballooned with it you know cheap money zero interest the absolute flooding of funds the FED starting a party right so the Silicon Valley Bank enjoyed that deposits went up by 90 year over year in 2021 reaching 200 billion dollars the party was on but then as you know the FED shut down the tap the parents came home and turned on the lights and kicked everybody out parties over this is pretty much what happened in 2022 the FED stopped the cheap money era it started tightening interest rates jumped up the cheap money era was over and the growth tech industry basically plummeted into the toilet faster than Grandpa after Christmas party and with it Silicon Valley Bank and obviously over the past year the svb balance sheet went from looking like a rock star to Swiss cheese pretty much full of holes. now as of December 31st 2022 to svb's balance sheet showed available for sale Securities which had a fair market value of 26 billion dollars which is 2.5 billion dollars below the 28.5 billion of it actually costing the bank so the bank bought it at 28.5 and now it's marked at 26. and it had held to mature the Securities with fair market value of 76 billion dollars which is 15 billion dollars below the balance sheet value so give or take a few hundred million here and there svb is in the hall for about 17 and a half billion dollars which is actually more than the entire Equity it has which is 16 billion dollars and that's never good I mean whether you're Banker or a grocery guy from you know from the neighborhood you know that that's bad now with that obviously confidence in the bank started to Road deposit status to fall out and people started leaving the bank there's little money coming in you know the story you know every bank that people lose confidence in this is they exact same story now deposits dropped 13 during the final three quarters of 2022 as you would expect and they continue to drop well into 2023 as of the making of this video. So eventually standard employers had to wake up from their Slumber and actually downgrade svb and they took their credit down to one level above junk Moody's actually quickly did the same thing because it's a copycat industry and they said that you know with downgrading svb because deterioration in the bank's funding liquidity and profitability declining Venture Capital Investments Etc et cetera Etc yeah thanks Captain Obvious I mean we all knew that but the trigger what started this whole implosion this cataclysmic craziness that we saw yesterday was none of that it was something completely different now about two days ago March 8 svb came out and admitted it sold all of its available for sale Securities because it's needed cash now after that they things went rapidly downhill the official explanation from the bank was that this was nothing to worry about in fact the svbco came out and said stay calm everybody stay calm says there's nothing more relaxing than a panic CEO screaming at you to stay calm right well as expected that terrified The Venture Capital clients of the bank including Peter Thiel who has a lot of money with it through his funds who apparently instructed These funds to take everything out of this as fast as they can now other smaller VC firms followed suit you know obviously which caused a 60 drop in the share price of SVP which is the biggest drop we've seen in the last seven years. The founders fund which a key VC player is advising that com its own companies should withdraw funds from Silicon Valley bank now the stock is still dropping in pre-market as we speak it's about 30 percent down so it ain't over yet. According to Bloomberg a startup CEO who would not identify himself said that yesterday he tried to take out their millions of dollars from svb and could not withdraw it but on the other hand Bloomberg also said that several other clients of the bank actually told them that they were able to take out their money Thursday without any significant issues whatever that means we even had Bill Ackman yesterday calling for a government bailout of svb yesterday which pretty much tells you how bad things are although I wouldn't say that Bill Ackman is the best indicator of how bad things are you remember the whole no disguise falling thing that they did back in the day so you know take it with a grain of salt in my opinion and this is strictly my own opinion for whatever it's worth to you this is now starting to smell a little bit like a bank run and you know if that happens nobody wants to be that last guy standing in a room holding its nuts so be very careful how you interpret this story so the question is how bad can this get and is this kind of game over for svb and what does it mean for the rest of the stock market in general well there is a risk that svb runs out of cash and you know can't operate properly which would mean that it would either be sold to a competitor or taking apart piece by piece um but I think it's a bit of overreaction at this point because especially since you know the thing that started this whole shitstorm which is the sale of stock that they've done brought in a lot of cash which should be enough for svb to function for a while at least and stay afloat but I think the more interesting question is what about the rest of the industry and the greater Market obviously that's not a good signed for the market and the big problem is that SVP is not the only Bank who has this issue they're not the only Bank who said on a bunch of unrealized losses now the entire banking industry right now is basically holding on to it's not hoping for this thing not to get worse because there's a bunch of banks out there sitting on a heap of unrealized losses and it's pretty much like a ticking Time Bomb they hope would not explode now look I don't have a crystal ball I don't know how this plays out but it seems like a big ass Canary and a tiny ass mine warning us about what's to come.,1.0,-1.0

Tom Nash,OZVXdp_bC8k,2023-03-09T17:48:06Z,Why The Fed Wants Higher Unemployment?,Federal Reserve,hey this is Tom good morning happy Thursday this is about 6 a.m over here and I thought I'd use this kind of quiet time to chat about the very weird relationship between the Federal Reserve and the unemployment rate now usually the Federal Reserve and the government would like the unemployment rate to be as low as possible so why now in recent times the FED is getting a rash on its Underpants every time we mention the fact that unemployment is at 3.4 percent which is a historically low number in fact it's pretty much as close to Full Employment as we can get why does the FED not like that you see the FED is trying to prevent a far greater evil than the unemployment rate going from three and a half to seven percent and I'll talk in a second about why I said seven percent because I think that's the real number we're headed into I'm just giving you a hint because what the FED is trying to prevent is a runaway inflation so now we know why the FED is doing it I'm going to talk in a second about the reasons why we chose to ignore the problem but we chose to ignore the problem and instead of doing that what we chose is to pretend as if inflation is absolutely transitory and not real and will go away on its own and we kept interest pretty much at zero why did it happen well there's two reasons the reason number one would be I guess political reason Jerome Powell was trying to get renominated and reappointed which he did but because the guy who was supposed to reappoint him was Biden he had to play ball he could not crash the economy because of recession when he was up for renomination so he played the game and he pretended as if this was transitory although I never I never believed that he actually thought this was transitory you'd have to be a dumbass to really believe in that reason number two I think is hopium I mean you don't want to cause a recession before you absolutely sure there's a problem that you can't solve so I guess John Paul was hanging around too long trying to see if there's if this thing will actually go away before he will go down in history as one of the people who caught the recession The combination of these two things basically caused us to miss the window of opportunity to slowly increase interest rates and cruise out of inflation so 2022 rolls around and now we don't have a choice worth 9.1 percent now to go from 9.1 inflation when you're at zero percent interest and your balance sheet is it nine trillion dollars don't forget the balance sheet there's no way to do it and not crash the economy But the question is why are we talking about 3.4 versus 4.5 why is John Paul saying well we need to go to four and a half percent why is this one percent increase gonna solve the the problem why is unemployment going from three and a half percent to four and a half percent will solve everything why is this one percent is the solution well let me tell you the story here the real story is that this one percent is a bunch of horse baloney it's transitory 2.0 and much like in transitory 1.0 which was the whole movie we saw in 2021 it's based on nothing Jerome Powell doesn't have a clue how much unemployment has to go up to solve this he doesn't have a clue how much unemployment will go up once the market starts reacting to elevated interest rates and it has no idea where this thing is going to stop he has no freaking idea is this late yes the FED is late to the party for sure is this necessary yes could it have been avoided yes is the Fed to blame for us now being in a shitty situation that we should have been yes my only problem with power was that the fact that he wouldn't admit that there's no way that a recession isn't coming and trying to pretend as if a soft Landing can actually happen Inflation will be solved on the expense at the expense of the poor people and the middle class in America they will pay the price for the policy mistakes and the horrific horrific decisions that were taken by the Federal Reserve by the government and they will pay the price makes no mistakes about it,1.0,-0.9
Tom Nash,NWVIAE3uCGI,2023-03-07T13:58:08Z,THE FED JUST ENDED THE STOCK MARKET,Federal Reserve,a year ago the Federal Reserve decided to change its stance on inflation they went from hey inflation is nothing to be taken seriously it's completely transitory all the way to oh my God inflation is Will Smith and Jada Pinkett it should be avoided like the plague pretty much absolutely going to war against inflation. we had the Federal Reserve go and absolutely max out interest rate hikes they've increased interest rates by four and a half percent in one year we haven't seen this pace of increase since the Paul voker days and 80s that's extremely aggressive. the FED hasn't really gone Full Throttle on reducing its balance sheet we went down from 9 to 8.3 which is a significant drop but looking at pre-pandemic levels we were three and a half trillion dollars so we're still more than double in the balance sheet and until that drops off we're going to have a propped up stock market and a propped up economy I don't know if the FED actually will do it ever because at this point they seem comfortable just letting it roll off and that might be the case but if they ever decide to pull that liver it's going to be absolutely insane it's going to be pandemonium. the macro signals are basically sending alarm bells for the FED unemployment 3.4 percent oh my God consumer spending all-time high housing flat so the FED is basically going oh my God we have to push harder on the other hand two-thirds of Americans are unable to squeeze in another 500 per month because they're living paycheck to paycheck so we have this fed overreaction potentially coming in because of all the hot numbers coming in and on top of it we have people who are unable to pay any more because they're already spread thin. unfortunately that creates a significant risk of a Fed of a reaction pushing the market into recession If the Fed decides to push harder on interest rates and push harder on reducing its battle cheat the housing market the consumer spending the student loans the car market all of those will push the market down people will be left without money consumer spending will go down people will lose their jobs less spending a vicious cycle leading to a very nasty recession unfortunately this renders the soft Landing or no Landing scenarios impossible. look the FED is looking at this Micro Data it has to either increase rates at a high rate for a longer time and or decrease its balance sheet even further and that's going to put a lot of pressure on consumers they're going to be paying more for housing for cars for groceries for student debt whatever you name it less consumer spending less retail income Less jobs leading to a vicious cycle leading to a recession now hopefully it's going to be a mild recession but to say that there's a scenario here of no recession no Landing or soft lending sorry.,1.0,-0.8
Tom Nash,LJdLkakjI5g,2023-03-02T14:19:54Z,We need to talk about Meet Kevin’s meltdown,Meet Kevin,my jaw is literally still on the floor from what I just saw mid Kevin went on one of the craziest most epic meltdowns I've ever seen before about the Tesla investors day. now he was live streaming the entire show and he went on this recap where he absolutely went ape [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy basically tearing Elon and musk Elon Musk that's a new one it's no surprise that a presentation that Tesla Was preparing to put on for the last what six months is a complete flop and a complete disaster basically blaming them for dropping the ball for shooting the bed absolutely consent and the craziest part came in the last three minutes of it where he made a whole impersonation of Elon Musk as Donald Trump I'm not even making this up this is absolutely insane you have to see this see as Elon Musk my goal is to make sure we have bigly success and as a result at some point in the future we don't have an exact time frame yet but we plan to unveil the model 2. now the one real criticism I have towards Kevin here and the bone to pick with him is the fact that in eight minutes of recap he managed to plug his product twice twice in eight minutes Kevin what are you doing yeah it's just like the buy the dip opportunity for you to use the flash sale coupon code that expires today because the price will be higher guaranteed in the future dude like us do it once you can now buy stock MVP for 50 off for Life using the code last 50. that's it you're not gonna hear about it anymore in this video I'm just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's move on dude that's all that's all that's literally all they needed to say that's literally it three minutes that's all they needed to do God I'm leaving now but Kevin raises a few interesting points and a few valid points which we have to actually analyze here. so Kevin while in the minority here at least it seems there's a plenty of audience here who seems to agree with Kevin now I want to be the judge here I want to look at all the evidence and decide whether Kevin's arguments here are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or legit. now for that we're gonna have two lawyers one representing Kevin one representing the pools and I'm gonna decide based on this data so first of all before we get started we go to crazytom to argue on behalf of Kevin's name was death well that was really faithful thank you angry Tom and now we go to insightful Tom to hear from the other side oh hello I didn't notice you there well thank you for that whatever that was and now let's talk about what happened now this was obviously a very polarizing event and I want to explain why on the one hand you know Kevin is kind of right about two things. I don't think Kevin actually talked about this but it kind of goes along because Gary basically said look I like the presentation but look I asked multiple times and never got an answer how is Tesla going to get from 2 million cars to 20 million cars by 2030. I loved it maybe you didn't let me know below if you agree with Kevin or you agree with the bulls what do you think about the versus day no hey to Kevin Kevin I love you great video absolutely phenomenal stream see in the next video,1.0,0.2
Tom Nash,LJdLkakjI5g,2023-03-02T14:19:54Z,We need to talk about Meet Kevin’s meltdown,Tesla,I am pissed I am utterly pissed at Tesla for the absolute lack of presentation prep. Elon Musk was apparently up at 2AM yesterday [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around testing a new feature on Twitter spaces and now he's sitting on stage looking like he's about to fall asleep. It's no surprise that a presentation that Tesla Was preparing to put on for the last what six months is a complete flop and a complete disaster. They talked all about the efficiencies and all that good stuff which we'll cover but we didn't see a picture of the car how it's going to look like what it's going to be called how much it's going to cost no actual details as far as what this car is going to be Beyond how good it's going to be and it's something I also kind of expected to see instead we got a picture of a white towel which we've seen before. I want more institutional investors to invest in Tesla. They talked about this in the financial section but not enough and that's why you see a lot of institutionals are still hesitant about investing in Tesla. Gary basically said look I like the presentation but look I asked multiple times and never got an answer how is Tesla going to get from 2 million cars to 20 million cars by 2030. how's this demand problem going to be solved It's a lot of cars to be sold and the only answer I got is don't worry about it we got it and I also agree with Gary at that point I mean I'd like to hear a little bit more details on that rope map that's going to 10x the amount of cars they sell in seven years I think it's a valid question not answered in this investors day. you have to give credit for Tesla for their boldness to start the presentation and go hard on the environmental stuff on the energy stuff on the whole sustainability issue. I mean it's not really sexy to talk about it with Wall Street invest but they put that thing first and that just shows you what Tesla is all about. now look I want to talk a little bit about the production stuff they talked about the Next Generation car and they gave away a lot of details. they haven't shown the car sure they haven't said the name or the price but they've shown a lot of very interesting details. the production of this new generation car this model 2 or 25 000 car whatever you call it it's actually going to be very different from how they manufacture cars today. and Tesla was basically dunking on the model y design saying well the model y production is obsolete it's old news we have a new process for the new new generation car and it's going to be even better how much better well 50 cheaper to make and 40 faster to make because it's going to be modular it's going to be pretty much like Legos they're going to basically pre-build parts and then just bring it together smaller space faster production cheaper and actually better margins. now basically the idea here that this car is going to cost around 16 17 000 to make which means that at 25 000 you're gonna make still the best margins in the business even on the entry-level cars which is quite impressive. as far as the powertrain they're talking about the new powertrain for these you know the model 2 the next gen car whatever they call it the main thing for me was that they said that we're not going to need any rare earth materials here for this drivetrain that's insane to me if that's indeed the case that eliminates the whole thud of how Tesla will get to 20 million cars because this is a major issue. this is actually going to be a smaller drivetrain 75 percent actually smaller and 60 cheaper which means about a thousand dollar cheaper than the current drivetrain at 17 000 whereas the cost this is a massive cost reduction don't not contested they already have the best margins in the business this thing seems to just make it even crazier. they talked a little bit about FSD and the Tesla bot a lot of fluff I didn't really see anything crazy there. the one thing that Elon said which was very interesting he said it Optimus that the bot is going to be bigger than the car business and that very well may be the case but I mean it remains to be seen this is a huge DVD. they sold 4 million cars so far in aggregate let's Tesla just reach 4 million cars we knew that not a lot of news here on the supply chain. they also talked about hitting 20 million cars and there's never been any issues on the supply chain again we'd like to see a little bit more detail on that as well as on the demand side. Tesla has exponential growth in revenues and it has linear growth in costs and what they showed here was absolutely for me as somebody who's into financials blew me away I mean this was insane. they showed their operating cost as a percentage of revenues so basically your operating cost is how much it costs to operate your business your revenues is your sales and total right so their operating cost as a percentage of revenues was already an industry low which is a good thing at 17 in 2018. right now four years later they went from 17 to seven and a half percent they literally slashed by more than half their operating expense as a percentage of revenues in just four years this is unheard of they already have the best margins in the business but it seems that they're absolutely going insane and they said they go we'll go below seven percent in 2023 6.9 absolutely insane those who talk about their sgna the sales General administrative being 60 to 70 lower than the rest of the industry now there's a huge chunk here that actually has to do with Tesla not promoting the cars sgna has a lot of marketing expense built in so by Tesla not having a marketing department that's where the 60 70 is coming from very impressive. look at the end of the day Tesla is Miles Ahead of the competition This invested day although a little bit short on the details about the next gen car shows you how far ahead this is. Tesla is absolutely insane because what they're doing is unrivaled. Tesla has become a master of reducing costs the savings of costs increase their margins even more in increase their revenues even more which goes back into r d into further cost reductions this is a cycle that makes it literally impossible for any Legacy audit to compete with it's pretty much game over after this investors day I loved it.,1.0,0.7
Tom Nash,LJdLkakjI5g,2023-03-02T14:19:54Z,We need to talk about Meet Kevin’s meltdown,Twitter,Elon Musk was apparently up at 2AM yesterday [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around testing a new feature on Twitter spaces. now look I ran a Twitter poll although not really you know an empirical data here but a thousand people voted on my Twitter poll from about two hours ago asked how did you like the invest today good bad or neutral 45 said good 36 said neutral. now another thing I want to talk about is something that Gary black raised on Twitter.,0.8,0.0
Tom Nash,LJdLkakjI5g,2023-03-02T14:19:54Z,We need to talk about Meet Kevin’s meltdown,Toyota,and it's kind of funny because Toyota was basically saying the other day that they took apart the model Y and they were blown away by the efficiencies in production they've never seen anything like this this was like taking an alien spaceship and you know studying at reverse engineering it.,0.9,0.5
Tom Nash,LJdLkakjI5g,2023-03-02T14:19:54Z,We need to talk about Meet Kevin’s meltdown,Wendover Productions,which means that the Wendover Productions video where they knocked on people for you know for for getting a sub power product with FSD I mean there's 400 000 idiots who think that this product is actually worth paying a lot of money for so I think it's working just fine and throwing a little shade here at Wendover Productions.,0.9,-0.5
Tom Nash,z8pDNlROZDw,2023-02-26T13:44:29Z,"""How Tesla Fumbled"" | Fair or Total Hit Piece?",Tesla,hey everybody this is Tom and a massive channel here on YouTube called Wendover Productions just posted an extremely critical video of Tesla titled how Tesla has fumbled for the better part of a decade now it sold consumers on the promise failed to deliver made new promises failed to deliver and repeat and repeat and repeat 20 minutes worth of some of the most harsh accusations I've heard about Tesla in a while the reputation Tesla has earned as a company whose word means nothing has to have an impact I'm gonna take it apart like a cheap cushion coming apart at the seams in this video but I'm going to avoid personal attacks I'm not gonna be cursing I'm not going to be angry no ad hominem attacks just data versus the claims that's it if you want to check it out stay with me for the duration of this video and let's get started Tesla has never been good at building cars now for me this is one of the weakest arguments and it's really strange that I chose to start the video with it because there's not a lot of supporting evidence some empirical data that shows that what they're saying is actually true complaints about Model S's with windows that leak when it rains or mispositioned wire looms and model X's with drooping window seals or mysterious rattles when reaching speed have become commonplace scroll YouTube's results for Tesla build quality and the search will populate far more videos offering negative feedback than positive or take this poll on Tesla subreddit where a majority of all respondents reported at least minor or cosmetic issues with their vehicle I mean what are you relying on by saying it a few Scrolls on YouTube a research that's based on a Reddit poll with a thousand people Elon saying that they had quality issues when they started ramping up five years ago in 2018 I mean where's the empirical data you can take it from the man himself Elon Musk who admitted that the company's build quality waned when production ramped up Elon did say this and when you start ramping up you usually have quality issues that was five years ago how about some actual data from right now the company simply struggles to deliver consistent reliable well-assembled Vehicles it's been a problem since the beginning it's been a problem the company has sought to address time and time again and it's been a problem that's taken different forms over the years for perhaps the most objective stance of all there's the consumer reports annual reliability rankings where Tesla placed second to last in 2021 and 19th out of 24 manufacturers in 2022. now this is where I gotta push back a little bit I've been saying that Consumer Reports is the most objective way to look at this is a little bit ridiculous giving the mountains of data that you can go and find about the relationship between consumer reports and Ford and GM and about the very long combative history between consumer reports in Tesla all of this has been discussed in abundance and it's weird that they kind of present Consumer Reports as the epitome of objectivity as far as Tesla but let's stay with Consumer Reports As You Wish now in this video they're showing you 20 20 data from consumer reports 2021 data from Consumer Reports but guess what the video was posted a few days ago we already have 2022 data we have it since November 2022 why was this data not shown I don't know why they actually omitted 2022 numbers when they were publicly available I can guesstimate that maybe it's because it disproved a lot of their claims but I honestly don't know nevertheless even Consumer Reports which is known to be a little bit anti-tesla let's put it mildly I actually came out in November 2022 and did an updated study on reliability they took 24 Brands 300 000 cars and they checked it and the conclusions are very clear for 2022 Tesla and Nissan are the best as far as reliability out of all EVS so as far as EVS go Tesla is right at the top but what about the rest of the industry it must be probably one of the worst well not really Tesla scored pretty average and in fact none of Tesla vehicles are anywhere close to the bottom 10 in any category so they based on consumer reports at least this is completely debunk Tesla may not be the best equality but they're definitely not anywhere close to being the worst and as far as EVS go they're absolutely at the top as far as quality and reliability if Tesla is bad at building cars then they're at best hit or miss when it comes to delivering them some of those who are once happy to wait showed up at delivery centers for their new model 3. others went to Twitter searching for answers when they couldn't get through to anyone at Tesla now in this part they're saying the test is not only bad at building cars they're equally as bad at delivering them of course talking about things that happened in 2018 showing Twitter posts from 2018 were in fact right now we're in 2023 and there's publicly available data proving that this is a bunch of horse manure now right now the average wait time for Tesla in the US is 30 to 60 days that's it in fact the backlog from February 2022 to February 2023 have shrank from 400 000 vehicles to 100 thousand Vehicles Tesla has not only gotten better four times better at delivering cars in fact the current wait time of 30 to 60 days is probably one of the best we had but of course if you want to show a different picture you show four-year-old data the company only established 163 service centers spread across the US now this claim is actually somewhat on point what they're talking about is a very painful topic to a lot of Tesla owners there's not enough service centers in the US 100 if you live in Wichita Kansas your nearest options are all a state border and a two-hour Drive Away there's a lot of States who prevent who forbid Tesla from opening centers of service in their state because the law says that only the dealership can do that the manufacturer is not allowed to open its own service center they're doing it because this archaic old rules who are designed to protect dealerships prevent Tesla from actually providing services in those States so it's a regulatory problem that needs to be addressed it's not a 10 Tesla problem so the company is burning through their existing customers the group most likely to buy future Teslas which is certainly a problem now this segment sounds extremely logical right if Tesla is making bad cars and if Tesla can't deliver these cars on time it's losing its customer base very logical only problem is that Tesla is not building bad cars only problem is the Tesla is not having trouble delivering the cars only problem is that Tesla is not losing customers in fact is growing customers in 2022 the growth in Tesla sales was above 50 percent if Tesla was making cars that would have never been the case in fact if you compare quarterly sales at the final quarter of 2019 just three years ago to the quarterly sales in Q4 2022 the sales went up from a hundred thousand cars in the quarter to 400 000 cars in a quarter so Tesla quadrupled them out of quarterly cars for 2019 to 2022 it's a little bit of a misleading thing to assume when numbers are literally telling you that Tesla is growing at a massive pace so where this conclusion is coming from I honestly don't understand because the data simply proves otherwise compare a model y long range to a Mustang Machi premium and it has slightly better acceleration slightly longer range but a slightly higher price as far as distinguishable differences go there are a few now this is my favorite segment so far they're comparing the Tesla Model y to Ford Mach e and this is a little bit like comparing a spaceship to a potato it's not the right comparison but let's do it now they do stipulate the Tesla has better performance and better capacity of battery better performance of speed what not whatever right but they say Hey look it's close enough and the Ford Mac e is still a cheaper car well that's just factually incorrect I'm shocked that they haven't done the research because let's compare apples to apples let's look at the numbers following the price drop the model y long range is 55 000 they did this to meet the EV tax credit now the Ford Mark E comparable model which is the premium all-wheel drive e all-wheel drive is 60 two and a half thousand dollars it's more expensive than the model y long range not to mention that Tesla has better software better utility and the supercharging network it's a similar story of market with the model S the Lucid air nearly matches on acceleration beats it on range and is close enough in price that few in this market segment would bat an eye now this part is just comical they're comparing the model S to the Lucid air basically saying look the Lucid air is comparable probably even better and it's cheaper it starts at ninety thousand dollars the model S is a hundred five thousand dollar car but here's the kicker ask yourself one simple question why Lucid has manufacturing capacity of 7 000 vehicles in 2022 but it only sold 4 400 Vehicles why why was there not enough demand for This Magnificent vehicle that's so much better than the model is and even cheaper well it's because it's not really cheaper because the actual price of these Lucid cars starts at 90 000 but then it goes all the way up to 250 thousand for the premium version at the end of the day when you compare the best premium version of lucid at 250 000 to the one hundred and forty thousand dollars of the model S plaid this thing is literally half the price it has better software better full self driving better a supercharging network all the stuff we talked about in fact better engineering so who in his right mind would buy the Lucid Air at Double the price of the model S pled in fact I assume that anybody who must have bought this car has two holes drilled in the roof of the Lucid air for the ears you know the donkey ears because anybody who's done that is a poopless donkey Tesla is bested by Chevrolet whose base model Bowl EV starts for some fifteen thousand dollars less than the base model 3 while coming close on many specs while this part might be the most egregious of them all even worse than Lucid they're actually bringing up the Chevy bolt now look I'm not a hater of the Chevy bolt but ask yourself this simple question why apply to this beautiful yummy fifteen thousand dollar car such a great price so quality so value only sold 40 000 cars in 2022 well it might have something to do with the fact that in 2021 they recalled every single Chevy bolt made because it literally had a problem of spontaneously Catching Fire allegedly now I don't know what about you but even at fifteen thousand dollars I I don't know if I wanted to sit in the car that you know had that in its history so now that's just a joke obviously but more on this serious topic look even at fifty thousand dollar it's just not good enough of a car not enough features not enough utility it doesn't have the software no super charging I mean it's just a really poor very basic Bare Bones offering nobody really wants in the US well unique in their minimalistic design the broad Strokes of Tesla's product lineup is uniquely basic Min Marco sedan midmarket SUV upmarket sedan upmarket SUV what are you really saying here that their cars are too boring sedan remember that in the SUV what I mean look people obviously like it they sold 1.3 million last year based on Q4 numbers they're in route to sell 2 million cars in 2023. obviously people are okay with the design what's your point not to mention the fact that this is the Brilliance of Tesla the Simplicity of it look standardized Vehicles only four real Vehicles really only two real Vehicles the model 3 and the model Y and massive scale cheaper production faster ramp up cheaper maintenance way more data and you're preparing yourself for the robo taxi Network year after year after year it's never been a surprise who will Top the list of American vehicle sales it's the Ford F series it's always the Ford F series now I have to give them credit here because this segment is on point the truck segment in the US is the best category for every auto manufacturer and it is absolutely dominated by the F-150 which is an incredible car by the way now Tesla's not in it they're missing out on a lot of potential profit he's right but here's where the kicker is Tesla is a brand new company it's ramping up what do you expect them to make 57 different models in five years they have to pick their poison the semi the model is the model 3 the Roadster I can do all day cyber track I mean there's only so much they can do in five years Ford announced they just build an electric version the F-150 three years after that it entered production and today there are thousands of F-150 lightnings on the road and exactly zero Tesla pickups and yes Ford sold 15 000 units of the F-150 true good for them but just five days ago this article came out talking about Ford stopping sales completely until they can figure out why batteries on the F-150 lighting are catching fire this is what happens when you push out a product too fast before it's finished just to be the first in the market that's exactly what did not happen to Tesla the F-150 was merely joining a market already kicked off by the Henry V and rivian r1t meaning there are three manufacturers already in production working out the Kings ramping up to massive scale in 2023. how massive is the ramp up well GMC Hummers are about 850 units in in 2022 Riven has done a little bit of a better job with 24 000 units hardly a massive ramp up and I'm just going to leave you with this funny video of a GMC Hummer being charged from 49 to full and you're gonna absolutely love it the new GMC Hammer EV truck is the quickest charging vehicle on the market right now One charging 120 volt using the Hummer cable right now it's about 6 pm on Tuesday and it says it'll be full by Saturday at 10 55 which is four plus days of charging that's byd no company globally produces more EVS they are now bigger than Tesla from a volume perspective now in this part we're seeing a manifestation of this recent trend on YouTube of hyping up byd now don't get me wrong byd is a fine company but the information is absolutely misleading it's factually incorrect they're talking about byd being the biggest EV producer in the world which is just plain wrong byd produced 900 000 electric vehicles in 2022 that's way less according to my math versus the 1.3 million of Tesla so that doesn't put them as number one I'm sorry I think what they're talking about is that byd also produced 950 000 hybrids at the same year now if you combine hybrids and electric vehicles and you lump it up together then Toyota which absolutely is not in the EV game is now becoming the world's number one Eevee producer see how ridiculous that is to include hybrids in these statistics so no so byd isn't the world's largest producers of electric vehicles by many stretch of the imagination they're good company but that's definitely false China is just such an immense Market that there are equivalent quality alternatives to Western products that are better suited to the needs and wants of Chinese consumers which leave Western managers dumbfounded so in Tesla's case inevitably their vehicles are going to be worse for Chinese consumers than the Homegrown Alternatives and unless they succeed where almost all their equivalents have failed they just won't be able to understand why though this segment logically makes sense because they're saying well look Chinese manufacturers are really good and they know what the Chinese public wants so Tesla would never be able to compete with it only problem is beta again proves otherwise in January 6th Tesla dropped prices on its offering in China guess what happened on February 3rd the Chinese passenger car Association the cpca actually showed that Tesla sold 66 000 china-made vehicles in January at 10.4 percent increase compared to year ago and an 18.4 increase compared to December 2022 and these numbers do not include exports it's just pure Chinese made and sold Vehicles local in China and by the way in January Tesla went up in market share as far as the Chinese market from six percent December to eight and a half percent January it's a two and a half percent market share rise in the month Tesla does not need 60 market dominance like it has in the US and we'll have for a while it doesn't need that it needs about 10 percent of the Chinese market to be just fine in 2016 after being dropped by its previous autonomous partner over safety concerns Tesla charted a new vision for full self-driving and quickly started selling a software package referred to as full self driving for three thousand dollars soon after now this part is really annoying because this is literally a misleading way to put what happened they're talking about the split in 2016 between mobile and Tesla and they're saying that mobile I dumped Tesla because of safety concerns now look you can call it safety concerns but it's very misleading if you don't give context the context is way more important here than you would think because what happened is we've done Elon Musk and the head guy of mobileye had a disagreement Elon says hey this thing eventually will be autonomous and the guy from mobile says hey what we're building will never be autonomous at least not in our lifetime this is always going to be a driver assist system they have this clash in where the development is supposed to go and they split up because they saw different Visions there were no safety issues or concerns or accidents it's absolutely a different vision for the system and so far with FSD beta versus the mobilized system it seems that Elon had a good point in fact when they split up this is what Alan Joshua the head guy of mobilize said no matter how you spin it autopilot is not designed for that it is a driver assistance system and not a driverless system simple but full self-driving didn't exactly mean full self driving and yes in this part they're talking about how FSD the full self-driving is not really full self driving well nobody is buying this feature because they think the car is autonomous I would struggle to find any purchaser of Tesla who purchased this Assuming he's getting an autonomous system full self-driving does not mean autonomous self-driving it's different things yes it's not perfect yes it's work in progress yes it has to get a lot better but nobody's getting full here and trust me having driven other cars Tesla's driver assist systems starting from the autopilot on all the way to the FSD beta from what I've seen from my friends is top-notch and unrivaled by any of the other car manufacturers including some of the guys who work with them in 2016. so the better part of a decade now it sold consumers on the promise failed to deliver made new promises failed to deliver and repeat and repeat and repeat the company has burned through its most promising customer base existing owners the reputation Tesla has earned as a company whose word means nothing has to have an impact now this segment is very strange because it has a lot of assumptions and when you assume you make an ass out of you and me but mainly because there's actual hard data that proves what they just said in the segment is absolute horse manure they're saying that people are getting disgruntled because they're not getting the FSD they were promised and that's where the quitting Tesla the brand loyalty et cetera Etc but there's literally a study by s n p globe level and in that study they found out that Tesla from 2021 to 2022 doubled doubled its brand loyalty from 30 to 63 percent in fact that 63 ranks it as the highest brand loyalty auto manufacturer in the world out of every single other auto manufacturer in the world so not only the Tesla clients are leaving or disgruntled they literally have the best brand loyalty in the freaking world how could you have not seen this research well musk might have been the Visionary behind the disruptive Behemoth today he's a liability now this part is a little bit strange because for a research-based channel that does research-based content for them to go ad hominem like this at Elon the personal attack is very weird calling him a liability now look I may not agree with everything he says or does but calling this dude a liability the guy who has built Tesla from the ground up that took it from nothing into two million cars next year with mountains of cash with massive growth Global adoption the guy who's changed the art industry I don't know if I can agree with that it just sounds like a very personal thing to say about somebody who has achieved a hell of a lot Tesla's competitive Advantage was built on scarcity for most of their history they were the only legitimate horse in the EV race they're claiming that the only Advantage for tested only mode is the scarcity and once the scarcity is gone when there's more competition then Tesla doesn't have an edge versus the other EVS in the market to me that's a little bit strange because you have absolutely ignored the supercharger network with 40 000 charges and 1800 stations and I know you know of its existence because two years ago you made a video saying that the supercharger network will never be enough to support EV adoption now ever since your video the network has doubled in size and definitely proven that it's more than capable to do so but somehow to absolutely never mention the supercharger Network as far as modes and an edge yikes meanwhile 4gm Volkswagen rivien and others are acting as the adults in the room now I can live with these guys not mentioning the supercharger network but calling Ford and GM the responsible adults in the room the companies that have a hundred billion dollars in debt each but hold on about the debt that has nothing to do with what he's talking about Ford and GM let's look at the numbers Ford and GM combined sold a hundred thousand electric vehicles in 2022. that's literally what Tesla does in the weekend not in the weekend in the month okay whatever I know I get it I get it so they sold a hundred thousand combined Tesla sells 1.3 million uh has the best brand loyalty in the business and somehow these guys are the responsible adults in the room now talking about VW that's a whole different discussion yes VW is definitely way better position and they did sell over 550 000 vehicles in 2022 electric vehicles but guess what in Germany there's a whole new thing coming up the German Factory is actually starting to ramp up in January Tesla sales in Germany shot up by 903 percent Tesla's fumble is what it could have been now let's see exactly how Tesla fumbled its future now we're talking about a company that's sitting on a pile of cash no debt 50 annual growth they went from 280 000 cars in 2018 to 2 million cars this year they'll make 2 million cars this year based on Q4 numbers they have the best margins in the business better than Toyota and we haven't even talked about the Cyber truck coming out the 25 000 car coming out we haven't talked about AI we haven't talked about energy none of these things so how exactly have Tesla fumbled its future I mean my guy how much faster and better would you expect Tesla to do from 2018 to 2023 I mean I don't understand this point and I'm really trying they could have been a giant they could have been 4gm and Chrysler so if in 10 years Tesla is anything but the biggest car manufacturer in America the explanation will likely be less about what it does over the next decade and more about what it didn't do oh come on give me a break if in 10 years grandpa doesn't have balls you'll be Grandma come on now for me the hardest part about this video was reading the pin comment they left basically saying well we know that Tesla cult will come for us because we criticize Tesla no no that's not the case I'm coming for you and a lot of people are coming for you because you put out lazy half-assed research with absolutely no objectivity to prove a point to shoehorn your point into a reality that doesn't fit what you're claiming now if you have done this video about VW or Alibaba or at T the result would have been the same yes it gets more cloud because it's Tesla but it's not because it's a cult it's because your video is riddled with inaccuracies and professional research and absolute horse manure of information to try and make you point even better you could have made an absolutely balanced video critiquing Tesla on the issues that it does have which might be quality which might be service aftermarket which might be Elon personally being polarizing all of this could have been made in a better way without you going all in and pushing it all the way in just to show how bad Tesla is I was disappointed I'm not going to stop watching this channel I think this channel puts out great content I think this is a one-off and I wish this video would not have been done I definitely do not want you to go there and leave hate on their video by no means do not do it while not looking for drama but I want you to send this video to anybody who sends you the Wendover Productions video saying Hey look at Tesla it's so bad send them my video and then go have a chat with them and by the way this video took a long ass time to make if by any chance you haven't subscribed yet to the channel I'd really appreciate it if you can on your way out you know just slap the like button a little bit I hate asking yeah a little bit cringed out but hey it's YouTube we're playing the algorithm game thank you so much we'll see you next video,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,z8pDNlROZDw,2023-02-26T13:44:29Z,"""How Tesla Fumbled"" | Fair or Total Hit Piece?",Wendover Productions,hey everybody this is Tom and a massive channel here on YouTube called Wendover Productions just posted an extremely critical video of Tesla titled how Tesla has fumbled for the better part of a decade now it sold consumers on the promise failed to deliver made new promises failed to deliver and repeat and repeat and repeat 20 minutes worth of some of the most harsh accusations I've heard about Tesla in a while the reputation Tesla has earned as a company whose word means nothing has to have an impact I'm gonna take it apart like a cheap cushion coming apart at the seams in this video but I'm going to avoid personal attacks I'm not gonna be cursing I'm not going to be angry no ad hominem attacks just data versus the claims that's it if you want to check it out stay with me for the duration of this video and let's get started now in this video they're showing you 20 20 data from consumer reports 2021 data from Consumer Reports but guess what the video was posted a few days ago we already have 2022 data we have it since November 2022 why was this data not shown I don't know why they actually omitted 2022 numbers when they were publicly available I can guesstimate that maybe it's because it disproved a lot of their claims but I honestly don't know nevertheless even Consumer Reports which is known to be a little bit anti-tesla let's put it mildly I actually came out in November 2022 and did an updated study on reliability they took 24 Brands 300 000 cars and they checked it and the conclusions are very clear for 2022 Tesla and Nissan are the best as far as reliability out of all EVS so as far as EVS go Tesla is right at the top but what about the rest of the industry it must be probably one of the worst well not really Tesla scored pretty average and in fact none of Tesla vehicles are anywhere close to the bottom 10 in any category so they based on consumer reports at least this is completely debunk Tesla may not be the best equality but they're definitely not anywhere close to being the worst and as far as EVS go they're absolutely at the top as far as quality and reliability if Tesla is bad at building cars then they're at best hit or miss when it comes to delivering them some of those who are once happy to wait showed up at delivery centers for their new model 3. others went to Twitter searching for answers when they couldn't get through to anyone at Tesla now in this part they're saying the test is not only bad at building cars they're equally as bad at delivering them of course talking about things that happened in 2018 showing Twitter posts from 2018 were in fact right now we're in 2023 and there's publicly available data proving that this is a bunch of horse manure now right now the average wait time for Tesla in the US is 30 to 60 days that's it in fact the backlog from February 2022 to February 2023 have shrank from 400 000 vehicles to 100 thousand Vehicles Tesla has not only gotten better four times better at delivering cars in fact the current wait time of 30 to 60 days is probably one of the best we had but of course if you want to show a different picture you show four-year-old data the company only established 163 service centers spread across the US now this claim is actually somewhat on point what they're talking about is a very painful topic to a lot of Tesla owners there's not enough service centers in the US 100 if you live in Wichita Kansas your nearest options are all a state border and a two-hour Drive Away there's a lot of States who prevent who forbid Tesla from opening centers of service in their state because the law says that only the dealership can do that the manufacturer is not allowed to open its own service center they're doing it because this archaic old rules who are designed to protect dealerships prevent Tesla from actually providing services in those States so it's a regulatory problem that needs to be addressed it's not a 10 Tesla problem so the company is burning through their existing customers the group most likely to buy future Teslas which is certainly a problem now this segment sounds extremely logical right if Tesla is making bad cars and if Tesla can't deliver these cars on time it's losing its customer base very logical only problem is that Tesla is not building bad cars only problem is the Tesla is not having trouble delivering the cars only problem is that Tesla is not losing customers in fact is growing customers in 2022 the growth in Tesla sales was above 50 percent if Tesla was making cars that would have never been the case in fact if you compare quarterly sales at the final quarter of 2019 just three years ago to the quarterly sales in Q4 2022 the sales went up from a hundred thousand cars in the quarter to 400 000 cars in a quarter so Tesla quadrupled them out of quarterly cars for 2019 to 2022 it's a little bit of a misleading thing to assume when numbers are literally telling you that Tesla is growing at a massive pace so where this conclusion is coming from I honestly don't understand because the data simply proves otherwise compare a model y long range to a Mustang Machi premium and it has slightly better acceleration slightly longer range but a slightly higher price as far as distinguishable differences go there are a few now this is my favorite segment so far they're comparing the Tesla Model y to Ford Mach e and this is a little bit like comparing a spaceship to a potato it's not the right comparison but let's do it now they do stipulate the Tesla has better performance and better capacity of battery better performance of speed what not whatever right but they say Hey look it's close enough and the Ford Mac e is still a cheaper car well that's just factually incorrect I'm shocked that they haven't done the research because let's compare apples to apples let's look at the numbers following the price drop the model y long range is 55 000 they did this to meet the EV tax credit now the Ford Mark E comparable model which is the premium all-wheel drive e all-wheel drive is 60 two and a half thousand dollars it's more expensive than the model y long range not to mention that Tesla has better software better utility and the supercharging network it's a similar story of market with the model S the Lucid air nearly matches on acceleration beats it on range and is close enough in price that few in this market segment would bat an eye now this part is just comical they're comparing the model S to the Lucid air basically saying look the Lucid air is comparable probably even better and it's cheaper it starts at ninety thousand dollars the model S is a hundred five thousand dollar car but here's the kicker ask yourself one simple question why Lucid has manufacturing capacity of 7 000 vehicles in 2022 but it only sold 4 400 Vehicles why why was there not enough demand for This Magnificent vehicle that's so much better than the model is and even cheaper well it's because it's not really cheaper because the actual price of these Lucid cars starts at 90 000 but then it goes all the way up to 250 thousand for the premium version at the end of the day when you compare the best premium version of lucid at 250 000 to the one hundred and forty thousand dollars of the model S plaid this thing is literally half the price it has better software better full self driving better a supercharging network all the stuff we talked about in fact better engineering so who in his right mind would buy the Lucid Air at Double the price of the model S pled in fact I assume that anybody who must have bought this car has two holes drilled in the roof of the Lucid air for the ears you know the donkey ears because anybody who's done that is a poopless donkey Tesla is bested by Chevrolet whose base model Bowl EV starts for some fifteen thousand dollars less than the base model 3 while coming close on many specs while this part might be the most egregious of them all even worse than Lucid they're actually bringing up the Chevy bolt now look I'm not a hater of the Chevy bolt but ask yourself this simple question why apply to this beautiful yummy fifteen thousand dollar car such a great price so quality so value only sold 40 000 cars in 2022 well it might have something to do with the fact that in 2021 they recalled every single Chevy bolt made because it literally had a problem of spontaneously Catching Fire allegedly now I don't know what about you but even at fifteen thousand dollars I I don't know if I wanted to sit in the car that you know had that in its history so now that's just a joke obviously but more on this serious topic look even at fifty thousand dollar it's just not good enough of a car not enough features not enough utility it doesn't have the software no super charging I mean it's just a really poor very basic Bare Bones offering nobody really wants in the US well unique in their minimalistic design the broad Strokes of Tesla's product lineup is uniquely basic Min Marco sedan midmarket SUV upmarket sedan upmarket SUV what are you really saying here that their cars are too boring sedan remember that in the SUV what I mean look people obviously like it they sold 1.3 million last year based on Q4 numbers they're in route to sell 2 million cars in 2023. obviously people are okay with the design what's your point not to mention the fact that this is the Brilliance of Tesla the Simplicity of it look standardized Vehicles only four real Vehicles really only two real Vehicles the model 3 and the model Y and massive scale cheaper production faster ramp up cheaper maintenance way more data and you're preparing yourself for the robo taxi Network year after year after year it's never been a surprise who will Top the list of American vehicle sales it's the Ford F series it's always the Ford F series now I have to give them credit here because this segment is on point the truck segment in the US is the best category for every auto manufacturer and it is absolutely dominated by the F-150 which is an incredible car by the way now Tesla's not in it they're missing out on a lot of potential profit he's right but here's where the kicker is Tesla is a brand new company it's ramping up what do you expect them to make 57 different models in five years they have to pick their poison the semi the model is the model 3 the Roadster I can do all day cyber track I mean there's only so much they can do in five years Ford announced they just build an electric version the F-150 three years after that it entered production and today there are thousands of F-150 lightnings on the road and exactly zero Tesla pickups and yes Ford sold 15 000 units of the F-150 true good for them but just five days ago this article came out talking about Ford stopping sales completely until they can figure out why batteries on the F-150 lighting are catching fire this is what happens when you push out a product too fast before it's finished just to be the first in the market that's exactly what did not happen to Tesla the F-150 was merely joining a market already kicked off by the Henry V and rivian r1t meaning there are three manufacturers already in production working out the Kings ramping up to massive scale in 2023. how massive is the ramp up well GMC Hummers are about 850 units in in 2022 Riven has done a little bit of a better job with 24 000 units hardly a massive ramp up and I'm just going to leave you with this funny video of a GMC Hummer being charged from 49 to full and you're gonna absolutely love it the new GMC Hammer EV truck is the quickest charging vehicle on the market right now One charging 120 volt using the Hummer cable right now it's about 6 pm on Tuesday and it says it'll be full by Saturday at 10 55 which is four plus days of charging that's byd no company globally produces more EVS they are now bigger than Tesla from a volume perspective now in this part we're seeing a manifestation of this recent trend on YouTube of hyping up byd now don't get me wrong byd is a fine company but the information is absolutely misleading it's factually incorrect they're talking about byd being the biggest EV producer in the world which is just plain wrong byd produced 900 000 electric vehicles in 2022 that's way less according to my math versus the 1.3 million of Tesla so that doesn't put them as number one I'm sorry I think what they're talking about is that byd also produced 950 000 hybrids at the same year now if you combine hybrids and electric vehicles and you lump it up together then Toyota which absolutely is not in the EV game is now becoming the world's number one Eevee producer see how ridiculous that is to include hybrids in these statistics so no so byd isn't the world's largest producers of electric vehicles by many stretch of the imagination they're good company but that's definitely false China is just such an immense Market that there are equivalent quality alternatives to Western products that are better suited to the needs and wants of Chinese consumers which leave Western managers dumbfounded so in Tesla's case inevitably their vehicles are going to be worse for Chinese consumers than the Homegrown Alternatives and unless they succeed where almost all their equivalents have failed they just won't be able to understand why though this segment logically makes sense because they're saying well look Chinese manufacturers are really good and they know what the Chinese public wants so Tesla would never be able to compete with it only problem is beta again proves otherwise in January 6th Tesla dropped prices on its offering in China guess what happened on February 3rd the Chinese passenger car Association the cpca actually showed that Tesla sold 66 000 china-made vehicles in January at 10.4 percent increase compared to year ago and an 18.4 increase compared to December 2022 and these numbers do not include exports it's just pure Chinese made and sold Vehicles local in China and by the way in January Tesla went up in market share as far as the Chinese market from six percent December to eight and a half percent January it's a two and a half percent market share rise in the month Tesla does not need 60 market dominance like it has in the US and we'll have for a while it doesn't need that it needs about 10 percent of the Chinese market to be just fine in 2016 after being dropped by its previous autonomous partner over safety concerns Tesla charted a new vision for full self-driving and quickly started selling a software package referred to as full self driving for three thousand dollars soon after now this part is really annoying because this is literally a misleading way to put what happened they're talking about the split in 2016 between mobile and Tesla and they're saying that mobile I dumped

sold 15 000 units of the F-150 true good for them but just five days ago this article came out talking about Ford stopping sales completely until they can figure out why batteries on the F-150 lighting are catching fire this is what happens when you push out a product too fast before it's finished just to be the first in the market that's exactly what did not happen to Tesla the F-150 was merely joining a market already kicked off by the Henry V and rivian r1t meaning there are three manufacturers already in production working out the Kings ramping up to massive scale in 2023. how massive is the ramp up well GMC Hummers are about 850 units in in 2022 Riven has done a little bit of a better job with 24 000 units hardly a massive ramp up and I'm just going to leave you with this funny video of a GMC Hummer being charged from 49 to full and you're gonna absolutely love it the new GMC Hammer EV truck is the quickest charging vehicle on the market right now One charging 120 volt using the Hummer cable right now it's about 6 pm on Tuesday and it says it'll be full by Saturday at 10 55 which is four plus days of charging that's byd no company globally produces more EVS they are now bigger than Tesla from a volume perspective now in this part we're seeing a manifestation of this recent trend on YouTube of hyping up byd now don't get me wrong byd is a fine company but the information is absolutely misleading it's factually incorrect they're talking about byd being the biggest EV producer in the world which is just plain wrong byd produced 900 000 electric vehicles in 2022 that's way less according to my math versus the 1.3 million of Tesla so that doesn't put them as number one I'm sorry I think what they're talking about is that byd also produced 950 000 hybrids at the same year now if you combine hybrids and electric vehicles and you lump it up together then Toyota which absolutely is not in the EV game is now becoming the world's number one Eevee producer see how ridiculous that is to include hybrids in these statistics so no so byd isn't the world's largest producers of electric vehicles by many stretch of the imagination they're good company but that's definitely false China is just such an immense Market that there are equivalent quality alternatives to Western products that are better suited to the needs and wants of Chinese consumers which leave Western managers dumbfounded so in Tesla's case inevitably their vehicles are going to be worse for Chinese consumers than the Homegrown Alternatives and unless they succeed where almost all their equivalents have failed they just won't be able to understand why though this segment logically makes sense because they're saying well look Chinese manufacturers are really good and they know what the Chinese public wants so Tesla would never be able to compete with it only problem is beta again proves otherwise in January 6th Tesla dropped prices on its offering in China guess what happened on February 3rd the Chinese passenger car Association the cpca actually showed that Tesla sold 66 000 china-made vehicles in January at 10.4 percent increase compared to year ago and an 18.4 increase compared to December 2022 and these numbers do not include exports it's just pure Chinese made and sold Vehicles local in China and by the way in January Tesla went up in market share as far as the Chinese market from six percent December to eight and a half percent January it's a two and a half percent market share rise in the month Tesla does not need 60 market dominance like it has in the US and we'll have for a while it doesn't need that it needs about 10 percent of the Chinese market to be just fine in 2016 after being dropped by its previous autonomous partner over safety concerns Tesla charted a new vision for full self-driving and quickly started selling a software package referred to as full self driving for three thousand dollars soon after now this part is really annoying because this is literally a misleading way to put what happened they're talking about the split in 2016 between mobile and Tesla and they're saying that mobile I dumped Tesla because of safety concerns now look you can call it safety concerns but it's very misleading if you don't give context the context is way more important here than you would think because what happened is we've done Elon Musk and the head guy of mobileye had a disagreement Elon says hey this thing eventually will be autonomous and the guy from mobile says hey what we're building will never be autonomous at least not in our lifetime this is always going to be a driver assist system they have this clash in where the development is supposed to go and they split up because they saw different Visions there were no safety issues or concerns or accidents it's absolutely a different vision for the system and so far with FSD beta versus the mobilized system it seems that Elon had a good point in fact when they split up this is what Alan Joshua the head guy of mobilize said no matter how you spin it autopilot is not designed for that it is a driver assistance system and not a driverless system simple but full self-driving didn't exactly mean full self driving and yes in this part they're talking about how FSD the full self-driving is not really full self driving well nobody is buying this feature because they think the car is autonomous I would struggle to find any purchaser of Tesla who purchased this Assuming he's getting an autonomous system full self-driving does not mean autonomous self-driving it's different things yes it's not perfect yes it's work in progress yes it has to get a lot better but nobody's getting full here and trust me having driven other cars Tesla's driver assist systems starting from the autopilot on all the way to the FSD beta from what I've seen from my friends is top-notch and unrivaled by any of the other car manufacturers including some of the guys who work with them in 2016. so the better part of a decade now it sold consumers on the promise failed to deliver made new promises failed to deliver and repeat and repeat and repeat the company has burned through its most promising customer base existing owners the reputation Tesla has earned as a company whose word means nothing has to have an impact now this segment is very strange because it has a lot of assumptions and when you assume you make an ass out of you and me but mainly because there's actual hard data that proves what they just said in the segment is absolute horse manure they're saying that people are getting disgruntled because they're not getting the FSD they were promised and that's where the quitting Tesla the brand loyalty et cetera Etc but there's literally a study by s n p globe level and in that study they found out that Tesla from 2021 to 2022 doubled doubled its brand loyalty from 30 to 63 percent in fact that 63 ranks it as the highest brand loyalty auto manufacturer in the world out of every single other auto manufacturer in the world so not only the Tesla clients are leaving or disgruntled they literally have the best brand loyalty in the freaking world how could you have not seen this research well musk might have been the Visionary behind the disruptive Behemoth today he's a liability now this part is a little bit strange because for a research-based channel that does research-based content for them to go ad hominem like this at Elon the personal attack is very weird calling him a liability now look I may not agree with everything he says or does but calling this dude a liability the guy who has built Tesla from the ground up that took it from nothing into two million cars next year with mountains of cash with massive growth Global adoption the guy who's changed the art industry I don't know if I can agree with that it just sounds like a very personal thing to say about somebody who has achieved a hell of a lot Tesla's competitive Advantage was built on scarcity for most of their history they were the only legitimate horse in the EV race they're claiming that the only Advantage for tested only mode is the scarcity and once the scarcity is gone when there's more competition then Tesla doesn't have an edge versus the other EVS in the market to me that's a little bit strange because you have absolutely ignored the supercharger network with 40 000 charges and 1800 stations and I know you know of its existence because two years ago you made a video saying that the supercharger network will never be enough to support EV adoption now ever since your video the network has doubled in size and definitely proven that it's more than capable to do so but somehow to absolutely never mention the supercharger Network as far as modes and an edge yikes meanwhile 4gm Volkswagen rivien and others are acting as the adults in the room now I can live with these guys not mentioning the supercharger network but calling Ford and GM the responsible adults in the room the companies that have a hundred billion dollars in debt each but hold on about the debt that has nothing to do with what he's talking about Ford and GM let's look at the numbers Ford and GM combined sold a hundred thousand electric vehicles in 2022. that's literally what Tesla does in the weekend not in the weekend in the month okay whatever I know I get it I get it so they sold a hundred thousand combined Tesla sells 1.3 million uh has the best brand loyalty in the business and somehow these guys are the responsible adults in the room now talking about VW that's a whole different discussion yes VW is definitely way better position and they did sell over 550 000 vehicles in 2022 electric vehicles but guess what in Germany there's a whole new thing coming up the German Factory is actually starting to ramp up in January Tesla sales in Germany shot up by 903 percent Tesla's fumble is what it could have been now let's see exactly how Tesla fumbled its future now we're talking about a company that's sitting on a pile of cash no debt 50 annual growth they went from 280 000 cars in 2018 to 2 million cars this year they'll make 2 million cars this year based on Q4 numbers they have the best margins in the business better than Toyota and we haven't even talked about the Cyber truck coming out the 25 000 car coming out we haven't talked about AI we haven't talked about energy none of these things so how exactly have Tesla fumbled its future I mean my guy how much faster and better would you expect Tesla to do from 2018 to 2023 I mean I don't understand this point and I'm really trying they could have been a giant they could have been 4gm and Chrysler so if in 10 years Tesla is anything but the biggest car manufacturer in America the explanation will likely be less about what it does over the next decade and more about what it didn't do oh come on give me a break if in 10 years grandpa doesn't have balls you'll be Grandma come on now for me the hardest part about this video was reading the pin comment they left basically saying well we know that Tesla cult will come for us because we criticize Tesla no no that's not the case I'm coming for you and a lot of people are coming for you because you put out lazy half-assed research with absolutely no objectivity to prove a point to shoehorn your point into a reality that doesn't fit what you're claiming now if you have done this video about VW or Alibaba or at T the result would have been the same yes it gets more cloud because it's Tesla but it's not because it's a cult it's because your video is riddled with inaccuracies and professional research and absolute horse manure of information to try and make you point even better you could have made an absolutely balanced video critiquing Tesla on the issues that it does have which might be quality which might be service aftermarket which might be Elon personally being polarizing all of this could have been made in a better way without you going all in and pushing it all the way in just to show how bad Tesla is I was disappointed I'm not going to stop watching this channel I think this channel puts out great content I think this is a one-off and I wish this video would not have been done I definitely do not want you to go there and leave hate on their video by no means do not do it while not looking for drama but I want you to send this video to anybody who sends you the Wendover Productions video saying Hey look at Tesla it's so bad send them my video and then go have a chat with them and by the way this video took a long ass time to make if by any chance you haven't subscribed yet to the channel I'd really appreciate it if you can on your way out you know just slap the like button a little bit I hate asking yeah a little bit cringed out but hey it's YouTube we're playing the algorithm game thank you so much we'll see you next video,1.0,-0.2
Tom Nash,z8pDNlROZDw,2023-02-26T13:44:29Z,"""How Tesla Fumbled"" | Fair or Total Hit Piece?",GM,giving the mountains of data that you can go and find about the relationship between consumer reports and Ford and GM and about the very long combative history between consumer reports in Tesla all of this has been discussed in abundance and it's weird that they kind of present Consumer Reports as the epitome of objectivity as far as Tesla but let's stay with Consumer Reports As You Wish now in this video they're showing you 20 20 data from consumer reports 2021 data from Consumer Reports but guess what the video was posted a few days ago we already have 2022 data we have it since November 2022 why was this data not shown I don't know why they actually omitted 2022 numbers when they were publicly available I can guesstimate that maybe it's because it disproved a lot of their claims but I honestly don't know nevertheless even Consumer Reports which is known to be a little bit anti-tesla let's put it mildly I actually came out in November 2022 and did an updated study on reliability they took 24 Brands 300 000 cars and they checked it and the conclusions are very clear for 2022 Tesla and Nissan are the best as far as reliability out of all EVS so as far as EVS go Tesla is right at the top but what about the rest of the industry it must be probably one of the worst well not really Tesla scored pretty average and in fact none of Tesla vehicles are anywhere close to the bottom 10 in any category so they based on consumer reports at least this is completely debunk Tesla may not be the best equality but they're definitely not anywhere close to being the worst and as far as EVS go they're absolutely at the top as far as quality and reliability if Tesla is bad at building cars then they're at best hit or miss when it comes to delivering them some of those who are once happy to wait showed up at delivery centers for their new model 3. others went to Twitter searching for answers when they couldn't get through to anyone at Tesla now in this part they're saying the test is not only bad at building cars they're equally as bad at delivering them of course talking about things that happened in 2018 showing Twitter posts from 2018 were in fact right now we're in 2023 and there's publicly available data proving that this is a bunch of horse manure now right now the average wait time for Tesla in the US is 30 to 60 days that's it in fact the backlog from February 2022 to February 2023 have shrank from 400 000 vehicles to 100 thousand Vehicles Tesla has not only gotten better four times better at delivering cars in fact the current wait time of 30 to 60 days is probably one of the best we had but of course if you want to show a different picture you show four-year-old data the company only established 163 service centers spread across the US now this claim is actually somewhat on point what they're talking about is a very painful topic to a lot of Tesla owners there's not enough service centers in the US 100 if you live in Wichita Kansas your nearest options are all a state border and a two-hour Drive Away there's a lot of States who prevent who forbid Tesla from opening centers of service in their state because the law says that only the dealership can do that the manufacturer is not allowed to open its own service center they're doing it because this archaic old rules who are designed to protect dealerships prevent Tesla from actually providing services in those States so it's a regulatory problem that needs to be addressed it's not a 10 Tesla problem so the company is burning through their existing customers the group most likely to buy future Teslas which is certainly a problem now this segment sounds extremely logical right if Tesla is making bad cars and if Tesla can't deliver these cars on time it's losing its customer base very logical only problem is that Tesla is not building bad cars only problem is the Tesla is not having trouble delivering the cars only problem is that Tesla is not losing customers in fact is growing customers in 2022 the growth in Tesla sales was above 50 percent if Tesla was making cars that would have never been the case in fact if you compare quarterly sales at the final quarter of 2019 just three years ago to the quarterly sales in Q4 2022 the sales went up from a hundred thousand cars in the quarter to 400 000 cars in a quarter so Tesla quadrupled them out of quarterly cars for 2019 to 2022 it's a little bit of a misleading thing to assume when numbers are literally telling you that Tesla is growing at a massive pace so where this conclusion is coming from I honestly don't understand because the data simply proves otherwise compare a model y long range to a Mustang Machi premium and it has slightly better acceleration slightly longer range but a slightly higher price as far as distinguishable differences go there are a few now this is my favorite segment so far they're comparing the Tesla Model y to Ford Mach e and this is a little bit like comparing a spaceship to a potato it's not the right comparison but let's do it now they do stipulate the Tesla has better performance and better capacity of battery better performance of speed what not whatever right but they say Hey look it's close enough and the Ford Mac e is still a cheaper car well that's just factually incorrect I'm shocked that they haven't done the research because let's compare apples to apples let's look at the numbers following the price drop the model y long range is 55 000 they did this to meet the EV tax credit now the Ford Mark E comparable model which is the premium all-wheel drive e all-wheel drive is 60 two and a half thousand dollars it's more expensive than the model y long range not to mention that Tesla has better software better utility and the supercharging network it's a similar story of market with the model S the Lucid air nearly matches on acceleration beats it on range and is close enough in price that few in this market segment would bat an eye now this part is just comical they're comparing the model S to the Lucid air basically saying look the Lucid air is comparable probably even better and it's cheaper it starts at ninety thousand dollars the model S is a hundred five thousand dollar car but here's the kicker ask yourself one simple question why Lucid has manufacturing capacity of 7 000 vehicles in 2022 but it only sold 4 400 Vehicles why why was there not enough demand for This Magnificent vehicle that's so much better than the model is and even cheaper well it's because it's not really cheaper because the actual price of these Lucid cars starts at 90 000 but then it goes all the way up to 250 thousand for the premium version at the end of the day when you compare the best premium version of lucid at 250 000 to the one hundred and forty thousand dollars of the model S plaid this thing is literally half the price it has better software better full self driving better a supercharging network all the stuff we talked about in fact better engineering so who in his right mind would buy the Lucid Air at Double the price of the model S pled in fact I assume that anybody who must have bought this car has two holes drilled in the roof of the Lucid air for the ears you know the donkey ears because anybody who's done that is a poopless donkey Tesla is bested by Chevrolet whose base model Bowl EV starts for some fifteen thousand dollars less than the base model 3 while coming close on many specs while this part might be the most egregious of them all even worse than Lucid they're actually bringing up the Chevy bolt now look I'm not a hater of the Chevy bolt but ask yourself this simple question why apply to this beautiful yummy fifteen thousand dollar car such a great price so quality so value only sold 40 000 cars in 2022 well it might have something to do with the fact that in 2021 they recalled every single Chevy bolt made because it literally had a problem of spontaneously Catching Fire allegedly now I don't know what about you but even at fifteen thousand dollars I I don't know if I wanted to sit in the car that you know had that in its history so now that's just a joke obviously but more on this serious topic look even at fifty thousand dollar it's just not good enough of a car not enough features not enough utility it doesn't have the software no super charging I mean it's just a really poor very basic Bare Bones offering nobody really wants in the US well unique in their minimalistic design the broad Strokes of Tesla's product lineup is uniquely basic Min Marco sedan midmarket SUV upmarket sedan upmarket SUV what are you really saying here that their cars are too boring sedan remember that in the SUV what I mean look people obviously like it they sold 1.3 million last year based on Q4 numbers they're in route to sell 2 million cars in 2023. obviously people are okay with the design what's your point not to mention the fact that this is the Brilliance of Tesla the Simplicity of it look standardized Vehicles only four real Vehicles really only two real Vehicles the model 3 and the model Y and massive scale cheaper production faster ramp up cheaper maintenance way more data and you're preparing yourself for the robo taxi Network year after year after year it's never been a surprise who will Top the list of American vehicle sales it's the Ford F series it's always the Ford F series now I have to give them credit here because this segment is on point the truck segment in the US is the best category for every auto manufacturer and it is absolutely dominated by the F-150 which is an incredible car by the way now Tesla's not in it they're missing out on a lot of potential profit he's right but here's where the kicker is Tesla is a brand new company it's ramping up what do you expect them to make 57 different models in five years they have to pick their poison the semi the model is the model 3 the Roadster I can do all day cyber track I mean there's only so much they can do in five years Ford announced they just build an electric version the F-150 three years after that it entered production and today there are thousands of F-150 lightnings on the road and exactly zero Tesla pickups and yes Ford sold 15 000 units of the F-150 true good for them but just five days ago this article came out talking about Ford stopping sales completely until they can figure out why batteries on the F-150 lighting are catching fire this is what happens when you push out a product too fast before it's finished just to be the first in the market that's exactly what did not happen to Tesla the F-150 was merely joining a market already kicked off by the Henry V and rivian r1t meaning there are three manufacturers already in production working out the Kings ramping up to massive scale in 2023. how massive is the ramp up well GMC Hummers are about 850 units in in 2022 Riven has done a little bit of a better job with 24 000 units hardly a massive ramp up and I'm just going to leave you with this funny video of a GMC Hummer being charged from 49 to full and you're gonna absolutely love it the new GMC Hammer EV truck is the quickest charging vehicle on the market right now One charging 120 volt using the Hummer cable

want you to send this video to anybody who sends you the Wendover Productions video saying Hey look at Tesla it's so bad send them my video and then go have a chat with them and by the way this video took a long ass time to make if by any chance you haven't subscribed yet to the channel I'd really appreciate it if you can on your way out you know just slap the like button a little bit I hate asking yeah a little bit cringed out but hey it's YouTube we're playing the algorithm game thank you so much we'll see you next video,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,z8pDNlROZDw,2023-02-26T13:44:29Z,"""How Tesla Fumbled"" | Fair or Total Hit Piece?",Lucid,it's a similar story of market with the model S the Lucid air nearly matches on acceleration beats it on range and is close enough in price that few in this market segment would bat an eye now this part is just comical they're comparing the model S to the Lucid air basically saying look the Lucid air is comparable probably even better and it's cheaper it starts at ninety thousand dollars the model S is a hundred five thousand dollar car but here's the kicker ask yourself one simple question why Lucid has manufacturing capacity of 7 000 vehicles in 2022 but it only sold 4 400 Vehicles why why was there not enough demand for This Magnificent vehicle that's so much better than the model is and even cheaper well it's because it's not really cheaper because the actual price of these Lucid cars starts at 90 000 but then it goes all the way up to 250 thousand for the premium version at the end of the day when you compare the best premium version of lucid at 250 000 to the one hundred and forty thousand dollars of the model S plaid this thing is literally half the price it has better software better full self driving better a supercharging network all the stuff we talked about in fact better engineering so who in his right mind would buy the Lucid Air at Double the price of the model S pled in fact I assume that anybody who must have bought this car has two holes drilled in the roof of the Lucid air for the ears you know the donkey ears because anybody who's done that is a poopless donkey,1.0,-0.8
Tom Nash,z8pDNlROZDw,2023-02-26T13:44:29Z,"""How Tesla Fumbled"" | Fair or Total Hit Piece?",Chevrolet,Tesla is bested by Chevrolet whose base model Bowl EV starts for some fifteen thousand dollars less than the base model 3 while coming close on many specs while this part might be the most egregious of them all even worse than Lucid they're actually bringing up the Chevy bolt now look I'm not a hater of the Chevy bolt but ask yourself this simple question why apply to this beautiful yummy fifteen thousand dollar car such a great price so quality so value only sold 40 000 cars in 2022 well it might have something to do with the fact that in 2021 they recalled every single Chevy bolt made because it literally had a problem of spontaneously Catching Fire allegedly now I don't know what about you but even at fifteen thousand dollars I I don't know if I wanted to sit in the car that you know had that in its history so now that's just a joke obviously but more on this serious topic look even at fifty thousand dollar it's just not good enough of a car not enough features not enough utility it doesn't have the software no super charging I mean it's just a really poor very basic Bare Bones offering nobody really wants in the US,1.0,-0.9
Tom Nash,z8pDNlROZDw,2023-02-26T13:44:29Z,"""How Tesla Fumbled"" | Fair or Total Hit Piece?",Rivian,the F-150 was merely joining a market already kicked off by the Henry V and rivian r1t meaning there are three manufacturers already in production working out the Kings ramping up to massive scale in 2023. how massive is the ramp up well GMC Hummers are about 850 units in in 2022 Riven has done a little bit of a better job with 24 000 units hardly a massive ramp up and I'm just going to leave you with this funny video of a GMC Hummer being charged from 49 to full and you're gonna absolutely love it the new GMC Hammer EV truck is the quickest charging vehicle on the market right now One charging 120 volt using the Hummer cable right now it's about 6 pm on Tuesday and it says it'll be full by Saturday at 10 55 which is four plus days of charging that's byd no company globally produces more EVS they are now bigger than Tesla from a volume perspective now in this part we're seeing a manifestation of this recent trend on YouTube of hyping up byd now don't get me wrong byd is a fine company but the information is absolutely misleading it's factually incorrect they're talking about byd being the biggest EV producer in the world which is just plain wrong byd produced 900 000 electric vehicles in 2022 that's way less according to my math versus the 1.3 million of Tesla so that doesn't put them as number one I'm sorry I think what they're talking about is that byd also produced 950 000 hybrids at the same year now if you combine hybrids and electric vehicles and you lump it up together then Toyota which absolutely is not in the EV game is now becoming the world's number one Eevee producer see how ridiculous that is to include hybrids in these statistics so no so byd isn't the world's largest producers of electric vehicles by many stretch of the imagination they're good company but that's definitely false China is just such an immense Market that there are equivalent quality alternatives to Western products that are better suited to the needs and wants of Chinese consumers which leave Western managers dumbfounded so in Tesla's case inevitably their vehicles are going to be worse for Chinese consumers than the Homegrown Alternatives and unless they succeed where almost all their equivalents have failed they just won't be able to understand why though this segment logically makes sense because they're saying well look Chinese manufacturers are really good and they know what the Chinese public wants so Tesla would never be able to compete with it only problem is beta again proves otherwise in January 6th Tesla dropped prices on its offering in China guess what happened on February 3rd the Chinese passenger car Association the cpca actually showed that Tesla sold 66 000 china-made vehicles in January at 10.4 percent increase compared to year ago and an 18.4 increase compared to December 2022 and these numbers do not include exports it's just pure Chinese made and sold Vehicles local in China and by the way in January Tesla went up in market share as far as the Chinese market from six percent December to eight and a half percent January it's a two and a half percent market share rise in the month Tesla does not need 60 market dominance like it has in the US and we'll have for a while it doesn't need that it needs about 10 percent of the Chinese market to be just fine in 2016 after being dropped by its previous autonomous partner over safety concerns Tesla charted a new vision for full self-driving and quickly started selling a software package referred to as full self driving for three thousand dollars soon after now this part is really annoying because this is literally a misleading way to put what happened they're talking about the split in 2016 between mobile and Tesla and they're saying that mobile I dumped Tesla because of safety concerns now look you can call it safety concerns but it's very misleading if you don't give context the context is way more important here than you would think because what happened is we've done Elon Musk and the head guy of mobileye had a disagreement Elon says hey this thing eventually will be autonomous and the guy from mobile says hey what we're building will never be autonomous at least not in our lifetime this is always going to be a driver assist system they have this clash in where the development is supposed to go and they split up because they saw different Visions there were no safety issues or concerns or accidents it's absolutely a different vision for the system and so far with FSD beta versus the mobilized system it seems that Elon had a good point in fact when they split up this is what Alan Joshua the head guy of mobilize said no matter how you spin it autopilot is not designed for that it is a driver assistance system and not a driverless system simple but full self-driving didn't exactly mean full self driving and yes in this part they're talking about how FSD the full self-driving is not really full self driving well nobody is buying this feature because they think the car is autonomous I would struggle to find any purchaser of Tesla who purchased this Assuming he's getting an autonomous system full self-driving does not mean autonomous self-driving it's different things yes it's not perfect yes it's work in progress yes it has to get a lot better but nobody's getting full here and trust me having driven other cars Tesla's driver assist systems starting from the autopilot on all the way to the FSD beta from what I've seen from my friends is top-notch and unrivaled by any of the other car manufacturers including some of the guys who work with them in 2016. so the better part of a decade now it sold consumers on the promise failed to deliver made new promises failed to deliver and repeat and repeat and repeat the company has burned through its most promising customer base existing owners the reputation Tesla has earned as a company whose word means nothing has to have an impact now this segment is very strange because it has a lot of assumptions and when you assume you make an ass out of you and me but mainly because there's actual hard data that proves what they just said in the segment is absolute horse manure they're saying that people are getting disgruntled because they're not getting the FSD they were promised and that's where the quitting Tesla the brand loyalty et cetera Etc but there's literally a study by s n p globe level and in that study they found out that Tesla from 2021 to 2022 doubled doubled its brand loyalty from 30 to 63 percent in fact that 63 ranks it as the highest brand loyalty auto manufacturer in the world out of every single other auto manufacturer in the world so not only the Tesla clients are leaving or disgruntled they literally have the best brand loyalty in the freaking world how could you have not seen this research well musk might have been the Visionary behind the disruptive Behemoth today he's a liability now this part is a little bit strange because for a research-based channel that does research-based content for them to go ad hominem like this at Elon the personal attack is very weird calling him a liability now look I may not agree with everything he says or does but calling this dude a liability the guy who has built Tesla from the ground up that took it from nothing into two million cars next year with mountains of cash with massive growth Global adoption the guy who's changed the art industry I don't know if I can agree with that it just sounds like a very personal thing to say about somebody who has achieved a hell of a lot Tesla's competitive Advantage was built on scarcity for most of their history they were the only legitimate horse in the EV race they're claiming that the only Advantage for tested only mode is the scarcity and once the scarcity is gone when there's more competition then Tesla doesn't have an edge versus the other EVS in the market to me that's a little bit strange because you have absolutely ignored the supercharger network with 40 000 charges and 1800 stations and I know you know of its existence because two years ago you made a video saying that the supercharger network will never be enough to support EV adoption now ever since your video the network has doubled in size and definitely proven that it's more than capable to do so but somehow to absolutely never mention the supercharger Network as far as modes and an edge yikes meanwhile 4gm Volkswagen rivien and others are acting as the adults in the room now I can live with these guys not mentioning the supercharger network but calling Ford and GM the responsible adults in the room the companies that have a hundred billion dollars in debt each but hold on about the debt that has nothing to do with what he's talking about Ford and GM let's look at the numbers Ford and GM combined sold a hundred thousand electric vehicles in 2022. that's literally what Tesla does in the weekend not in the weekend in the month okay whatever I know I get it I get it so they sold a hundred thousand combined Tesla sells 1.3 million uh has the best brand loyalty in the business and somehow these guys are the responsible adults in the room now talking about VW that's a whole different discussion yes VW is definitely way better position and they did sell over 550 000 vehicles in 2022 electric vehicles but guess what in Germany there's a whole new thing coming up the German Factory is actually starting to ramp up in January Tesla sales in Germany shot up by 903 percent Tesla's fumble is what it could have been now let's see exactly how Tesla fumbled its future now we're talking about a company that's sitting on a pile of cash no debt 50 annual growth they went from 280 000 cars in 2018 to 2 million cars this year they'll make 2 million cars this year based on Q4 numbers they have the best margins in the business better than Toyota and we haven't even talked about the Cyber truck coming out the 25 000 car coming out we haven't talked about AI we haven't talked about energy none of these things so how exactly have Tesla fumbled its future I mean my guy how much faster and better would you expect Tesla to do from 2018 to 2023 I mean I don't understand this point and I'm really trying they could have been a giant they could have been 4gm and Chrysler so if in 10 years Tesla is anything but the biggest car manufacturer in America the explanation will likely be less about what it does over the next decade and more about what it didn't do oh come on give me a break if in 10 years grandpa doesn't have balls you'll be Grandma come on now for me the hardest part about this video was reading the pin comment they left basically saying well we know that Tesla cult will come for us because we criticize Tesla no no that's not the case I'm coming for you and a lot of people are coming for you because you put out lazy half-assed research with absolutely no objectivity to prove a point to shoehorn your point into a reality that doesn't fit what you're claiming now if you have done this video about VW or Alibaba or at T the result would have been the same yes it gets more cloud because it's Tesla but it's not because it's a cult it's because your video is riddled with inaccuracies and professional research and absolute horse manure of information to try and make you point even better you could have made an absolutely balanced video critiquing Tesla on the issues that it does have which might be quality which might be service aftermarket which might be Elon personally being polarizing all of this could have been made in a better way without you going all in and pushing it all the way in just to show how bad Tesla is I was disappointed I'm not going to stop watching this channel I think this channel puts out great content I think this is a one-off and I wish this video

its most promising customer base existing owners the reputation Tesla has earned as a company whose word means nothing has to have an impact now this segment is very strange because it has a lot of assumptions and when you assume you make an ass out of you and me but mainly because there's actual hard data that proves what they just said in the segment is absolute horse manure they're saying that people are getting disgruntled because they're not getting the FSD they were promised and that's where the quitting Tesla the brand loyalty et cetera Etc but there's literally a study by s n p globe level and in that study they found out that Tesla from 2021 to 2022 doubled doubled its brand loyalty from 30 to 63 percent in fact that 63 ranks it as the highest brand loyalty auto manufacturer in the world out of every single other auto manufacturer in the world so not only the Tesla clients are leaving or disgruntled they literally have the best brand loyalty in the freaking world how could you have not seen this research well musk might have been the Visionary behind the disruptive Behemoth today he's a liability now this part is a little bit strange because for a research-based channel that does research-based content for them to go ad hominem like this at Elon the personal attack is very weird calling him a liability now look I may not agree with everything he says or does but calling this dude a liability the guy who has built Tesla from the ground up that took it from nothing into two million cars next year with mountains of cash with massive growth Global adoption the guy who's changed the art industry I don't know if I can agree with that it just sounds like a very personal thing to say about somebody who has achieved a hell of a lot Tesla's competitive Advantage was built on scarcity for most of their history they were the only legitimate horse in the EV race they're claiming that the only Advantage for tested only mode is the scarcity and once the scarcity is gone when there's more competition then Tesla doesn't have an edge versus the other EVS in the market to me that's a little bit strange because you have absolutely ignored the supercharger network with 40 000 charges and 1800 stations and I know you know of its existence because two years ago you made a video saying that the supercharger network will never be enough to support EV adoption now ever since your video the network has doubled in size and definitely proven that it's more than capable to do so but somehow to absolutely never mention the supercharger Network as far as modes and an edge yikes meanwhile 4gm Volkswagen rivien and others are acting as the adults in the room now I can live with these guys not mentioning the supercharger network but calling Ford and GM the responsible adults in the room the companies that have a hundred billion dollars in debt each but hold on about the debt that has nothing to do with what he's talking about Ford and GM let's look at the numbers Ford and GM combined sold a hundred thousand electric vehicles in 2022. that's literally what Tesla does in the weekend not in the weekend in the month okay whatever I know I get it I get it so they sold a hundred thousand combined Tesla sells 1.3 million uh has the best brand loyalty in the business and somehow these guys are the responsible adults in the room now talking about VW that's a whole different discussion yes VW is definitely way better position and they did sell over 550 000 vehicles in 2022 electric vehicles but guess what in Germany there's a whole new thing coming up the German Factory is actually starting to ramp up in January Tesla sales in Germany shot up by 903 percent Tesla's fumble is what it could have been now let's see exactly how Tesla fumbled its future now we're talking about a company that's sitting on a pile of cash no debt 50 annual growth they went from 280 000 cars in 2018 to 2 million cars this year they'll make 2 million cars this year based on Q4 numbers they have the best margins in the business better than Toyota and we haven't even talked about the Cyber truck coming out the 25 000 car coming out we haven't talked about AI we haven't talked about energy none of these things so how exactly have Tesla fumbled its future I mean my guy how much faster and better would you expect Tesla to do from 2018 to 2023 I mean I don't understand this point and I'm really trying they could have been a giant they could have been 4gm and Chrysler so if in 10 years Tesla is anything but the biggest car manufacturer in America the explanation will likely be less about what it does over the next decade and more about what it didn't do oh come on give me a break if in 10 years grandpa doesn't have balls you'll be Grandma come on now for me the hardest part about this video was reading the pin comment they left basically saying well we know that Tesla cult will come for us because we criticize Tesla no no that's not the case I'm coming for you and a lot of people are coming for you because you put out lazy half-assed research with absolutely no objectivity to prove a point to shoehorn your point into a reality that doesn't fit what you're claiming now if you have done this video about VW or Alibaba or at T the result would have been the same yes it gets more cloud because it's Tesla but it's not because it's a cult it's because your video is riddled with inaccuracies and professional research and absolute horse manure of information to try and make you point even better you could have made an absolutely balanced video critiquing Tesla on the issues that it does have which might be quality which might be service aftermarket which might be Elon personally being polarizing all of this could have been made in a better way without you going all in and pushing it all the way in just to show how bad Tesla is I was disappointed I'm not going to stop watching this channel I think this channel puts out great content I think this is a one-off and I wish this video would not have been done I definitely do not want you to go there and leave hate on their video by no means do not do it while not looking for drama but I want you to send this video to anybody who sends you the Wendover Productions video saying Hey look at Tesla it's so bad send them my video and then go have a chat with them and by the way this video took a long ass time to make if by any chance you haven't subscribed yet to the channel I'd really appreciate it if you can on your way out you know just slap

Tom Nash,IpzQh6F7kLk,2023-02-16T16:04:17Z,New Data Shows Early Signs of Accelerating Inflation,Tesla,now talking about paying attention to words instead of actions I just I want to remind you that when this year started everybody were talking about the fact that Tesla is hitting in the demand wall not enough Tesla demand does not cancel enough cars everybody was basically saying I'm gonna wait for Tesla to come down from 100 to 70. basically I just want to remind you that this was 98 ago now I don't know if Tesla comes back down maybe goes up I don't know I don't care but I do love the fundamentals ever since that happened the beginning of the year we had great earnings and when I say great earnings I mean that's an understatement now we're finding out that Tesla just ran out out of Model wise in the US you can't get a motorbike this right now until April why well they just literally sold out everybody bought one why because Tesla has a demand problem but not the kind of demand problem that these mother lovers were talking about they have a demand problem and the fact that there's too much demand not enough cars same in China by the way China demand is going through the roof for Tesla as well now I know byd sells a lot of cars in China but there's no demand problem for Tesla as you can see right now once Tesla drop price is a little bit back from the increase they had basically they sold out of everything and they literally had to raise prices again in the US and China China and the US actually had price increase blackout because they literally just sold out,0.98,0.9

Tom Nash,SBGOEPFLKn8,2023-02-15T15:07:14Z,Tesla: Fair Value of $370?,Tesla,Twitter this tweet Tesla catalyst for February 15 2023 and he goes through all of this but the bottom line here I want you to pay attention to is that 370 dollar Target price for the next six to 12 months 370 dollars now obviously he's talking about investor day the EV credit the deliveries the FSD the mega pack the buyback that hasn't been confirmed yet and I don't think it's happening the Twitter Co announcement that cyber truck which is also questionable when the compact car which has not been announced yet there's a lot of Wishful Thinking here there's a lot of good information here good Catalyst here but this is just an estimate so 370 dollars currently the share price is about 209 210 dollars for the past month the Tesla Q have not had a good month let's put it this way you know how they say about basketball Shooters well he didn't have a good day I think this the queue did not have a good career anyway so the question is how legitimate is this price can we do anything with it 370 based on Gary black can and we stress test this and I would say yes we can and we will so let's do it right now let's check how much this is true let's do a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or legit test on Gary Black's 370 Target price so the first thing we want to take a look at obviously we will use stock MVP for this now the first thing we want to use is actually look at what other analysts are saying I just want to remind you Gary black is saying 370 dollars this is the stock MVP analyst chart it Aggregates all the analysts that are basically covering Tesla just to show you the different Target prices you have the low Target price another 26 dollars right here you have the high Target price 526 dollars right here but mainly what's important is that you have the average analyst Target price here which is 327 dollars so Gary black is above that but not miles above it obviously they all give it a plus five five strong buy etc etc but the average analyst Target price here is 327 which is very close to Gary Gary is above it but I mean it's not out of the realm of the current coverage of analyst but then again analysts in general is just one thing to look at they get it wrong a lot and somebody who got it wrong a lot myself volunteer I'm just kidding I love volunteer I mean it's just one thing to look at now let's move on to a little bit more of a I would say objective data here let's take a look at this thing here so this thing here before we will run the full DCF we will run the full evaluation model I'll tell you my Target price in a second I will I promise but the first thing you have to understand what's under the hood of the company you have to understand the fundamentals of the company that's really important and also it's important because that's the one thing I don't like about um I guess other tools I used to use in the past is you look at fundamentals you can't see the history it really like it's a struggle to go back and look what the trend is now on stock we built it so it can actually see the history so for example revenues for test is 81.5 billion dollars but if you look at revenues just five years ago there were 12 billion dollars so clearly you can see the trend here right from 12 billion to 81 billion in five years it's 600 up and actually listed here so you can see that the revenues are more than impressive the growth for the past year was 51 percent that's important remember that number 51 the growth number is going to be a huge huge element of our valuation not the solar element but a huge element now selling and general expenses basically this is what I call the fat this is the this is usually where you can trim the most cost if you really were adamant about it now as revenues grew 600 of the past five years SG a grew about 60 percent over the past five years so you can see here that this company is generating 600 more sales with only 60 growth in this GNA in fact their SG a have dropped 12 and a half percent the cost drop over the past year when they grew 50 sales by 12 percent again these are really impressive numbers now on the operating expensive side which is where you aggregate all the things that you have to do to generate these revenues including sgna by the way it's up 1.2 percent of the past year so let me just be clear so Tesla increase operating expenses by 1.2 percent and increase sales by 51.35 I mean you can't find a lot of companies that can give you numbers like that over the past five years again Opex is up operating expenses are 86 percent versus a 600 increase in Revenue I think the efficiency question here is answered it's an extremely efficient company with video game level numbers I mean this is insane this is like playing railroad Tycoon on easy mode um now one important thing here is looking at the increase in ebitda increase in ebitda is super important for our DCF coming up in a second we have a DCF calculator here on stock MVP which we'll use in just a second so Evita is at 17.5 billion dollars which is in self-summing is about to make my brain explode I mean 17 billion in ibida and by the way ebitda is pretty much how much the company is making before the accountant [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] start finagling the numbers so ebitda is where I think it's the most important part but net income is also important basically EB That Grew 85 percent of past year so 85 percent ebitda growth is where we at now in DCF we'll use that number we're actually bring it down a little bit to be more conservative now look at this this is video game numbers growth over the past five years is a ten thousand percent so people talk about Tesla as a meme stock as a hype stock retail stock my guy if you're heading on Tesla it's a 10 000 increase in EBT over the past five years I mean that's video game numbers so 17.5 billion of Ibiza net income is 12.6 billion dollars again 660 net income increase over the past five years that's insane with Opex up only 86 so imagine increasing operating expenses by 80 and then increasing net income which is the absolute bottom line with my 660 absolutely insane Capital expenditures are not small for a company like Tesla mind you the supercharger network is a super Capital intensive business so seven billion dollars it's a lot of capex but it's going to building that mode by the way the White House is all gone home about eliminating that mode and having test open it up for the public but guess what that's what Tesla actually wants because it's going to generate Tesla a lot more money but that's a whole different video so basically we have capex here at 7.2 billion growth of the past year is 10 so we're gonna use that 10 Again capex growth you remember that number 10 we're going to use it for our DCF free cash flow oh my goodness 7.6 billion 117 increase in free cash for the past year 282 increase in free cash flow over the past five years you started to see the trend here this is a very impressive company financially from a fundamental standpoint not of a hype not of a price action um cash is 16.3 billion again super impressive here total debt it says here 3 billion but let's okay let's say three screw it let's say three although we can argue about that three basically more than four times more cash than debt they can literally repay the debt right now be with zero debt and 13 billion in cash so this is pretty much this is a wash a liability is 37 billion assets 82 billion so double literally double um than assets and liabilities I mean this is absolutely insane okay so the next thing we have to do is run a proper DCF discounted cash flow valuation of Tesla based on its current numbers now we have here on stock MVP DCF calculator so you don't have to basically screw around with an Excel spreadsheet and you'll break your fingers trying to figure out how to do it everything is here in fact you can automate the whole process just by clicking populate and calculate you can also manually change all of these things but basically in this example we'll just use the auto populate feature so as you saw earlier ebitda growth may I remind you was way way higher than 10 lets go back to the cards and let's see so in the cards ebitda growth was 80 five percent year over year eighty five percent so in our example we'll just use fifty percent well let's just use fifty percent which is way below 85 just to be cautious now a capex growth was ten percent let's keep it 10 depression of a decision you can also do ten percent and we're going to do populate and then we go long-term growth rate four percent discount rate ten percent calculate now we scroll up and we find out what's going on so basically the DCF valuation we just got is 447 dollars for this company 447 which means it's undervalued by 113 and 81 cents now we can actually make this a little bit tougher you can do sensitivity analysis on these DCF models we have a stock MVP and you can do 12 discount rate which means the stock will be cheaper basically let's say interest rates are going up so you want to have a higher discount rate to reflect more risk fine calculate okay now we're getting 323 dollars basically the exact number all the analysts are getting so now we know where the majority of the analysts are the majority of the analysts are basically saying hey this is a 50 growth rate on ibida and basically at 12 discount rate four percent Perpetual rate so this is why if you go back to analyst then you see that on the other side three 327 327 we just got what we just got 323. so now you know that the analysts are basically here that's why this is the average price because this is what Tesla is actually worth now Gary black is saying 370 which means he either bits on the discount rate will be lower because of lower interest rates or he thinks that the growth rate is going to be higher so we can do that we can live 12 and we can put 60 percent and maybe the growth rate which is still below what they're actually growing at and then you get 450 so Gary Breck is probably in that area as well now beyond the DCF you want to have another kind of built and suspender system this is another tool we have called the SCF CEF tool you can actually evaluate the stock here by a multitude of elements as you can see they're on the screen right here I've already populated it basically it has conservative valuations optimistic valuations and current valuation and then you get the five year Target price and you get the bear case the medium case and the optimistic case I've already populated here on the screen you can see Revenue growth everything is actually on the conservative side below the current numbers on the optimistic side it's right about the current numbers give or take so this is what we get and I actually did this just a second ago I don't want you to be waiting for me to fill this out it's on the screen you can pause it and look at it in a second basically what I'm getting is for the five-year conservative which means way below the current numbers four hundred dollars per share which is an 89 90 upside for five years at the bear case at the medium case 809 at the optimistic case 1200 which is an 840 percent on the upside now look these are insane numbers and you might say well Tom this is super expensive I mean how can you say 1200 so look Peter Lynch talked about it multiple times great companies you probably have like 20 years to buy into them and still make a hell of a lot of money I'm not saying 480 but I'm saying like if this is a generational company they're actually going to do what Gary black says at least half the stuff he's saying here they're worth 300 no doubt about it I think Gary black is definitely based on our little test here on stock MVP has a good point,1.0,1.0
Tom Nash,SBGOEPFLKn8,2023-02-15T15:07:14Z,Tesla: Fair Value of $370?,Gary Black,good morning everybody we have an important announcement Gary black about four hours ago in the middle of the night I don't know what he was doing up that late Twitter this tweet Tesla catalyst for February 15 2023 and he goes through all of this but the bottom line here I want you to pay attention to is that 370 dollar Target price for the next six to 12 months 370 dollars now obviously he's talking about investor day the EV credit the deliveries the FSD the mega pack the buyback that hasn't been confirmed yet and I don't think it's happening the Twitter Co announcement that cyber truck which is also questionable when the compact car which has not been announced yet there's a lot of Wishful Thinking here there's a lot of good information here good Catalyst here but this is just an estimate so 370 dollars currently the share price is about 209 210 dollars for the past month the Tesla Q have not had a good month let's put it this way you know how they say about basketball Shooters well he didn't have a good day I think this the queue did not have a good career anyway so the question is how legitimate is this price can we do anything with it 370 based on Gary black can and we stress test this and I would say yes we can and we will so let's do it right now let's check how much this is true let's do a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or legit test on Gary Black's 370 Target price I just want to remind you Gary black is saying 370 dollars Gary is above it but I mean it's not out of the realm of the current coverage of analyst now Gary black is saying 370 which means he either bits on the discount rate will be lower because of lower interest rates or he thinks that the growth rate is going to be higher so we can do that we can live 12 and we can put 60 percent and maybe the growth rate which is still below what they're actually growing at and then you get 450 so Gary Breck is probably in that area as well I think Gary black is definitely based on our little test here on stock MVP has a good point,0.9,0.7

important basically EB That Grew 85 percent of past year so 85 percent ebitda growth is where we at now in DCF we'll use that number we're actually bring it down a little bit to be more conservative now look at this this is video game numbers growth over the past five years is a ten thousand percent so people talk about Tesla as a meme stock as a hype stock retail stock my guy if you're heading on Tesla it's a 10 000 increase in EBT over the past five years I mean that's video game numbers so 17.5 billion of Ibiza net income is 12.6 billion dollars again 660 net income increase over the past five years that's insane with Opex up only 86 so imagine increasing operating expenses by 80 and then increasing net income which is the absolute bottom line with my 660 absolutely insane Capital expenditures are not small for a company like Tesla mind you the supercharger network is a super Capital intensive business so seven billion dollars it's a lot of capex but it's going to building that mode by the way the White House is all gone home about eliminating that mode and having test open it up for the public but guess what that's what Tesla actually wants because it's going to generate Tesla a lot more money but that's a whole different video so basically we have capex here at 7.2 billion growth of the past year is 10 so we're gonna use that 10 Again capex growth you remember that number 10 we're going to use it for our DCF free cash flow oh my goodness 7.6 billion 117 increase in free cash for the past year 282 increase in free cash flow over the past five years you started to see the trend here this is a very impressive company financially from a fundamental standpoint not of a hype not of a price action um cash is 16.3 billion again super impressive here total debt it says here 3 billion but let's okay let's say three screw it let's say three although we can argue about that three basically more than four times more cash than debt they can literally repay the debt right now be with zero debt and 13 billion in cash so this is pretty much this is a wash a liability is 37 billion assets 82 billion so double literally double um than assets and liabilities I mean this is absolutely insane okay so the next thing we have to do is run a proper DCF discounted cash flow valuation of Tesla based on its current numbers now we have here on stock MVP DCF calculator so you don't have to basically screw around with an Excel spreadsheet and you'll break your fingers trying to figure out how to do it everything is here in fact you can automate the whole process just by clicking populate and calculate you can also manually change all of these things but basically in this example we'll just use the auto populate feature so as you saw earlier ebitda growth may I remind you was way way higher than 10 let's go back to the cards and let's see so in the cards ebitda growth was 80 five percent year over year eighty five percent so in our example we'll just use fifty percent well let's just use fifty percent which is way below 85 just to be cautious now a capex growth was ten percent let's keep it 10 depression of a decision you can also do ten percent and we're going to do populate and then we go long-term growth rate four percent discount rate ten percent calculate now we scroll up and we find out what's going on so basically the DCF valuation we just got is 447 dollars for this company 447 which means it's undervalued by 113 and 81 cents now we can actually make this a little bit tougher you can do sensitivity analysis on these DCF models we have a stock MVP and you can do 12 discount rate which means the stock will be cheaper basically let's say interest rates are going up so you want to have a higher discount rate to reflect more risk fine calculate okay now we're getting 323 dollars basically the exact number all the analysts are getting so now we know where the majority of the analysts are the majority of the analysts are basically saying hey this is a 50 growth rate on ibida and basically at 12 discount rate four percent Perpetual rate so this is why if you go back to analyst then you see that on the other side three 327 327 we just got what we just got 323. so now you know that the analysts are basically here that's why this is the average price because this is what Tesla is actually worth now Gary black is saying 370 which means he either bits on the discount rate will be lower because of lower interest rates or he thinks that the growth rate is going to be higher so we can do that we can live 12 and we can put 60 percent and maybe the growth rate which is still below what they're actually growing at and then you get 450 so Gary Breck is probably in that area as well now beyond the DCF you want to have another kind of built and suspender system this is another tool we have called the SCF CEF tool you can actually evaluate the stock here by a multitude of elements as you can see they're on the screen right here I've already populated it basically it has conservative valuations optimistic valuations and current valuation and then you get the five year Target price and you get the bear case the medium case and the optimistic case I've already populated here on the screen you can see Revenue growth everything is actually on the conservative side below the current numbers on the optimistic side it's right about the current numbers give or take so this is what we get and I actually did this just a second ago I don't want you to be waiting for me to fill this out it's on the screen you can pause it and look at it in a second basically what I'm getting is for the five-year conservative which means way below the current numbers four hundred dollars per share which is an 89 90 upside for five years at the bear case at the medium case 809 at the optimistic case 1200 which is an 840 percent on the upside now look these are insane numbers and you might say well Tom this is super expensive I mean how can you say 1200 so look Peter Lynch talked about it multiple times great companies you probably have like 20 years to buy into them and still make a hell of a lot of money I'm not saying 480 but I'm saying like if this is a generational company they're actually going to do what Gary black says at least half the stuff he's saying here they're worth 300 no doubt about it I think Gary black is definitely based on our little test here on stock MVP has a good point,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,3mExl2j7q18,2023-02-14T12:44:15Z,"Palantir Stock: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Truth",Palantir,I gotta be honest with you I feel a little bit strange yesterday didn't really feel like getting punched in the nuts like I usually feel after palantir earnings which is a very peculiar feeling to be honest but I can get used to it now in this video I'm gonna do a deep dive long format of the entire palantir earnings now if you're not into palantir this video isn't for you skip to the next one it's okay now if you are into palantir we're gonna do a deep dive but without over geeking and over detailing the numbers I don't want to get lost in the numbers I want to keep it simple but deep and detailed now hopefully we can achieve that and this video is going to be a little bit longer so sit back relax and let's do it so the first thing I want to mention is what just happened post earnings obviously post earnings the company had a blast of it after hours with you know the share price spiking I'm assuming the same thing will continue in the pre-market it's currently 5 a.m so I don't really know exactly what's going on the pre-market media do I care and I'll explain in a second why this point is coming don't worry now what happened yesterday is basically palantir beat EPS earnings per share and it actually hit Gap generally accepted accounting principle profitability so these two elements basically Spike the share price basically this all comes down to one thing which is Wall Street really loves performance and execution on the financial side once you hit EPS once you actually hit Gap profitability you'll get a nice little bonus that's okay now I wasn't particularly focused on these two things although I did care I had a whole list of my own which I posted on Twitter and it included seven items I'm gonna redo all the seven items to tell you what I was looking at number one obviously Gap profitability I care about Gap probability I actually want to know that the company is heading the right direction but it's only one out of seven item the second item I was looking at is grow growth guidance how much the company is guiding for in the financial year 2023 we're going to talk about that because not all is Rosie in that section at all but more on that later number three is commercial sector growth I believe that the growth engine for the company is the commercial sector so I wanted to see the commercial sector numbers in this section we obviously check the mark no problem at all exactly what I wanted to see number four what's going on with us versus EU this company has a major Achilles heel as far as almost virtually no business in the EU compared to the US did it get better I want to see the company becoming a little bit more Global obviously they're not going to go into China we know why but at least in the EU front with everything that happened with Ukraine with the whole de-globalization I expected to see a little bit more out of the EU um not necessarily got what I was looking for there number five stock based compensation reduction I think we already had the big peak of hiring all the sales force to actually go after the commercial Market I'm expecting to see a little bit of a decline if not more of a decline in SBC stock base comp we definitely got that more on that in a second number six net dollar retention very important to me to see that the company isn't losing ground as far as charging existing customers more I'm talking about that as well I have a whole section dedicated to that again not always Rosie there as you can see as you can see I'm not into fluffing this company I'm not here to basically say that everything was great and you know you should just go all out there's plenty of channels to do that on this channel you get an objective view the good and the bad if you want to be actually a good investor you have to look at the good and the bad and be able to recognize both so exactly what we're doing in this video and of course number seven I wanted the company to present the data in a little bit of more straightforward transparent matter without all this nonsense like aggregating U.S business and of course they didn't do it and we had to dig through this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] again sorry for my language but it is what it is it might be a company culture thing as far as presentation I'm not getting caught up in that too much now talking about the company mindset leads me to the second point in the company mindset section I've seen a lot of improvement in these specific earnings and in fact the first thing I was impressed with with Alex carp's ability to basically be concise direct answer to the point no philosophical stuff I think it's a really good change as far Alex goes it shows a lot of understanding as far as what the market is looking for from SEO of a multi-billion dollar company and I was actually impressed I gave him an eight for his performance communication skills I know that's not easy for him but in fact he was actually so self-aware that he made a little joke about it basically saying well I want to go on this philosophical tangent but I know you guys hate it so I won and I thought that was actually pretty brilliant now leaving Alex carp aside because this was a nuanced thing nobody really cares about that let's talk about the most important thing here this earnings call was the first time where I actually felt that the company was focused on Gap profitability just as much as it was focused on growth in fact probably even more in gap of stability this time than the previous quarter shows me that the company is actually speaking in that language that institutional investors are looking for institutional investors will not invest in palantir at least not in huge amounts until we see Gap profitability and the management finally understands it it's a sign of maturity it's a sign of basically them talking the language institutional investors are speaking does it mean we have a 60 institutional ownership tomorrow probably not but it definitely seems that the management understands the channel change the frequency change they have to talk the language of the institutional investors and actually show they care about Gap profitability they can no longer do this oh we only care about growth you know Screw profitability they've not they've done it before and the market punished them for these statements so to speak and this time they actually Dodge the bullet and spoke very to the point I think that the big move here in this share price and I mentioned this earlier was the fact that the company hit for the first time in history Gap or stability I mean that's huge milestone it came two years early because last time we spoke to Alex carp basically he spoke to us he said 2025 so hitting gapper's ability two years early is very very strong as far as share price performance as far as institutional participation I think this is a huge milestone for the company does it mean we have to start celebrating and getting into Euphoria no no no price action in Euphoria post gap of stability is understandable there's a lot of idiots out there but you should not be one of them you have to be objective look at the good look at the bad and actually assess the company for what it did not for what you think it might basically getting into this formal because of price action right now is a huge mistake there's plenty of time to buy volunteer shares if you want to do so in the next two years there's no rush definitely not in the middle of a formal cycle which I hope we don't get now how I personally handle this and again I think psychology is a huge part of being a long-term investor in fact I would say critical part is look I didn't get down on myself and I didn't get depressed when the share price was six dollars I'm not gonna get high right now on this nine dollar share price or 10 share price just because of price action it's meaningless to me when it's down to six it's meaningless to me when it's up to 10 whatever it may be I care about long-term success I think that this is a 30 40 50 stock in a few years that's the only thing I'm focused I don't care about these price wings and making any decisions based on that making any kind of euphoric statements based on that is plain stupidity you have to stay objective you have to stay grounded don't get distracted by this nonsense now to summarize before we go deep into the numbers the earnings were good they were not brilliant I think there's a lot of places for improvement there's a lot of work to be done there's a lot of weaknesses but they were definitely better and in the right direction I think there's way more work to be done here and talking about that my main concerns are basically the fact that Revenue growth this year was actually not that high at least compared to last year last year we did 40 percent this year 24. I mean that's really a huge decline in acceleration rate still growing at 24 is impressive but given last year at 40 growth that's a huge concern and I'll talk about why this is happening I I think I know why this is happening but let's hold off on that for a second the other thing which I had a huge issue with is the decline in net dollar retention now net dollar retention is basically how much existing clients are paying you more this year compared to what they paid you last year last year palantir had 131 percent net door retention which is very good this year 115 Network retention so they're declining on net door retention now this is a huge problem because if you're expecting to hit 30 keger you have to be able to charge your existing customers more every single year it's 10 times easier to upsell an existing client versus to cold call and recruit a brand a new client so losing net dollar retention ground is a huge concern if they are to hit that 30 keger it's just another thing I'm really concerned about another point I'm concerned about and we'll get to the good parts in a second but I want to start with the concerns is the fact that cash operations is down last year they did 330 million this year 220. it's a huge decline operating margin is down from 31 last year 31 last year to 22 this year now there's a lot of excuses to be made here obviously the company is expanding there's more low ticket item sales there's more freemiums there's more of recruiting going on and obviously that hurts the margins I get it but still I don't expect to see such a huge decline from 31 to 22 on operating margins within a year that's another huge concern now at this point having heard all my concerns you might ask yourself a simple question well Tom are you still bullish on palantir with all these concerns yes in fact I'm more bullish than ever and I think the results were good but I showed you all these concerns to show you that not everything is Rosy a lot of people on social media on Twitter are hyping up about the share price they're overlooking these weaknesses you have to be aware of them even as a bullish investor it's super super important I'm not here to fluff the stock I'm here to give you the facts good or bad now look let's move on to what I like about this company what I like about these earnings and what I like about it Beyond just a gap of stability we have talked about it everybody has beaten this topic to death let's talk about what I like beyond that now number one I like the customer growth customer growth is up 55 year over year it's absolutely insane very impressive but you still have to remember we did just mention that the net door retention is only 115 this year it's extremely low compared to last year 130 it's way lower than the company like snowflake but on its own Standalone basis if I tell you hey I have a SAS software is a software business and I'm having a 115 Network retention it's not a bad result it's just not as good as it used to be and not as good as we expected but getting more clients through the door is the first step of fixing that so 55 growth in customer account is good it's also a huge mitigation to the concentration risk you never want to have too much business in the hands of two little clients that's a huge risk now talking about that palantir's current top 20 clients comprise about 50 percent of its entire Revenue so 50 of volunteers entire revenue is sitting in the hands of just 20 clients that's a huge concentration risk however those 20 clients the best 20 clients of the company have increased their spend by 13 on average from 44 to 50 million dollars per client per year in this current year which is really impressive I mean Corporate America mainly doesn't spend 50 million a year for a service provider unless they have the good stuff so the increase from 44 to 50 million per client per year on the top 20 clients shows me their product is that good and even better now the second item I want to talk about is stock based compensation that's one of my specific Focus points I'm happy to report that although stock waste composition is still fairly high it's down 27 year over year which is a step in the right direction now the next point I'm really excited about is the deal flow palantir increased their deals closed this year by more than 60 percent from 600 to 980 deals closed just in the entire year of 2022 that's a huge increase that shows me that their business development that the sales force is actually doing its thing which is what I was concerned about because we didn't know how good these sales people were so that's another important Milestone we have to be aware of as a positive signal now let's talk about commercial growth now commercial growth is very impressive 67 which is something to be celebrated for sure however what I'm still missing here is a push of the EU side now the EU side is pretty much non-existent I love how the growth in the US is absolutely insane but the EU is still the Achilles heel of this company we don't have to go to China there's plenty of business to be had in the EU and palleteer has to try and diversify a little bit outside the U.S currently the entire Commercial Business is primarily in the US and that's another huge risk it's concentrated we have plant concentration problems and geographical concentration problems that need to be fixed but then again 67 is very impressive but if you look at the entire commercial growth it's 29 that's what happens when you have zero percent or close to zero percent at other geographies now the one thing I want to talk about is the government now government you know it's always been kind of the anchor of this company a lot of government clients they're very sticky but they're actually increasing the government revenue this was the first year in the company's history they crossed the one billion dollar Revenue per year from government business it's insane it's very very impressive however you have to be aware that the growth is not going to come from government government comprises about half of this company's business give or take but the growth in the government side is only about 13 it's a lot slower it is stickier but it's a lot slower than the commercial side it's another thing to be aware and I guess the most impressive part about this company is that somehow sales are up 24 whether you think this number is high or not it's still an impressive number on a standalone basis so sales are up 24 but sales expenses sgna is down seven percent but at this point you might say well Tom that's because they're paying everybody with stocks well it's kind of true but stock based composition is also down 27 so the company is generating 24 more sales but it's paying less than stock base count by 27 and paying less in SG a by seven percent that's very impressive and let's talk about the weak guidance we got for next year not very impressed by that 2.2 billion give or take based on the year we just finished with 1.9 billion so it's a very very cautious guidance very very meager why well there's two reasons here which well there's really three reasons I hope the third one is not legit reason number one they're just sandbagging it they're basically giving us slow guidance so they can beat it definitely possible they're not the first one to try this method in fact they have before and as you can see in this guidance it worked for them last year the lower guidance and this is what we got this year a huge spike in the share price maybe that's the case maybe it's because they think that next year macroeconomically is going to be horrific and they're adjusting to that maybe possibly maybe it's a combination of both I don't know there is a third reason is because their business is trash but at this point I tend to think that this reason is not so valid but if it is then that would be a good reason to lower your guidance again I don't know I'm not a fortune teller the other one which was a little bit more serious started by Alex carp hinting at possible M A at possible acquisition if planetir will get acquired by a big company obviously there's going to be a huge spike in the share price and all that good stuff and I think it's partially responsible for that share run up we saw I'm just here to tell you that I think it's highly unlikely that palantir would ever be a target of an m a of emergency acquisition activity for two reasons number one it has a class F shares which gives unlimited lifetime veto to Alex carp and Peter Thiel and a lot of other guys and the other part is their government business is dependent on them not doing business in China any acquisition that you can think of who would buy palantir that doesn't have business in China that doesn't have Chinese exposure because in that case older government side is going to the toilet and they become half as valuable as they are right now so unless they can find a strategic purchaser that has nothing to do with China which is very hard in this day and age I think this is highly unlikely I think it's a lot of hot smoke air to kind of pump it up a little bit I don't take this seriously at all,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,U3eM9gD3n10,2023-02-08T16:43:07Z,Michael Burry’s Stock Market Prediction For 2023,Tesla,so it seems that Tesla is finished done kaput mid gurnished at least if you look at mainstream media now you will come across a few articles today explaining how Tesla's having major problems in China citing a 36 drop and deliveries in January versus the previous month of December 2022 and the problem is it's complete horse manure I'll explain now the number is accurate Tesla had 36 less delivers in January compared to the previous month they delivered 28 000 cars instead of 42 000 cars that is true only problem is that the entire Chinese market delivered less cars I don't know why I said rest less cars in January versus December in fact Tesla's market share went up from six and a half percent of market share in December to eight percent market share in January so the fewer deliveries were relatively more in January than they were in December in fact it was a whole Chinese January thing a holiday the beginning of the year etc etc so be careful when you read these headlines it's usually some manipulative crap basically designed to take shots at Tesla Tesla is actually increasing its market share in China month over month so there's nothing to worry about I just want to come out here and point it out before you read this nonsense,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,U3eM9gD3n10,2023-02-08T16:43:07Z,Michael Burry’s Stock Market Prediction For 2023,Michael Burry,now I do want to talk about some crazy stuff going on right now in the market before we get to Michael Berry and yes he's back he's back on Twitter and he has a very interesting warning I'm not just being cynical you actually want to actually and why what's going on with my conversationalism today can't talk he actually has a very interesting warning but before we get to Michael Berry and my speech in capabilities I don't know what's going on today let's talk about Michael Berry so Michael Berry is back on Twitter congratulations I predicted this I said he'll be back and he's back better than ever he actually put it out saying and this time it's different and he posted this picture now the picture basically correlates the S P 500 to the federal funds rate during the stretch of time between 2000 and 2002 you all know what happened in 2000 you know the.com crash as it's coined right basically what Michael Burr is trying to say here I'm going to try to decipher what he's saying um number one he's referring I believe to a very famous book that was released right after the 2008 crash called This Time It's Different by rhaegov and Reinhardt the book basically talks about how before every crash politicians analysts economists they all think that this time it's going to be different and yet every time you know they experience the same thing so he's referring to the book with that phrase but what he's showing is a very interesting chart and it tells a lot about what he's thinking here I think it's a very serious warning and it has Merit I don't know if he's right or wrong but here's what he's saying the one thing I can tell you is obviously he's comparing this current market to the 2000 market so he's basically saying what we have right now this insanity is basically what happened in 2000. it's the same setup now I don't know if I agree to that or not but that's what he's saying he's also saying and that's very important that they whole market crash of 2000 actually took about two years look at the chart the collapse is going on from 2000 all the way to 2002 so it didn't happen overnight so there's plenty of time for this to play out also what he's saying is look at the volatility these two years of a crash were plagued with a lot of up and down up and down movement so there's a lot of crazy rallies in between but the trend will continue it's basically saying beware of these rallies these are crazy rallies that are basically going on in the middle but the trend will be the same in 2000 2002. um the other thing he wants you to look at and I think it's also very interesting is look guys the Fed was reducing the rate which is true look at the chart the FED started this 2000 time with six percent interest and then by the end of this period the interest rates was about two percent so the FED went from six percent to two percent interest while the S P 500 dropped from 1300 to 800 at the same time so basically the fact of the matter is the Fed pivot the reduction in interest rates is not always a magical cure for market crash that's what he's worrying about very interesting warning I'm not gonna dunk on Michael Berry I know we can all make the jokes about how we predicted 50 out of the last two crashes but this is a very interesting warning and I believe it holds a lot of Merit and it's worth listening to,1.0,0.6

Tom Nash,iqXJrmDdCtI,2023-02-03T14:05:32Z,Things are about to go CRAZY!,Tesla,we will talk about the Cyber truck sighting. another thing I want to talk about is cyber truck so there was a cyber truck sighting and it is a polarizing vehicle. I personally live a lot I think it's an absolute Beauty and I'm sure it's going to sell like hot cakes but a lot of classic pickup truck fans they will have a hard time getting used to this new look but hey cars in the 50s look a lot different than cars in the 70s cars in the 90s look a lot different than cars in the 70s etc etc etc this is the evolution of the truck of the pickup truck in my opinion I think it's a matter of time until people get used to it obviously the product is going to be amazing the car is going to outperform it's going to be in absolute Overkill much like Model S model 3 war is going to break the market and it finally would give Tesla this foothold in the pickup truck category which is the best category in the US which they haven't been playing on,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,ux467T9dB8E,2023-02-02T14:47:25Z,Great news!,Meta,absolute Insanity meta great earnings but there's a huge question marked there. One word about Meta Meta had great earnings beat everything great guidance for the billion dollar buyback all the analysts all of a sudden after the fact recommending this talk. Meta is doing great but meta has always done great it always been cash machine but Michael Michael Mark Zuckerberg's little metaverse bed has cost the company 14 billion dollars in losses this year and that hasn't really happened so I might argue here that what we're seeing with meta is more despite the Herbert rather than because of Zuckerberg so we still have to talk about the metaverse 14 billion that could have gone you know and even made it even better year for for meta but who knows I'm just a gandering that I have no idea what I'm talking about and it is what it is.,1.0,0.1
Tom Nash,ux467T9dB8E,2023-02-02T14:47:25Z,Great news!,Adani Group,most importantly you remember a Danny group this Indian company that was targeted by Hindenburg research oh this story is getting worse by the day it's absolutely insane. I have to kind of give you the recap of the reality of what's going on here now let's start with adani group I know a lot of you haven't heard the name adani group before the Hindenburg research but trust me this story is absolutely fascinating. Basically a Danny group the one of the largest companies in Asia 220 billion dollar market cap gautamadani one of the richest people in the world second or third in the world before this report so basically here's what it's like kind of in a nutshell what happened so as you remember those of you actually uh were interested a little bit in the story a Danny group canceled their share sale Extravaganza they were supposed to sell shares at about 2.5 billion dollars to raise some cash and the question is why because the share was finalized everything was signed the money was transferred everything was finished and yet yesterday they pulled the plug why did they pull the plug why are they giving people their money back and not selling shares anymore well above the market price currently well here's the lame end explanation of what happened here we have a big company from India with a rich Indian businessman one of the most richest people in the world they're doing great the company went up by 800 percent in three years and then Mr adani the rich businessman says guys I'm doing so well I'm making so much money I'm so successful I want to share all this wealth with you Let me sell you some of my stock so you can actually share all this greatness with me people say but they start basically buying up like crazy but then all of a sudden a short seller comes out said hey guys just so you know we have this report here that shows a lot of insanity that's going on in this company a lot of financial Shenanigans a lot of Monkey Business a lot of just you know plain old horrible business management over leveraging nepotism investigations I mean are you sure you want to buy this stock and then the Indian company comes out and says well you're just racist and of course the markets don't buy that and immediately start selling off the shares now this shares sell-off that happened in the market is already done 100 billion dollars so the market cap of the company has decreased by 100 billion dollars over the past week since the report came out almost by 50 give or take so now the government in India that is allegedly being greased by the adani group allegedly according to the report blah blah blah just my opinion so the government now has to actually pretend as if they give a rat ass and actually do something about it so Danny group is going to be on the stake and they I think the politicians can do because they have to show as if they're actually investigating a Danny group and now a Danny group is at risk of offering all these shares 2.5 billion dollars worth of shares to people at basically false representations and lies and potential fraud and potential lawsuits and potential you know criminal allegations and liabilities and Etc et cetera Etc so now that you know that risks exist they've said no no we don't want to sell the shares because all the representations we gave you about the shares everything we told you about this it's questionable so this is what's going on with any group that's why they dropped 100 billion dollars in market cap and this is just the beginning of the story.,1.0,-0.9

Tom Nash,btr7-t9kyrk,2023-02-01T20:21:48Z,Everything (Important) Jerome Powell Just Said,The Federal Reserve,so as John Paul is recapping the end of his speech I want to come out and give you the highlights of what he said the main talking points John Paul in general hasn't been really hawkish or dovish he's kind of basically remained the same but he delivers a lot of hawkishness so to speak as far as the message that was provided the first thing I have to talk about is the fact that John Paul mentioned that the two percent inflation Target will not change and he did it 17 times during his speech more rate hikes are incoming they're more hikes needed again a little bit on the hockey side we knew that how many more hawkishness how many more raid hikes he didn't say but at the very least we know at least it's going to be five percent at the end of the year at bare minimum now he also mentioned something he didn't say last time which is the fact that they're gonna be reducing the balance sheet now he said it multiple times maybe not the last time he spoke but to date the talk has been talked the walk has not been walked does he have the balls to reduce the balance sheet and crash the market I don't know we'll see if he does that it's gonna be very very painful for the stock market if you dump a lot of these bonds out of the market well I'm going to say the price is going to go down it's going to be bloodbath um he did mention that the restrictive policy of the FED has to continue because the job ain't done yet basically he's signaling to all the opiums out there that hey we're not gonna pivot We're Not Gonna pivot now and now John Paul did mention that they're seeing a Slowdown in the economic activity in the real estate market but he did mention that the job market is just too darn hot and they won't stop until they get a cooler job market he didn't say a number at least I didn't hear one but he mentioned before four and a half to five percent unemployment still a long ways away from the three and a half percent currently he basically kind of um created a little bit of a problem for himself because at this point he basically gave away the cards saying Hey We're Not Gonna pivot until we hit two percent and until we have five percent unemployment now it's a very restrictive kind of stance to put yourself into but hey that's what he said um he did say that we need more evidence we being the FED to get convinced that there is an actual slowdown in inflation and he actually hinted towards what happened in the 70s twice saying we're not going to get complacent we're not going to ease off before inflation is fully dead because it's going to come back and bite us and there's way stronger than it did now exactly what happened in the 70s inflation went down the FED took it easy and then it spiked back up stronger and much more worse than before and then Paul Walker had to step in so he's basically saying we're not going to make the same mistake of the 70s ain't gonna happen two percent or bust pretty much um he did mention that they will be shifting to a slower increase rate of hikes so to speak the pace at which they could increase is going to slow down but we already knew that that's not anything new he's basically saying we're not stopping we're not reducing rates you can forget about that and he was asked a very interesting question would I most questions are absolute hot garbage but one question was very interesting and he was asked whether there's a scenario where the unemployment rate stays at three and a half percent but inflation eases to two percent and if that happens they can reduce rates without unemployment Market going to five percent and he said and I don't know why he would do that but he said he doesn't think the scenario is possible he doesn't think that that's possible so it seems he's absolutely obsessed with crushing the job market and I I think it would have been a good opportunity for him to unshackle himself from the unemployment market and say hey if we get to two percent we don't care about the employment Market no problem um very strange answer as we can see here Steve leesman is on the screen and you get the gist of it basically same old same old from Jerome Powell very very focused on the job market almost to an obsession and the markets are not buying it it's kind of the gist of it,0.98,-0.4

Tom Nash,djNcIWKajKE,2023-01-31T14:37:34Z,Tesla Just Dropped a HUGE Bombshell,Tesla,hey this is Tom welcome to another video now in today's video obviously we have to talk about Tesla according to the latest 10K filing from yesterday it seems that Tesla is being investigated by the doj we're going to talk about that cover that in full also as far as Tesla Jim chain is one of the most vocal Tesla shorts is doubling down on shorting Tesla we're going to talk about that and of course we have to talk about Ford dropping prices on the Mac e as a response to what Tesla done and we will talk about what it means for the Auto industry in general what it means for Ford and how does this all play out into Tesla position in the market and obviously we have to start with Tesla Tesla just filed the annual report the 10K and in that report they point out in a little paragraph that the doj the Department of Justice requested information from Tesla requested documents about autopilot with regards to what seems to be an investigation now is this a nothing Burger is this a huge deal I don't know Tesla didn't say in the report but guess what this isn't the first time these driver assist systems by Tesla are being looked at by politicians by Regulators by legislators I just have to say one thing when I see systematic self-destruct it really bothers me you guys have fallen ass backwards into the best car company in the world miles ahead of the competition as far as EVS Toyota is starting to figure this out VW got it Ford and GM starting to get it but Tesla is so far ahead of the curve and now you're actively trying to sabotage your own Golden Goose your own Holy Grail I honestly don't understand why I see the president does it by calling the GM the leaders I see politicians and Regulators do it I honestly don't understand what's the issue with autopilot what's the issue with FSD it's driver assist systems come on guys now the problem is it's not going to hurt Tesla in the long run because Tesla is so far ahead that even the petty regulators and Petty legislators that are trying to slow it down are not going to get what they want but why would you even engage in the self-sabotage I honestly do not understand this but hey maybe I'm wrong now Jim chain is one of the most famous short sellers of Tesla pretty much have come out and doubled down in the short basically saying hey the competition is here basically Tesla is getting wrecked the margins are gone blah blah blah the same fat we keep hearing about Tesla just regurgitated in 2023 now he actually had the audacity to mention that the mar the multiples the Tesla is trading on are way higher than the Ferrari or a Porsche so he's comparing Tesla to Ferrari or Porsche and he thinks that it makes Tesla expensive now to me it shows a little bit of a lack of understanding not disrespect Mr James but a little bit of lack of understanding of what Tesla is Tesla sold 1.3 million vehicles in the past year it will sell 2 million the next year and based on this article just came out an electric of the 10 most sold cars in the world not EVS the 10 most sold cars in the world Tesla has two cars in that top 10 list number four Tesla Model y number seven Tesla Model 3. like two out of the top 10 selling cars in the world are actually a Tesla not to mention the fact that the entire world is Shifting towards EVS who byd well that's a good bet but the problem that byd carries so much risk with being located in China to me it seems that Tesla is the more sense possible bet versus byd long term I know for example Warren Buffett thinks otherwise and he invested in byd but Warren Buffett investing in byd is very different than Jim chain is actually shorting actively shorting Tesla which is a crazy move now he may make a lot of money because shorting a company in the short term might make you a lot of money especially in this crazy Market it's a very volatile Market Tesla might very well go to 100 per share in this insane Market based on this macro and he may make a lot of money but as a long-term investor it's very hard to bet against Tesla giving the numbers given the fundamentals giving the market so Jim chainus might be playing a little bit of a short-term game and that's fine but for long-term investors betting against Tesla just seems absolutely insane now they might be a really nice niche producer of expensive luxury Vehicles that's fine but they're nowhere near Tesla I'm sorry now talking also about Ford Ford actually dropped prices on the Mach e which I think is absolutely ridiculous look you have to understand that Ford doesn't really make any money off of The Mach e there's not enough of them being sold also Ford is operating on a 13 gross profit margin Tesla's operating on 24 gross margin so Tesla literally has double margins than Ford now Tesla dropping the margins a little bit to sell more units makes sense where is this price drop is going to come for Ford you're already at 13 cents on the Dollar on gross profit and now you're cutting prices this is essentially a loss producing vehicle damaki at this point and I feel bad for Ford but I mean they got a match Tesla Tesla did this actively they've dropped prices as a strategic move to suffocate the competition now Ford is being tentative and being reactive essentially putting itself in the position where every car sold will cost Ford money which is absolutely insane,1.0,0.7
Tom Nash,djNcIWKajKE,2023-01-31T14:37:34Z,Tesla Just Dropped a HUGE Bombshell,Lucid,it seems that lucid the fart that was developed yesterday as far as Lucid being bought out by the Saudi fund it seems to be weighing down but Lucid reassures you that no matter what happens the Saudi will keep paying for this little Adventure by Peter Rawlinson which is good I guess if you're Peter Rawlinson on the one hand Lucid flooded this balloon yesterday about a possible buyout by their own 65 shareholder the Saudi fund it seems to have fizzled out it seems at least for now until further notice it ain't happening but Lucid have been reassuring everybody that the Saudis will back them up financially as much as needed they have plenty of cash which they do but guess what Elon mentioned this years ago it's not about having money you can have the most money let's say you're building a soccer team or a basketball team and you have the most amount of money you still need people to select talent to coach to basically strategize to analyze you need infrastructure building cars in mass is very very difficult Lucid have been finding this out for the past two years building really beautiful prototypes of beautiful cars it's not as hard as ramping up and producing 500 000 Vehicles no matter how much money Lucid have they don't have the Manpower the human resource the quality of talent the infrastructure the understanding and how to ramp up a car company now they might be a really nice niche producer of expensive luxury Vehicles that's fine but they're nowhere near Tesla I'm sorry,1.0,-0.6

Tom Nash,3nBdSpUqsk4,2023-01-26T16:36:22Z,Tesla haters are having a really bad day,Tesla,hey everybody this is Tom and Tesla is blowing everybody out of the water again I don't know why some people are surprised they say in the first time I think Tesla dropped a huge bombshell yesterday the earnings were phenomenal Revenue beat earnings per share beat a lot of new disappointed employees behind the dumpster the Quickie Mart today because of betting against Elon and Thursdays today but that's besides the point neither here or there let's talk about the earnings I mean the numbers are very impressive 24 billion 24.3 actually in revenues 1.19 per share very impressive beat beat you know as always Tesla doesn't disappoint much when it does it's very very rare now look the numbers are high quality there is an interesting number in there as far as the predictions for the future Tesla's guiding towards 1.8 million cars this year this is very interesting because 1.8 million cars is pretty much what they're making right now the current Pace that they're on is 1.8 million based on Q4 deliveries so that means the Tesla saying we're not going to ramp up at all in 2023 while we know objectively that's false that's incorrect the likelihood of Tesla doing 1.8 million cars in 2023 I think is the same likelihood as my grandpa quitting alcohol it ain't happening I think the number is going to be much higher closer to 2 million easily I think just like sandbagging the numbers just to look better I mean everybody's doing it on Wall Street why not I get it also there's a risk management element here I mean we've seen a pandemic a war in Europe I mean Russia against Ukraine it's like U.S against Canada it's pretty much the same Insanity so nothing will surprise me anymore so if you have an alien invasion or some sort of a global collapse yes 1.8 million is possible but besides that I think they're sandbagging and they're gonna do two I probably think they're gonna do 2.1 2.2 million just in 2023 you know you can replay this video in a year and either embarrass me or say hey Tom you called it correctly in either case I'll be fine don't worry about it now look more importantly a lot of nitpicking is going on right now mainstream media about the margins so Tesla's reduced prices all the short Sellers and theirs were static the old gist in their pants basically saying oh yes but the problem is that despite dropping the prices the margins are still great despite what they're telling you on TV now they're talking about how the gross profit has reduced from 29 a year ago you know to 24 oh my goodness the problem is that the operating margin didn't really budge at all I mean it's pretty much at 17 now when you have a competitor like Tesla which has double double operating margin then every other competitors gross profit margin I think that this discussion is pretty much a moot point it's almost like debating you know um I have a Toyota Corolla and I'm trying to figure out whether the private jet that my neighbor just bought is good enough and big enough and there's a bigger Lear jet he could have bought and you know he's he's losing money so my guy he's flying a Learjet and I'm driving in Toyota Corolla I shouldn't be talking about his margins Tesla has by far the most exciting product lineup going forward with the Cyber truck with the semi with the 25 000 car they've talked about with SAS income software as a service income with FSD which nobody else has I mean Dylan called it you know you got to have a telescope to see Tesla from the second place at this point so talking about their margins I think it's ridiculous yes they're dropping prices but they're dropping price is because they want it it's their game it's an aggressive move Tesla's doing it on their terms they're basically now ready to ramp up and because they're ready to ramp up they'll sell you the car for cheap so you can actually sell more units they didn't have any interest in selling more units before because they couldn't procure enough materials at a decent price and couldn't just build enough of them not enough Factory ramp up now the factories are working at a higher Pace each unit cost is now lower because of that ramp up raw material supply chains are better so you can actually produce cars cheaper so reducing prices actually will do nothing for the long-term margins for Tesla and increase capacity because more people will buy it not to talk about the EV tax credit and even if you look at the revenues the revenues are up 37 on a quarterly basis 20 gross profit increase on a quarterly basis net income is up 60 if you go annual on an annual basis revenues are up 51 53 increase in Gross profits and 130 increase in net income balance sheet is incredibly strong with 22 billion dollars in cash virtually no debt so the company is doing better than ever however two things I want to mention here number one this stock is still exposed to the risks it's exposed to the elements we don't know how Market forces will interact with the stock because if the FED decides to hammer the economy even further Tesla is going to get wet and it's going to get hurt so the market forces can and take the stock down significantly from this point and it's not something that cannot happen but it absolutely has nothing to do with Tesla if it happens it happens but in the long term Tesla is doing better than ever now the second point I want to mention here is the BuyBacks I was really interesting to see if Elon Musk will talk about the BuyBacks he didn't directly mention BuyBacks but two things happen number one he said about we're going into recession year cash is King which basically implies he's probably not going to do BuyBacks but also we found out yesterday and you can check me on this Elon actually purchased four billion dollars of bonds now if they spent four billion on bonds which actually produce interest and he's talking about cash as king recession uncertainty I think it would be very unlikely he's going to spend five to ten billion dollars on BuyBacks because it's basically prepping for the worst so in a sense Elon is telling you what I just said a second ago the share price is too exposed to the elements right now to do a buyback there's a lot of unknowns about where the market is headed and I think a buyback pays based on what we saw yesterday is off the table but it doesn't really matter.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,fLtRCgrSNKA,2023-01-25T16:40:08Z,"I'm BACK! (Tesla Earnings, Michael Burry New Warning, Recession Update)",Tesla,in today's video I want to cover Tesla Michael burry's new warning Hindenburg research dropping a huge bombshell Google Microsoft employing some important updates. anyways let's start with Tesla real quick. Tesla's reporting earnings today huge day look not gonna be a lot of surprises 25 or so just under 25 billion of revenues about just under 4 billion of profits not a lot of surprises everybody's talking about recessionary fears competitions coming Elon Musk is you know hurting the brand and what are the interest rates it's going to do to Tesla price drops EV tax credit all of this is already on the table the truth is very simple for the people who actually trade test around earnings which I don't it's very simple the numbers are good the stock is going to fly the numbers are bad the stock is going to drop like a stone simple. what I'm curious about is two things that I don't think get covered a lot and are even more important than these short-term nonsense. the two things I'm looking at is number one will Tesla provide a proper succession plan to show there's a limited keyman risk with Tesla it's not all about Elon it's not a one-man show it's been already on the kind of docket for a long time institutional investors are looking forward for something like that maybe now is a good time to actually showcase that. more importantly I want to look at the BuyBacks will Tesla announce BuyBacks and I'm not rooting for one way or the other I know Gary black wants them I know other people are not so sure that's the right way to spend Tesla's money maybe more factories or whatnot but here's why BuyBacks are important BuyBacks essentially if it's a company actually buying back its own shares it's a vote of confidence. now for me Elon Musk is one of the smartest people on the planet so what Elon does here is very important. now in October Elon said we're gonna probably implement share Buybacks in the realm of 5 to 10 billion dollars in 2023 now he said it. now the reason that I'm curious to see what is actually going to do if it's going to follow through or they're not it's not because I want to name call him a liar which some people have made a career out of is because I want to see what he thinks about the recession. if Elon Musk says anything about this that this basically eliminates his previous statement and he backtracks on it basically tells me that he thinks a recession is coming and it's going to get worse and if that's the case there's no sense in buying back shares now if things are about to get much worse why would we buy bike shares now when everything is about to get worse. if he kind of follows through with that and he actually talks more about BuyBacks and the BuyBacks plan actually goes forward it shows me that Elon Musk is not on that recession bandwagon so I'm looking forward to see what Elon does not says that will indicate what he really thinks about the recession that's my main takeaway from this Q4 earnings not the that everybody is focused on. a lot of short sellers are hoping it's Tesla and I doubt it but let's see who it is.,1.0,-0.1

(Tesla Earnings, Michael Burry New Warning, Recession Update)",Michael Burry,in today's video I want to cover Tesla Michael burry's new warning Hindenburg research dropping a huge bombshell Google Microsoft employing some important updates. now Michael Berry just issued another warning he's basically saying that this is kind of the period when the market shut up slightly before the big crash of 2001-2000 and there's a very famous chart that he pulled up on this Twitter. I guess Michael Berry is like one of them and page trees some people love them and swear by them these pastries and some people just hate them. some people love Michael Berry and love his predictions other people absolutely hate him. I think he's been right a lot he's been wrong a lot but at the very least it's very entertaining and I don't know if he's right or wrong but let me tell you what he's definitely in love with the attention we're all giving him and absolutely love it because I totally get where he's coming from. is this a reasonable prediction yes um is it possible yes and is the indicator is there to Showcase that what he's saying is correct yes will it happen I don't know but guess what I'm not Michael Berry I don't have to make this prediction.,1.0,0.1

(Tesla Earnings, Michael Burry New Warning, Recession Update)",Google,in today's video I want to cover Tesla Michael burry's new warning Hindenburg research dropping a huge bombshell Google Microsoft employing some important updates. now another company that thinks that Michael Berry might be right is Google. Google is laying off 12 000 employees six percent of their Workforce. you don't do that as Google because of the pr nightmare you're gonna have as you've seen over the past few days unless you are 100 certain recession is coming because Google is now not looking so hot. now it tells me that Sundar and the Sergey and and the entire management team in Google they think that it's really going to get bad because this is the sort of decision you kind of make with the founders so a six percent cut is usually not something you do unless you're convinced of a recession so we know where Google is at.,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,fLtRCgrSNKA,2023-01-25T16:40:08Z,"I'm BACK!

NOW Microsoft just reported earnings and they were fine they were fine nothing out of the ordinary. the only thing is that Azure their Cloud business is slowing down and it's slowed down significantly but guess what they were flying so high that even post slow down they're at like 30 annual growth. look um is this a good time to bail on Microsoft I don't know but let me tell you what it's very hard for me to bet against Microsoft because the cloud business is just absolutely insane. they have a recurring revenue from just office as as horrible as their as their Computing business is they're creating a lot of recurring Revenue. they're dominating the business to business software industry. it's very hard to say hey Microsoft is going down. I think it's more like Microsoft is adjusting to post kind of pandemic realism then Microsoft is dropping like a stone. so to me Microsoft is still one of the best companies to own out there.,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,fLtRCgrSNKA,2023-01-25T16:40:08Z,"I'm BACK! (Tesla Earnings, Michael Burry New Warning, Recession Update)",Boeing,if you want to look at other indicators boy just announced that they basically missed revenues in EPS. it's a very simple thing costs are going up cost of Labor going up demand is going down. when flights and Airlines have always been a leading indicator in the recession so whenever things get really really bad airlines are the first one to get hit. it's the first thing that people stop doing luxury travel and all that stuff is the first thing that actually suffers so you can really see that Boeing is showing slight signs of a pre recession environment.,1.0,-0.7

Tom Nash,3PrsRmjuEE4,2023-01-17T14:28:03Z,The Debt Crisis Is Coming Soon,U.S. Banks,now look the one thing that happened last week was very interesting is the fact that Banks reported great results. now if you look at results on the bank everybody made money woohoo great right. well there's one thing I like to pay attention to as far as Bank earnings that most people don't look at I look at the balance sheet and that balance sheet is very very important because in that balance sheet I get to see a huge predictive element. but in the case of a bank there's actual predictive value there and that's what I want to look at and trust me what happened in Q4 with all U.S banks is a big huge warning sign you don't want to miss. now look the one thing that banks have to report in the balance sheet is the provision for credit losses how much the bank considers it will have to give up as far as uncollectible debt. now there's no incentive for the bank to increase this unless they absolutely have to because it makes them look much in a shitty situation than they are. now the past quarter that number have increased by 30 percent across all U.S banks 30 in a single quarter that's no laughing matter. 6.2 billion which all major U.S banks consider to be bad debt that which will probably not be collectible the banks are basically bracing for a recessionary year. now look it's not just about the banks there's other data points which we can look at to confirm what the banks are telling us. but look at what I'm saying the banks are increasing their Provisions the credit in the US on the consumer side is actually getting bigger and bigger getting to that Boiling Point.,0.95,-0.8
Tom Nash,tCfn8lS4L2A,2023-01-13T14:34:41Z,Elon Musk Just Did The Unthinkable (This Changes Everything),Tesla,oh my goodness the sky is falling Tesla is dropping prices the company's going out of business you gotta move to the south of Spain where there's no rain and you have to change your name oh my goodness no no no relax by the way welcome to this beautiful Friday my name is Tom Nash and today we have to talk about the Tesla price Cuts yes Tesla dropping prices significantly but as I'm about to show in this video because I always give you the bottom line first that's actually a good thing and a 4D chess move that's about to make Tesla a lot of money. Now if you're here for the fud and you want me to hate on Tesla I mean there's plenty of channels that kind of regurgitate this pavlovian Tesla hate and Elon hate feel free to watch that but I'm going to give you the analysis the way I see it. Now look I'm a bull of Tesla I'm an investor of Tesla obviously I want the company to succeed but I'm not gonna write its D just because I'm an investor if there's problems I'm gonna call them out. Now look this is what happened so Tesla basically announced that they're dropping prices again significantly across the board about 10 percent on the model S and the model X but more importantly twenty percent twenty percent on a Model Y which is very significant even the model 3 Performance is now going to be 54 000. Now is this a bad idea does this mean that Tesla is losing ground they can't compete they're dropping prices because they're getting beat the margins are gone like the company's going back up no none of this let me explain to you exactly what's going on this is literally a combination of four different 4D chess moves by Tesla and Elon Musk absolutely brilliant. What did Tesla do? Well Tesla actually didn't sit around and wait for the government because you know GM and Ford they're really used to just sitting there and waiting for the government to bail them out like they did many many times in the past this is not waiting on anybody. Look at model 3 Performance and look at model y both cars are now right on the money just under 55 000 so they can qualify for the EV tax credit of 7 500 which is huge. In 2021 Tesla actually raised the prices for the model y by 17 000 all the way up to what we have right now. Now they're now reducing the price by Thirteen thousand dollars just a year later so in aggregate in net we're still about four thousand dollars higher than what we were when the car actually launched so this price drop is just a backwards adjustment to the original price that can still actually be painful that is if you don't have margins but here's the thing Tesla have plenty of margin. Tesla is a 25 four percent so they have way more margin more than double the margin of GM and force which means they can actually do this and not get absolutely annihilated. So Tesla is dropping the price they definitely have the margins to absorb it but don't forget the volume makes up for these discounts. My bias would be to say like okay let's grow as fast as we can without putting the company at risk and yes obviously when you reduce prices that margin that profitability is going to be hurt you're not going to be making 24 again at least not for a while but guess what if your volume of sales actually goes up insanely that's going to compensate for the reduction in margin. 45 000 is basically now the price you have to pay for the model y that's a very very competitive considering the landscape Tesla is operating in. Tesla actually has big plans for the model Y and the model 3 which means that at 45 000 a model y base is a very very competitive car which is going to increase sales actually way stronger and way faster than even the some of the more optimistic models I've seen lately. At 45k it's a whole different ball game it's actually a recession-proof strategy ahead of time which the margins that we just talked about that 24 gross margin allows Tesla to do and does not allow Ford GM to do the same I think it's going to propel sales absolutely insanely. Tesla is already growing at 40 per year on sales at least on deliveries in a market that's gone down eight percent. I think Tesla waited to do these price Cuts they waited until Berlin was actually operational they waited until Berlin was actually ramped up and they waited for China to get out of zero covet policy so they can actually produce all this new demand. There's no doubt in my mind that at forty five thousand dollars the model Y is going to sell like hot cakes. I think now that we've seen that Germany is actually online the China's going back online Tesla can actually produce these cars so now they're dropping the price to actually accommodate that. This is a classic example when the government tries to screw Tesla and screw them out of their you know EV credit and then your sister says well you know what you didn't like us in the front door we're gonna come in through the window. As a long-term investor I know that the fundamentals are going to beat out the market no matter how many embarrassing weird strange stuff Elon tweets about.,1.0,0.85

Tom Nash,tCfn8lS4L2A,2023-01-13T14:34:41Z,Elon Musk Just Did The Unthinkable (This Changes Everything),Ford,So if the Ford Mustang if the GM Cadillac lyric and the you know the base model Y five-seater is now not under 55 000 they will not get this 7 500 credit. What did Ford do? I don't think Ford even got the memo. I think for for the display probably don't even know about the Evita is created that. GM and Ford they're really used to just sitting there and waiting for the government to bail them out like they did many many times in the past. Why didn't Ford do it? Why didn't they drop the Mach e and the lyric below fifty five thousand dollars like Tesla just did with the model y because they literally can't. Their margin for Ford and GM the gross margin on cars is about 11 percent and that's across the board including the more profitable ones. Tesla is a 25 four percent so they have way more margin more than double the margin of GM and force which means they can actually do this and not get absolutely annihilated. Ford and GM already have billions hundreds of billions of debt and they cannot afford to drop even the single Dollar on these cars they're already losing money on these cars as it is because they can't make them cheap enough they just don't know how they don't have the experience they don't have the track record they don't know how to make these cheap cars EV. The Machi are going to stay very elevated in price and 4gm can't make enough of them anyways.

Michael Berry tweeted a few days ago basically saying hey guys the FED is going to overshoot it basically we're going negative inflation this year in the second half of the year the FED is going to freak out basically saying oh my god what have we done we've raised interest way too much they're going to start stimulating again which is going to send the stock market into a crazy rally and bring back inflation stronger than ever now in fact if you look at the bond market right now and you look at the way the stock market is behaving a lot of people are agreeing with Michael Berry there's a big part of the investment Community who's betting on that specific scenario while in fact the FED in John Paul are very clear they're not going to do that in fact Jared Powell jerem Powell Jerome Powell's poke yesterday and he literally said hey we're not backing off we're gonna go through with this all the way through 2023 and possibly 2024 don't expect any rate cuts at all so the quest question is I think whether Michael Bear is right or John Powell is actually going to keep his award is actually very simple it's a factual question... I'm personally I'm not going to bet against the FED I think playing a game of chicken against the central bank that has literally nothing to lose and I have to lose all my money it's not a smart chicken game I want to play... The job of the Central Bank in America is not to deal with any climate change issues that's the legislator's job not the job of the central bank which I 100 agree with... the U.S economy is so strong it's so powerful it's so dominant that even the FED can't screw it up imagine that even John Powell could not destroy the U.S economy in that debate I much rather go with Warren Buffett who says that you should only bet on the U.S economy versus everything else,1.0,0.2

Tom Nash,ki481cr_-_Y,2023-01-10T16:47:03Z,The survival of Tesla depends on Ross Gerber (according to Ross Gerber),Tesla,we have Russ Gerber trying to get a five minute with England and a board seat on the board of directors of Tesla. he's basically saying the survival of Tesla no less is dependent on me getting a five minute with Elon. The other thing Rose Gerber is trying to promote is himself as a board of directors member of Tesla which I found absolutely hilarious. I'm seeing Tesla bears and shorts basically cracking jokes on social media how they would actively promote his nomination for the board of directors that's their wet dream having Ross Gerber as a director of Tesla hopefully that doesn't happen but I mean we've seen stranger things in the past few years so who knows. on more serious things I've been on and off with Tesla haters and Tesla Bears on Twitter following my latest video the video was titled Tesla Bears will absolutely hate this video I'm gonna put it right here if you go to check it out I made a video explaining why Tesla bears are wrong about Tesla and social media is always the place where people come to scream into the void you know people with like five followers tweeting about things nobody reads. so basically a lot of experts on social media explain to me why I'm wrong and why Tesla is the worst company ever Elon Musk is the worst human being ever why he's the worst CEO ever about how I'm clueless Etc. look you can hate those all you want but here's the problem you're missing one critical point if you're coming to just like Ponzi scheme or an elaborate scam or an overvalued car company here's the problem with that argument you're looking at a company that just sold 1.3 million cars in the recession year when the entire Market was down big. There have 28 gross margin which is literally doubled in Toyotas which is the best margin in the business and tripled in Ford and GM they're generating 22 billion dollars in ebitda they have zero debt and they just increased sales by 44 of new cars over the past year when the entire Market went down by eight percent so it's a little bit of a problematic argument. The problem with these Tesla haters is because I think a lot of them it's about ego they got it wrong and they just can't give it up the second group is people who are you know they're the quintessential idiots in every like in every society and every group of friends there's always the guy who is probably the stupidest of every of the group but he's sure that he's always the smartest in the in the room so these kind of the people I have to deal with social media so I mean I don't mind I mean it's just kind of fun to me that they still think that you know Tesla is a bad company.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,Z4MxWBOgA1g,2023-01-09T16:24:25Z,Tesla Bears Are Going To Hate This Video,Tesla,okay so if you listen to mystery media right now this is all you hear Tesla is basically going bankrupt the company is falling apart the cars are falling apart so what you got to do is sell your Tesla stock sell your Tesla car move to a different country better even you know a different continent change your name so that nobody ever finds out that you ever owned a Tesla car and or the stock this is literally all you hear right now and I find it really amusing because you know Tesla fat has always been around but this is like new level stuff that we haven't seen in a long time okay so Tesla just delivered 405 000 vehicles in the fast in the fast in the last quarter of 2022. The estimates were 418 000 so they missed by about 13 000 cars and of course immediately the Festival has started all the Cockroaches coming out in the Halls basically celebrating Tesla's failure only 405 000 Vehicles yay Tesla is losing demand the growth story is over even some people who actually respect have caught on to this narrative unfortunately Even if you define yourself as a Tesla hater in Elon Musk hater as well whatever that may be but please listen to what I gotta say in this video because the data absolutely will debunk everything you hear in mainstream media right now look it's true that Tesla missed estimates for sure but you know let's look at what's going on with the rest of the industry the entire U.S Auto industry is selling eight percent less car in 2022 than it did in 2021 while Tesla increased their sales by over 40 percent so that there and then should be the end of the discussion but I'm just getting warmed up everybody is hurting but Tesla is basically selling 40 plus percent more and somehow that's a problem during the time when Tesla went from 300 000 Vehicles a year to 1.3 million Vehicles a year during the same time the U.S Auto industry basically shrunk they shrunk by 35 the main thought about Tesla over the past few years has always been this argument the competition is coming the competition is coming every year we hear about how finally this year the Germans are coming you know the competition is coming I've been hearing this this I would say since 2013. how Tesla cannot survive once Legacy auto really goes into this game I've been hearing this for the past eight years and somehow every year that hasn't happened yet even though the money is there on the table you know it's there for the taking you know take it from Tesla it's like taking candy from a baby well that baby can punch back and it punches really hard because look Legacy auto with all due respect and I have respect for Legacy auto they just cannot compete with Tesla at scale the US Auto industry will talk about of that in a second isn't a whole new [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sandwich of its own it has to solve before even you know considers competing with Tesla while they're trying to figure out how to handle this Tesla is basically creating more space between themselves and the second and the third place and I'll give you numbers to prove this I'm not just you know pulling this out of my butt now look without the respect to you U.S auto Legacy they just cannot make electric vehicles at scale like that it's possible look at the numbers the GM lyric which you saw Mr President Biden driving and you know do some PR stunts I mean they sold 36 units in Q3 of 2022. 36 units my guy even the Mach e which is not a bad car I mean it's not a Tesla Model 3 it's not even the Tesla it's it's a Mucky it's an it's a nice electric first attempt by Ford I don't hate on it they sold about 30 000 cars this year 30 000 cars that's as much as Tesla sold the model S you know how much Tesla sold model 3 and why this year in the US about 350 000 so Tesla is outselling Ford by a multitude of 10 and that's just with the three and the Y not including the S so there's just not enough there in the in this equation for legacy order to make any sort of a run for this everybody knows about how Tesla is the best-selling car in Norway but I mean it's not just Norway in 28 years and shout out to Farzad for bringing us my attention the best-selling midsize sedan in Australia was the Toyota Camry and rightfully so it's a great car this year in 2022 or rather last year in 2022 this title was taken from it by the Tesla Model 3. the model 3 is now the best-selling mid-size sedan in Australia in the first time since 28 years it's not the Camry by the way if you look at UK for example you're gonna be shocked because the two best-selling cars is the model 3 and the model y what about five times more sales than the third place in the UK and with Legacy auto pretty much unable to compete with Tesla at this point except maybe for VW that can make a little bit of noise Toyota has pretty much given up the rest of them don't get any started who's going to compete with Tesla byd the company I mentioned earlier actually has a shot it's a terrific company hands down the best competitor for Tesla completely vertically integrated and they're growing like crazy 150 more sales from last year to this year they're definitely breathing down Tesla's neck even Tesla who really pissed off President Biden I don't know why he's so upset with Tesla to the point he couldn't even say the name Tesla is not you know in the same situation the U.S government right now really doesn't like Tesla and yet you know they operate freely you know Elon Musk is not in prison they sell 40 more cars this year than than last year so to me byd is just an unfortunate situation bad geography in China they will never be able to compete unfortunately so before you listen to all this fud about you know Tesla losing demand and you know falling off a cliff or coming apart the seams look at what's going on the rest of the world and yes I understand Tesla has a lot of issues in China I mean who doesn't but if you look at the rest of the world North America Europe anywhere else Tesla's absolutely killing it in the US they're the best selling electric vehicle by Miles 350 000 units just from three and why 370 if you add the model S and you know what yes I know the stock market can be a little bit crazy and who knows the stock price might be kind of sideways for the couple years I don't know I don't determine the stock price I can only focus on the company I like the company I like what they're doing they're in route to doing 2 million cars a year I believe in about 18 months and at this point that's all I need the stock price might keep the stock down the macro might be horrible yes Tesla might be trading sideways for a while but as a long-term investor it's just not something I'm concerned about and if you are and you're trying to kind of medium trade your way into this Market that's fine Tesla isn't the stock for you I get it but for long-term investors who are in love with what the company is doing as far as fundamentals as far as their margins which are the best in the business I mean their margins even after the discounts they're still going to be doubled than anybody else in the business including Toyota who makes 10 times more cars than them has no debt unlike the 500 trillion dollars of combined debt of all the global automakers by the way 200 of that 200 billion is just GM and Ford imagine that so I mean no debt great margins absolute terrific cars yes there's quality issues in Tesla cars which cars does not have quality issues I mean give me a break they're not the perfect car I've never said they are but they're damn good solution for somebody who wants an electric vehicle a supercharger Network great software and the ability to actually have an ecosystems to operate in and have a product a complete product.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,Z4MxWBOgA1g,2023-01-09T16:24:25Z,Tesla Bears Are Going To Hate This Video,Ant,today got announced that Jack Ma has agreed agreed to give up his 53 control in and group and group which was supposed to IPO at a valuation of 300 billion dollars in 2020 and by the way an IPO that was canceled by the Chinese government because they didn't like Jack ma for no other reason so that same and group finally Jackman has agreed to give up his control in the company and now he will be holding a nice little six percent instead of his 53 and basically you know the government has convinced him I I think they made some really strong arguments there but basically look at what they're doing they gave him the six percent so he has money and you know he's taken care of but he basically lost his company that's how it works in China ant and slowly became a much bigger thing that anybody had imagined it's it's kind of the Chinese equivalent of PayPal but it ballooned to something much bigger than this almost like an alternative paying kind of environment microsystem microcosmos basically taking control out of the Chinese government with regards to how people pay between each other the loans everything so once the currency controls have started to Shake in China and Jack ma started to dabble too much in what the Chinese government considers taboo they pretty much made him disappear for a while they brought him back you haven't heard them speak speaks you haven't heard them speak once since there I don't know what's going on with me I can't talk but basically since they made him disappear and then he reappeared he's been very very silent and people are awfully silent that's usually a case that they're terrified or they basically know that worse things will come if they actually open their mouth now look what happened today,1.0,-1.0

Tom Nash,KYALwPllMAo,2023-01-03T17:38:38Z,Tesla Missed Delivery Target (But That's OK),Tesla,okay so Tesla the company that cannot go wrong in Elon Musk the guy who always gets it right actually missed deliveries and that's not good I'm not gonna lie to you and say that this is great there's no good way to spend this but the real question is how bad this stuff really are because look if there's one thing for certain is that I think Elon Musk emails at the end of the year basically rallying the troops and the troops didn't rally because they delivered 405 000 cars instead of the anticipated 420 000 cars I'm not even making this stuff up this is the actual number 420. believe it or not now look missing deliveries is never good there's no good way to spend this and if you're looking for somebody to spin this for you in a good nice package to package this bad sandwich and let you have a taste of it this is not the right place I'm going to talk about The Good the Bad and basically how serious this is because this is definitely not good but the question is is this a little bump of the road or is this engine problems that might require some serious overhaul now check this out I have some numbers here so the Miss was from 418 to 405 mainly the Miss was on the model 3 and the model y as you would expect because this is the bread and butter of Tesla now here's their actual question is this a sign that Tesla is actually losing demand because the amount of production was actually quite higher a lot higher than this there is a lot of cars standing waiting around to be delivered so the first question we have to ask here is this a sign that Tesla cannot push out cars at will anymore like they could in the past remember back in the day people used to wait a year year and a half for the car is this now a sign that this stuff is over and basically Tesla has to play on expert mode like everybody else not necessarily look you have to take this in context obviously this is not good obviously the share price will suffer and there's definitely issues here but first of all at least partially speaking I don't know exactly what's the percentage it's not all demand destruction partially a lot of it is just pure Logistics when you manufacture cars in China and Germany in the US and you have to deliver them to Bulgaria Romania and the Czech Republic It's Complicated so a lot of cars are basically in a logistical nightmare it happens there's a lag not every car is produced gets delivered the next day to the client it takes a lot of time a lot of process and some of it is that for sure but some of it is definitely demand loss and I'm not going to beat around the bush now look having said that there's a lot of positives here that we have to talk about number one this was hands down the best delivery quarter in the history of Tesla they are now on Pace to deliver 1.75 million cars in the next four quarters this one included so this space even if they do not increase anymore they stay just on the space for the next three quarters four quarters they'll do 1.75 million cars annualized rate very very good now also it's still a 40 growth in deliveries year over here which is again an impressive number but it's not as impressive as we had before if you go back in the time machine and the DeLorean you will see that there's definitely deceleration here I mean it's not as good as it used to be look Tesla delivered 500 000 vehicles in 2020. it delivered 940 000 vehicles in 2021. that's a 80 increase in deliveries but from 2021 to 2022 the increase was just 40 from 940 to 1.3 million now there's a lot to blame here not everything is demand destruction some of the haters will tell you this is not the end of Tesla's demand like some people on Twitter are saying but it's definitely a sign of a few things number one that you should never ever ever in your life set up a company in Germany when I used to work for Deloitte we always told clients to stay away from two jurisdictions France and Germany as far as opening a company you never want to do business in France Jeremy because the bureaucracy there is going to literally want to make you pull your hairs out and now eight months behind schedule even Giga Berlin is facing the same problems delayed delay delayed because of freaking bureaucracy and if you want to talk about stupid bureaucracy how about China Shanghai out in about zero covet policy in and out partial like what the hell is going on so with China being basically half-assed with Germany being dragged down by bureaucracy as always and with the recession here with the pandemic here with everything that went on this world with the war in Europe Tesla still pulled a 40 growth rate which is still impressive but not as good as previous years we have to admit this now look at the end of the day here's the thing here they manufacture and produce and deliver more electric vehicles than any other combined Global manufacturer in the world so basically Tesla's EVS produced and delivers are more than all of the other combined in fact if you compare them to VW which is the second in place they produce and deliver 10 times more cars than VW so I don't want to hear this nonsense about how VW is about to surpass Tesla in 2023 is that happening not in 2024 there's definitely time for VW to play even on the same level so as it stands right now in the Eevee industry as far as pure EVS there's not a lot of choices out there I'll tell you what the id4 is probably the only actual competitor maybe byd is playing in the same chord but there's very few competitors so the idea is that the problem is more in the time and More in macroeconomics than anything else the question is how bad this resistance is going to be that's going to impact Tesla a lot more than elon's tweets and elon's political views and whatnot now look there's another question here so would I sell my stock knowing this right looking at this quarter to quarter right everything is accelerating right Q2 they've delivered 250 000 cars I'm looking at my notes Q3 340 000 cars that's a 35 increase quarter of a quarter from Q2 to Q3 but from Q3 to this quarter they've only accelerated 18 from 340 to 405. so there is deceleration so the question is am I selling or do I think you should stay in again it's a personal decision I can't tell you what freaking thing you should be doing with your money I mean that's you that's me I'll tell you what I'll do and I'll tell you what I feel about people who sell Tesla and my answer might surprise you now I personally am not good at Soul Tesla I'm not going to trim my position I'm very bullish on Tesla I love that 40 growth I think they'll figure out this thing with the Eevee credit that model y5 series will qualify and that if you credit is going to be huge for them I almost have no doubt however if you feel like you need to sell Tesla stock because they miss deliveries I'm gonna be 100 honest with you I totally understand you I can't blame you and I can't call you a fudster I can't call you a trailer I can call you anything I can tell you it's a bad idea no once a company misses deliveries all the excuses go freaking flying out the window nobody cares Cry Me a River it's the same thing as playing sports nobody cares the bad ref calls nobody cares about if you slipped on the wet you know on the wet hardwood whatever that may be nobody cares at the end of the day Tesla went into this quarter flying high and missed deliveries if certain investors would like to sell their stock because of that I will not be basically negative about it and say that they're making a mistake no especially knowing that the share price will come down because of this I'm expecting to see a lot of red because what just happened however me personally I think that Tesla as a company have never been in a better situation yes there is a deceleration however forty percent of your growth the best quarter in their history and they're absolutely dominating the EV Market that's just slowly starting to develop and really to be honest they don't have competition people talk about the Germans which Germans the eqs the BMW x5e I mean come on let's be honest no company have their infrastructure nobody have the quality of software they have they have a massive Advantage now when we're going to be talking about two to three million demand that's a whole different story wait up for that but all the way up to 2 million cars I believe they can sell at ease especially since byd and VW are really the only ones who are trying to compete especially with this EV credit stuff which I think will be resolved soon so I'm not selling but if you feel like you have to sell because of what happened I totally understand you and I get it they missed you sell you know and now they're on probation totally understand let me know below what you think about what just happened see you next video.,1.0,0.6

Tom Nash,PKceLngYP0Y,2023-01-02T16:10:09Z,Tesla's Exclusion From New EV Tax Credit,Tesla,okay so the US government is literally trying to demolish Tesla I'm not even exaggerating this is as bad as it sounds now everybody knows that guy in every group of friends that has no idea what he's doing he's literally fumbling through life making every possible mistake ends up working as a security guard for that you know donkey Theater Company in Mexico so you're telling me there's a chance well that is literally the U.S government this point because they've made every possible mistakes to screw themselves because we are talking about Tesla the only company in the past 45 years to actually compete against the Germans against the Koreans against the Japanese the U.S under industry has been in their absolute toilet for the past four decades getting annihilated by Mercedes by BMW by KIA by Hyundai you name it the U.S Auto industry have lost to it every single car manufacturer in the world have been shellacking the US Auto industry since the 80s now they've been barely scraping by but at a cost look at GM and Ford open up their balance sheet they have over 110 billion dollars of debt each and each has 21 billion dollars of cash whoopty freaking do look at this siamese twins my guy come on now these companies are being on pretty much held on life support by the US government but that is not enough apparently now we have to destroy the one company the only company that actually can offer competition to the rest of the world which is actually dominating the EV Market which is the next big Market we have to destroy it because it's interfering with the companies that we're keeping literally on life support which is Ford and GM unbelievable now what am I talking about here because this is absolutely blows my blood you know how this you know the joke about the donkey what is a donkey a donkey is a horse planned by committee well that would be a compliment to what this Administration is doing I'm not even talking about the previous iterations of what we saw how Joe Biden forgot to invite Tesla to an easy convention in the White House literally the company holds 70 of the US market how he forgot to even name Tesla and you know thank Mary Barra from GM for leading the EV industry you electrified the entire automobile industry I'm serious you led and it matters you know GM the company that has the lyric lyric that they sold 36 units of in Q3 I literally mean 36 units not 36 000. I mean this is the leaders right anyways so the US government has never been a fan of that they tried it before with the UAV with the auto unions and they tried a whole bunch of horseshit to go at Tesla but this time they literally get gone too far because this time it's so blatant it actually you know insults my intelligence do they think people won't notice now what I'm talking about is the new EV tax credit is part of the new anti-inflation legislation which in itself is a kind of a you know a Frank kopka film at this point because absolutely ridiculous so this kafka-esque thing is going on right in front of us when you know they're giving away a tax credit now a tax credit is very simple you know you file your taxes you have a tax liability if you have that 7 500 tax credit you get it back you don't pay taxes if you have too little taxes you get to carry it forward for future years you never get cash but you get pretty much as good as cash now they made it sound reasonable when you start reading this tax credit because you know if you are over three hundred thousand dollars as a household you can't get it if you're buying a track or an SUV about eighty thousand dollars you shouldn't get it I mean you're buying a premium car right if you're buying a sedan about 55 000 you shouldn't get it so it all makes sense on the face of it right if you're a rich mother lover with above 300 000 as a household if you're a rich mother lover who buys a truck for more than eighty thousand dollars if you're a rich mother lover who buys a sedan for over fifty five thousand dollars you shouldn't be eligible and to that part I couldn't agree more why not sure we don't want to give this credit to people who have too much money already I mean come on let's be fair but then at that point is where things became become a little begin become a little shady because at this point it actually goes off the rails get this now the cars that qualify for this tax credit are cars that you wouldn't really qualify as electric vehicles per se because they're all hybrids like the Q5 from Audi the BMW x5e or even the Ford Escape I don't know why anybody would buy that piece of car but all these cars qualify and they qualify as an SUV which means that the price cap for these cars to be eligible for this refund is eighty thousand dollars so you can buy a BMW x5e an Audi Q5 and a Ford Escape I don't know why would you among other cars which are all five seater SUVs which means five people fit in it it's an SUV you buy it below 80 000 you get the credit however the model 5 or the model 5 the model y with the five seats is not eligible why no idea if you look at the dimensions of this car it's pretty much identical if not bigger than the Ford Escape it's seven inches longer and just about an inch and a half shorter than the the the Ford Escape and yet somehow it is not an SUV now again in my mind it's actually ridiculous some may say well Tom you know it's not an anti-testinal thing it's not pro jamming for because the GM lyric doesn't qualify it's an SUV with five seats and it doesn't qualify yeah my guy these mother lovers sold 36 units of it in the previous quarter they don't give a flying rat's ass about the lyric the lyric is just there for PR Jim couldn't give a rat's ass about this car nobody does you know anybody with the lyric and this is the part that really annoys me and pisses me off and as an American I think you should feel the same thing because the United States government let this happen they've let the Auto industry become an Antiquated dinosaur they've lost the battle for the Global Auto industry back in the 80s the Japanese took it the Koreans took it the Europeans took it literally everybody took a shot at the U.S Auto industry and they've never recovered since look at the data but somehow by sheer Miracle the United States have fell as backwards into this amazing thing that is called Tesla a company that's not only beating everybody else it's actually light years away from the competition literally taking over the Eevee industry which is the next big wave in the Auto industry but instead of of nurturing that and understanding hey this is the next big growth engines for the us we have to protect this company by all means we're going to do something different as the US government we're going to take these two companies for GM which have failed again and again and have failed and have failed and have failed and were bailed out again and again and again and we're going to kick Tesla in the nuts Joseph foreign gmk keeps surviving Hanging On by a thread with their 100 billion dollars dead and uncompetitive [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cars so the next question is what can we do now look I don't know if this is a clerical mistake pure negligence or intentional [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Tesla each of these options actually I don't know which one looks worse for this government but that is irrelevant go right now to the link below it's a petition opened up by Farzad sign it there's already almost 9 000 people who signed it please sign it so that the IRS can actually change the definition of an SUV to include model y like any other ecv in the market and actually include Tesla in this tax credit and for all the haters in the comments I find you guys really peculiar because you guys have been so flaky that you remind me of a winner schnitzel in Vienna I mean you guys went from loving Elon from saying he's the greatest Genius of all times into hating him just because he bought Twitter and tweeted a few posts that are a little bit too political for you you forgot everything he's done with Tesla SpaceX neural link starlink that's all forgotten now I mean come on that's pathetic now again I know the haters will be hating and I don't care but the ones who actually care about Tesla and care about the US and want to see the right thing done please go sign the petition I'll see you next

Tom Nash,JseGw4AwAek,2022-12-29T14:53:28Z,Elon Musk Just Dropped a Bombshell about Tesla's Future,Tesla,oh my goodness so Elon Musk sent an email to everybody in Tesla and you won't believe what he said it's absolutely insane at the same time that he was sending this email Adam join us for Morgan Stanley one of the most famous analysts that are bullish on Tesla actually slashed the Target price from Tesla and his rationale is absolutely mind-blowing you won't believe what he wrote so there's a lot to talk about here including Tesla starting to recover slowly today and whether this is the beginning of a new run now look I'm here to bring you nuanced analysis not hype and emotions so let's break everything down piece by piece first of all we're talking about Tesla a company with zero debt 20 billion dollars and absolutely terrific cash flow and the best margins in the business they're not going bankrupt now the stock market might not like the stock but the company is doing just fine and it's not in any risk I've seen a lot of bozos on YouTube make thumbnails for clicks with Tesla going bankrupt this is absolute horseshit fud ignore it if you see somebody talking about the Tesla bankruptcy usually that's an idiot now first of all let's talk about what Adam Jonas said now Adam Jonas is an analyst for Morgan Stanley right now he's one of the most famous Tesla bulls and he put out a note saying something absolutely asinine I'm not gonna lie because the Dude slashed the Target price from 330 dollars per share to 250 per share and the rationale was that Tesla is going to extend its lead over its competition in the Eevee Market in 2023. now to me it sounds like he was trying to do the old Russian trick of sugarcoating a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sandwich now he's slashing the Target price he doesn't want to get the backlash so he's saying well Tesla is going to extend its lead it's like when somebody's rejecting you you know you're a really nice guy I like your personality but I'm not going to have sex with you pretty much so Adam Jonas is again bailing on Tesla this would not be his first time because if you go back in history and actually have the evidence you might find that Adam Jonas has some flaky history with Tesla even though he might not want you to remember this but everything is Forever on the internet so this is what Adam Jonas said in 2019 where the Tesla fad were at its absolute finest in 2019 even everybody was hating Tesla this is what he said Tesla is a distressed credit story and a restructuring project and he basically said don't touch that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now obviously since then he became a bull but now again once times just start to be a little tough you can see Adam Jonas starts to flake now look I just want to explain something and this is not directly directly at Adam Jonas I don't know the guy I don't care about the guy but here's what I have to say analysts are not your friends analysts are not your employees they do not work for you and they do not serve your best interest that's not their job their job is to reflect the current market sentiment their target prices for the most part except a very few like Gary black and a few others are not fundamentally based they're based on crowd psychology they tell you what they think this stock will be based on crowd psychology very little fundamental analysis they kind of Mark it out to be as if some sort of scientific Target price but they're just calling out whatever the street is saying they're glorified Jim cramers so before you listen to analysts look understand this and also understand and that the game is rigged eighty percent of the money in the stock market is institutional and these guys work for institutional investors not for you so you know just make sure you treat it like mainstream media they're just there to throw you under the bus and kind of confuse you mostly when they tell you to sell and everybody is in the panic panic panic mode look at what the Institutional Investor is doing check an Institutional selling check institutional buying usually they sell when you are following into stocks and they buy when you are panicking out I mean check me on this and see now look Adam Jonas is just one example let's move forward here because it's not the main story here while this was going on Elon Musk actually sent an email to everybody in Tesla and what he said was very interesting he said that he believes that Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world long term he said that he wants Tesla to push out Q4 as much as match match by the way in Russians is ball I don't know if this is Freud or not he wants people to push out the deliveries as fast as possible so they get a strong finish to Q4 and he also said in the PS at the end of the letter ignore the stock market craziness none of this matters if we execute if we deliver if we have great margins the stock market craziness will go away it's absolutely meaningless now a few things here number one I completely agree with this final statement yeah the stock market what's going on with me today I can't talk the stock market craziness is absolutely irrelevant to the performance of the company if the company keeps performing it's going to keep bidding expectations like it did in the previous quarter the price will go up you can't cater to crowd psychology you have to focus on succeeding on the court 100 agree with what elon's saying here now there's a lot of thought about this letter and I feel like it's unjustified a lot of bozos Again on YouTube on Reddit on other social media are talking about that this letter is a show of panic from Elon Elon is sending out this letter he's panicking no my guy check the history every year for the past five years Elon is sending out a similar letter at the end of each year this is an annual thing for Tesla this is nothing unusual so relax with the flood anytime you hear people talking about oh it's a panic move chill it's a usual standard Elon end of the year email if anything the email shows me that elim's more concerned about bidding expectations for deliveries than what's going on in the stock market look the final topic today is Tesla is up today a little bit at least in the pre-market as of the recording of this video the question is does this change anything does it mean the Tesla is going to run up again probably not you got to remember we're going into very tough two years the FED will keep raising rates in 2023 2024 is going to be elevated interest time as well so the next two years are not going to be good from a macroeconomic perspective this change is nothing for Tesla investors long term because we know the next two years are going to be rough but it doesn't change our thesis for the long term does this six percent mean that we're going to run up again to previous highs probably not but for me it's another sign that if a company goes down by five percent to one day six percent up the other day it's a lot of unnecessary volatility if you try to time this you're probably you know you're playing a losing game I would just you know if you hate Tesla get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out if you love Tesla stay in this is absolutely meaningless in fact I don't think we're going to see anything dramatic in the market before people you know most of the Traders are now are passed out nobody's going to be working until the 4th or the 5th of January so the market is going to be pretty flat anyways before that in any case this is a long-term investing now one behind the point I want to explain here about Tesla a lot of people are Panic selling right now Tesla and that's fine if you don't believe in the stock you don't believe in Elon sell there's plenty of other options but I want to explain the concept here which I think Gets Lost in Translation when you're shopping for a convertible car when would be the best time to buy the car when you're shopping for or a winter jacket when would be the best time to get the best deal on that jacket you probably want to buy a convertible car in the winter time because not a lot of people are buying the demand is low the price will be lower you probably want to buy a winter coat in the Summer where the demand is low you'll get a better price why are you guys who are fans of Tesla not talking about people who hate Tesla if you're a Tesla fan and you want to be a shareholder of this company why are you annoyed of the fact that this is winter time right now and you get to buy a convertible for cheap so that when summer comes in you can actually drive and enjoy it and you actually play pay 30 less so that mentality is something that very obvious to me but I don't understand what people are annoyed that their favorite stock that fundamentally is doing better than ever is now cheaper I don't understand that honestly I don't and I know a lot of people hate Tesla hate Elon and they think it's a trash talk and they use it to bash the stock in England and people who like the stock I don't care their opinion is irrelevant but I'm talking to people who like Tesla and they're annoying about this come on guys you know understand what's going on here GM and Ford are drowning in debt Tesla has literally zero debt they're 20 billion dollars in cash best margins in the business double margins the GM and Ford they're killing it they're growing 50 a year and right now they're in a massive 70 discount because this is winter and you're actually you know buying convertible think about it.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,zKhUczqxBDM,2022-12-28T23:16:22Z,Tesla's Collapse,Tesla,"what the hell is going on with Tesla right now this stock is down 70 year to date oh my goodness what A bad month what A bad year it is up today by almost two percent but goodness gracious now in this video I'm going to answer a question that a lot of you are wondering because a lot of you have Tesla stock or considering investing or considering to sell whether it's the right time to sell the right time to buy or just the right time to keep holding on. The only person that I've seen in the news right now from the high profile investors that are still loading up heavily on Tesla at this point it's Kathy Wood. I'm not even sure that it's good for Tesla that she's buying so much because she's already kind of becoming the negative Catalyst or the negative indicator for any stock she touches. Look fundamentally speaking the first thing you have to look at is price to earnings with Tesla. Price to earnings with Tesla have traditionally been you know unhinged from from fundamentals and rightfully so I think still it is hands down the best company in the stock market right now easy but the problem is that even though it's currently at a historically low PE of about 30 and forward p is actually even sub 30. Even though you know for Tesla 30 is low it's not an objectively low number in this bear market so this is not some automatic indicator where you mortgage your house and buy more Tesla stock NOW. Unfortunately for long-term Tesla investors I have bad news for you this isn't going to change in the next couple of years. Tesla will keep suffering from that, especially when Tesla still doesn't have a 27 28 000 car to compete with the Toyota Corollas and the Honda Civics and whatnot. How low can Tesla drop because if the next couple of years is going to be tough I want to explain to you what is the downward exposure I'm bullish on Tesla I'm a long-term investor but you have to understand that if you are staying for the next couple of years it's going to be a bumpy ride. If the Fed decides to continue with its restrictive monetary policy for longer this is probably a huge exposure that you have to accept as a long-term investor in Tesla. If you're not willing to accept the possibility of losing another 50 on your Tesla stock from this point on in the next two years probably not a good idea for you to invest. Why not just sell and wait two years and repurchase Tesla? This is definitely not the right time to go into margin, definitely not a stock like Tesla which will be erratic in the next couple years. If you're that sort of person and Tesla is very very interesting I'm not gonna lie look at the numbers here and they have some of the data here it's very interesting so this stock is phenomenal. It has 21 billion in Revenue in the previous quarter It produced 350 000 cars last quarter and it's it beat expectations again seven and a half percent beat above expectations on revenue ebitda is up 68 revenue is up 56 percent. The EV Market the global EV Market is expanding even though they have more competition but there's more you know more time more total market so how low do you think it will go in the recession will it take a hit most likely I mean it's probably not going to keep growing like this if the market is going to go absolutely soft but ask yourself this question if we are talking about a 20-year strategy who's going to be around in 20 years and who's going to be actually dominant is it going to be Ford or GM or any of these companies or it's going to be Tesla? It's very hard to build an argument why Tesla is not one of the best companies in the world right now. You might make an argument that Tesla's stock is too expensive you might make an argument that the recession is going to wreak havoc on its supply chain and its demand you might make an argument that the stock might drop lower and you will be able to pick it up cheaper. I think trying to time this company is just not a good idea. If you do not think that Tesla is a generationally great company at least like a top five company in the world right now this is not a good time to speculate on the stock. If you think that this company is probably I would say in the top five companies right now to invest in and you have money to lose which is not going to bankrupt you and you're willing to stay the course for the next 20 years then this is a very interesting opportunity you should look into. The fear I'm seeing in the market right now as far as Tesla stock seems to be more psychologically driven than anything fundamental even though you might make an argument about a recession slowing down Tesla but how much do you think is going to slow down I mean this company is kicking but. Do not make a decision based on psychology or fear or greed it's always a bad idea to fall more into a stock and this is a bad idea to sell into panic try and analyze the stock fundamentally and try to figure out if this is a good investment for your 20-year plan based on what it's doing based on what is planning based on the numbers look at the ebitda look at their financials look at their plans try to figure out what they're doing as far as their Tam expansion more plans Battery Technology production technology.",1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,1d08iOdJSnw,2022-12-28T15:16:56Z,The Real Estate Crash 2023,Federal Reserve,more importantly does this mean that the next Real Estate crash is now inevitable well you're not going to like my answer because what happens to the real estate market is going to be heavily impacted by the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve at least in the next couple of years generally they have an inverse relationship meaning that when one goes up the other tends to go down and vice versa I'm sure you all have friends like that now low interest rates have always been very accommodating to mortgage takers it's quite simple right when interest rates are low potential home buyers get to borrow more money at a cheaper rate which naturally drives up demand for housing and increases prices this party mode causing the housing market to absolutely unhinge from fundamental analysis and valuations has to end at some point because like any other party at some point it has to come to an end and that end usually happens when the script flips and the interest rates start climbing then the borrowing becomes much more expensive which reduces demand and drives down real estate prices now when Paul volcker took over the chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1979 the United States was battling one of the worst cases of inflation in history volcker believed that raising interest was the necessary evil it would make borrowing more expensive and will surely slow down the rate of economic growth in the US but it would also reduce inflation significantly so he kept raising and he kept raising all the way to 20 interest in 1981. Now volcker's actions made him an absolute Legend the rate of inflation which was at around 13 in 1971 fell to just three percent in just two years although the US actually went into a deep recession in the early 80s Paul volcker is still widely regarded as having saved the US dollar and the economy but re-establishing The credibility of the Federal Reserve so that raises the question what happened to the real estate prices during those years of elevated interest well during those few years the average 30-year mortgage in the US went up to a whopping 18 in 1981 which is three times higher than the current rate of 6.8 percent now data from the National Association of Realtors existing home price index shows that the median price of an existing home in the US during those times declined by 25 from 1979 to 1982 25 now existing home sales during those years declined from a peak of six and a half million in 1979 to 3.5 million in 1982 it declined of 46 in volume now there are plenty of other examples but you get the point interest rates have and always had a significant impact on the demand of housing the number of property sales and naturally home prices one might argue though that the Paul volcker days were too extreme for us to draw any conclusions about what's going on right now because Walker was you know the most aggressive Fed chair in modern history and pal is the transitory guy right how can you even compare well let's test this assumption with actual data in his tenure volcker raised rates by nine percent in two years that's a four and a half percent increase per year in average now how different is pile from that Powell started with zero percent in the beginning of 2022 and he ended it with 4.25 percent not that much different at all in fact the current pace of interest rate increases is the fastest we have seen in the US since volcker faster than 1988 faster than 94 faster than 2000 faster than 2004 definitely faster than 2015. so I would say there's a hell of a lot of similarities between volcker and the 1981 era and the current 2022 situation so unless the Federal Reserve dramatically changes its policy and decides to ease the pressure 2023 we're headed into a very very similar real estate market that we got in 1981 when it dropped 25 percent now the question is How likely is the Fed to slow down its current pace of interest rate increases because the current rate is the highest we've seen in 15 years inflation is slowing down so there is a chance that we are at the tail end of this but it's as much of a chance as the Miami Dolphins winning the Super Bowl next year possible but extremely improbable why well we're still a long ways away from being back at normal inflation did come down significantly over the last half of 2022 going down from 9.1 in June all the way to 7.1 in November but it's simply too little too late the current seven percent inflation rate is still a multi-decade high and remains three and a half times higher than the two percent inflation fed is actually targeting so unless the FED will accept a high rate of inflation as normal Dropout will continue to be extremely aggressive now the current interest level is the highest since December 2007. and it seems to be just the opener of what's to come in his December speech John Powell the guy who makes car salesmen seemed credible and whose sole purpose is to sugarcoat the situation said that he expects two percent inflation to happen in 2025. so at the most optimistic scenario which he's peddling this means High interest for another two years from now and as long as the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest at the fastest Pace in the last 40 years the housing market will continue to be squeezed by higher mortgage rates the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage right now is 6.8 percent the highest since 2008 and double than what it was just one year ago and with higher interest rates in 2023 this means one thing this is not getting any better in 2023 or anytime soon at least not for the housing market having said that you might think that I'm gonna say that the market crash of Epic Proportions is absolutely unavoidable but that's not exactly the case I'm going to surprise you a real estate market slowdown will happen this is a foregone conclusion at this point it will go as far as the FED will take it with its restrictive monetary policy I just showed you how,0.98,-0.4

Tom Nash,63KrTDSJ7Lk,2022-12-20T14:07:11Z,The Problem With Palantir Stock,Palantir,so palantir just hit a new low and we have to talk about it is this the end of palantir stock am I no longer bullish what's going on what's the problem and is there a path for Redemption for this stock obviously as you can see on the screen right now it's not good the stock is down 65 percent over the past year now it's not really different than many of the other tech stocks that we looked at here but the problem with palantir that it has a bigger Hill to climb than the Facebooks the Googles the Amazons and so forth and so forth now if I pull this thing up you're going to see right away that since the last time we spoke about palantir which was a few months ago the share price have plummeted but what also happened is while the share price probably the share also is now being shorted a lot more aggressively than before we went from three percent sure interest to seven percent so we doubled the short interest on the stock while the stock is actually dropping which is not a good sign it means that more institutional investors more smart money is shortening this talk because for the most part shorting is performed by institutional investors and smart money it can be done by retail investors but not very often so first of all we have to talk about what's the problem I mean what are the good things about it what are the bad things about it and what are the ugly things about it let's call it The Good the Bad and the Ugly now first of all the one thing that I can tell you from looking at this here in stock MVP is that revenue is 1.8 billion TTM basically for the past four quarters volunteer generated 1.8 billion dollars which is not bad at all they're a little bit under the guidance which was 30 to 35 percent they're 28 right now but given how bad this year has been going for everybody I'll take it there's no problem with the revenues at 2 billion Revenue it's not so bad that's not patented the problem they're definitely selling now the problem with volunteer starts when you like go and look at the cost structure and the cost structure you are going to find a lot of issues that need fixing and again I'm going to say it right here I said it many many times on Twitter and I'm going to repeat it the fact that you're a bull on a certain stock does not mean you have to exist in an echo chamber it does not mean you cannot criticize the stock it does not mean that you can't point out flaws in the stock there's no perfect stocks there's no perfect spouses except my wife of course it is what it is now I will point out the good and the bad and if it bothers you if you volunteer fan I mean it is what it is I'm not here to run the cult I'm here to show you the good and the bad the new ones so revenue is 1.8 billion but look operating expenses are way too high with 1.6 billion almost all the revenue gets eaten up by operating expenses now ebitda is negative 500 million just absolutely abysmal so far at this point we already expected to see better ebitda I tweeted about this on uh I believe on Wednesday or Thursday and I said hey palantir we're saving the world against terrorism great but how about your ebitda that's the problem that you haven't solved yet and that's the major flaw with the stock right now because before before this thing gets resolved before they move to positive ibida there's not going to be any institutional money and they will not get the trust of the retail investor again until this thing goes positive they will be on the rocks and it is what it is that's the key ebitda has to go positive for them to actually get some traction as far as the share price goes I'm not talking about the company we'll talk about the company in a second but as you saw on this on this channel there's a lot of differences between the company and the stock sometimes company can be a great company but the stock might be not so good now with this company the problem is that they haven't yet turned the profit which is quite concerned and given the fact that it have been at this project since 2017 talking about the business side of things and they've been for 18 years on the government side and still haven't seen positive ebitda we need to get to Gap generally accepted accounting principles profitability much faster than and Alex harp would like to and I I think it has to happen very very soon for the stock to actually hold water now the good part here and again I'm not going to bash the stock I'm also going to point out the good stuff look they're definitely not going to go bankrupt they're not in any danger there's no problems with cash flow with liquidity this company is absolutely pristine as far as the balance sheet the strength the financial strength of the company is is spectacular this company has 10 times more cash than debt they got rid of their debt before the recession before interest rates were higher which was a smart move and I have to give credit to the management they have a lot of problems with communicating with investors but that move was very very smart almost know that virtually know that at 2.4 billion dollars in cash that will allow them a Runway of Ample Ample time to find solutions to the negative ebitda their liabilities are very very low compared to the assets three times more assets and liabilities 10 times more cash than that very very healthy balance sheet but again the ebitda is that killer seal for this company and this is the biggest problem where right now institutional investors are looking at this and saying not yet not yet even though the price is starting to get attractive it's 6.3 dollars they're still waiting for it to come to that positive ebitda site and I can show you exactly how it looks like here in stock MVP because we can go and look at institutional ownership now the stock dropped yesterday by eight percent eight percent now the entire Market was in the toilet yesterday but I mean this volatility is because it doesn't have high participation of institutional investors once the stock is heavily invested by institution investors it doesn't become that volatile because the volatility on the institutional side is much much more relaxed the problem here is you can see is that a 35 institutional ownership 35 is just not enough it's too low for a stock that has to kind of trying to get into the top 50 top 60 companies top 100 companies they have to get to 60 institutional shareholding that's kind of The Benchmark the Golden Rule they're about half that right now with such high 53 retail investors ownership it's a very volatile stock because Rita by definition they tend to be very volatile and not as stable as institutional investors institutional have to go to 60 it's going to take a while I showed you before until ebitda goes positive it ain't going to happen now you can see that the institutionals here are pretty much some of the biggest in the business Vanguard and BlackRock Vanguard owns 7.7 percent of palantir blockwork owns five percent of palantir that's all nice and dandy but we need more institutional investors you can see right here that this is kind of goes against the fat a little bit that institutional ownership in the company is actually going up we went up this was just two years ago at 176 million shares we're now up to 663 million shares so institutional shareholding is going up but the pace as you can see is slowing down in the beginning the pace was very rapid but since last year since September last year so a year ago exactly it pretty much went flat just slightly going up because at this point the institutional investors are saying to the management by not buying more we want to see positive ebitda we want to see Gap profitability not enough to tell us stories about terrorism we want to see the numbers now the other part here is definitely The Insider selling look there's a lot of Insider selling in this company but it's basically because of the very Hefty compensation packages to carp and to a charm sound car but overall there's not been a lot of movement over the past year I can show you if I go all the way to the start and I can show you that despite all these sales a lot of them are conversions like sham Shankar as you can see right here you can see that uh his security is 2.1 million at class A and let's look at class B Class B 608 000. so 2.1 million and 680 000 Class A Class B if we go to page two I believe let's look at page one or two where is this I'm having trouble seeing this right here hold on where do we have sham song or Okay found them so sham Shankar right here he went down by two hundred thousand from 2.1 million to 1.9 million in class a common stock so allegedly he sold 200 000 stocks but his class B shareholding went up by two hundred thousand so it was just conversions from class A to class B again a lot of fun the same thing with Alex carp there's you would go to the last page and you would see a lot of sales but Alice carp Alice carpal scarp all these are sales but if you're going overall you check his shareholding for the year pretty much is unchanged Class A and Class B are pretty much the same almost 50 million dollars of Class B stock and almost six and a half million of class A stock nothing has really changed on that front so this is mainly fud but the part that is not fun and should be taken seriously is the fact that these managers gotta have the compensation package they have to deliver you cannot pay so much for Quality Management which they're doing and not expect and demand positively with the year sixth into this whole project that is the business side you know in by 2017 if this was just a government contractor nobody would have cared about this company this all interest in palantir started when in 2017 they started Foundry with Airbus and that project led to the whole startup that is palantir business the B2B side of it but that business year six right now it has to start showing gap of stability it just it has to now as far as the share price right here I can run it quick to see if but I can tell right now that this company will require a lot a lot of good assumptions here for this thing to actually make sense so let's say that currently they're at negative 500 million ebitda let's say they break even next year let's just be generous here let's say that they do a 300 million in year 2024 then let's do 600 in 2025 900 just for the sake of the example just to show you I don't think they'll do these numbers and and then that's our ebitda right so we have the ebitda and let's do depreciation amortization 10 capex growth let's do one and a half percent populate and then let's do 10 long term and discount rate so based on this which is kind of a very I would say not such a aggressive but not so conservative a realistic expectation if the company actually manages to pull out a one billion dollar ebitda by 2027 1.2 billion dollars ebida by 2027 which means about five six billion dollars in earnings let's say even seven billion dollars by 2027 from two to seven within the next five years they're pretty much undervalued by 30 right now but then again it all depends on the interest rates we can actually show you that if interest rates will will go up this valuation will be much more painful for volunteer The problem with volunteer is that things have changed at the bottom line what happened is that the market isn't really tolerate it doesn't really tolerate any more growth and stories and revenue the multiples of shrunk you saw what happened to every big Tech stock the only thing this Market is looking for is results on the financial side we want to see them beat the earnings we want to see them provide positive ebitda and positive Gap gap of stability until that happens this is going to be a six seven dollar stock maybe eight but that threshold will not be broken until piloted delivers actual results on the financial side I'm still bullish on the stock I'm not selling but I'm also not adding to my position because like the other institutional investors I'm sitting on the sideline waiting to see if this management can deliver on the actually giving us the gap of stability so my position is bullish but waiting on the sideline waiting to see more from this management before I add to my position,1.0,-0.3

Tom Nash,9KRWYFPfl_Q,2022-12-16T19:13:09Z,Google Stock: More Upside In 2023?,Google,okay so let's talk about Google stock you all ask for me to do a DCF on Google here it is I'm on stock MVP as you know the platform I use now daily and we're going to take a look at Google first of all let's look at the cards uh this stock by the way is actually performing quite horribly but not as bad as some other stocks we looked at recently down 37 over the past year over the past three months what's the performance like 11 down I mean yeah All Tech is taking a bidding right now Google is included let's look at my own cards here and of course you can customize your own cards my own are on the screen right now revenue is 281 billion dollars it's growing 17.9 percent over the past year 170 of the past five years so we're looking at Double Digit growth which is very nice for company of this size it's quite impressive actually net income is 67 billion ebitda is 94 billion and cash and cash equivalents are 22 billion that is on par 29 billion so very close I mean it doesn't have a lot of that compared to the cash a little bit over but not something dramatic especially given the fact that it has three and a half times more assets right here than liabilities right here so three and a half times more assets and abilities and very close almost one to one cash and uh and debt and insanely profitable company we know about you know the Google cloud services the the YouTube business the search business I mean the advertising business Google has a lot of business a lot of moving Parts if you look at institutional shareholding of Google you're going to find out that this is one of the stocks that institutions love 63 institutional ownership let me just make it bigger so you guys can see it on the screen 63 is exactly like where you want it to be accompanied this size although this is the little bit alarming part as you can see over the past couple of years they've been slowly criming their position this is the holding of institutionals as you can see they've been going down this is two thousand This Is 2020 2021 2022 so just two years ago they were at 4 billion point four shares right now they're at 3.7 billion so there are trimming that's not that's not you know sugarcoat it there are trimming uh there's more Insider selling than than buying although this is Google so it's not really that important of a metric everybody knows what Google is let's run the quick DCF and let's see where it's at right now real quick so current price is 90.61 today it's down half a percentage point it's pretty much flat so uh let's use the you know 15 ebitda growth in five percent the Precision grow five percent capex growth let's populate let's give it a 10 discount rate over four percent lockdown growth rate and okay so what I get here it's 284.81 which is 214 undervalued which is absolutely insane now we can make the assumptions a little bit crazier and more conservative in you know to make life a little bit harder for Google let's give it 10 growth 10 depreciation number position 10 capex and then 12 discount rate populate calculate even if we go by the most trick metrics I can imagine which is 12 discount rate at 10 capex every year increase let's do five percent ebitda growth let's say Google Grows by five percent ebitda that's it it's still undervalued by 21 so no matter how you spin it now Google is according to this DCFS and the value don't forget though it doesn't mean it's undervalued because you have to look at the macro the macro is not good we're heading into recession Google has a lot of businesses depending on Advertising which depend on you know kind of a b2c business so if we're going to recession ad revenue is going to come down it's already coming down with YouTube so be careful.,1.0,0.2
Tom Nash,HyyWRZh5KAg,2022-12-15T14:30:42Z,Time to finally sell Tesla stock?,Tesla,okay is this the right time to get rid of Tesla is it time to sell your Tesla stock now there's been a lot of controversy about Tesla over the past few days few weeks and probably the better part of a couple of months. that hurts for a lot of investors in Tesla including myself. Tesla has started going downhill. Let's just focus on the stock on the fundamentals of Tesla Let's ignore the noise the whole PR nightmare the the whole discussions the controversy looking at Tesla as a standalone company what do we think about the stock at this price currently trading at 156 and 80 cents. but first of all let's talk about Tesla look we have these cars right here and you can customize your own cards. when I'm evaluating company and Tesla included Revenue 75 billion dollars nice 10 billion dollars is what they did five years ago so 600 growth over the past five years over the past year growth of 60 Revenue over the past three years 200 Revenue growth naturally I'm gonna say that this is one of the areas that I don't see any problem that companies generate massive amount of Revenue 11.2 billion of net income incredible year-over-year growth of 226 percent again incredible ebitda growth 126 year of a year this is something absolutely incredible almost three thousand percent of the past five years as you can see here they have 19.5 billion dollars of cash 6 billion of debt but most of this is not real debt. so way more cash than debt I think everybody can agree to that a price to sales ratio of six and a half 6.6 and asset solubility is double assets and liabilities it kind of checks the box as far as what good fun fundamentals look like right more cash than debt significantly right here it's like three times more a little bit more actually double assets and liabilities positive net income right growth up to what zoo even the growth over the past year 126 percent so clearly this company has very strong fundamentals. The problem with this company and why you've seen the spike or rather the the drop off is what's going on with the Insiders. 44 45 institutional holding for a company like Tesla is way way too low anything below 60 is very very low and institutional investors do not like this company and that's keeping the share price down and until institutional investors won't be convinced that this is a good deal they won't jump in and the share price is not gonna pick up. the stock despite what you want to say about Elon and his behavior and his erratic Behavior Tesla based on a super conservative model just based on the fundamentals if you ignore the noise if you ignore the Elon drama and all that stuff just Tesla on a standalone basis is undervalued by 45 as it stands based on our most conservative model you can think of. I just wanted to come on here and show you that this company is way undervalued and there's still a lot of upside here. let me know what you think about Tesla stock I know that Pete doesn't really like it that much.,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,gbtq3-2BwH8,2022-12-14T20:45:07Z,Powell JUST Reset The Market | URGENT UPDATE,The FED,point number two he said that they are moving to a slower pace of rate increases which is as expected on script we know this really he did say they have more work to do. he actually said that they're targeting four and a half percent which I did not expect them to come out and say. he said that he expects the FED very very important point to hit the two percent Target rate in 2025 which means that based on their current estimate we have two more years of restrictive monetary policy not a good sign very hawkish. he hinted that the next time they're going to raise interest they're going to do another 50 basis points which is also very very important but he said that current currently they're seeing the peak rate for this situation as they know right now based on current circumstances and facts five percent and if we're currently at four percent interest and their Peak is five percent and is hinting and another half percentage points that means that the rate after that it cannot be more than 0.25 otherwise you just exhaust it all you know you blow your load right away so it's basically he laid out the map 0.5.25 for the next two rate hikes. and the fact of the matter the FED doesn't want you to know this because they don't want to scare you but what they're trying to call is to go from 3.7 to four and a half or five percent employment that's a violation of the Sam rule the samurai basically says have a percentage point of increase in the unemployment rate within a year off the three-month average is a massive recession which is exactly what they're trying to cause they ain't in a soft Landing.,0.95,-0.8

Tom Nash,a7KlSG6gPCc,2022-12-02T16:31:06Z,Blackstone Just ENDED The Housing Market | URGENT,Blackstone,so Blackstone just announced it is limiting withdrawals from its 70 billion dollar real estate income trust. Blackstone one of the largest asset managers in the world is actually dealing with the massive Bank Run on its Flagship private read. Blackstone wrote that Redemption requests were above the five percent quarterly limit that is set for the fund. the biggest drop that we've seen for Blackstone since March. Blackstone is much more than just a real estate investment firm right they have over 950 billion dollars in assets under management and this specifically it's about seven percent of its entire assets. and yet immediately when these news broke out the shares of Blackstone dropped by exactly you guessed it seven percent. Blackstone has almost had a limit on the draws that's a normal thing you know they put it in place to avoid having to sell real estate really really quickly and really really cheaply when you're panicking and you're trying to sell something quick you're never gonna get full price. the bottom line here is very very simple black Stones read is a barometer it's a flagship fund right if it's facing Redemption issues that is a clear warning sign though any real estate investor that the real estate market is not only slowing down it's about to hit a freaking wall. but nobody's talking about the fact that Blackstone is limiting redemptions far beyond the original limit it's a huge deal and I want you guys to be aware of what's going on now.,1.0,-0.9
Tom Nash,a7KlSG6gPCc,2022-12-02T16:31:06Z,Blackstone Just ENDED The Housing Market | URGENT,Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT),so Blackstone just announced it is limiting withdrawals from its 70 billion dollar real estate income trust. the company is limiting withdrawals from its 69 billion real estate fund this follows a big jump in Redemption request. now when the 70 billion dollar rate does that I pay attention now irid is a real estate investment trust which is nothing but a fancy name for a company that holds property it makes income and it pays it out to investors the concept is very similar to a mutual fund or an ETF but just with real estate. now most REITs operate like this a property is owned a rent is collected it's paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends. now here's the important part REITs don't pay corporate tax as long as they distribute at least 90 percent of the taxable earnings to shareholders every single year and only the shareholders actually pay the income taxes on those dividends it's a nice little tax benefit and most reads are actually public but some can be privately held. Blackstone one of the largest asset managers in the world is actually dealing with the massive Bank Run on its Flagship private read. Blackstone wrote that Redemption requests were above the five percent quarterly limit that is set for the fund. now this specific read owns about 70 billion dollars worth of assets spanning from warehouses apartment buildings hotels casinos even Office Buildings mainly it's residential real estate somehow they're dealing with a liquidity crisis. this whole  sandwich is a major red flag for the entire real estate investment industry and you have to understand how crazy this thing really is now this is a private read you have to be invited in this fund is only sold to super super rich conducted investors and it's not available for you and me for the general public. if this fund is limiting withdrawals if it's struggling things in real estate are getting much worse than even I initially imagine. now as far as the re they make money on two ways right one is a management fee of 1.25 from AUM assets under management the other is twelve and a half percent from returns which is only triggered once the actual investors make about five percent on their money. now once money is being pulled out out of the Reit and assets are being liquidated to allow the redemptions the fees that the Reit is collecting is going to suffer tremendously but that's not the end of the world for this read. Blackstone has almost had a limit on the draws that's a normal thing you know they put it in place to avoid having to sell real estate really really quickly and really really cheaply when you're panicking and you're trying to sell something quick you're never gonna get full price now the limit is actually there and it's usually two percent of net asset value per month and five per quarter. in October they've received 1.8 billion in Redemption requests that's 2.7 percent of net assets same in November same in December which means this read has exceeded its monthly limits for redemptions for three months in a row and the entire quarter actually. now if there's redemptions limit is being hit consistently every single month now this could be a sign that the entire reaps performance is in the toilet and if the best in the business is struggling what does it mean for the entire industry. this specific read is actually a great barometer for the entire U.S housing market most of its assets are Apartments and if you needed further proof that there's a Slowdown in the U.S housing market this is it. the bottom line here is very very simple black Stones read is a barometer it's a flagship fund right if it's facing Redemption issues that is a clear warning sign though any real estate investor that the real estate market is not only slowing down it's about to hit a freaking wall.,1.0,-0.9

The problem is that we haven't had any kind of catalyst to show that the FED pivot should happen soon with inflation being at almost eight percent still seven percent with the war in Ukrainian Russia with China lockdowns with the price of energy just everything seems to point to the fact that we're still far away from that potential fed pivot when we say fed pivot we mean a change of policy from a more hawkish stance more increasing rates more going aggressive against the market into a more accommodating policy... I actually am legit and I think that the FED will pivot in 2023... What he's saying here is that he thinks that the FED pivot the change of policy from hawkish to more dovish from aggressive to more lenient happens either by the end of this year which is 40 days or the beginning of next year which seems more likely and what he's saying here is that the moment that the FED changes their policy their stance the equity markets will react instantaneously because the equity markets they price in Into the Future so if the FED change is policy now everything will get priced in accordingly and will get a massive rally in the stock market... Jay Powell has has said and we've talked about it on this show over and over again this idea it's a little bit uh maybe like an antibiotic you know you got to go for the full 10-day dose that that on day seven you may it may look like you're feeling better it may look like it but you know if you stop taking it you can get sick again... I was shocked when uh Jim board said you know just last week uh yeah I think things are are getting worse and and now I I'm I feel I have to be even more aggressive he's referring to a statement that was made last week by one of the FED Governors I believe that was the gentleman from Saint Louis who said that things are getting worse and that the FED has to go from four percent or five percent all the way to seven percent just to tackle this current inflation so Professor Siegel is saying I have no idea what he's talking about I don't know where he's getting his numbers I absolutely do not agree... the money supply is coming down which will reflect in slower inflation which will basically mandate the FED to rethink its policy... monetary conditions are still extraordinarily tight once they get to their recognition hey What's Going up uh in the real world they'll say we just don't have to tighten anymore and we don't have to get into the fire Professor... what he was about to say is I don't see them getting into the five percent area so he doesn't even think the FED will ever hit five percent interest which is kind of the consensus right now it's a very very bullish stance on the market... the important part of the index that housing index which for the FED is going up because of the way they constructed in the real world is going down 40 of the core index is this housing so even when you take into account passing on... I'd ask do you think we're talking about 50 basis points or 75 for the next time or or something else and then as you look out to 2023 how you think the FED pivots because part of you know you just mentioned Jim Bullard saying he's seeing the opposite that you're seeing you know Jay Powell has talked about you know just his own credibility the question is there's gonna be there will be a pivot at some point but also there's a bit of how do you pivot when you start to think about those other kind of issues well I think the most important thing I I think it's looking to me like 50 basis points because I think the the data will still come in on the softer side what's more important in that December 14th statement is that a real strong hint of a pause and which is what I think should happen... he's saying that the beyond the 50 basis points which you think is going to be the increase next time the FED lingo the FED terminology has to reflect the more Dover stance to kind of calm down the market from the planning they're in right now interesting given the tightness that we've seen so far um uh uh they need to pause to see what actually is going to happen that would really spark a big rally but even a strong statement that we have seen good signs about inflation and that most of our increases are behind us I think could spark a December rally uh if not then it will come in July excuse me in January... he's thinking the FED pivot happens either in December or January and it's going to start off in the immediate rally... comment below if you agree with him with the professor Siegel or you think Jim Bullard from um from St Louis is right and this is just the beginning of the pain you know comment below let's see what everybody's thinking.,1.0,0.1
Tom Nash,afWEQelOAk8,2022-11-21T20:51:40Z,Will The Fed Pivot in December?,OPEC,and if China actually reopens then the flip side of that is going to be more consumption of energy so without OPEC actually playing ball with the US here which it isn't right now these problems have yet to be solved and that alone the real estate market cooling down the loan in itself I even think is enough of an accelerator to offset that but this is where he's hitting it at the head I think he's talking about money supply is coming down now watch some of the Old Milton Friedman lectures Milton Friedman always said and he's kind of the OG in the community he's one of my favorite all-time greats he's always said that the main thing isn't none of these Supply chains or OPEC or none of this is money supply means inflation money supply is what decides if we have a vision or not... until we can't find a way to work with OPEC to reduce the prices of energy globally this is going to be a stretch I hope he's right I do because it's going to be good for everybody if if we are in fact in a position where we beat inflation and but I'm very very doubtful if we're there here yet or not.,1.0,-0.4
Tom Nash,afWEQelOAk8,2022-11-21T20:51:40Z,Will The Fed Pivot in December?,Smucker's,Smucker's on this morning he seemed to be able to pass this calls on and then some to to the customer base right now right yeah I mean there's there's certainly going to be pass on with without without any doubt.,0.8,0.1
Tom Nash,4DxOTNzj4Z0,2022-11-18T19:02:31Z,Michael Burry: “You have no idea how short I am”,FED,first of all we know right now the FED is heading toward the four and a half five percent interest rate they're slowly hiking up the rates making money more expensive trying to slow down inflation it is kind of working but we just heard James Bullard one of the FED Governors basically coming out and saying look the job ain't done yet we're not getting the results we want we need to be at seven percent now James Bullard doesn't get to call the shots and he's known to be kind of more the hawkish side of things but even if the FED goes to six percent it's a very destructive process for the market and you're already seeing the initial results despite inflation still being at four times higher than the rate the FED will accept as normal which is two percent the FED is going to increasingly be more and more hawkish they're not going to stop because they've already screwed up too many times they're going to push the boundary until they get to two percent inflation and until that happens there's going to be a lot of blood on the streets a lot of pain in the stock market,1.0,-0.8
Tom Nash,4DxOTNzj4Z0,2022-11-18T19:02:31Z,Michael Burry: “You have no idea how short I am”,Amazon,we just heard that Amazon is laying off 10 000 employees,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,4DxOTNzj4Z0,2022-11-18T19:02:31Z,Michael Burry: “You have no idea how short I am”,Facebook,Facebook just announced massive layoffs,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,4DxOTNzj4Z0,2022-11-18T19:02:31Z,Michael Burry: “You have no idea how short I am”,OPEC,the energy Market is going to go out of control Winter is Coming heating costs are going to go through the roof because energy is actually going to be a huge part of it not to mention that OPEC is not playing ball with the us at all and China is actually finally reopening after a whole lot of time of these lockdowns so China is coming back as a major consumer we have winter coming up as a major accelerator for that consumption and OPEC is nowhere near to having a proper discourse with the U.S as slowing down the prices,1.0,-0.6
Tom Nash,4DxOTNzj4Z0,2022-11-18T19:02:31Z,Michael Burry: “You have no idea how short I am”,Walmart,A lot of people like to throw these two numbers at me to tell me why I am wrong number one they just saw the Walmart reports come out and they're phenomenal they're great yes Walmart had a record-breaking quarter guess what that's bad news that literally proves what I'm saying here Walmart great business great company no hit against Walmart but Walmart does great when people can't afford premium brands people go to Walmart when they're trying to save money and by the way great place to save money is Walmart so shout out to them but that basically is a full-on accelerator showing you that a lot of people have moved from premium brands from expensive Brands into Walmart that's just how it works in bad times so Walmart doing better is an indicator that things are not as good as they seem,1.0,0.2
Tom Nash,fv7A1yiptaE,2022-11-16T13:51:59Z,Tesla's Brand Deteriorating? | Dan Ives Interview (LIVE),Tesla,look it's been a crazy week I think for all of us that are Tessa supporters and and obviously we can dig into it I think it's been you know it's it's frustrating in some ways but I feel like we're starting to get the message through like in other words like I feel like I wanted to really go out there and explain how most institutional investors view it now a lot of times like retail investors that are so knowledgeable they'll be like no you're you're you're you you're missing a broader picture what could happen between Twitter and Tessa over the long I don't disagree with that my issue I think many others is like dude they're done in other words like the frustration the overhang on Tesla has gotten to a point where frustrations boiled up and it's it's become a legit overhang in the stock and I think it was it was starting to put it was trying to put that out more in the open because obviously it's a big it's a it's it's a it's a contained situation now but if it continues then it becomes more of a concern do you feel like there's more kind of people are firing in the same camp at each other now more because of that because I've seen like Twitter beef between Gary black and Warren Ridley who like two some of the two most famous Tesla balls like I feel like there's it causing a lot of tensions even within the community I mean time I've been the biggest Elon supporter in test for the last decade I mean there's no one that loves Tessa more believes in the vision more I in my opinion is the most disruptive technology stock in the world you know over the next five to ten years and I think that's why sometimes you get so emotional about it and and because it's frustrating and what I talk about in terms like brand deterioration potential is that you know musk is is viewed so at another level of any other innovator in the world and the problem is when he starts to come down into the Twitter ecosystem going back and forth this you know controversial treat after tweet look he's not no longer a a user he owns a platform so my whole point is okay the selling the stock we get it right it's been well talked about in terms of that frustration it's still a small amount I think the bigger word is like hey what social media experts and like your whole network focus on Twitter Focus back on Tessa I'm not saying he can't balance he's bound SpaceX and and has that for many years the problem here is that it's hit a boiling point where especially coming out of like a very look a very good 3Q relative to what's happened in the industry but still miss the delivery number how to lower it you're starting to see a little Bloom come off the roads in terms of institutional investors you don't need another stumble and then the perception is if there's another stumble ah because of Twitter it's because of the attack you see him that I'm that's part of the problem here yeah yeah I I use this example of you and I we come from the same era uh although people always give me like a 25 I don't know why I'm 42 years old so we're we're pretty much from the same era you remember how uh Allen Iverson came into the NBA and he was absolutely going nuts but because he was such a talented player he used to get away with everything until he wasn't good enough on the court and just caught up with him so I'm saying like with Tesla with Elon being held at such high regard they had more room to screw up than they do now because with everything that's going on right now with Twitter it leaves very little room for Tesla not to over deliver over execute and over perform the minute they hit a little hiccup uh this whole Shenanigans with Twitter starts to basically take toll on on Tesla's perception right PR issues right I mean Tesla is probably one of the most complex neat in terms of like it's China foothold with giga the political Rubik's Cube that It ultimately navigates in terms of Europe uh so the last thing you want is that this little fire in the house that's me being a fire pit in the back of your house you don't want that little fire to all of a sudden start to get into the house and I think house being Castle that that's why we came out to a strong because of someone that is the biggest supporters had patience it's almost it's putting a Line in the Sand being like look we're still huge Believers and nothing's changed in the long-term story however there's a yellow flag now that's up there being like this needs to this isn't signing is in and in terms of I'm not talking about like selling in a stock or the I'm talking about just the whole cross containment or cross-pollination between what has been a train wreck in terms of Twitter as a stock for the last decade and now the Golden Child Tesla you need to draw the lines were you surprised about the reaction you got as far as negative reaction when you put out this note because I don't think people realize this but you only reduce your Target price from 300 to 250 which is still like a massive buy and were you surprised at the backlash from the hardcore villain fans sure I mean look it's emotion right I mean they love musk they're huge Sports just like I am and I think part of it is that but it's no different than like you love your kid do you not discipline your kid when they do so or you say something when they do something wrong there could be you know negatives that come out of that but I'm just saying like my view is it's part of The Passion of the Tesla base I actually love it because so many I mean I've covered stocks for 20 I'm going to Twin second year like so many stocks it's like apathetic right in terms of like the big the passion I I get and also look but then there's there's some many they'll be like you're viewing this over the next six 12 months you gotta view this over the next three four five years in terms of like the the X app WeChat 2.0 where he could take this no one ever ever will deny much success and the reason he's rich person in the world today my whole issue is as an Institutional Investor and our client and as you handhold you cannot ignore overhands that are created because they're real that's I mean that Tom at the end of the day that's the fundamental thing is that is that these are real overhangs and it's trying to basically be like and look we're still buy rated 250 price that we took it off to the reason we took out also a top picks was is like top pictures like could something in the near term significantly outperform if I believe that there's a significant overhead that started to get worse I think that you know that's ultimately that was the trigger there in terms of why we took it off but I don't but in terms of reaction stuff and people take like oh a bull turning Bears it's not bull turn barrier it's a super bull just being like hey there's a line in the sand this needs to end otherwise this is what could happen I think that the in a sense there's a there's a possibility here where you're gonna be right and he's going to be right and this is the theory I want to test with you here sure so you're saying listen this is this you sleep with dogs you wake up with fleas right Twitter is a rat infested swamp Tesla is the is it a diamond why even bring them in the same house blah blah blah all that stuff couldn't agree more now here's where I think you guys can both be right about this what if he stays on for another month and a half two months stops he cleans house he's already getting rid of all these rotten rotten apples kicking people out who are disrespectful he's basically setting in a new culture so let's say he stays for another month two months he creates a new culture he puts in the CEO that he thinks is kind of aligned with his vision and just checks out at that point would you still that's that's too late for you that no that's the Goldilocks scenario also for you that's the best case scenario best case so I think I think that that's where he's aiming I don't think he has he has the interest in Daily operating Twitter I think he's going to get bored out of his mind doing that for more than 60 days 90 day stops no look Tom that would be the Goldilocks scenario I mean he's gonna he'll be on the board he'll he'll have a big focus on he has others with social media that ultimately navigated but look we saw with the verification plan right like you knew that thing within 30 seconds of reading and I'm like this thing is a disaster because I could just say I'm Tom Nash and put your picture verified and then how would they know if it's me or you know so right away anyone that's on Twitter knew that that was not the right thing to just come out with right away and look do I believe that ultimately over the long term must could turn around Twitter and turn into something special no I think of course he could yeah you can't then anyone that's created EVs and Rockets could do that right that's my my issue is in the near term going back to the dog with fleas versus diamonds when they're separate and he's just selling stock to fund that it's at least it's like arms length the problem is is that when you start taking like Engineers from Tesla to Twitter you start CR similar to like a SpaceX situation if you go on SpaceX headquarters and there's tests investors that to me is what I don't love about I like arms length because it's also like there's a negative perception about Twitter and look just put your put your um yourself in the hands of uh institutional Ambassador in Tesla you intentionally because disruptive technology what they're going to do two million units that could ultimately four or five million units you know going down next seven eight years FSD disruptive techno you don't own Tesla to somehow be exposed to a Twitter overhang slash Arbitrage situation what you're in this for and that's why as an Institutional Investor that's that's a huge negative and it goes back like if I'm a retail mess I'm like they're just viewing a near-term look perceptions reality like what do you want me to tell you it's like you could think New Jersey doesn't have the best pizza they do that's a very subjective statement that come on there's something actually I will say I'll give Staten Island slash New Jersey best best pizza and I've eaten some good pizza in Michigan Believe It Or Not uh I've eaten some good pizza in Michigan too I mean there's a few you know a few good places in Ann Arbor so check out the Pizza House in Ann Arbor next time I've been to the beach house huge it's good they deliver late I love them they give it like uh on the Port Norris scale maybe like a seven one no it's the best for me blasphemy oh man I'm gonna go I'm gonna go there that's much better Pizza than Penn State yeah so Ann Arbor actually has a lot of cool places like NYPD and Ann Arbor's a sick City yeah yeah it's an amazing City so uh going back before we go deep because we go without that route of Ann Arbor Michigan Penn State we get lost in that um so I Had Gary black here on the show just two weeks ago I love Gary also pragmatic guy analytic no no emotions yeah and I asked Gary the same question about to ask you and I'm going to tell you his answer so Ask Gary why are institutional investors shying away from Tesla and he said one thing Tom and one thing only is the key man risk it's just too much of it with this I I it's never been an issue because that's the biggest asset is must but now with Twitter there's a discount to Tesla's stock that started to be reflected because if you said to me right now Tesla 200 to share like what's musk worth like per share I'd say of any company in in the in the market he as a percent of the stock is it is exorbitantly more than anyone no CEO founder is anywhere near him the percentage because most CEO have found I mean of course like well then you'd go down to like in the Della a cook you know I mean of course there's yeah there are names that are like hugely associated with stories not even Steve Jobs back in the day you know Steve Jobs look but you start the end today because he left he left he came back and nothing happened like uh no but Steve Jobs but but how about this I'll put it up there in the scene we don't no one's sitting there with an iPhone if it's not for Steve in other words like Steve Jobs like when he came back to Apple and obviously covered and saw it like back and like when I go back to like it was six or seven launched the iPhone which Steve Jobs was so associated with the Apple story yeah it's a big reason that apple is who it is today just go back to the musk and that's it but remember jobs wasn't randomly working on other things now musk everyone knows musk could he's the Jack of all trades he's the best Bluetooth we've ever seen best multitasker that we've ever seen But even musk admitted over the last week look it's this has been a lot to handle and I think like my whole point goes back to time like your scenario like let him be involved have others focus on Twitter he will still be involved I just don't want to be sitting here with Tessa as one of our favorite favorite memes you know for the last decade and obviously going forward to now team the story which is the golden unique story that I've seen in the last 30 40 years because of this because of ultimately a deal that he couldn't get out of right and ultimately you know legally speak and he had needed to ultimately own it but he's gonna try to turn around but I just don't want I I I just don't want you know this to to team the broader testoster story now in terms of like tasks like fundamentally like on Pace or a very strong Q4 yeah you've seen what's happened in China even Luciano covid which is positive you know can you start to can you get to growth rate it's 45 48 for the year you go into two million deliveries into next year higher margin because of what's happening in terms of production see what what makes it more frustrating is like the story The the let's call it like uh there's almost like three phase to attach the story first phase Skeptics haters this they got through came out became a trillion dollar market that happened the the second phase is happening now it's about scale EV is really starting to see broad adoption within us and of course even next level in terms of China and Europe tests are so well positioned production ramping around the world of course we have Austin Germany as well the last thing you want just as this is happening is to have this little kind of Albatross whatever like barking like annoying dog whatever you want to call it like impacting this I had the similar sentiment from Gary when he was here he was basically saying guys this is our biggest position in the future fun I mean we're fans we're not being like hateful and it's not more than it's not even just fans like I'm I'm the biggest supporter of Tessa that you ever find but also Tom knocking sometimes people like they'll compare as I'm like well this person you know they don't care and their price Target is right I might go up man like part of how we've gained credibility on Wall Street for the last 22 years is we see it and we say it like we see it we're not smoke and mirror wearing a rose-colored glasses so if I see something I'm gonna say it now people you know they might be like ah unfollow or the fiend let's see this and however they phrase it which go back to this in 18 months yeah this will age well dude the point is I'm the biggest supporter that's theirs but like this is a problem and it needs to be contained yeah I agree I agree with that point you know just is the evidence of that we've been on for 20 minutes talking about this we haven't said a word about Tesla deliveries no fundamentals the margins nothing all we've talked about so 20 minutes is this that's proof Tom when I get called for institutional Masters on daily basis I'm talking about this situation ninety percent of the time instead of being like hey deliveries in China what do you think the month over month could potentially be what about the some of the logistics hey what's happening on some of the Battery Technology a FSD I'm saying like the core parts of the hey how's Austin Ram do you still feel good about cyber truck second half of 23. what do you have in your model but speaking about that shifting focus a little bit to the more fundamental side of Tesla which I think are you right it's getting so much overlooked now because of the drama that there's Twitter um one thing that perception's reality yeah but I personally think he'll turn to it around I couldn't really see it happening I mean I'm very active on Twitter you are active on Twitter I can see a different vibe on Twitter than before in this like FTX collapse drama the way it's been covered on Twitter more than anywhere else that's kind of a post Elon non-moderated environment I covered Twitter as a public com the biggest problem with Twitter no one disputes how much is on we're all on Twitter yeah how do you monetize it how do you get advertised on it yeah and how do you balance content moderation yeah with advertisers those are the Rubik's Cubes but if I told you 10 years ago or 15 years ago you could be making money off of rockets privatizing NASA and electric cars you would have been very like anybody I've been I would have been very skeptical I mean he figured out a way to monetize that he will find a way he will find a way to turn this around I just don't want him to do this at the expect where others that know this do it and even from perception so Tom we're on the same page it's just I just don't want this next three to six month period be a constant for no reason we're already in a you know softer macro jittery risk assets yeah especially like Tesla is not going to be dry when everybody else will get wet if we are heading into the sessions I mean that's just a fact uh you have to like accept that and because they're not selling at twenty five thousand dollars but I think that numbers those numbers have already been reflected in the stock they ripped the Band-Aid off they're not going to hit the 50. you could see the share price for affecting that for sure everybody knows that but that's gonna be at a premium yeah yeah I agree with that so that's the part it's like does that annoy you you what you just mentioned right now is my biggest pet pee with the haters because they will say I'll buy it when it catches up with the PE catches up with the normal it will never catch up it will it will always work premium Ruth remember this goes back first of all like heaters heaters of Tesla look a lot of it becomes emotional it it's but but at the end of the day like you're never gonna see the switch and they'll but I just always go back to like so that's gone from 100 million to a trillion that's like being like negative on Mahomes coming out of the draft being like he's gonna be terrible but you're still trying that's like Brady in the 2000 draft sixth round being like dude that was I I I'm still not a Believer so the point is like look that's just never gonna happen but you know did you see the Brady resume that he made he was passing out resumes in Ann Arbor for before the draft because he he didn't think he would get dropped that combined with when he runs his 40 is one of the best yeah yeah it's terrible it's a horrible look no but Tom but Tom the point is Tesla is always gonna trade in my opinion as a disruptive technology mean not an auto yeah so those uh this is what Toyota trades at this this is what they don't understand it's so different than like those are the same that say apple is a hardware company it should trade it 13 times PE my view is apple is the best brand in the world consumer to some of the parts that's why it's worth you know three trillion it is I'm just trying to walk through um you know these are ultimately the differences in how you look at names and that's ultimately it's what makes a market it's funny you should mention apple and Tesla in the same discussion because they're the only two companies in history that have been able to successfully Mass sell value over price I've never seen it done in other areas except for these two companies and then I can also tell you Microsoft does it in in the Enterprise in the Enterprise yes for sure so actually that's why I I would view it like Microsoft Apple and Tessa those three but in Enterprise like there's more the the budgets are bigger yeah for consumers like think about it they'll they'll sell it every year by the way my daughter did the hard so it's not so I love that she made me a little hard but I'm just so bad yeah I need to get one but uh this for a thousand bucks which is essentially the same phone every year uh that's you don't sell Hardware no Hardware costs a thousand dollars per year for the same identical phone and um but but then it goes back to the whole Apple it's the brand in other words if you're in Sydney Paris and New York you walk on the three main streets you see next to the hermit the Apple Store it's brand right yep Tesla the brand for a comment doesn't formally Market it's the brands the brands everything right and you know you could argue like that's what companies like like a rivian or trying to create down the road from a brand perspective and you're afraid of the things that might come in from the Twitter side and again now it's not that like it it start it's just more the more on an everyday basis that he's out there not just the user owning the platform I just view it as it's something where like the Clock Struck 12 for Tesla investing you know for institutional in fact yeah you we gotta like we need church and state separation here is there like what does Ila need to do in the next obviously that's not gonna happen overnight but if Ellen wants to actually get to 60 65 institutional ownership in Tesla which is still a long ways away uh what does he have to do in the next year to get it done in your opinion as far as McDonald's I think there's three and there's three things one you you gotta show the path and we could argue price points to two million units in 2023 because when you start to get toward two million units the scale of the story starts to change dramatically so I think that's one and then I'm not saying if it's 2.1 1.9 but I'm just trying generally like in the neighborhood of that that neighborhood two Battery Technology show me Innovations that now are further and further separating Tesla from everyone else and that's going to give them more of a leg on margins and overall of a moat and financial performance in what's now starting to be like a rigidity the entrance that's two and three like do a buyback mm-hmm because it goes back to the whole like show me that you who we like all all I have to do is like you're selling stock selling stock this I'm defending you know I'm just walking yeah walk the walk walk to us yeah dude don't talk to walk to Walk yeah and and the other thing that I view is like from an Institutional perspective is like the technology days and The Innovation days are great awesome they're huge parts of the longer term tests of story I do think sometimes from like an investor perspective their not phenomenally timed they they sometimes like they put too much like stuff out there where then like the haters and the shorts be like oh you said you're gonna do this and now it's two years later and we're not that so also I think like putting timelines on things um is a negative and there's like you could talk about things but when you start to put timelines on like oh we should have this over next year or over the next 18 months and that that puts artificial timelines which sometimes create overhangs in the store yeah and uh that sounds very reasonable to me I think that the absolutely needs more institutional participation to stabilize this stock a little bit because it's that's the next growth stage right when you go to through stock maturity right you need more and more stability than that front but also the things Tom like you're talking about a modern day Albert Einstein Thomas had to say so the point is like you know it's very easy from like uh you know sit here from 30 000 feet up feeling you should do that the guy's building EVS rockets and he just bought Twitter so so the thing is is that like no one will deny that it's just like we're just talking as like you know similar like Gary's talked about ultimately what I think are keys to lay in the groundwork for the stock to get re-rated and fundamentally to to drive volume in the name yeah because uh looking at it like if we would have analyzed Tesla strictly as a auto manufacturer they're already the best one out there because you look at the economies of scale so they're at one eighth of what Toyota produces a year one ninth they have better margins at this point imagine like what happens next they have the best brand loyalty in the business as far as I can think of and they have software Advantage they have the best software in the business best battery Tech in the business and they have the quickest fastest production uh so across the board is perfect but also I view it as like it's comparing Peter Luger's to like Five Guys in other words like we're talking premium premium brand software vertical ecosystem and it goes back to like my issue like my view and look even though it's something like they'll they'll hate it whatever but like my viewers would say like even like names like GM and Ford and I know like as soon as I say that people like do you can't look you start to get more software ecosystem more Battery Technology the multiple on the stock starts to change that's why we're sitting here GM at 40 bucks so it's just like it's very important in terms of just more and more of that software ecosystem within within the so it obviously will come like the FSD situation that that really needs to be you know remedied um in terms of just you know because that's it's a key part of the story and you gotta work with Regulators to kind of figure that out are you surprised at the amount of uh Cloud chasing that's going on in politics like a lot of people are leveraging this FSD for a lot of people have tried and failed some quite pathetic I'm not going to name any names you don't want to embarrass any people but people in the chat can understand who I'm talking about but I mean there's been a lot of attempts to politicize FSD which I feel like is kind of a um kind of ridiculous why are we it's almost like mind-boggling to me so we have been losing the Auto industry game for 30 years maybe more and for the first time in my lifetime U.S company is kicking butt and our own government is fighting against it and trying to help the companies that have lost continuously yeah but I think my view is that that tied slowly changed I mean I think if I used to look like broader the tax incentives or the IRA in terms of like bringing more and more build out in the U.S I I think look the Beltway is always a complex uh ecosystem Right In terms like why it turns and why how when but I do believe Tides changing right in terms of bullish U.S and I think you see it right you know it's like pole star coming into you you're gonna have more and more manufacturers to come in the U.S more building within the U.S in terms of EV I talked a lot of battery manufacturers I think like this is a real see change that's happening and it's going to significantly benefit test I mean I was down in Austin last week and it's just amazing what the Tesla build out and ecosystem has done to the broader economy yeah Tesla has like Austin is it was a great City before but now it's absolutely it's Silicon Valley 2.0 yeah yeah yeah it's funny because the people from California moved there to get away from California now they're colorful nice in Austin which is kind of ridiculous but I think Austin just such a and such a habit of where tech companies want to be because of the engineering talents yep uh you know I think location environment I mean it's a tax friendly environment it's just really it's I think it's a very unique City in terms of uh the build up there and the financial industry I have many many friends in financial industry who moved to Austin from and in my opinion it's probably I mean you could argue me like part best barbecue or best you know some of the best food in the world yeah I agree hey we have five minutes left then uh I want to open it up for for audience questions before I do one last question for me uh obviously you're not only covering Tesla you've been in the stock game for over two decades um obviously we all left our crystal balls at home so we don't know but everybody keeps asking me I don't know the answer whether this is the bottom when we're headed way upwards or or is it still not at the bottom and like what do you think the CPI BPI that's all you need to know cool inflation it's been the biggest overhang inflation I mean seagulls talked about in others like it starts to now be downhill skiing I mean you could argue it's just gonna it's just gonna really continue to accelerate Federal continue to raise smaller going into next year then they take their foot off the paddle that's been the biggest overhang in stock that's why in my opinion like so we talked about the last six months like you can't time it but we're now starting to get to a point where I think it's a more bullish environment for risk on Tech assets it's funny but by the way put your the audience put your questions in chat right now I'm going to pull up as money as I can for the next five minutes and we'll have like Dan rapid fire yesterday I was having a zoom call with my private community and my answer I kid you not and the members of my committee can come in the chat right now was just watch the fed that's literally what I said just the market is all 10-year yes CPI PPI watch the fed this is where it's at 10 years if 10 years of three seven Marcus it's funny you should mention this because it's literally what I said yesterday so we're telepathically yes yes first question rapid fire uh Rush wreck is asking and Tom ask Dan if he thinks Berkshire will invest in Tesla what a great question that's a great question I mean look I think it's interesting that Berkshire invested in semis right for the first time I think it just shows just how how cheap some of these assets have gotten in Tech I think that's important that Berkshire got into semis I'm gonna turn this out about Tesla you know in terms of uh for them but I do think when you dance with Berkshire the fact that they are starting to buy semis is very important in terms of what that says about the broader market for the first time I think ever a question from Isha and a friend of the channel here uh he's from farsats Community sure emotions why change the price no that's a good question like and people laugh like I don't get it what the multiple okay so like when he's like they're supposed to say mathematical Tesla Tesla stock is based on a multiple okay that multiple is much higher than any auto player that multiple a big part of that multiple it's because a mosque yep if there's brand deterioration on Musk then ultimately the multiple comes down doesn't change numbers per se but it's about the multiple and Tommy that's a really important point I think sometimes like there's a lot of us that don't recognize the multiple you pay for tests a big part of that multiple is must yep mine's down,1.0,0.3
Tom Nash,fv7A1yiptaE,2022-11-16T13:51:59Z,Tesla's Brand Deteriorating? | Dan Ives Interview (LIVE),Twitter,what could happen between Twitter and Tessa over the long I don't disagree with that my issue I think many others is like dude they're done in other words like the frustration the overhang on Tesla has gotten to a point where frustrations boiled up and it's it's become a legit overhang in the stock do you feel like there's more kind of people are firing in the same camp at each other now more because of that because I've seen like Twitter beef between Gary black and Warren Ridley who like two some of the two most famous Tesla balls like I feel like there's it causing a lot of tensions even within the community the problem is when he starts to come down into the Twitter ecosystem going back and forth this you know controversial treat after tweet look he's not no longer a a user he owns a platform so my whole point is okay the selling the stock we get it right it's been well talked about in terms of that frustration it's still a small amount I think the bigger word is like hey what social media experts and like your whole network focus on Twitter Focus back on Tessa the problem here is that it's hit a boiling point where especially coming out of like a very look a very good 3Q relative to what's happened in the industry but still miss the delivery number how to lower it you're starting to see a little Bloom come off the roads in terms of institutional investors you don't need another stumble and then the perception is if there's another stumble ah because of Twitter it's because of the attack you see him that I'm that's part of the problem here so I'm saying like with Tesla with Elon being held at such high regard they had more room to screw up than they do now because with everything that's going on right now with Twitter it leaves very little room for Tesla not to over deliver over execute and over perform the minute they hit a little hiccup uh this whole Shenanigans with Twitter starts to basically take toll on on Tesla's perception right PR issues right the last thing you want is that this little fire in the house that's me being a fire pit in the back of your house you don't want that little fire to all of a sudden start to get into the house and I think house being Castle that that's why we came out to a strong because of someone that is the biggest supporters had patience it's almost it's putting a Line in the Sand being like look we're still huge Believers and nothing's changed in the long-term story however there's a yellow flag now that's up there being like this needs to this isn't signing is in and in terms of I'm not talking about like selling in a stock or the I'm talking about just the whole cross containment or cross-pollination between what has been a train wreck in terms of Twitter as a stock for the last decade and now the Golden Child Tesla you need to draw the lines you sleep with dogs you wake up with fleas right Twitter is a rat infested swamp Tesla is the is it a diamond why even bring them in the same house blah blah blah all that stuff couldn't agree more I don't think he has he has the interest in Daily operating Twitter I think he's going to get bored out of his mind doing that for more than 60 days 90 day stops no look Tom that would be the Goldilocks scenario I mean he's gonna he'll be on the board he'll he'll have a big focus on he has others with social media that ultimately navigated but look we saw with the verification plan right like you knew that thing within 30 seconds of reading and I'm like this thing is a disaster because I could just say I'm Tom Nash and put your picture verified and then how would they know if it's me or you know so right away anyone that's on Twitter knew that that was not the right thing to just come out with right away and look do I believe that ultimately over the long term must could turn around Twitter and turn into something special no I think of course he could yeah you can't then anyone that's created EVs and Rockets could do that right that's my my issue is in the near term going back to the dog with fleas versus diamonds when they're separate and he's just selling stock to fund that it's at least it's like arms length the problem is is that when you start taking like Engineers from Tesla to Twitter you start CR similar to like a SpaceX situation if you go on SpaceX headquarters and there's tests investors that to me is what I don't love about I like arms length because it's also like there's a negative perception about Twitter now with Twitter there's a discount to Tesla's stock that started to be reflected because if you said to me right now Tesla 200 to share like what's musk worth like per share I'd say of any company in in the in the market he as a percent of the stock is it is exorbitantly more than anyone no CEO founder is anywhere near him the percentage I just don't want to be sitting here with Tessa as one of our favorite favorite memes you know for the last decade and obviously going forward to now team the story which is the golden unique story that I've seen in the last 30 40 years because of this because of ultimately a deal that he couldn't get out of right and ultimately you know legally speak and he had needed to ultimately own it but he's gonna try to turn around but I just don't want I I I just don't want you know this to to team the broader testoster story now in terms of like tasks like fundamentally like on Pace or a very strong Q4 yeah you've seen what's happened in China even Luciano covid which is positive you know can you start to can you get to growth rate it's 45 48 for the year you go into two million deliveries into next year higher margin because of what's happening in terms of production see what what makes it more frustrating is like the story The the let's call it like uh there's almost like three phase to attach the story first phase Skeptics haters this they got through came out became a trillion dollar market that happened the the second phase is happening now it's about scale EV is really starting to see broad adoption within us and of course even next level in terms of China and Europe tests are so well positioned production ramping around the world of course we have Austin Germany as well the last thing you want just as this is happening is to have this little kind of Albatross whatever like barking like annoying dog whatever you want to call it like impacting this I mean I'm very active on Twitter you are active on Twitter I can see a different vibe on Twitter than before in this like FTX collapse drama the way it's been covered on Twitter more than anywhere else that's kind of a post Elon non-moderated environment I covered Twitter as a public com the biggest problem with Twitter no one disputes how much is on we're all on Twitter yeah how do you monetize it how do you get advertised on it yeah and how do you balance content moderation yeah with advertisers those are the Rubik's Cubes but if I told you 10 years ago or 15 years ago you could be making money off of rockets privatizing NASA and electric cars you would have been very like anybody I've been I would have been very skeptical I mean he figured out a way to monetize that he will find a way he will find a way to turn this around I just don't want him to do this at the expect where others that know this do it and even from perception so Tom we're on the same page it's just I just don't want this next three to six month period be a constant for no reason we're already in a you know softer macro jittery risk assets the guy's building EVS rockets and he just bought Twitter so so the thing is is that like no one will deny that it's just like we're just talking as like you know similar like Gary's talked about ultimately what I think are keys to lay in the groundwork for the stock to get re-rated and fundamentally to to drive volume in the name,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,fv7A1yiptaE,2022-11-16T13:51:59Z,Tesla's Brand Deteriorating? | Dan Ives Interview (LIVE),SpaceX,I'm not saying he can't balance he's bound SpaceX and and has that for many years the problem here is that it's hit a boiling point you can't then anyone that's created EVs and Rockets could do that right that's my my issue is in the near term going back to the dog with fleas versus diamonds when they're separate and he's just selling stock to fund that it's at least it's like arms length the problem is is that when you start taking like Engineers from Tesla to Twitter you start CR similar to like a SpaceX situation if you go on SpaceX headquarters and there's tests investors that to me is what I don't love about I like arms length the guy's building EVS rockets and he just bought Twitter so so the thing is is that like no one will deny that it's just like we're just talking as like you know similar like Gary's talked about ultimately what I think are keys to lay in the groundwork for the stock to get re-rated and fundamentally to to drive volume in the name,0.9,0.6
Tom Nash,fv7A1yiptaE,2022-11-16T13:51:59Z,Tesla's Brand Deteriorating? | Dan Ives Interview (LIVE),Apple,Steve Jobs look but you start the end today because he left he left he came back and nothing happened like uh no but Steve Jobs but but how about this I'll put it up there in the scene we don't no one's sitting there with an iPhone if it's not for Steve in other words like Steve Jobs like when he came back to Apple and obviously covered and saw it like back and like when I go back to like it was six or seven launched the iPhone which Steve Jobs was so associated with the Apple story yeah it's a big reason that apple is who it is today my view is apple is the best brand in the world consumer to some of the parts that's why it's worth you know three trillion it is I'm just trying to walk through um you know these are ultimately the differences in how you look at names and that's ultimately it's what makes a market it's funny you should mention apple and Tesla in the same discussion because they're the only two companies in history that have been able to successfully Mass sell value over price I've never seen it done in other areas except for these two companies and then I can also tell you Microsoft does it in in the Enterprise in the Enterprise yes for sure so actually that's why I I would view it like Microsoft Apple and Tessa those three but in Enterprise like there's more the the budgets are bigger yeah for consumers like think about it they'll they'll sell it every year by the way my daughter did the hard so it's not so I love that she made me a little hard but I'm just so bad yeah I need to get one but uh this for a thousand bucks which is essentially the same phone every year uh that's you don't sell Hardware no Hardware costs a thousand dollars per year for the same identical phone and um but but then it goes back to the whole Apple it's the brand in other words if you're in Sydney Paris and New York you walk on the three main streets you see next to the hermit the Apple Store it's brand right,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,fv7A1yiptaE,2022-11-16T13:51:59Z,Tesla's Brand Deteriorating? | Dan Ives Interview (LIVE),Microsoft,and then I can also tell you Microsoft does it in in the Enterprise in the Enterprise yes for sure so actually that's why I I would view it like Microsoft Apple and Tessa those three but in Enterprise like there's more the the budgets are bigger yeah for consumers,0.9,0.7
Tom Nash,fv7A1yiptaE,2022-11-16T13:51:59Z,Tesla's Brand Deteriorating? | Dan Ives Interview (LIVE),Rivian,you could argue like that's what companies like like a rivian or trying to create down the road from a brand perspective and you're afraid of the things that might come in from the Twitter side Dan what do you think of rivian another great question yeah well Caribbean I mean I'm a I'm a big fan already I mean I spent a lot of time with RJ in the factory and just uh you know my view of I'm not saying Riven his next test I'm saying rivian has I think a unique moot the Amazon relationship significant they had disaster situation coming out of the IPO in terms of production they've navigated a lot of that they're doubling down in Atlanta in terms of that second Factor I'm a Believer like rivian is a longer term player in EV so I'm very positive on rivian in terms of attacking especially that sport utility uh Trucking Market you can't like some people like oh you can only play Tessa for Ev you like my view is like just how we played cyber security and cloud and like you you don't you can't just of course tell us our top pick by but you have to play it other component whether it's the supply chain the batteries the trucking side people who are buying rivian aren't being affected by inflation not sure understand the sentence no he's saying are you here she is saying basically like it's too exp it's a premium brand it's too expensive they're not yeah but look like that comes down to people like if they're buying 50 million dollar apartments in New York like there's a there's a subset of the population and inflation there's not but but that's why the important thing with rivian reservations went from 98 000 to 114 000. yeah this quarter despite what we're seeing no in terms of churn that's an important number I'll tell you one thing about reviewing my two thoughts although nobody asked my opinion on this but then has to go in a minute so you'll stick with my opinion look uh rivian is a terrific company their go to market strategy is brilliant which is a premium product in the category that has no EVS which is and also the best category in the US which is trucks and the US Auto Market is very different than the European one trucks is is where you want to be at nobody's dominated yet and Tom also RJ very uh you know CEO very Innovative individual uh I'm just a big fan very Hands-On in a very interesting I think they were a victim of Market insanity and the price spiked yeah if you ask him he wouldn't have wanted the share price to spike like that but for now for RJ it was like navigating the storm him and the team made some changes did a good job their human capital is is as good as Tesla's almost as good no I mean I've talked to a lot of people at rivie it's very like they're bent even below it's very very yeah yeah I agree,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,fv7A1yiptaE,2022-11-16T13:51:59Z,Tesla's Brand Deteriorating? | Dan Ives Interview (LIVE),Amazon,I'm not saying Riven his next test I'm saying rivian has I think a unique moot the Amazon relationship significant,0.8,0.7
Tom Nash,fv7A1yiptaE,2022-11-16T13:51:59Z,Tesla's Brand Deteriorating? | Dan Ives Interview (LIVE),GM,but also I view it as like it's comparing Peter Luger's to like Five Guys in other words like we're talking premium premium brand software vertical ecosystem and it goes back to like my issue like my view and look even though it's something like they'll they'll hate it whatever but like my viewers would say like even like names like GM and Ford and I know like as soon as I say that people like do you can't look you start to get more software ecosystem more Battery Technology the multiple on the stock starts to change that's why we're sitting here GM at 40 bucks so it's just like it's very important in terms of just more and more of that software ecosystem within within the so it obviously will come like the FSD situation that that really needs to be you know remedied,0.9,-0.2

Tom Nash,fv7A1yiptaE,2022-11-16T13:51:59Z,Tesla's Brand Deteriorating? | Dan Ives Interview (LIVE),Toyota,Tesla is always gonna trade in my opinion as a disruptive technology mean not an auto yeah so those uh this is what Toyota trades at this this is what they don't understand it's so different than like those are the same that say apple is a hardware company it should trade it 13 times PE because uh looking at it like if we would have analyzed Tesla strictly as a auto manufacturer they're already the best one out there because you look at the economies of scale so they're at one eighth of what Toyota produces a year one ninth they have better margins at this point imagine like what happens next they have the best brand loyalty in the business as far as I can think of and they have software Advantage they have the best software in the business best battery Tech in the business and they have the quickest fastest production uh so across the board is perfect,0.9,-0.1

Tom Nash,gfm9OJDOmdc,2022-11-09T17:20:57Z,"So, Is it finally time to sell $TSLA?",Tesla,hey this is Tom Nash and let's talk about whether this is the right time to sell Tesla there's definitely media circus around Twitter Elon Musk and the share price of Tesla is suffering so is this the right time to reduce your position let's talk about it now yesterday we found out that Elon Musk sold 20 million shares of Tesla at about 4 billion dollars now he didn't say why he sold it but we can safely assume this was done partially to finance is 44 billion acquisition of Twitter and for the past five days the company's Shares are down 15 that's not something that we can actually just ignore because For the first time in a long time given yesterday's dip Tesla shares have an accumulated value a total market cap of just under 600 billion dollars that hasn't happened in a long time so something is definitely up the question is whether this is temporary and you ride out the storm or is it time to get out so let's start with adding some clarity to this whole story this morning Weber Securities analyst and aware well-known Tesla ball their knives said that Elon is losing credibility with certain investors due to his multiple proclamations of being done selling Tesla shares only to sell more shares I mean he's right he actually said that Elon is the most important part of the whole Tesla Story by a huge margin and every move he makes has a major impact on the share price of Tesla and that he absolutely needs to stop the Twitter circus show as he defined it as soon as possible now I think we can all agree whether we agree with then eyes or not that the Twitter deal has not been good to Tesla the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk started way back when in April 14th and in that time Tesla shares have dropped 27 which means hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap lost because of this Twitter deal well hold up a second Tom it wasn't just the Twitter deal the macroeconomic conditions worsened during that time I agree Tesla's dip is no different than Microsoft Amazon and Google in that sense as well as some other great tech companies but in test a specific case a significant negative Catalyst for this drop was also the Twitter deal if not the main one now ilan's attention money his Tesla shares and most recently actual Tesla employees are now working on Twitter related projects all that have made a lot of investors feel uneasy with what's going on right now with Tesla share price reflects that you can't lie so the question is very simple is all of this currently is too much for Tesla should you consider reducing your Tesla position well one thing to remember is that the current share price is pretty much at its 52-week low and although sometimes it does make sense to sell at that low point it has to be something huge it almost has to be like a thesis breaking thesis changing story to justify that normally even if you are looking for an exit strategy selling right on the 52-week lows is a very dangerous strategy especially with a fundamentally great company like Tesla so be careful now the other thing to remember here is that your own personal situation actually matters because if you are done big on Tesla if you lost a lot of money on Tesla because you bought it at the peak it's a very different situation to a guy who bought early and is now up 150 on the stock the portfolio management strategy here is not a one size fit all you know that guys you know talk to professional I'm not a professional financial advisor this is not Financial advice talk to somebody who can analyze your portfolio always remember my grandpa always told me this and no one ever went broke taking a profit especially given the horrible macroeconomic conditions we're about to see in 2023 now that's one point worth keeping in mind as we go forward with our analysis now let's talk about some negative and positive Catalyst for this stock so you can make a decision for yourself now look one negative Catalyst here and the potential reason for you to consider selling right now could be for example elon's public statement recently right he's been very vocal very active talking about politics he's not being politically correct as he always is right he's never been politically correct let's be honest but he's more unpolitically correct than ever right whether you like him or not his public statements as of late clearly are not having a good impact on the share price of Tesla and knowing Elon he's not likely to stop it because it hurts his stock that's not him and for better Wars if you're buying into a Tesla stock you have to accept Elon as the cost of doing business that's Elon for better for worse on the other hand we we have seen Tesla execute and perform quarter after quarter of the quarter after quarter beating expectation every single time as long as the company keeps delivering results investors will tolerate elon's Antics trust me you know they have done so in the past they will keep doing it as long as Tesla performs however if Tesla screws up the price for that screw up due to elon's behavior is going to be much more severe so the question here should be do you think Tesla outperforms long enough well enough consistently enough going forward to override ilan's let's say unorthodox Behavior another negative Catalyst here to consider is macroeconomics the economy is headed into some bad times it seems and Tesla is not going to be 100 immune from that forget about that that ain't happening now this point is more of a kind of Market sentiment not so much a Tesla specific or even specific issue but we cannot ignore it nonetheless if you think the market is headed into the toilet holding loan positions in big tech companies might not be the smartest idea so you have to model your own forward-looking Market Outlook in order to make a decision about any long positions right now Tesla included now one other thing to consider here with everything we just spoke about is key man risk for Tesla that's Elon Musk I've discussed this in depth with Gary black the interview is on my channel go check it out the latest series of events I think highlights for a lot of institutional investors Tesla's kind of over Reliance on Elon Musk as a single entity that's all be all right Elon will be done with Twitter Antics soon he'll be bored with it or he'll figure it out but look at how his absence at least mentally or emotionally has affected the share price so far God forbid the villain word to hit by a piano dropping from the 57th floor walking down the street right does Tesla actually have the management in place to keep going that's a huge question and it does keep a lot of institutional investors away from the stock keeping the share price not as high as it should be so with the whole Twitter story it seems to be more highlighted so knowing this if you invest in Tesla you have to accept the fact that institutional investors are not going to be pouring in into the stock anytime soon so where do I stand on this personally and again this is just my opinion might be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it might be wrong might be the remnants of amendment you know the drill so I'll say one thing sure if Elon Musk simply would shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up Tesla stock would be in a much better position than it is right now sure but if Grandma had Wheels she would be a bicycle I mean both are very unlikely to happen to me personally I don't mind him voicing his political opinions using controversial humor making fun of politicians corporate uptight people I don't care in fact nothing he said in the past six months actually is shocking it's just humor and just Elon being illin it's kind of just not exactly by The Playbook of the corporate world but it is what it is to me it's just harmless humor to me he's the world's best multitasker he's already managed Tesla SpaceX his

Tom Nash,gfm9OJDOmdc,2022-11-09T17:20:57Z,"So, Is it finally time to sell $TSLA?",Twitter,there's definitely media circus around Twitter Elon Musk and the share price of Tesla is suffering so is this the right time to reduce your position let's talk about it now yesterday we found out that Elon Musk sold 20 million shares of Tesla at about 4 billion dollars now he didn't say why he sold it but we can safely assume this was done partially to finance is 44 billion acquisition of Twitter and for the past five days the company's Shares are down 15 that's not something that we can actually just ignore because For the first time in a long time given yesterday's dip Tesla shares have an accumulated value a total market cap of just under 600 billion dollars that hasn't happened in a long time so something is definitely up the question is whether this is temporary and you ride out the storm or is it time to get out so let's start with adding some clarity to this whole story this morning Weber Securities analyst and aware well-known Tesla ball their knives said that Elon is losing credibility with certain investors due to his multiple proclamations of being done selling Tesla shares only to sell more shares I mean he's right he actually said that Elon is the most important part of the whole Tesla Story by a huge margin and every move he makes has a major impact on the share price of Tesla and that he absolutely needs to stop the Twitter circus show as he defined it as soon as possible now I think we can all agree whether we agree with then eyes or not that the Twitter deal has not been good to Tesla the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk started way back when in April 14th and in that time Tesla shares have dropped 27 which means hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap lost because of this Twitter deal well hold up a second Tom it wasn't just the Twitter deal the macroeconomic conditions worsened during that time I agree Tesla's dip is no different than Microsoft Amazon and Google in that sense as well as some other great tech companies but in test a specific case a significant negative Catalyst for this drop was also the Twitter deal if not the main one now ilan's attention money his Tesla shares and most recently actual Tesla employees are now working on Twitter related projects all that have made a lot of investors feel uneasy with what's going on right now with Tesla share price reflects that you can't lie so the question is very simple is all of this currently is too much for Tesla should you consider reducing your Tesla position one other thing to consider here with everything we just spoke about is key man risk for Tesla that's Elon Musk I've discussed this in depth with Gary black the interview is on my channel go check it out the latest series of events I think highlights for a lot of institutional investors Tesla's kind of over Reliance on Elon Musk as a single entity that's all be all right Elon will be done with Twitter Antics soon he'll be bored with it or he'll figure it out but look at how his absence at least mentally or emotionally has affected the share price so far God forbid the villain word to hit by a piano dropping from the 57th floor walking down the street right does Tesla actually have the management in place to keep going that's a huge question and it does keep a lot of institutional investors away from the stock keeping the share price not as high as it should be so with the whole Twitter story it seems to be more highlighted so knowing this if you invest in Tesla you have to accept the fact that institutional investors are not going to be pouring in into the stock anytime soon so where do I stand on this personally and again this is just my opinion might be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it might be wrong might be the remnants of amendment you know the drill to me he's the world's best multitasker he's already managed Tesla SpaceX his boring company 57 Ex-Wives 47 kids whatever project he's doing I mean he's been probably the world's greatest multitasker we've ever seen so to think that he cannot handle Twitter on top of it all I don't know I wouldn't bet against him so fast,1.0,-0.6

Tom Nash,0dProVmDWaY,2022-11-04T14:46:49Z,How to invest in a bear market,S&P 500,"s p 500 is down 23 so far... by focusing on the S P 500 and a few select boring stocks and by letting it write out the storm patiently smart people create Financial Security for ages now over the course of its existence the S P 500 had good years it had bad years it had horrible years it had amazing years but guess what on average it provided investors with about eight percent returns per year. Don't believe me check pull up the S P 500 chart right now and zoom out five years 10 years 15 years 20 years 25 years see for yourself. Now if you're 20 years old right now and you put in a hundred thousand dollars in the S P 500 right now even if you don't add a single dollar you just keep it there by the time you retire at 65 years old you're gonna have 3.2 million in your portfolio without adding a single dollar of capital into this thing the whole time. Now what happens if you invest the same a hundred thousand dollars when you're 20 but you add in 200 every single month, you can afford it right? Well most people can by the time you retire you can go out from 3.2 million to 4.1 million dollars by another 200 per month that works whether you're 20 30 40 or 50 doesn't matter. Let me show you, let's say you're 50 years old and you say that a hundred thousand dollars that's not enough to retire right? It's a lot of money but not enough to retire but what if you put that hundred thousand dollars into the S P 500 right now and you keep it there for 15 years until you retire at 65. And you add in 500 per month. In that case upon retirement you're going to have half a million dollars. Simple investing during a bad Market is not easy, there's a lot of emotions, there's a lot of fear, there's a lot of stress, but if you invest like that if you stay disciplined if you stay consistent you stay patient the data shows you're going to make money no matter how good or bad the market is in certain years. Now does it mean you have to invest strictly in the S P 500 because I use that as an example? Hell no that's not necessarily true. Obviously I have a lot of s p 500 in my portfolio but to each their own. The data shows that a healthy mix of ETFs indices and individual stocks actually adds some more Firepower to your portfolio while keeping the risk to a reasonable level so why not? In fact a lot of people will tell you that diversification like that by doing S P 500 stocks and a bunch of ETFs is actually going to mitigate a lot of your risk.",1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,4LOpRLaTbYg,2022-10-20T21:46:54Z,Tesla's Amazing Q3 Earnings (and Some Signs of Concern),Tesla,so let's talk about the Q3 earnings from Tesla and yes I know there's 150 different YouTubers who already reacted to it but I wanted to take my time and purpose I want to slow down digest it all and provide you with a deeper analysis instead of the usual quick and shallow breaking news style coverage we usually get on YouTube now I mean no disrespect to any of the other creators but it's simply not something I want to offer on my Channel I want to provide more of an in-depth value with my commentary now look first of all I gotta say I was genuinely impressed by Tesla's Q3 results now don't get me wrong this was far from a perfect quarter for musk and crew but we knew coming into the quarter they missed deliveries by four percent now we know what was the impact which was the two percent Miss on revenues now Tesla did beat earnings per share by four percent and the strong dollar must have had a negative impact on revenues but that didn't matter when you are the world's largest automobile manufacturer at least by market share and you are being priced for Perfection and you missed revenues that's gonna hurt which is exactly what happened when Tesla shares dropped and after hours yesterday and today during trading now the real question which nobody seems to worry about on mainstream media is how good or bad are the actual results beyond the slide Revenue Miss beyond the slight earnings per share beat so let's take a deeper look and find out now first let's start with the numbers golly Automotive revenues went up by 55 year over year 28 quarter of a quarter all the way to 18.6 billion dollars regulatory credits remain low at 286 million with a 17 decline quarter of a quarter and a slight three percent increase year over year pretty much flat now what's actually quite impressive is the Tesla achieved a 54 Revenue increase with just two percent of extra operating expenses up to 1.7 billion that's it now that is why the income from operation is up 84 year over year of course from 2 billion to 3.7 billion now this company is getting more efficient by the quarter and you can see it across the board even in metrics like the ebitda margin which went up by 55 percent year over year of course from 3.2 billion all the way to 5 billion dollars now that's even without mentioning the net cash from operation going up by 5 billion dollars during the quarter not to mention Tesla sitting on 21 billion of dollars in cash all that with virtually no real debt I can't think of a company that's more prepared for hard times and the recession and increased rates than Tesla right now now as far as the cars themselves let's talk about it the model S and X production is still very very slim but it did grow 123 year over year with 20 000 units out in Q3 now model 3 and model y on the other hand those are wrapping up quite nicely all the way to 345 000 units which represent about 51 year-over-year growth now what's interesting and often gets overlooked at least on the mainstream media side is what's going on with the supercharger Network now during Q3 Tesla went up to 4300 stations 39 000 Chargers that's a 32 year-over-year increase in one of its major selling points over the competition whatever that is the number are absolutely terrific we knew that right but all of that is already priced in into the current share price the market knows exactly what the present is we all know Tesla is a great company but what about the future based on these earnings is Tesla actually still massively undervalued despite its huge PE well that would depend on how you answer these following two questions and this is where the beef is going to be between the Bears and the Bulls so let's talk about it let's talk about future projections now this seems to be the Battleground between the bullish and the bearish analysts of Tesla and I find it quite peculiar so Tesla said in the earnings call that they expect a 50 annual growth year over year in the next few years which may sound ambitious at first especially given the fact that we're about to hit a massive recession interest rate hikes the current state of affairs of the economy isn't that great so isn't the current share price outrageously High well let's actually examine this without emotions let's look at the numbers so the question is can Tesla sell and produce enough cars to justify a 50 annual growth guidance is that growth actually reasonable given the current market share giving the recession around the corner can Tesla keep this level of demand going even when loans are getting more expensive even when discretionary spending is actually going down and can it even actually produce all these cars assuming they can sell them now obviously even for a company like Tesla a 50 annual growth over the next two years is a very ambitious goal and some of it is already baked into the share price but not all of it let me explain with this valuation any bump in the road is going to have a heavy impact on the share price as we saw what happened two days ago when the share price actually plummeted because of a few percentage points of mess on revenues even though everything else was basically firing on all cylinders so you should be aware of that if you are an existing or potential Tesla investor this stock is priced for Perfection and anything short of that is going to be very painful for you as a shareholder you got to acknowledge that before you jump in now as far as numbers go let's start with production capacity in other words can Tesla increase production that fast well in Q3 Tesla produced 365 000 Vehicles which is a massive 54 increase year over year so as it stands now Tesla definitely can produce at a level that will support a 50 annual growth now based on the card production Pace from Q3 at least this is currently operating at a 1.5 million vehicles on a trailing 12-month basis meaning that if you multiply this quarter by four you get about 1.5 million cars on an annual basis and that's with two factories far from Full capacity so imagine what happens when these two factories Austin and Berlin actually go fully operational that's definitely more than enough to support a 50 annual growth at least for a few more years so I wouldn't call BS on Tesla being able to produce at a 50 annual growth rate now what's the real question here isn't the production base or the production capacity is the demand can we reasonably assume that Tesla will be able to sell enough cars to support a 50 increase that's the real question because if the answer is no that's the shareholders are in the World of Pain now first of all Tesla is no longer the only EV manufacturer in the world let's face it there's no point in lying to ourselves right the competition is still far from brilliant but it's slowly getting better and we can't just ignore that and hope it just goes away if you're a Tesla fan right it will have an impact on Tesla's demand that's just natural beyond that there's only so much fifty thousand dollar cars you can sell around the world there's 80 million cars being sold annually around the world the average selling price 28 000 Tesla's cars are selling at Double that give or take so you can probably push out three four million cars out of the 80 million being sold globally but that's pretty much where it ends if you want to sell 10 12 15 million cars you got to do two things if you're Tesla in the next five years number one you gotta lower the price of the model 3 and the model y can it be done possibly yes because look battery costs are still coming down inflation is slowing down Supply chains is easing up and Tesla has shown real Excellence at pushing down costs and increasing margins at least in the past so I wouldn't just say there's no way for them to reduce prices it's possible but the more important element here and the second part is that Tesla absolutely has to develop a competitor and the thirty thousand dollar category there has to be a thirty thousand dollar Tesla option at least something close to that even the thirty five thousand dollar will be suitable now the good news are they got about two or three maybe even four years because they can probably sell two or four million cars a year even with just the model 3 and the model y x and S out there so they got the timeline to get it done and that's enough time for them to roll out an affordable kind of a four-door or a kind of a Corolla competitor for the global market now Tesla doesn't have a demand problem right now in fact right now it can't make enough cars to meet existing demand so that might change in the future but as far as card demand it's still extremely strong and should remain strong at least for a few more years so therefore my conclusion here is very very simple 50 future annual growth based on what we know right now is still a legitimate claim by Tesla it doesn't mean that this is guaranteed but it certainly means that it is possible and even probable,1.0,0.3

Tom Nash,EQ7nK7S5VCo,2022-10-06T22:05:18Z,The Saudi’s Revenge,OPEC Plus,so let's talk about OPEC the organization of the petroleum exporting countries also known as the oil cartel now it is headquartered in Austria but trust me there's nothing Austrian about it there's a lot of countries there but none of them are Austria now the sole purpose of this cartel which produces about one-third of the world's oil is to coordinate oil prices by increasing and decreasing production you know they make more the prices go less they make less the prices go more you know it's a simple lever you control the price of oil by increasing and decreasing production now in 2016 something interesting happened all prices were very low so the 13 OPEC members actually joined forces with 10 other oil producers to create OPEC plus even better cartel right a group of 23 this time all exporting countries which meet regularly to decide how much they want to screw you at the gas pump pretty much now here is another important piece in the puzzle Saudi Arabia is pretty much the biggest single oil producer within OPEC and OPEC plus they produce more than 10 million barrels per day just getting around that number and they pretty much call the shots both in OPEC and OPEC Plus think of them like the U.S of NATO they are the big swinging banana in the room and what just happened is very interesting after hitting a hundred and twenty dollars per barrel just in June the price plummeted all the way down to 77 dollars per barrel as of the end of September mainly due to you know what we've been talking about for weeks expectations of a Slowdown basically because of the upcoming Global recession right cheap oil this is great for good gas pump it's awesome for the economy it's very important in reducing inflation and it is absolutely critical in winning the US mid-term elections in November cheap oil on the other hand is bad for OPEC Plus members it's bad for sanctioned written Russia and Putin and it's not so amazing for Saudi Arabia but at the right circumstances Saudis have been known to take one for the team in order to help the US think of it as you know I scratch your back you scratch my back not a huge deal right not to mention that you know high oil prices they eventually lead to demand destruction and they pretty much are not good long term as a business making mechanism for OPEC I mean if the prices stay elevated too elevated for too long basically we get demand destruction the economies go down and there's less demand for oil long term so in the past the U.S and the Saudi Arabian government always always found a way because as you know they are allies right they've always been able to find the middle ground and keep prices steady and affordable but what happened yesterday was very very strange open Plus members decided to Slash 2 million barrels a day from production in the move to push the oil prices up as a result the price of barrel went up way way higher all the way to almost 90 dollars per barrel so we know the US is energy independent but oil is actually traded on the global market so our prices still go up when supplies cut around the world and by cutting the supply of oil and increasing the global price per barrel this is going to help all exporting countries say Russia for example to pay for its war in Ukraine it will send inflation flying back up in the U.S after a few months of a Slowdown mainly due to lower oil prices and it will be a big big problem for this Administration in the upcoming midterms this is literally the Saudis flipping the middle finger at Biden's face and smiling but why well remember when three months ago Biden went to Saudi Arabia this was not a social visit this was all business this was no accident he went there to fix now Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader of OPEC we know this right this was a desperate attempt by Biden to repair the relations between the US which is obviously the world's biggest oil consumer in Saudi Arabia the biggest crude oil exporter a relationship that the Biden Administration single-handedly destroyed by publicly humiliating the Saudis in general by cutting ties and by particularly shaming their de facto leader Muhammad bin Salman calling him a pariah due to delegations of Saudi involvement in the killing of the journalists in turkey and that decision by the U.S leadership was questionable in the normal time and it actually even kind of made sense or at least was harmless when oil went to zero or even negative during covet but as it often does the tables have turned and oh my God how they've turned now what happens is the the US have spiraled into a period of monstrous inflation driven in large part by high oil prices all of a sudden the US needs help from an old friend but the Saudis did not even pick up the call and now they just survived the final course of Revenge the moment prices started going a little bit down Saudis and their friends came together with Putin and pushed it back up how bad is this well the oil production cut was the biggest OPEC plus implemented since April 2020 and that was when we thought the world is coming to an end so let's recap this whole thing here right years of relationship management going back all the way to Nixon including Biden's predecessor Mr Donald Trump or president Donald Trump right all of this years decades of relationship management were canceled as part of this new presidential policy in 2020 when Biden actually vowed to make Saudi Arabia pay the price make them the Pariah that they are over the killing or the alleged killing of the journalist Jamal khachogi I'm not going into that the pandemic rolls around right after that happens so we don't give a flying nut about oil prices so we double down on shaming the Saudis obviously they get the message and three months ago after inflation went bananas we tried to gravel and say we're sorry but the Saudis simply ignore and they refuse Biden's personal request to increase production they basically say nope somehow by the grace of God partly by releasing our own emergency reserves and partly due to a global slowdown we actually get a gift in the form of lower oil prices below 80 not cheap but palatable immediately right there and then in what seems to be a perfectly timed screw you to the US the Saudis use OPEC plus to increase prices back up push inflation back up punish Biden in the midterms and help Putin uh this boys and girls is what happens when you confuse diplomacy with virtual signaling and more importantly it seems that we have taught the Saudis a very important lesson don't ever let a good crisis go to waste,1.0,-0.7

Tom Nash,E3yIY5SSErA,2022-10-03T11:08:40Z,Palantir: It Happened,Palantir,in this video I will break down some very interesting news about palantir that you probably want to hear. so if you're looking for some sort of palantir ass kissing this isn't the right place. so then hives from Weber Securities one of the better analysts out there just said that talentier as well as other companies will see a boost from federal cyber security spending. now on Friday then eyes put on a note to clients and said palantir and other software companies are likely to see benefit from increased spending by the US government on cyber security. which would allow companies like palantir to grab significant market share. now first of all I have some mixed feelings about this and you know I'm a huge palantir bull so everything I say here it has to be taken within that context. also I mean we can't ignore the fact that most folks actually loaded up on this stock in the 20s 20 25 range and Devin Byrne and I was one of the few saying how much I like the stock at that price and you know since the stock price slashed and slammed to eight dollars the excuses are relevant for anyone with a short or medium term for investment Horizon this so far has been a fail and even for me is a long-term investor so far this has not been a good performer in my portfolio and this has to be said before anything else. I never invest in palantir for the government business since you know I don't see it as a growth engine for the company anyways. besides the point I don't even know what they do in the government side of things I don't fully understand it nobody does it's a black box. I invested for the commercial side of things which I saw and still see as the real growth engine for the company. I like the tech I like the solution that Foundry offers I think it's a game changer. for a highly trusted and valued government contractor like palantir this means more Revenue better margins and a way to write out the recession that is inevitably coming that's just the reality and if anything I'd rather let palantir do it than anyone else. Now if in that scenario pilotir who is already debt free and is sitting on a pile of cash billions in cash and gold creates a new income stream to compensate for losses that it has in the commercial side because of the recession it will be one of the best companies to survive the storm. I think it's safe to say that those circumstances alone make palantir one of the better position companies out there right now especially if a recession is coming which I think is absolutely inevitable. so if indeed palantir keeps on growing their government sector while other companies are slowing down because of the recession what do you think will happen. they're going to be that one shrimping boat that survived well of course there's gonna be more boats this isn't exactly the same story but you get the idea. but for the retail investors for the long-term retail investors for the patient investors we see something in the stock volunteer keeps on getting new contracts it keeps on expanding existing contracts and it has the government side to back up any weakness in the market. the lack of debt and their massive cash position make it into a company that can flourish not just survive in hard times and I think hard times are coming so I like the stock. listen to Alex carp the founder and CEO of the company.,1.0,0.65
Tom Nash,sqVm6XJYhjU,2022-09-28T21:43:18Z,Rethinking Palantir...,Palantir,so let's rethink the whole palantir story and let's find out if we want to renew our vows or maybe we find out we're stuck in this horrible relationship and we have no business to be in it now look palantir has not dropped so much compared to the DPO price the DPO price was ten dollars it's currently at eight dollars that's a 14 drop that's not a huge deal especially in this market but that stat is misleading because most retail investors got in at 20 to 25 some even higher now if that's the case for you which I'm assuming is the case for most retail investors then you're down 67 percent and that's no laughing matter that's a huge deal now here's the problem with how much palantir drop I think certain members of the palantir investment Community tend to completely write it off by saying well it's just a bad market and yes the market is absolute but let's see if palantir is just a victim of circumstance if palantir is just captive by the horrible market now panettier is trading on the New York Stock Exchange but for all those purposes this is a NASDAQ company classic growth stick and it's on the New York Stock Exchange for historical reasons now some people will have a problem with me using the NASDAQ and NASDAQ companies comparable to volunteer because they are trading on nukes of change in that case I suggest you have a glass of water you take a deep breath you'll be fine deal with it now if you look at the NASDAQ the NASDAQ is down over the past year since September of last year 24 percent if you look at comparable companies like crowdstrike like snowflake they're down 30 percent I compare that to palantir with its 67 drop clearly this isn't just about the market yes the market is definitely part of the reason but planetir did drop double then everything else I just showed you so just to claim that they're a victim of the market without actually paying attention to the actual issues is a little bit misleading so it's not just the market let's be honest before we start this evaluation if you have a problem with me being honest about volunteer and saying the good and the bad first of all remember I'm a palantir bull and I'm heavily invested and number two that's okay you don't have to like me or watch my videos if that bothers you feel free not to watch the video or even unsubscribe it's fine I'll deal with it now let's talk about the good and the bad now there's a reason I think that palantir is down 67 on the year I mean September 2021 September 2022 that year presented a lot of the floating up with palantir and I call it the I damn and the reason I call it the item is because it's easier for me to remember for the purpose of this video so the I stands for Insider selling the d stands for dilution the a stands for arrogance the m stands for margins and the E stands for expensive I damn mainly the argument is the company's multiples are too expensive the dilution is too crazy there's too much Insider selling the margins are not that hot and simply put Alex carps arrogance is not just annoying in fact it might be detrimental to the business these are the main arguments I can think of as far as why people tend to classify volunteer as an uninvestable and yes there are people like that volunteer is a very polarizing company some love it some hate it and that's okay now what I want to do in this video is examine examine examine I'm insulting Italian people right now unbelievable what I wanted in this video is examine whether any of these factors have improved enough for me to say well this is still good enough for me and I can actually see them getting better let's start with the multiples palantir at some point we're creating it 30 times sales counting down to eight time sales with the compression of multiples in the market they're definitely not as expensive as they were in fact you can buy them at about one quarter of the price that you would have paid just a year ago so as far as palantir being expensive maybe you can still make an argument that even at eight time sales it is expensive maybe it is maybe it isn't but it's four times cheaper so it's getting cheaper it's getting better for the purpose of my examination anyways now let's talk about margins because as far as margins here's where I think the biggest misconception is I think if you are looking for a profitable company as far as ebitda as far as net profits I think Pioneer isn't going to be one for a while and if you're looking for that Talent here it's kind of like going to McDonald's and trying to get a salad I mean you can get a salad of it but it's not gonna be amazing I mean you shouldn't go to McDonald's to get a salad if you're looking for a bottom line profitable company you don't invest in a high growth Tech play like palantir their margin as far as gross profit is in line with SAS companies which is about 80 percent but yes they're not ebitda profitable they're not net profitable they're free cash flow profitable sure but I mean they don't try to be the company is intentionally not going for profitability but rather reinvesting the money and going into growth mode versus profitability for Gap purposes and if you actually heard Alex sharp talk about it he actually said it's going to be years until palantir has actually got profitable they're not chasing that so if that sort of thing bothers you this company isn't for you because clearly they're not on the path to Gap profitability anytime soon no that part hasn't got better so so far we have the multiples becoming cheaper but profitability basically staying the same as far as non-existent now let's talk about the other factors let's talk about Alex carp's arrogance now we've saw Alex carp absolutely destroy self-employed and I think embarrass palantir on multiple interviews multiple earnings calls and even though in the beginning it was a little bit endearing at some point it gotten really frustrating because I believe that this kind of attitude started to sip in and to palantir's own business development and sales culture that arrogance and I believe that has a destructive impact on the company and that's not something I won't ever see in a company I invested in now in the last earnings call we saw Alex carp absolutely completely lose it banging on the table saying some really weird stuff like our clients hate us but they have to work with us because there's no Alternatives like absolutely mind-boggling things were said and his total lack of awareness of how ridiculous that was was alarming I'm not gonna lie now I haven't sold my stock but I was like this is not good now just the other day just two or three days ago Alex carp went on CNBC and had what I think was his best interview so far he was relaxed he was calm he was answering coherent answers he wasn't being arrogant he was making fun of himself and he actually was on point so if you want to take that piece of interview that happened just a few days ago and compared to Alex Carp from the last earnings call it's literally a different person I don't know how can somebody go 180 degrees like that but Alice carp has either been coached or he basically got a together whatever it is that arrogance that absolutely lack of self-awareness is gone there's a new carp in town and what I saw on CNBC I like a lot so as far as you know corporate arrogance and Alex carp arrogance that thing seems to be history so that's getting better now let's talk about the elephant in the room and let's talk about the two last points here dilution and Insider selling now as far as Insider selling the look the company is still engaging inside of selling but if you actually review these sales their automatic sales they're essentially part of employee stock option plans but what's actually important here to tell you is that Alex carp the guy who has been heavily selling and put on the spot for that has not sold a single share of palleteer since November 2021. so Alex carp is coming up on the year without selling a single share of palantir so if you want to talk about Insider selling Alex cab is not selling even though he technically can and could have but he's holding on to his shares that's a huge test if carp isn't selling that means that everything that he sold before was indeed part of his payment for his own options plan the one he was granted for the next 10 years but then again we're getting sidetracked here let's just keep it straight Alice carp made no Insider sales for 10 months and it doesn't seem like there's any coming up anytime soon now the last Point here I want to talk about is dilution and if you look at dilution with palantir it can literally screw with your head because their dilution is just insane from 2019 to 2020 the dilution was 69 by the way that's just proof we're in The Matrix but hold on it actually gets better the next year from 2020 to 2021 the dilution was 96 now that certainly proves to win The Matrix because we had 69.96 so they almost doubled the share count from 2019 to 2021 which is absolutely insane and yes there were valid reasons for this which was basically that's how you create liquidity in the DPO you have you know you have the hall we just hired the massive sales force which we didn't have before and we had to actually give them options yes yes yes yes yes and of course Alex carp knew 10-year option plan just expired and had to be reinitiated all that is true but at the end of the day look I was trying to say at the end of the day but some weird at the day came out at the end of the day the second word everybody get deluded and the delusion was almost 2x every single year from 2018 2020 2021. um for the first half of 2022 the dilution is eight percent so we went down from 96 annual dilution in the previous year to eight percent for the first half of this year so delusion is still way higher than standard but getting slower and slower lower and lower by the quarter so palantir does not need to hire as much sales people anymore Alice car plan is already in place so delusion just came down from 96 year of a year to eight percent for the first six months of 2022. so that's also improving now if you ask me again I'm not going to pretend to be 100 objective here since I'm a palantir bull but I look at it and I see delusion getting slower I see Insider selling from carbside non-existence I see carp not arrogant anymore and actually answering coherent questions or answers this case and actually talking to the point I see multiples compressing so except for the lack of Gap or stability everything is getting exponentially better for this company while the price keeps dropping at least it kept on dropping it's up to date like 40 but you know you understand my meaning so if I have to rethink the whole palantir thesis looking at these numbers I'm not selling simple as that now you comment below you tell me what you think share with me your thesis because I think the planetary Community has some of the brightest minds and I would love to hear input about palantiram what you're doing with this talk see you next video,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,28ymXVB7xEw,2022-09-26T11:39:46Z,Steve Hanke says the chance of a U.S. recession just shot up to 80%,Federal Reserve,he blamed the U.S Central Bank for Rising inflation which is the school of Milton Friedman and I completely agree with him the reason for that is because the FED exploded the money supply starting early in 2020 to an unprecedented rate and they don't want this length to be visible between the money supply and inflation so he's pretty much quoting Milton Friedman if Milton frieden was alive he would be absolutely annoyed by what's going on because his prophecies are coming to life pretty much so he's definitely a part of the Milton Friedman school of thought essentially you know it's all it's all the FED it's all the government it's all money Printing and I agree with this completely. And Hanky was critical and has been in the past of the Federal Reserves failure to manage inflation through keeping an eye on the large supply of money sloshing around the US economy. The FED flooded the US economy with large amounts of money. The market is starting to understand that the pal is not bluffing. That unleashed the Wrath of the FED that basically Unchained the fed from any political pressures from the government to ease up because of midterms because of whatever. So now people basically starting to understand well the FED isn't going to Pivot and with an 8.3 CPI out of August they can definitely be safe and not be subject to any political pressures what we're seeing right now Beyond just the market kind of digesting the fact that pal probably isn't bluffing is kind of the usual cycle of how these things work and the FED becomes more aggressive rates obviously tend to go up. Now I will link a video right here in a second why the FED is no longer subject to any political pressures I'm going to put the video right here where the article is right now go watch that video in that video explain why it's good news for the US economy that the FED is now free from political pressures and they can actually push through watch the video tell me what you think I'll see you next video.,1.0,-0.4

This is the pounds here part of the story yeah the parts that we're not allowed to talk about is um don't like that part it's the first piece of criticism I have I mean This Is War and uh it's there's I feel a bad taste in my mouth about sitting there and saying you know they're winning because of our software but I can't tell you about it I don't like that braggy approach again. I think you guys are down 58 this year in your stock price ouch well you know what look bad times are are incredibly good for balance here because you you short out you get the dirt there's there's this thing where you we've been involved with things for a lot of long years like pound just 20 years old 18 years old The Bad Times Really uncovered the durable companies and Tech is going through bad times and there are lots of reasons saw interest rates other reasons but you will see that the durable companies that come out of this in three four years two years how long it takes are largely going to be from America largely from the west coast and they're going to be very focused on producing things that actually matter will will this will this like deadly tidal wave wipe out some companies yes it will and what are you seeing he should have said here but not us because if you look at the balance sheet of volunteer if you look at how much cash they have how much that they don't have which is literally insane that's two assets assets to liabilities ratio cash flow free cash flow palette is not in trouble operationally in fact they're doing better than ever which is what he's talking about because he's basically saying well we're making money and we're growing so we should be fine but a lot of other companies might get wiped out. look we built palantir we're we are it's a great question by a circle employees that got ESO employees.com options uh now the comp that they got with slashed by half I mean it's an issue private for almost 16 years and our share price on the non-private market was going down so like these times in the end bad times help us also because the Alternatives end up being like our main competition is uh I want to be a cockroach holder.com who recruits our people that's our actual competition a startup that is two days away from failing but Engineers don't know it those companies aren't getting funding and so like instead of going to mycockroachtrap.com people are like yeah the stock is down we're doing crazy important things and the Alternatives suck. we we see a big difference between U.S and to be frank probably too Frank the U.S is just completely different than everyone else our U.S business has grown 67 a year the last three years from 233 million to just over a billion the rest of the world there yeah people react Americans for all of our foibos we react to Bad Times by rolling up our sleeves and adapting the rest of the world has trouble with adapting at the pace we adapt so yes our business is being is being negatively afflicted by the inability to uh in other countries to adapt the way they adapt it we adapt in America on the other hand you know we're we're an 18 year old business the last three years our largest uh the American segment is growing 67 despite me as a front man it's like you know maybe if they you know we have a more successful front male we can even I like this carp I love this carp I was spot on timing wise yeah give this man a stage I mean that was per he knows it look at his smile he knows he just nailed that punchline good job carp even I don't know I'm not planning to go anywhere but it's like we're we're despite or because of our various disabilities we're growing 67 a year in the most important most interesting Market in the world and yes we we are not growing that way in Germany and France and other places and good good finally I I think somebody spoke to him bro that was good he wasn't oversetting he said yes we're not growing in Europe which is a known problem for volunteer do not hide from it he was open about it he said it boom credibility right there transparency right there good job carp I mean except one point so far I really like what he's doing on the show and I don't expect to grow that way I do think there'll be a handoff what I think is going to happen is we're going to have a couple years of terrible times uh those companies that are most robust Will Survive and Thrive you'll get credit for it in a couple years and the rest of the world will do what it often does it'll follow what we did well while deriding us for how crazy it is in America.,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,RlSREKcfLdY,2022-09-19T16:50:47Z,Should You Buy Stocks In THIS Market?,Market Sentiment,because a few months ago I saw a very interesting study by market sentiment I'm going to link it below in the description now they looked at the three latest significant Market crashes 2000.com bubble 2008 subprime crash and 2020 mini covet crash and they use the S P 500 as The Benchmark which means the markets went down by 55 in 2000 48 in 2008 and just 34 in 2020. but when the market goes below 10 of the previous all-time high which they defined in the study is the threshold Point each investor reacts differently now Jokes Aside each investor cautious daring and average right they all invest at the same time at the beginning of each month the same amount into the S P 500,1.0,0.5

Tom Nash,RlSREKcfLdY,2022-09-19T16:50:47Z,Should You Buy Stocks In THIS Market?,Fundstrat Global Advisors,and one that always comes to mind is Tom Lee from funstrad who's calling for a 20 rally before the end of the year Tom Lee he's the head of research at funstrot Global advisors he joins me now so you see on Friday Tom Lee said that headline CPI has peaked and he basically reiterated his view that the S P 500 will rally more than 20 percent by the end of 2022. you see Tommy is saying we're headed for a rally because inflation has peaked now here's the problem with this argument even if it is true which I'm not sure it is it doesn't really matter what matters is what the FED thinks about inflation now all that is assuming tomly is right about inflation and that is not something I am absolutely sure about because inflation doesn't just disappear if you agree with Tom Lee who's calling for a 20 rally you stay in maybe even double down,1.0,-0.2
Tom Nash,RlSREKcfLdY,2022-09-19T16:50:47Z,Should You Buy Stocks In THIS Market?,S&P 500,so you see on Friday Tom Lee said that headline CPI has peaked and he basically reiterated his view that the S P 500 will rally more than 20 percent by the end of 2022. now they looked at the three latest significant Market crashes 2000.com bubble 2008 subprime crash and 2020 mini covet crash and they use the S P 500 as The Benchmark which means the markets went down by 55 in 2000 48 in 2008 and just 34 in 2020. now Jokes Aside each investor cautious daring and average right they all invest at the same time at the beginning of each month the same amount into the S P 500 the least profitable strategy was to stop investing during the dips the second best strategy was to continue investing as usual and the best strategy was to double down during market pullbacks now obviously that's the data over the course of 24 years this strategy requires a quarter of a century to pan out but in this quarter of a century cautious made 240 percent while average and daring did more like 330 percent and actually the results were very similar even if investors began investing using these three strategies at the beginning of each of these three crashes so now we have the most important piece of the puzzle beyond the irrationality of the market beyond the experts being full of it beyond the valid Arguments for crash and the bull run at the same time we know the data clearly shows that timing the market doesn't work as a long-term consistent strategy so I guess we can end the video right here just buy the dip and everything will be Gucci right well not exactly listen up because this part is the most important part of the video so we just established that staying in the market is a better strategy long term than trying to get out during bad times and jump back in when things are better but that is just the starting point of the real answer because like everything in life this is also much more nuanced than the simple buy the dip kind of answer but the good news are we finally get to see how Michael Johnson is related to this answer now remember Michael Johnson the U.S Olympic medalist he competed in both the 100 meter as well as the 200 meter and the 400 meter events and he's actually the only athlete in history to win both the 200 and the 400 meters at the same Olympics he actually did it in 1996 in Atlanta Georgia why do I know this and why am I telling you this well look because the strategy he used for the 100 meter run is completely different than the strategy for the 400 meter event it's a different run and it requires different strategy and different planning and a completely different execution in the 100 meter you run as fast as you can like a bat out of hell while the 400 meter is a more calculated patient run you have to be much more strategic now in our example if day trading is like the 100 meter run swing trading is like the 200 meter round or the 400 meter run then long-term investing is like the 42 kilometers Marathon instead of 10 to 40 seconds you gotta run for two hours Mother Lover now that means you have to decide how much of your money will be used to invest and how much to trade and that allocation between your trading and investing accounts is probably the most important decision you'll ever made in your investing Lifetime and that should be maintained almost religiously investing in trading are inherently different and as such the strategy for them have to be absolutely different just like Michael Johnson 100 200 and 400 meter rounds are especially when you compare them to a marathon now for your trading account if you even have one by the way your next move depends on where you see the markets in the next three to six months if you agree with Tom Lee who's calling for a 20 rally you stay in maybe even double down but if you believe in Ray dalio who's calling for a 20 drop you pull out and wait until things get better and as such your short-term trading strategy is basically dependent on which of these camps the Bulls or the Bears is right that's all that is your decision and I can't tell you what to do however if you decide to pull out and go cash or let's say you decide to Double Down be prepared mentally and emotionally to deal with a lot of pain without a formal with major losses that might happen now here's the part I'm more interested in what about long term what about your do not touch investing account shout out to chicken genius now for your investing account you have to decide what is your investing Horizon and what amount of risk you are able to tolerate a 20 year old single guy living with roommates working as a bartender splitting his time between Tinder and video games should not be investing in the same manner as the 50 year old man who's married with two kids and a mortgage now I believe I have very little to offer to do video game playing 20 year old bartender so you'll excuse me for focusing on the 30 plus year old man or woman with families and financial responsibilities since you know this is pretty much who I am give or take a decade now this type of investor is not retiring in the next five years and that's why you know this investor is ready to tolerate some level of risk as long as it makes sense and as long as you know the overall strategy is kind of conservative or at least more conservative than crazy now this is probably the middle ground strategy between the 20 year old bartender and the six-year-old retiree or soon to be retiree and that is what we're going to focus right now because I'm going to show you a framework which you will use to build your own strategy with now obviously this is not Financial advice in any capacity I'm not just saying this you have to do your own research and talk to financial planner before you actually pull the trigger this is just to stimulate your brain so here's what we know over the course of 25 years the S P 500 will go up it might have bad years it might have amazing years but over a quarter of a decade it will give you a nice eight percent per year on average now that means that any portfolio has to be anchored around the S P 500 or a similar index but I personally like the S P 500 more because it's us focus and it's quite balanced,1.0,0.8

Well the reason that was provided by the company is actually not ridiculous they're saying the sale will be used to fund stock buybacks in itself and the parent aspers.

To be fair all of them including buffett and dalio still hold significant positions in chinese stocks so it's not like they all sold out we have to be fair and disclose that right however for me these sales clearly show increasing anxiety about china especially from some of its biggest proponents. The simple truth is that smart money is trimming positions in china meaning smart money is telling you we think the risk in china is getting too hot for us.,1.0,0.7

Tom Nash,ISoVX7Yeo8Q,2022-09-12T13:15:01Z,This has to stop.,Twitter,you're seeing on the screen the twitter stock of the past six months so as you know in april this was the date on which the deal was announced and you can see the stock run up and then you can see the stock run down and then starting to run up again so if you don't remember how things played out basically elon musk made an offer to buy the company in april for 44 billion dollars at 54 dollars and 20 cents now ever since then elon got cold feet he's trying to get out of the deal there's a whole legal proceeding around it we are not going to talk about that but basically what happens is these sort of deals have a name and they're called risk arbitrage deals if anybody is trading right now in twitter stock it has nothing to do with fundamentals the entire behavior of the stock over the past six months as you can see right here is purely based on what are the percentages that the deal will go through at 54.20 that's the only thing that impacts the share price until the deal gets finalized one way or the other there's nothing fundamental here so there's a lot of funds who are actually engaged in these risk arbitrage deals because as you noticed the price of the share which is 42 dollars and 20 cents right now is significantly lower than the purchase price of elon musk offer so his offer is 54 dollars current price is 42 which means if the deal actually follows through people who bought the stock today will get 12 dollars per share in risk arbitrage now those deals are very common and the specific funds that actually engage in this now so far so good now look at this as you can see right here the behavior of this chart is basically showing you what the market thinks about the likelihood of a deal so initially the deal is announced everybody's euphoric boom boom boom boom boom boom the stock runs up all the way to 52 dollars almost 52 right on april 25. sorry and then everybody's saying well the deal is going to go through no problem anything i thought that back in the day i was like yeah the deal is going through no worries so the deal actually falls through and elon gets cold feet and then right away you can see the price starts falling because at this point this arbitrage is going away it fell all the way and i want you to remember this number 32 dollars and 65 cents now i want you to remember this number because this is really important this is the number which is going to make everything clear how insanely manipulative these guys are now look this is the crazy part 32 dollars 65 cents can we say 33 dollars just for the simplicity let's say 33 dollars just so we keep it simple so 33 is the bottom of the stock now if you had a time machine and you thought that you could buy the 33 in july 11th and you could sell it right now for 42 and 20 cents not a bad deal right you buy 32 you sell it 42 a nice little gainer basically doing nothing right but what if you're greedy what if you say well i can probably pump it all the way up to let's say 48 49 back to where it was right here that's even better right imagine you had the tools to do that well in this video i'm showing you how somebody could potentially do that but this is not an allegation this is all allegedly in my opinion might be inaccurate might be the realities of a madman you know i'm just speculating on what could have happened i'm not making any accusations but i want to show you some crazy coincidence so this morning i open up seeking alpha and this is not an indictment against seeking alpha right but basically i'm looking at this article this article is basically saying hey there's a high likelihood that the court the chance record of delaware is going to rule in twitter's favor basically meaning this article is saying hey guys just you know the court is probably going to force elon to go through with the deal at 54.20 cents right now if that actually is true basically what happens is they say well look tom the stock is 42 easy money so everybody will be pumping in into the stock if this was true right so i just wonder who's saying that right twitter likely to win court first horizon bank likely to be approved investor okay what kind of investor what investor okay let's look at this and then you scroll down again this is not an indictment against seeking alpha every website wall street journal bloomberg cnbc they all do the same thing so basically they have a guy here who wants to come in and give his expert opinion which is something they always do i mean that's fine these outlets they want to get headlines they want to get experts and these experts obviously for no purpose other than to share the information want to come on and this is what this guy is saying notice they haven't said his name yet they haven't said where he's working for nothing so it starts with twitter likely to win court battle it's not a quote it's basically you know just a statement of fact and then the quote comes they're very good odds that twitter wins a trial for specific performance and there's also non-zero odds the court awards a very significant monetary damages roy barron managing member of westchester capital and co-portfolio manager of the merger fund now basically said that in an interview to seeking alpha last week we think the odds are low the twitter loses we think the odds are very low there's no settlement no specific performance and no money damage okay cool so this expert is coming in here and telling everybody hey just you know twitter and elon musk will have to go through with the deal which means that the stock should be priced much higher than 42 dollars and 20 cents whatever it is right now right so then i'm going to show something really cool merger fund the merger fund it's a risk arbitrage fund basically what they do is they do risk arbitrage deals they go into these mergers situations and they bet on them or against them now here's the crazy part if you actually go to the institutional ownership of twitter here's what you're going to find oh my goodness look at this merks the merger fund they just bought twitter shares oh my goodness what a coincidence so these guys just bought some twitter shares in fact they bought 887 000 twitter and shares at 33 million and 200 000 so these guys just invested 33 million into the twitter deal okay now this is a merger acquisition sorry the emergency arbitrage fund by the way notice there's no disclosure here at least that i can see that these guys were giving their expert opinion on what happens with the twitter deal and elon musk have something to benefit from people thinking that the price should be higher because i'm going to show that in a second so basically these guys bought the stock now they reported the purchase on august 25th but i can tell you exactly when they bought it and you're going to be shocked check this out so if you divide the 33 million 200 000 by 887 000 shares the price per share that you're going to get i'm going to blow your mind you know how much 33 dollars they bought right here right at the bottom so these guys come in by the twitter shares right at the bottom and then articles like this come out interesting right so if i'm just saying i'm just speculating i'm not saying that they're doing this on purpose i'm just speculating like imagine if i had a risk arb deal with twitter and i would have 33 million dollars writing on twitter and i'm already quite high up since i bought it at 33 the deal is already at 42. imagine i want to get it from 42 to 45 just to make a little extra dollars on this deal right all i got to do is i got to go to an outlet to a media outlet and talk about how the deal is absolutely going through there's no way the deal is not going to go through the stock may or may not react but if it does boomchakalaka free money now this is in my opinion at least morally flawed i'm not sure about the legalities of this especially if there's no disclosure here on on this article about them actually benefiting because when they say these things well there's you know there's no chance elon isn't going to do the deal they're trying to you know improve their own stock position which is weird to me there's no disclosure that i can see that's so crazy there's no disclosure oh my goodness this is and okay so basically this is how it works if you have the clout money if you're a fund and you're trying to do a risk arp deal you can sweeten the deal go on mainstream media talk about how the deal is going to go through you know they'll put it out there because you're an expert your hedge fund right and then when the price pumps a little bit higher let's say to you know 44 45 then you sell and you made nice nice gains and no harm no foul the only problem is that investing in especially trading is a zero sum gain so just make sure you understand what's happening here when they win by definition somebody loses and 99 of the times is the retail investor left on the other side of this trade so be careful before you read mainstream media and whatever nonsense they're telling you about

Tom Nash,ISoVX7Yeo8Q,2022-09-12T13:15:01Z,This has to stop.,The Merger Fund,okay cool so this expert is coming in here and telling everybody hey just you know twitter and elon musk will have to go through with the deal which means that the stock should be priced much higher than 42 dollars and 20 cents whatever it is right now right so then i'm going to show something really cool merger fund the merger fund it's a risk arbitrage fund basically what they do is they do risk arbitrage deals they go into these mergers situations and they bet on them or against them now here's the crazy part if you actually go to the institutional ownership of twitter here's what you're going to find oh my goodness look at this merks the merger fund they just bought twitter shares oh my goodness what a coincidence so these guys just bought some twitter shares in fact they bought 887 000 twitter and shares at 33 million and 200 000 so these guys just invested 33 million into the twitter deal okay now this is a merger acquisition sorry the emergency arbitrage fund by the way notice there's no disclosure here at least that i can see that these guys were giving their expert opinion on what happens with the twitter deal and elon musk have something to benefit from people thinking that the price should be higher because i'm going to show that in a second so basically these guys bought the stock now they reported the purchase on august 25th but i can tell you exactly when they bought it and you're going to be shocked check this out so if you divide the 33 million 200 000 by 887 000 shares the price per share that you're going to get i'm going to blow your mind you know how much 33 dollars they bought right here right at the bottom so these guys come in by the twitter shares right at the bottom and then articles like this come out interesting right so if i'm just saying i'm just speculating i'm not saying that they're doing this on purpose i'm just speculating like imagine if i had a risk arb deal with twitter and i would have 33 million dollars writing on twitter and i'm already quite high up since i bought it at 33 the deal is already at 42. imagine i want to get it from 42 to 45 just to make a little extra dollars on this deal right all i got to do is i got to go to an outlet to a media outlet and talk about how the deal is absolutely going through there's no way the deal is not going to go through the stock may or may not react but if it does boomchakalaka free money now this is in my opinion at least morally flawed i'm not sure about the legalities of this especially if there's no disclosure here on on this article about them actually benefiting because when they say these things well there's you know there's no chance elon isn't going to do the deal they're trying to you know improve their own stock position which is weird to me there's no disclosure that i can see that's so crazy there's no disclosure oh my goodness this is and okay so basically this is how it works if you have the clout money if you're a fund and you're trying to do a risk arp deal you can sweeten the deal go on mainstream media talk about how the deal is going to go through you know they'll put it out there because you're an expert your hedge fund right and then when the price pumps a little bit higher let's say to you know 44 45 then you sell and you made nice nice gains and no harm no foul the only problem is that investing in especially trading is a zero sum gain so just make sure you understand what's happening here when they win by definition somebody loses and 99 of the times is the retail investor left on the other side of this trade so be careful before you read mainstream media and whatever nonsense they're telling you about any sort of risk arbitrage deals,1.0,-0.8

Tom Nash,hKExd82_4CA,2022-08-31T13:41:52Z,"Buffett trims BYD position, Russia halts gas flows to Europe, Mortgage demand falls | Tom Nash",BYD,warren buffett trimming byd stock. so warren buffett is trimming byd position and it's really interesting so the headlines are screaming warren buffett sells byd you know the stock is down 12 today on the hong kong stock exchange i don't think it's traded in us but mainly you know you cannot mistake me for a chinese stock lover let's be honest about it but i think this headline is a little bit overblown so first of all i don't think warren buffett is more or less bullish on byd than he was before he made the sale because if you actually go and look through the numbers i mean the headlines is just clickbait he basically trims his position from 20.04 to 19.92 so we're literally talking about an insignificant 47 million dollar trim i mean for warren buffett 47 million it's like for me this piece of candy on my table i mean who cares so it's not a huge deal in fact if there is a good chinese company that has a lot of potential to actually compete in the global market is byd in america we mainly hear about x-bang and neo and lyoto guys like that byd might actually be i don't know who's texting me in the middle of my video oh it's my mom and basically byd might actually get it done before everybody else because byd is a completely vertically integrated company they make their own batteries they're on tech they make everything they're a massive competitor and they're selling a lot of cars but still if warren buffett is actually trimming because he is now concerned about what's going on in china i wouldn't be surprised although it's too soon to tell by a train of 47 million dollars he has a huge position byd byd is a terrific company the only problem is it's located in the country with absolutely no rule of law no stability a complete pandemonium chaos you know everything goes along with investing in a chinese company I spoke about it so much time before so if warren buffett is actually starting to get a little bit more bearish about china this would be i guess the first indicator but it's too early to tell so i wouldn't go just saying well warren buffett is selling off byd you know it's just pure clickbait by mainstream media,1.0,0.3

Tom Nash,X0n07yi7mzc,2022-08-30T14:00:07Z,Powell does not understand what is causing inflation,Twitter,elon musk has sent a termination letter to twitter yes a termination letter at this point is pretty much like telling somebody you've broken up after you haven't spoke for two years i mean it's pretty obvious at this point let alone it's probably like the seventh or the eighth termination letter he already sent so at this point he's gonna be coming like a bot just spamming twitter with termination letters now the reason i think he filed this letter is because this new whistleblower thing is actually becoming very interesting so we heard that elon musk and his legal team have now subpoenaed peter mudge or whatever his name is who's actually a very reputable guy i checked on this guy i did my research this much guy is for real he's like a super duper global you know world-class cyber security guy i mean you don't get the you know head security guy twitter for nothing right so this super duper very qualified guy is now being subpoenaed by elon musk's legal team and now they're going to use what he has to say to establish a whole new case we haven't heard about so so far the whole elon versus twitter thing was well brought some nobody bought the bot you know nobody bought the bot you got it nobody bought the bots saying obviously nobody thinks there's a material adverse effect here which something that has to impact the valuation of twitter but like 50 for ellen to cancel so he he had no case that's before this whole mudge thing actually merged up because with this much thing it becomes much more interesting the cases open up to a claim that there was fraud because even if you waive due diligence even if the company basically was sold as is if somebody defrauded you intentionally to sell you a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that waiver of due diligence does not apply it's a whole different enchilada right here and trust me this is a serious matter now look just to be clear on this i think elon musk is trolling the entire world with this twitter case and he's not obviously taking it seriously for one reason one reason alone elon musk knows first of all he can't afford it despite what you guys think he can't afford it let alone he will make money off it if somehow he gets out of it with the chance record of delaware forcing him to buy this company he's still going to make a lot of money off it you know exactly what's going to happen he's going to take twitter he's going to become a behemoth of a social media money machine the dude has a cult following they buy flamethrowers whiskey bottles i mean the man sold i think a dune buggy for kids i mean whatever he touches becomes gold so even if they force him to buy twitter he's still going to make a lot of money off it he just doesn't want to because he has too much to do as it is spacex like 17 ex-wives tesla all the other companies trying to set up basically getting a tan you've seen how you look like he's just white as a ghost he has so much to do already i mean at this point he's like yeah i don't really want this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but if they force him trust me twitter is going to be a money machine so i wouldn't bet against him and that's why he's not really taking this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too seriously,1.0,0.2

Tom Nash,aSlYVJ-Z5bc,2022-08-28T20:42:46Z,Sunday Livestream Hangout w/ Tom Nash,Palantir,The first question of it explain the 50k palantir buy it was just too low i haven't bought since uh pretty much the awful horrendous call that we saw and i said i'm gonna hold off but at eight dollars it was just too tempting for me to buy it i can't see dropping any further in the short term so i pulled the trigger i know i said i wouldn't buy anymore until i see some more from the management but at eight dollars i just decided to just pull the trigger so that's the short answer that's the simple answer it might turn out to be a huge mistake or it might be a huge win i don't know um as a long-term investor as you know because we share kind of the same strategy here it doesn't really matter it's just a way for me to upgrade my dollar cost average a little bit downwards because i still have faith for the company people tend to box me with sasha because sasha did sell his stocks we were both very critical of the company and a lot of people were not sure if i'm staying if i'm selling so i was very clear i'm not selling i'm actually adding to my position but it doesn't mean i'm not going to call out palantir for and they definitely deserve a call out after the last call because the numbers were not great the transparency was awful the call was absolutely horrible so i expect to see better results. do you think carp is necessarily a piece for volunteers long-term prospects it's a great question farzad and it's it's it's a it's a terrific question one that doesn't get asked a lot in fact i made a whole video about it basically saying hey is carp maybe carp is the problem and here are my thoughts if you would have asked me this question if carp is the problem about three months ago i would have categorically told you absolutely not look at the numbers look at the financials it's just yes he's not a good communicator he's arrogant he has all these issues but the numbers are are just insanely good look at the growth net retention look at the deal flow look at the relationships just great numbers now this quarter wasn't the end of volunteer obviously like some of my a clickbait suggests but the numbers are starting to regress a little bit i'm not saying that the numbers are horrible but i'll i start to see a slowdown in in the quality of numbers improvement and once i see that happen you know as far as that i'll give you an example you know ellen iverson the basketball player right you know when ellen iverson was a basketball player very outgoing person very problematic he wouldn't go to practices he would be basically do whatever he want but as long as he was the league's mvp the most valuable player everybody put up with his insanity right the moment you become not as good at your job nobody's going to put up with your so as long as carp was delivering people put up with this arrogance and nonsense now the moment that things are not going so well is basically people saying well mr carp you basically told the entire west coast to off you said you're going to do it better than silicon valley and you moved out to colorado and you basically said hey we know how to do this you guys are idiots but your numbers are consistently underperforming the expectations so you can't have it both ways so you cannot be the i do whatever i want i play my game blah blah blah and then not deliver on the court and right now he's not delivering on the court so my answer would be i'll wait another quarter before i give you um a definitive answer in this for that thank you for asking. does carp hinder growth maybe i don't know rich will have to see. what would be a deal breaker must-sell palantir well that has to be you know it's tough to say at this point but and the short answer is the main plan of volunteer right now is use the government side to fund the growth of the commercial side and then grow the commercial side until they actually get some serious market share in enterprise software in north america which is the big market everybody wants to be in europe isn't that big as far as where the the money you can make they're up against some serious players if microsoft or even snowflake or whoever comes out and swoops the market underneath them and i see that the marketing the business development and the growth in the commercial side is dying which is not right now they're still growing nicely on the U.S. side because in the U.S. they're growing like a triple digits then that might that will be definitely where i say well this is this is a deal breaker for me i want to keep seeing them grow on the commercial side in the us in crazy numbers so that's that's kind of my focus. question with delusion and bad earnings is volunteer valued at the right price well here's the thing akash nobody knows it's nobody has a crystal ball nobody really knows everybody makes mistakes so we don't know i personally think that it is but there are a lot of smart people like sasha for example sasha yanchen who think that they're not there's there's plenty of people who advocate against purchasing volunteers there's plenty of people who like it it's a very subjective valuation because in any evaluation you're applying your own kind of set of values and what matters to you so i don't think they had bad earnings akash i think they had bad transparency and a slowdown in growth and absolutely horrendous communication skills i don't think they had bad earnings though as far as the last quarter. how resistant palleteer to recession i don't think it's resistant to recession when recession hits everybody will get wet including palantir it doesn't have any recessionary protection nothing has real estate will suffer job market will suffer every single company will suffer. question palantir headed to five dollars i don't think so personally practical investing but who knows maybe i i don't think so personally but who knows. if you are polishing volunteer now now is the time to buy shares or get paid premium by selling 750 strike price puts expire 2023 don't let fear take control of your thesis market going up. why so many abandoning volunteer lately i i'm only familiar with sasha selling over the volunteer to be honest i think it's because you know the share price is dropping the call was disappointing it's people can change their minds it's okay.,0.95,0.0

Tom Nash,aSlYVJ-Z5bc,2022-08-28T20:42:46Z,Sunday Livestream Hangout w/ Tom Nash,Nikola,why walmart testing nikola fuel cell ev i'm not familiar with nikola having a fuel cell ev whatsoever to the best of my understanding what nicola has after losing trevor milton to what seems to be prison and mark russell to what seems to be early retirement which is the two honchos that led nicola to where it's at right now which is pretty much nowhere nicola basically has uh gabe you're back i can see you uh i just saw your super chat on the screen and so i can definitely see you so hold on a second i got your super chat yeah i'll show it in a second on the screen you're back in so whatever you did you just release yourself from the jail and let me just moderate you so you become one of the moderators for the stream and hold on a second i'm sorry for this guys i just have to do this for gabe because he's one of my moderators and absolutely want him to have mod rights on this thing so i apologize for the delay one second gs strategies llc i got you um okay gabe i just turned you into moderators so you cannot be blocked anymore it must have been a glitch so okay so back to nicola and i'll get to the super chat i'm gonna get to every single one of them so to my understanding what nikola has is two things number one they paid the company from germany called bosch to build a prototype of a fuel cell truck this prototype cost them about 45 million dollars to build this prototype to my understanding has no proprietary technology from nikola it's a fuel cell by bosch it's a design by bosch it's a built by bosch it has absolutely nothing in it that's nikola except for the fact that nicola paid for that now they've been parading it around ever since the three ever milton days but it's basically just a 45 million dollar prototype now what they do have which actually can sell and make money is an absolutely existing truck from europe by a company called iveco or iveco i think and and the i know you're from america you guys don't don't know this brand but it's a huge brand in europe and massive brand in europe and they have a daily delivery truck which is very popular in europe called the s way i know the name sounds weird to americans but it asks the letter s wait not ass anal you know what i mean and basically what they did is they took this very popular vehicle by aveco partnered with the vehicle and they're just slapping a nikola logo on top of it and a battery and they're going to sell it and they call the nikola tray the nikola tray which is the truck that cindy monroe absolutely loved he loved it because it's in the vehicle track that has years and years of popularity it's basically in the veko s way with the battery and the nikola logo that might sell but to build a whole business round that sounds to me a little bit ridiculous. question why is trevor milton rebuying nikola what trevor milton does jj is beyond me i mean this guy is just i can't pretend to even understand what trevor milton is doing or thinking. would you buy nikola for the hydrogen play i think hydrogen is very interesting nikola is a fake company so i would never buy nikola they have no ip no innovation no r d it's it's a marketing company with really bad history so no. you say don't short but would you have shot no i don't short and i knew nikola was trash at 60. i still didn't short it because the risk look when you're short let me explain what happens when you're short and this is something i need you all to listen and understand even though it's going to absolutely annihilate this live stream because people will be bored but listen to me this is important when you go long you own the shares you decide when to buy you decide when to sell the maximum that can happen you can lose your entire investment now you can also decide to stay in and write it out let's say drops 40 50 you just write it out like we do with volunteer right when you're short you do not own the stock you borrow the stock from your broker you pay your broker interest for borrowing the stock you sell the stocks you no longer have it and once the price increases too much and your broker starts to fear that you might have a problem your broker can margin call you that's even not the worst of it because beyond the margin call you might actually have to go outside in the free market and repurchase some shares and let's say nikola comes out with the new gm deal remember when they came out with a new deal with gm for months the stock spiked if the stock spikes you're getting a call from a broker saying hey we're margin calling you boom you just lost an obscene amount of money on the short short is a dangerous game that no written investor should ever ever ever play I hope that's clear. stonk tycoon is saying tom yes the 2021 prototype is aveco and bush yeah that's what i said i remember when i was deep diving into nikola i was like what the is this because they were parading around like fuel cell truckers like this is crazy did they build this and then they dove deep into like a 50 million dollar bill to bosch and there's nothing in it that's freaking nicola come on man. who would put money in nicola yo some people bought nicolette 80 bucks per share believe it or not.,0.95,-0.8

Tom Nash,XXEog-oZiBQ,2022-08-27T15:42:42Z,The FED Is About To Make The Most Expensive Mistake In History,Federal Reserve,hey this is tom nash and yesterday the eight minute speech by john powell out of jackson hall wyoming cost the world's richest people 80 billion dollars... john powell wants to be paul volcker but at this point he's much closer to the joker because everything we've seen from this man last year is an absolute joke... jerome powell is having a bad career... so he came out yesterday and he said look inflation is still very high 40 year high this is my priority he's trying to damage control this whole transitory debacle kerfuffle he had last year and so far he's not doing a bad job at it and honestly he's not wrong because what he's saying is absolutely true the inflation levels are still insanely high... john powell being the fed chair of the big banana in the room has to set the policy right so he came out there he said hey i'm still hawkish i'm going to be the responsible adult in the room i'm going to make the tough unpopular decisions because this is what we need... the federal open market committee's overarching focus right now is to bring inflation back down to our two percent goal restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses and you know what i absolutely respect what he said and i admire his goal but the real question here is will he be allowed to do what he actually wants to do or will some powerful people with a lot of money and clout start to mess with his plan... on the one hand we have the federal reserve which is supposed to be insulated it's supposed to be a hundred percent independent in its decision making... we want the fed to have its own role to do whatever it thinks professionally needs to be done without any political influences... there's a lot of influences that can trickle into this system and actually impact the decision making of the fed... elizabeth warren actually go at powell saying well you're about to drive the economy off the cliff... many many voices that are now starting to creep out into the decision-making process of the fed... if you are the fed chair and you are independent but you have people with obscene amounts of money basically telling you hey you slow down you're killing us and the other hand you have politicians who are basically telling you hey you're going to drive the economy off the cliff and they're all pressuring you to ease up and then i hear the sentence yesterday saying hey after september we might ease up i start to think whether the fed can withstand this avalanche... and the craziest part about this whole story is what i think is happening here because i think john paul and his team knew how bad inflation was and they kept calling it transitory for a long time while the entire world around them was taking on fire because of political reasons i think john powell was concerned about his reappointment long term and he was basically keeping this transitory alive from political pressures now we're on the opposite side now he completely changes tune and there's new pressures coming up about slowing down the quantitative tightening now we already have a bad record for mr powell and his team by them caving and absolutely giving up and calling this transitory for a whole year... assuming he knew this wasn't transitory he already failed to withstand political pressure once now it's going to be even worse... can this man withstand and not slow down because let me tell you one thing if he buckles under the pressure yes we'll probably have a sweet rally until then of the year but then inflation will be back and it will be back with the vengeance and it's going to be a runaway train which no amount of interest rate spikes will be able to stop we're going to see absolute avalanche of a storm in our economy and the stock market so yes it's going to be like drinking a few beers in the beginning you're having fun everything is great but then you're vomiting on the floor so i hope this doesn't happen but i'm very concerned with what i heard about the innuendo about what happens after september i'm very concerned when i hear people like elizabeth warren who actually has a big voice right now and i'm concerned by seeing billionaires lose so much money in such a short time frame.,1.0,-0.6
Tom Nash,XXEog-oZiBQ,2022-08-27T15:42:42Z,The FED Is About To Make The Most Expensive Mistake In History,The Government,we've already seen the government just a few days ago absolutely take a on the policy of the fed by giving up and giving away 300 billion dollars in student loans so they just threw 300 billion that people do not have to repay as debt which will go to spending for the most part actually making inflation worse just to get some votes in november i mean how far will they go with this policy to buy votes in november in the midterms these are politicians,1.0,-0.9

Tom Nash,oQqamakDCEU,2022-08-26T13:37:34Z,"Powell Crashed The Stock Market, Again; Meet Kevin Leaving YouTube, Again | The Tom Nash Show",Federal Reserve,now moving on let's talk about jackson hall jackson hall is today at 10 am jerome powell will speak to the nation he will come down from the mountain and he will tell us how good or bad things are going to be he's going to dictate how the market will behave today now look i've never understood the hype about this jackson hall annual symposium nothing ever comes out of this it's absolutely a nothing burger every year and it never surprises me otherwise it's always the same nonsense it comes out regurgitates things you already said in the past there's nothing to be excited about now i know people want for this messiah character coming from the mountain basically giving us information about how good or bad things are going to be in fact the only reason we even have these meetings is because in 1982 the kansas city fed were looking for a prominent speaker for the annual meeting and they were trying to convince paul volcker remember him to come in and speak so they held the meeting at jackson hall the fly fishing mecca and that's how they got him to come and ever since then it's basically a tradition now so this whole jackson hall is just another way for the media to pump headlines but there's nothing that will come out of it in fact i have some very harsh opinions about what's going to happen and i don't think none of this will be a result of what happens or being said at jackson hall i feel that given what happened with student loans just a few days ago we're in for a very interesting time if you look at how the politicians have been behaving over the past few weeks it's clear that everybody's focused on midterms in november this is the go to date november is everything if the democrats can't actually take control they're going to have a very rough two years in fact it might be even a situation where they become a lame duck because they would not be able to manage the country properly so winning the midterms is critical so far the performance of this administration let's say it wasn't so brilliant let's not talk about everything that happened this in the past but you know they don't have a lot to show for nothing of their initiatives actually worked not the universal global tax thing that fizzled out not afghanistan you remember what happened in afghanistan not the tax reform not the buildback better act nothing in fact even this student loan debacle which was a pretty much economic bribe for the elections even that got half-assed they don't have a lot to show for the only thing that can save the democrats and the upcoming midterms in november in about two and a half months is if the stock market goes on the crazy rally because then you have to understand people have short memories at least the general public they don't have a long memory so if the market goes boom everybody gonna be ecstatic and they're going to get a lot of votes people have short memories so there is a political incentive here for the federal reserve to say well look inflation is slowing down we went down from 8.6 to 8.1 right the real estate market is cooling off retail is definitely cooling off even nvidia just told us that their demand is coming down so the market is already slowing down we can actually relax this tightening we don't need to be as harsh so i think that the fed might make this into a political decision on how to move forward because right now the s p 500 is down 13 year-to-date and if you actually take into account the fact that on a good year on the normal year the s p 500 does 8 it's about 20 off the benchmark why do we have a 20 of the benchmark here well because everything is already priced in inflation energy shortages the war in ukraine basically a recession everything you can think of in some context has been priced in baked in into this s p 500 market price so what happens and i'm just speculating here if jerome powell comes out not saying it's going to happen today in fact i'm almost positive it probably won't happen today because jackson hall traditionally doesn't really give us some exciting news but what happens if for the next two to three weeks the fed comes out and says hey guys you know how we said we're gonna end the year at four percent four and a half percent look at the market i mean it's pretty much self-correcting we want inflation right we beat it think about it like the george bush speech or that carrier we won you know the iraqi war you remember what happened so if the fed actually does the we won't claim and we beat inflation and they basically slow down the qt until the end of the year just to get through the midterms the stock market might actually rally but i don't think it's going to be a sustainable rally because obviously it's going to bring back inflation through the backdoor bigger and better than it ever was and will be a critical mistake but the rally will be there for a few weeks or months so god knows how long so in fact with everything oversold and with all these negative worst-case scenarios priced in all we need is john paul to say something good or positive or slightly dovish to send people back into the stock market which might be you know long-term a horrible idea but in the short term who knows well comment below let me know what you guys think,1.0,-0.8

Tom Nash,VyvmWj5rWXA,2022-08-23T12:19:51Z,Be Very Careful. This is NOT Investing,AMC Entertainment,so mc's you preferred sure class ape is now trading on the new york stock exchange and while it's certainly a funny story it has a dark side that nobody else is talking about now look when i was 14 years old i had an idea a barber shop and a car wash you know you get your fade while your car gets a new shine unluckily i realized it was a stupid idea and moved on but that is not the case for amc remember amc the cinema chain that bought literally gold mine just a few months ago they're at it again and this time they mean business i mean this time it's for real get this amc the cinema chain just launched a new preferred chair class called ape and it actually began trading after being distributed to shareholders as a dividend last week now before you say anything ape is a serious acronym it's not a meme play no no no no no ape actually stands for amc preferred equity so why did amc shares drop down 42 yesterday confused well so am i but here's what happened now these ape units were distributed as dividend last week but instead of a cash dividend shareholders got stuck now it's pretty much like a stock split for all these purposes only difference is that this is a different class of stock but the results are the same existing investors of amc get additional stocks per eta to every share they own before the dividend and since each ap unit may be converted in the future to one common share of amc this is exactly like a two for one split but with better branding and here is where i have a big big problem with what amc just did now technically this stock split should have reduced the price of amc stock like any other split except tesla of course but it didn't quite work like that and the reason is quite suspect now this so-called special dividend is clearly a retail play and whenever i hear direct attempts to appeal to retail investors i stay away i think that adam aaron the ceo of amc is doing here a very questionable act now i love i love the dedication of the ape community these guys are some of the coolest smartest people i've had the pleasure to interact with other past two years but having said that when i see a company trying to take advantage of that use this passion to mark a new security specifically to dedicated retail investors that for me is a no-go that's a red flag and i'm here to warn you now look giving away free popcorn exclusive screenings for apes fine with me but this this is a whole different animal right here and i got a serious problem with that i think what's going on here is actually a setup for a bait and switch now look adam aaron has always said to you guys the ape community i will not delude existing shareholders and obviously the first eight units were distributed for free i get that but hear me out if you read the fine print what just happened you will find out that amc clearly says that it reserves the right to sell more of these so-called ape units in the future in fact up to 1 billion units in total can be issued and no shareholder approval will be needed from this point on this means that amc can literally sell 500 million more ap units just the same amount it pretty much just gave away and that is literally what the definition of delusion is and when the company is doing the opposite of what they swore not to do i tend to stay away now i don't like what adam aaron the ceo is doing here i also don't like what he's doing on twitter either not good news for doubters that's what he tweeted a few weeks ago talking about this ape situation makes me really angry because he's taking advantage of people dedicated people which doubters mr aaron sent clear to me since except the ape community nobody really cares about your dead cinema chain amc nobody cares it has a 70 retail ownership very relevant to no relevance to professional money managers but i guess creating a common enemy is one way to raise capital for a failed business in a failing industry with billions in debt and no real plan to get out of this mess amc has more debt than city world which we will get to in this video in a second and they're actually raising money at these valuations now look i love cinema but the truth is that the cinema industry isn't a big big mess not the fault of amc but that's the situation they have that's the hand they've been built and amc is no different than any other chain yes we had some great movies this year maverick wow a lot of them did well in the box office but generally speaking hollywood is so far up their own ass basically going down the woke culture rabbit hole i don't think they're capable of making good movies at least at scale anymore it's just garbage i mean cinema chains are only as good as what hollywood produces and for the most part except few good movies hollywood has been producing pretty much look cineworld who owns the regal cinema chain just announced that it is considering fighting for bankruptcy so things are far from getting better and as the economy is getting worse we're getting more into recession discussions spending like going to movies are going to take even bigger hit and unfortunately the bottom line here is very simple amc has played this meme stock craze to the max increasing shares outstanding by 400 percent literally cashing in on this ape community sure the funds from selling ape units in the future which i'm sure they will will help imc reduce its debt in theory that is because last time they had some money adam aaron went out and bought a freaking gold mine literally gold mine so i'm not sure i even trust this car management to make the right decisions for the business and speaking about the business where is it going long term fortunately nowhere the stock market is full of investment opportunities no offense but if you really think that the best investment you can find in the stock market is amc maybe you should stick to investing in index funds like the s p 500 now no offense to the amc community no offense to retail investors i love you all but whenever i see a ceo in the company take advantage and try to cash in on that i'm gonna save my piece i'm gonna call it like i see it see you next video.,1.0,-0.8

Tom Nash,Py6AH3RFl5Y,2022-08-19T23:30:02Z,China has NOTHING left,China,"according to recent publications chinese president xi jinping is going on a very interesting road trip president xi jinping is expected to make a visit to saudi arabia this week a number of economic agreements could come from that visit. So does this mean china is taking over the world? The question here is basically does china have the skill set to basically dethrone the world's biggest superpower the united states? Up until 40 years ago china was so isolated it was absolutely in shambles running in archaic centralized economy that was basically driving the country into the ground. About 40 years ago china initiated a major reform that absolutely led to the complete liberalization of its economy, opened itself up to foreign trade and foreign investments and allowed for free market reforms. China became one of the world's largest fastest growing economies with double-digit annual gross domestic product growth. Despite its impressive gdp numbers, china remains a poor country dealing with severe existential threats, no real capacity or desire to dominate the world. Based on per capita gdp, china is below the global average and is ranked 79th in the world so contrary to appearances china is no economic juggernaut. So much has collapse within china that the domestic economy is nowhere to be found, especially in the private sector where the only store of wealth the middle class had, the property sector, has completely collapsed. China's economy kept maturing, its gdp growth kept slowing down significantly. The chinese government has been consistently rolling back economic reforms and trade urbanization embracing a centralized economy. Years of boosting growth through debt finance infrastructure and real estate investments are now blowing up in china's face. China's refusal to allow companies listed in the us to be audited by the pcaob is putting a massive delisting sword over the same companies and scares away foreign investments. The chinese real estate market was going through the roof and now it's literally falling apart, with millions of homeowners in over 90 cities in china literally refusing to make mortgage payments. China's battle against demographic decline is not going so well; the median age of chinese citizens will be 50 years old within the next 30 years and 30% of the entire chinese population will be 65 and older by 2050. China is nowhere near to be viable as far as a threat to us and won't be for many years to come.",1.0,-0.9

Obviously the us is not what it used to be policy mistakes over the last few decades basically caused the us to absolutely decline and cost a lot of players to look at the top spot with interest. China is often talked about as the next in line to inherit the top position from the us which has a gdp of 21 trillion dollars. The united states is at the top position with 24% of global gross domestic product. The us suffers from a very similar issue but unlike china the us could literally open up the gate, new working people will come in from all around the world.

Tom Nash,r3KuQEF8XLA,2022-08-12T22:14:49Z,Tom Nash Finally Selling Palantir?,Palantir,hey this is tom nash and in this video we're going to have an honest conversation about palantir no bs just real talk pragmatic analysis. we're not going to be basically saying how volunteer is the best thing since sliced spread we're not going to be absolutely bashing volunteer for no reason if you are looking for one of those things there's plenty of other channels that can offer you basically either that or that on this channel and in this video we're going to give you pragmatic actual analysis objective analysis of planeteer the good and the bad. now as the title suggests you probably want to know whether i sold any volunteer stock or not the answer is no. i'm gonna explain why my confidence in this company is not as good as it was before this quarter why i'm seeing major red flags major warning signs and why i'm extremely concerned about the future of this company and why it's going on my naughty list for the next two quarters until i see any improvement. now i know there are a lot of youtubers who made negative videos about this company in fact selling their shares and basically saying hey i'm out i hate volunteer whatever that may be it doesn't matter. if any of you on the channel is behaving like a little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] by giving you know hate to people who say that they will sell pallete stock i suggest you unsubscribe my channel get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of here because that's being a total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]. now let's start with the bad things and i think that should be addressed i think the company had a horrendous earnings call absolutely horrendous. the ceo throwing his fits banging on the table saying god awful things about how his clients hate him and they have no choice but to work with the company because nobody can ever get to this level of product absolutely a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show. the presentation they provided was manipulative it was misleading and it was absolutely sus it's not a good look for this management. not to mention the fact that the underlying numbers the fundamentals were mixed a little bit on the negative side they were not amazing but definitely the way the company handled this yeah that raises a lot of red flags. beyond that there's actual red flags within the fundamentals dilution is still going very strong yes it's slightly declining but it's still extremely strong. rest of the world sales are pretty much non-existent that hasn't improved at all for volunteer they struggled to operate outside the us. not to mention that their outstanding deal flow hasn't moved the needle basically stuck on three and a half million that means they haven't added to that anymore. when we talk about the company slowing down about the sales teams not performing we're talking about reduced revenue growth the revenues are still growing now it's slowing down which is a major sign of concern and especially when alex carp is behaving like a 12 year old kid on these calls but the company is still growing and that part i want to cover because despite the horrendous reaction by management the company still grew commercial by 46 percent and govern business by 13. if you just isolate them from the expectations we have from palantir so yes they are declining but still the numbers are objectively quite good. volunteer has dropped from 124 to 119 so basically a five percent drop from 124 to 119 percent yes net dollar retention drop yes that's not good but they still have a very decent net or attention 119. they have this claim against them that kind of slow down on recently that their consultancy not a software company and again them adding customers at this space basically absolutely diffuse that and disproves that and that's good so 80 customer account growth year over year 10 customer growth quarter of a quarter top 20 clients are spending more money than ever top 20 clients of the company is spending sorry our spending 46 million which is a 17 increase year over year. not to mention the fact that the company still has a very clean balance sheet i mean it's easier to have a balance sheet that looks like that when you're not paying employees with salaries but rather with our stock volunteer so yeah so there's that and you have to be fair about this so yes valentin has three times more assets and liabilities 2.4 billion in cash no debt and it looks pristine but you have to remember who paid for that us the shareholders because the payment is in stock based comp for the most part we're paying for that. in my kind of limited view of what we got in q2 a slowdown in sales in the government section a slowdown in the commercial section is slow down in net retention all of these point out to the fact that these highly paid sales people that basically we as shareholders actually paid for not even the company with our own shares are not getting the job done at this stage of the company's life cycle where there's not gap profitability here still i expect to see growth going upwards not downwards so that's kind of a point for alarm. not to mention the fact that alex carp also said that he doesn't foresee gap profitability all the way to 2025 which means that he foresees way more dilution which means i think he knows he has to replace a big chunk of the existing sales team and start paying the new sales team again which again will slow down gap profitability again this isn't great at all. but for me this is still too soon to tell whether management will you know get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together and do not destroy this opportunity but if i see them keep you know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the bed and basically coming out with quarter like this and coming out with presentations that insult my intelligence and definitely having these calls where alice carp is being a total 15 year old twerp we have to stop there so i'm going to give it a few more quarters but i'm definitely staying in. this is kind of where i stand with the company still in still very bullish on the product unhappy with management a lot of red flags giving it two more quarters to see if management actually can get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together see you next video,1.0,-0.8

Tom Nash,o0K9hcF6HXc,2022-08-10T12:45:36Z,8.5% Inflation Announced: Can We Finally Be Optimistic?,Fed,it underscores the fed by its very nature of ill forecasting success is reactionary the market's not and the market continues to do what it's now done for weeks and weeks and that is long rates are moving down it believes that transient ultimately will be the correct word the problem was the time frame melissa lee back to you what a random rick thank you in a nutshell uh cooler than expected across the board versus consensus estimates which seems to lend some credence to the notion that the fed could pause. I'm not sure the fed can do 50 on the back to this I think they still might do 75 but it could suggest some attenuated rate increases down the road. And that's going to be also important for the federal reserve. But the next fed meeting is a while's away at this point right? I mean okay so they're going to be blathering on. I'm afraid that the fed is gonna choose option two because the fed is dealing with a lot of pressure from the government from the politicians from the stock market from from the people to basically ease up because everybody's hurting at high interest rates and the fed has so much pressure on top of it to slow down. I believe that this poses the first threat to that policy of being hawkish. This is exactly what muhammad delarian was talking about months ago and weeks ago when he was saying that in his opinion the biggest risk is that the fed is going to slow down and basically take the gas the foot of the gas pedal way too soon because of some positive numbers and i think this is the juncture where we're going to test this for the first time for the first time in a long time we're seeing some sort of a positive number coming out of inflation so the question is i'm going to see the fed will the fed basically continue saying nope we're going to work even harder now and do 75 basis points or they'll do 50 basis points and ease up or maybe oh my god they'll do 0.25 because they're basically going to say well we're almost close to neutral this is terrifying to me to see that because this is going to test the fed's cojones huevos we're going to see what they're made of.,0.95,-0.6

Well taylor's move was more successful than even he expected and his brand soft soap became a well-known household brand in america but that's where palmolive actually comes in remember them from the beginning well since the competitors realized they could no longer compete with taylor they were forced to purchase his business for tens of millions of dollars and that's 1980s money it's probably 100 million 150 million i don't even know how much these days guess what your own soft soap now palm leaf.,1.0,0.2

Tom Nash,Op6ckjrpbIU,2022-08-08T14:10:58Z,Palantir Latest Earnings: A Complete Disaster,Palantir,the government is growing still 13 right here you can see that also the commercial side is growing 46 percent good that's all fine and dandy if you scroll down you see a little bit of a problem now this is called net door retention right here this 190 i just highlighted the problem with this number is that it represents something very important for a sas business this number is everything is basically how much more your existing customers are spending year over year now this number is everything for sas now for pilot here last quarter we were 124 percent so that's 5 loss of net dollar retention still way better than average but losing net dollar retention is not good now as always i'm not going to sugarcoat nothing here you're going to hear exactly like it is i'm going to call it like i see it the good and the bad there's also good things i'm going to show you there's a lot of good things but there's a lot of bad things i'm not going to be you know d palantir because i like this talk now i have a position i'm long in the stock you all know this again there's not financial advice my own opinion might be accurate might be wrong you got to do in research but because i have a position because i love this because i'm long i'm not going to be sugar coating nothing that ain't about to happen so five percent loss of natural attention is the opposite way it's supposed to be growing you're supposed to be catching up with snowflake with their 180 percent and you're going down the elevator from 124 to 119 still good but declining net intention that's not good now customer growth i mean yeah we know this is always a thing for pilot here they're good at that nothing's really changed we knew that they're going to grow the customer base customer count is going average top 20 customers always spend a lot of money but the problem is that's also the achilles heel of this company look the fact is that they're dependent on their top 20 customers we want to see them break out of that that's not a good thing when you top customers are spending 46 million dollars each and there's 20 of them calculate how much is left for the other clients almost nothing so these top 10 clients basically control pilot's faith that's called clan concentration it's not a good thing so that needs to be worked out the other thing i want to show you here is this is all nice and dandy again i don't know why they keep showing adjusted gross margin nobody cares it's 80 in every sas business sas the software service 80 gross margin is kind of you know a given in any sas company keep showing that for no reason absolutely now i do want to show you something really interesting here so this is really interesting total u.s revenue growth 42 2012 months revenue 41 nice but now we're getting to the interesting part look at these two numbers right here okay commercial okay commercial growth for this company 28 37 47 54 you see what happening here every single quarter this company growing commercial growth 28 37 47 54. come out this quarter lose eight percent really my guy lose eight percent after growing every single quarter you're losing now i get it there's recession inflation all that stuff but you're decelerating commercial growth that's not a good thing again that just tells me their sales team is absolutely lackluster the sales team needs to go needs to be overhauled whatever needs to happen the sales team don't know what the they're doing if they're losing acceleration on commercial growth now even on the government side they're losing alternatives a second but i mean come on even on the u.s commercial where they were absolutely blowing everybody out of the water 136 net growth only 120 lost 16 percent of acceleration decelerating by 16 on commercial growth in the us which is the bread and butter that ain't good look at the government side same problems decelerating 66 34 26 16 13. now i know the government side isn't that much of an appeal to me i don't really care that much but even on that you're declining so you're declining on every single metric i can think of you're declining on the retention you're declining on commercial you're i mean not declining but declining growth on commercial you're declining growth on on government so what else is there i mean we can talk about cash flows getting better sure yes gross profit getting better sure sure i'm going to talk all about that in a second but i mean i mean you cannot say we're the best we know better than you all of you are idiots we're going to do it our way and just basically miss because may i remind you volunteer have missed last three quarters last three quarters palantir has missed and they missed again this time and somehow these quarters financials were even worse than the previous quarter financials amazing amazing now let me show you some good stuff we've beat them down a little bit we're at the halfway mark of this video now we're talking about good stuff i'm going to try and make it as fast as possible if i can make this video in under 10 minutes i'm going to pat myself in the back now before we continue i just want to remind you i made a video three days ago go check out my channel the video is titled palantir earnings warning massive warning q2 earnings palantir three days ago i told you this is exactly what's going to happen they're going to miss and the stock is going to come tumbling down the stock is down 15 in pre-market now look some of the good stuff let's talk about the good stuff so first of all let's talk about operating expenses and gross profit so gross profit for this company has gone up from 551 million in the first six months of 2021 to 722 million for the first six months of 2022. that is a 33 sorry 31 growth in gross profit so 31 growth in gross profit mainly mainly because they're just selling more so not bad also if you take a look at the total operating expenses you grew 31 on gross profit but on the operating side you really haven't spent that much more only 803 million when you spend 100 812 in the previous quarter so they've actually lost a percent on operating expenses so they're spending less money slightly less to bring in 31 more money that's good now if you look at the loss from operations again that was always an achilles heel for this company they're still losing money from operations make no mistakes about it but instead of losing 260 million which they lost in the first six months of 2021 they only lost only 81 million so that's a huge improvement but in this point you might ask yourself this question well tom how come if they're selling more they're spending less on operating expenses and their loss of operation is significantly smaller than it used to be how come their net loss right here net loss increased by seven percent how come well the answer lies below and the stock based compensation which is the real aquila seal of this company the stock based comp is where it's at now as you can see right here this is the stock base comp last year in the first six months of 2021 they spent almost half a billion dollars on it this time only 300 million so the good news are they've reduced stock based comp by 30 the bad news are they're still spending 300 million every six months on stock base comp and the sales team is just not delivering so they're basically throwing money away at these guys who are not getting the job done because the majority of these stock based comp is going to the sales teams which they're trying to build but those are not working out some more good news after we took a on these earnings look they're it's not new we always knew the balance sheet of volunteer was tight and it is tight tight lots of cash boom 2.3 billion lots of asset 3.3 billion nothing's changed liability is one-third so one two three ratio of to liabilities no debt lots of cash we all knew this about palantir but the problem is that you have the call where alice karp says hey we're not going to see profits before 2025 which is absolutely horrendous their 30-year sorry 30 growth annual growth is no longer there so they're no longer standing behind that and you basically see this absolute failure of realizing that the product isn't going to sell itself i mean this is just something i talked about multiple times i mean if you keep thinking that the product is going to sell itself you're going to drive this out of business i mean this just cannot be i think major overhauls are required in the sales teams major overalls are required in the go to market strategy the product itself seems to be selling still at a good pace but a deceleration in the growth and commercial sector a deceleration and the growth of net door retention and sorry deceleration in net retention and reduction in the growth of the government sector are just not good enough now if i have to grade these it's probably a c minus and i'm being generous here a valentine if i had to grade the phone call whatever the that was the live press conference that's an f absolute fail sham sankar was reading off a few cards alice carp was rambling on about nothing absolutely non-coherent stuff not answering the question properly and basically dodging important questions about what we actually want to hear about i think as a community we demand better answers to our questions and if you're thinking about why volunteer doesn't have more institutional investors that's exactly the reason why you cannot miss three quarters three quarters of earnings and do pull this and basically say hey customers hate us but they have to work with us because we have the best software nobody can copy us haha no institutional investor is going to invest in that,1.0,-0.8

I agree here will ackman that by saying that little sentence that two and a half is neutral it's pretty much like saying well we don't see more rate hikes real soon and it contradicted a lot of the other stuff he said because he also said the next rate hike is also going to be quite significant so you know the market chose to interpret that two and a half percent neutral as a bullish sign instead of him saying well there's more rate hikes coming and we're not done yet and it's blah blah blah blah so bill is saying hey jerome by saying the two and a half is neutral you screwed up and now the entire market is back to party mode and they're about to have a I guess a very rude awakening... so I started off be calling him horse ... and a lot of things he said but for the past few points he's been spot on... so look there you go bill ackman don't forget the man has an agenda we just don't know it yet but you know we talk about certain things what he said absolute ... we talked about certain things that he said which was point on and we also showed a little hint where he said what's the timing he's looking at where he said well the mark is great for the past six sorry for the next six to twelve months so basically saying hey everything's great for now and then he said six to twelve months i don't know if i guess your projections your predictions are as good as his because i don't think it's really that credible to try and time the market but as far as more macro kind of outlook to this look at it this way bill is saying something very interesting and again i don't know if his timeline is right or mine or yours you know nobody knows nobody's the oracle what he's saying is macro kind of makes sense to me which is look we're in the state of recovery right now in the stock market so everything is doing better and better and better right since inflation is still here supply chains are still screwed everything's still bad but the stock market is starting to go up again so at some point there's going to be a cognitive dissonance between the way the stock market is went up and the way everything else fundamentally is basically in the toilet and when the fed comes out and pops this bubble by raising interest rates to a higher level than what the market expects is basically going to cause a stock market pullback and to me it makes sense it's just i don't know where it's going to happen but i thought i'd react to it because you know bill ackman is in the news again so let's talk about it,1.0,0.3

Tom Nash,3epqJocR8RM,2022-07-28T11:34:51Z,Is Ford Closing The Gap From Tesla? Q2 Financials Reveal Truth...,Ford,hey this is tom nash and as requested i'm going to do a full comparison between ford tesla and gm as a bonus the financials... we don't have the quarterlies for four the only thing we have is just the press release right here q1 q2 yes but we cannot get to the filings the thank you the qualities are not out yet probably going to be out later today once we have them out i'm gonna actually analyze them there's more detail there that i actually need... as far as the press release itself i mean look it's probably as far as the bottom line summary because you guys like me to summarize it's not as bad as gm there's a lot of good things about ford i'm not gonna be sitting here and bashing ford i'm also not going to be basically sitting here and pretending that ford is you know the best things and sliced bread because it's actually neither so i'm going to be very fair and honest the bottom line is this is way better than gm what we saw yesterday but still not as good as tesla... net income 4 4 for the first half of the previous year was 3.8 billion this time we're at negative 2.5 it's a major drop but there might be reasons for this... cash wise ford went down from 5.2 billion of net cash provided by operations in the first half of the previous year to 1.8 billion in the first half of this year so that's a massive massive 64 drop in net cash from operations for ford... that's not good... ford is not a car company because they literally made double from financing then from car sales as far as operating activities go versus financing activities... ford is doing way better than gm four numbers are up they're selling more cars for sure and they're definitely way better than gm but and yes and they do have dominance in the most important category in the us auto industry which is pickup trucks so pickup trucks is the best category in the us ford dominates it still with the f-150 that's why they have great numbers... where ford actually has a problem is in issuance of long-term debt... Ford issued essentially borrowed almost 11.7 billion dollars in the first half of last year Ford borrowed another almost 19 billion dollars in the first half of this year this company keeps borrowing money obscene amounts of it and the result is the one line below it look payments for long term debt can you see that 26.6 billion in the first half of last year 25 billion almost in the first half of this year so this is a company that's so much in debt they're paying 25 billion every six months as payments for long-term debt that's not sustainable for any company long term i mean you cannot survive in this business when you're paying 25 billion this is worse than the us government for debt payments it's just insane... now we're getting to the parts where i got to give them credit... automotive revenues for the first half of 2021 they had 57 billion for the first half of 22. 70 billion it's a 21.4 percent increase well done not easy in this economy good job ford just comparing the second quarter to the second quarter of 2021 this is even more outstanding look 57 increase insane brilliant numbers really really good in fact they're way better than gm's... the growth of their automotive revenues is much higher than the growth of their costs opposite of gm and very similar to tesla so in that respect they deserve a lot of credit... their sg a sailing general administrative didn't go up at all they're completely stagnant i mean they're not spending any excess money... sgna stays flat which is always a good sign of good management... operating income ford went up from 2.442 billion in the first half of previous year to 4.211 billion in the first half of this year that's a 72 increase in operating income amazing really really good... this is the balance sheet and here where things get a little bit murkier for ford not as good as before they're down five percent in their cash reserves not amazing however and this is another kudos to ford their inventory increased only fifteen percent... not as bad as gm and tesla so in that category of unsold inventory it seems that you know ford is doing way better than gm and tesla you gotta give them credit... assets to abilities for ford is 1.21 very similar to gm and much worse than tesla... operating margin for the first half of 22 was five and a half percent the operating margin for the second quarter was seven percent okay so this is getting interesting so it seems it seems to me based on this preliminary kind of review that if you just look at the second quarter versus the first half is that ford is actually improving their margins which is not bad at all... of course the same thing as gm ford credit it's very similar to gm finance it's basically their business and yes it's not real debt uh however you have to understand there's a lot of risk with this sort of business model the first thing that in if we are going to recession and there's going to be a lot of car payments defaults and this 42 billion is going to be very very risky... i bunch them together ford and the techno king elon musk... ford sold 429 vehicles... automotive revenues for the first six months of 2022 70 billion dollars an increase of 21.39 for ford for the first half compared to the first half of previous year way better than gm with a 9.4 percent not as good as tesla with their 65 percent... ford better than gm not as good as tesla uh cost for the first six months of 2022 for ford was 62 billion up from 52 billion an increase of 19.2 percent... in ford look increase in sales is up twenty one point four percent and as long as it's growing faster than the cost increase which is 19.2 percent i'm good with that again not as good as tesla with a gap of 14 between cost growth and revenue growth operating income for the first six months of 2022 4.2 billion slightly lower than gm and just likely however much better quarter of a quarter sorry the first half of the first half so from first half of 2021 to first half of 2022 an increase of 72.4 percent uh wow impressive impressive definitely compared to the negative 30 of gm but again not as good as tesla with their 220 increase... cash they're down five percent not as bad as gm losing 16.7 percent of the cash definitely not as good as tesla which actually increases cash is about 4.2 percent and again they have the same thing as ford and gm you know gm finance has almost 94 billion they have 67 billion that's just in the you know in the in the car loan business the payments what not now as far as that similar debt to gm i mean that's net of ford credit 17.8 compared to gm very very similar the ratios as you can see right here cash to that ratios is pretty much identical one for both this literally all the cash they have is pretty much debt we know that right if you look at tesla again six point three they have six times more cash than that a whole different story assets reliability is very very similar you know 1.2 ratio versus gm's 1.3 very very similar not as good as gm definitely not as good as tesla with 2.2 ratio which is much higher it's actually valued very similarly to gm i don't know why because i think it's a way better company across the board so they are valued at three billion higher which i guess is okay but if i had to rank these for sure this would be three two and then obviously one this would be the ranking i would give it i think the difference between gm and ford based on these financials definitely justifies i think for ford um a better premium than just three billion because their numbers are much better than ford's but again they're not as good as tesla but again the question remains here as i asked this before is the fact that basically tesla is bidding out these guys in this matter is worth 16x more is tesla 16 times better than ford because we just saw ford give better results than gm ok so if we saw gm we saw four four did better so the question is is this good enough to say that tesla is not 16 times better...,1.0,-0.25

Tom Nash,3epqJocR8RM,2022-07-28T11:34:51Z,Is Ford Closing The Gap From Tesla? Q2 Financials Reveal Truth...,GM,hey this is tom nash and as requested i'm going to do a full comparison between ford tesla and gm as a bonus the financials... it's not as bad as gm... the bottom line is this is way better than gm what we saw yesterday but still not as good as tesla... in fact they're way better than gm's because look at it here the cost structure this is the cogs the cost of sales 19.2 versus 21.4 and 45 versus 57. so basically the growth of their automotive revenues is much higher than the growth of their costs opposite of gm... their sg a sailing general administrative didn't go up at all they're completely stagnant i mean they're not spending any excess money unlike gm we saw that insanity so sgna stays flat which is always a good sign of good management... operating income ford went up from 2.442 billion in the first half of previous year to 4.211 billion in the first half of this year that's a 72 increase in operating income amazing really really good this is i think the next part is a little bit misleading and that's why i'm missing the 10 qs the qualities to figure out where this crazy number is coming from if you look down below and you see income loss from before income taxes basically this number shows you negative 3 billion and all of a sudden like in the previous half of last year they had 4.6 billion and they're doing better so it doesn't make any sense the company is doing better but all of a sudden they just have 7 billion less of income and then you look up and you say there's 6.6 billion and it says other laws what other laws i don't know it might be the reviewing thing or at least partially the revealing thing but if so it's accounting it's basically you know um it's just written going down in value i don't know but that's 160 drop in income i mean it's i think it's accounting base I wouldn't take this too seriously at least until I see the thank you so I'm not going to knock forward for this let's scroll down a little bit more and i want to show you two more things before we go to the excel spreadsheet right here this is the balance sheet and here where things get a little bit murkier for ford not as good as before they're down five percent in their cash reserves not amazing however and this is another kudos to ford their inventory increased only fifteen percent if you remember from yesterday we saw gm rise and thirty percent tesla uh sorry gm 40 tesla 30 don't remember like ford only increased 15 that shows me they don't have a lot of idle vehicles unfinished vehicles which they can't deliver not as bad as gm and tesla so in that category of unsold inventory it seems that you know ford is doing way better than gm and tesla you gotta give them credit i mean can't lie now assets to liabilities right here assets have dropped 4.4 percent the ratio assets to abilities for ford is 1.21 very similar to gm and much worse than tesla as i'll show you in a second in the in the excel spreadsheet what i do want to focus on here is very interesting again the 6.6 other loss keeps popping up i don't know where this is from my guy this is weird but look at the operating margin the operating margin for the first half of 22 was five and a half percent the operating margin for the second quarter was seven percent okay so this is getting interesting so it seems it seems to me based on this preliminary kind of review that if you just look at the second quarter versus the first half is that ford is actually improving their margins which is not bad at all now i don't know if i have any more notes here um oh yeah of course the same thing as gm ford credit it's very similar to gm finance it's basically their business and yes it's not real debt uh however you have to understand there's a lot of risk with this sort of business model the first thing that in if we are going to recession and there's going to be a lot of car payments defaults and this 42 billion is going to be very very risky so and similarly to gm we talked about this and then a lot of mumbo jumbo let's go to the excel spreadsheet right now so i've took the liberty to add a little bit of a goofy pictures you have mr mary lead and with the gm logo right here i bunch them together ford and the techno king elon musk ok so first of all i have a few corrections in my previous video i mixed up tesla global vehicle sales with gm u.s sales a whole mix up so this time i went to car car salesbase.com and i took it directly from there so this is q1 vehicle sold in the us only by each company so that way we are comparing apples to apples and the numbers are solid ok cool so in that category gm sold the most as you can see right here 509 000 vehicles... automotive revenues for the first six months of 2022 70 billion dollars an increase of 21.39 for ford for the first half compared to the first half of previous year way better than gm with a 9.4 percent not as good as tesla with their 65 percent... ford better than gm not as good as tesla uh cost for the first six months of 2022 for ford was 62 billion up from 52 billion an increase of 19.2 percent um more expensive i mean the higher rate of increase i guess compared to gm but if you look at this and a half percent of gm versus nine point four percent increase in sales their increase in cost is faster than increase in sales however in ford look increase in sales is up twenty one point four percent and as long as it's growing faster than the cost increase which is 19.2 percent i'm good with that again not as good as tesla with a gap of 14 between cost growth and revenue growth operating income for the first six months of 2022 4.2 billion slightly lower than gm and just likely however much better quarter of a quarter sorry the first half of the first half so from first half of 2021 to first half of 2022 an increase of 72.4 percent uh wow impressive impressive definitely compared to the negative 30 of gm but again not as good as tesla with their 220 increase... cash they're down five percent not as bad as gm losing 16.7 percent of the cash definitely not as good as tesla which actually increases cash is about 4.2 percent and again they have the same thing as ford and gm you know gm finance has almost 94 billion they have 67 billion that's just in the you know in the in the car loan business the payments what not now as far as that similar debt to gm i mean that's net of ford credit 17.8 compared to gm very very similar the ratios as you can see right here cash to that ratios is pretty much identical one for both this literally all the cash they have is pretty much debt we know that right if you look at tesla again six point three they have six times more cash than that a whole different story assets reliability is very very similar you know 1.2 ratio versus gm's 1.3 very very similar not as good as gm definitely not as good as tesla with 2.2 ratio which is much higher it's actually valued very similarly to gm i don't know why because i think it's a way better company across the board so they are valued at three billion higher which i guess is okay but if i had to rank these for sure this would be three two and then obviously one this would be the ranking i would give it i think the difference between gm and ford based on these financials definitely justifies i think for ford um a better premium than just three billion because their numbers are much better than ford's but again they're not as good as tesla but again the question remains here as i asked this before is the fact that basically tesla is bidding out these guys in this matter is worth 16x more is tesla 16 times better than ford because we just saw ford give better results than gm ok so if we saw gm we saw four four did better so the question is is this good enough to say that tesla is not 16 times better...,1.0,-0.6

Tom Nash,r_mnUlFYLGo,2022-07-27T12:44:34Z,General Motors vs. Tesla Q2 Financials,General Motors,hey this is tom nash and i promise i'll do a deep dive into the quarterly financials for general motors. as you can see on the screen this is the 10 qs filed july 26 2022 and also on the screen right now you'll see i have tesla's right here as well just as a comparison this is the tesla's and we're going to use it side by side to show you how gm is doing relative to tesla. and I think on the flip side of it gm is really not being fairly analyzed by mainstream media I think they're getting a basically a free pass at this point and all I want to do in this video is be completely fair and objective. so look let's start with the good stuff right as you can see right here the automotive uh net sales for for for gm have increased by nine and a half percent and I'm not being cynical here this is not a bad thing I mean for a company like gm which is a company that's not in growth stage a 10 increase in the first six months of this year compared the first six months of last year it's not bad at all. however and here's where I think the problem starts if you look at their cost structure there's where the trouble lies. if you look at here sgna went up by 22 percent things begin to look a little murkier and if you look right here a total blended rate of 11.5 increase in cost so their costs are increasing at a faster pace than the revenues. you cannot be in business if your costs are rising faster than your revenues because this is basically a surefire way to go out of business. and if you look at operating income right here you'll see that it's down thirty percent in the first half of last year they had operating income of over six billion dollars right now that over four billion dollars so operating income is being chewed up by this cost structure 30 down that's a big booboo. while gm is losing 30 tesla is just triple theirs so just to show you the magnitude of the difference. now gem is again has to take a beating here because it's just it's it's clear look the cash position as of the end of previous year was 20 billion dollars as of the end of the first half of this year it's down to 16.7 16 less cash so they're bleeding cash as you would expect with a company that's um increasing their costs way faster than they should be right. now this is where I want to give gm a pass I think this would be unfair to attack them on increase in revenues in the inventory sorry in the inventory section you can look at gm and say well they had 13 billion in revenue in inventories by the end of last year now they have 17 well they can't move cars look gm admittedly reported you know that they said it hey we're str we're stuck with so many cars we can't sell because and we're lacking you know parts and raw materials to finish the cars because of the supply chain issues. gm only increased 30 percent of inventory. what's what is on them is the cost of their assets versus liabilities because this is not as good as I even remembered myself. gm is in a whole different enchilada so gm has way more assets 253 billion however the ratio right here as you can see is 1.4 so they are not as bad as some companies I mean I've seen much much much worse but 1.4 isn't amazing it isn't something to write home about. the bigger problem is if you look at their cash they have 16 billion in cash and they have 16 billion in automotive debt alone so just the automotive debt is basically one to one with the cash. look gm is still carrying gm financial debt it's 62 billion and in this economy a lot of people will default on auto loans and the 62 billion will become a big problem for gm even though it's not gm directly gm financial but you understand this is a major red flag to carry so much money on your balance sheet of debt for auto payments from a lot of potential defaults this year this is going to be a problem so that's another red flag you need to be aware of because they will not tell you this in mainstream media. if you add up like the 16 and the 62 and there's also right here 31 from gm financial like there's 92 billion dollars in gm financial debt on the books and another 16 from gm so there's a lot of debt over 100 billion dollars in debt here. net cash provided in operating activities net cash is down 38 for gm. gm has in the first sorry in the second quarter of this year gm sold 600 000 vehicles right or close to 600 000 vehicles. gm went from 59.8 to 65.4 they've increased increased their automotive revenues by 9.4 percent. gm has increased their cost by 11 and a half percent. gm actually is increasing costs faster than sales that's not good. one year later gm is down 23 to 4.4. net income tesla has more net income than gm. tesla is growing cash gm is losing cash. there's a lot of risk on the gm books because of the debt. look gem is sitting one to one their debt to uh cash ratio is 1.03 basically just enough to repay their debt. 1.4 for gm. gm is valued 16 times cheaper than tesla so it is what it is right so tesla's valued at 800 billion gm is at 50 billion. I think it's very hard to say that gm is the better company.,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,r_mnUlFYLGo,2022-07-27T12:44:34Z,General Motors vs. Tesla Q2 Financials,Tesla,you'll see i have tesla's right here as well just as a comparison this is the tesla's and we're going to use it side by side to show you how gm is doing relative to tesla. now look i'm just going to say it right here right now tesla has its problems and quite a lot and i'm going to highlight them in this video i'm not going to sugarcoat it. how bad is this well let me show you this is actually the i want to show you here testless okay so tesla has a basically kind of like a mirror image of that. if you look at automotive sales for tesla went up from 17.7 to 29.1 this is essentially a 65 increase in the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year now total revenues are up 60 so that's pretty much you know because that's the most dominant part so you would kind of expect that. however and this is the problem for tesla tesla is suffering from the same problems that gm is suffering things are more expensive and as you can see tesla actually had an increase of 55 in their uh automotive sales costs. but to tesla's defense again we have to show both sides of the of the coin right tesla has the same problem it's too expensive their margins are not that great but tesla is still um you know they can get a little break because they are ramping up two new factories so that cuts into this margins quite significantly. still 60 55 so clearly tesla still has five percent more in growth of sales versus the growth of expenses. if you look at cost of revenues right here you'll see that it's up from 17.2 to 25.9 again massive increase but because tesla is growing faster in their sales compared to their um costs that's why you see a gross profit increased by 90 right went up from five to 9.6 uh despite the increase cost so that because again as long as you can grow your sales faster than your costs this is what you're going to get. if you look at income from operations you remember when i showed you for gm how it's down 30 in the first six months of last year tesla did 2 billion that's from operations income from operations in the first six months of this year tesla did 6 billion that's a 3x on their income from operations compared to the first half last year so while gm is losing 30 tesla is just triple theirs so just to show you the magnitude of the difference. if you actually go to tesla's balance sheet you'll see it quite clearly so this is tesla balance sheet let's go to assets let's go to inventory so tesla's inventory went up for the same period end of last year the first six months of this year went up from 5.7 billion to 8.1 billion that's an increase of 40 percent. tesla is suffering from the same problems gm does in fact gm seems to be doing a better job at moving cars than tesla because tesla has way bigger inventory at least like they're on par. if you look at tesla just for the comparison and let me show you so this is tesla so tesla is looking at this is the balance sheet at assets of 68 billion over liabilities of 30 billion right so that's 2.26 that's the ratio 68 over 30. so they have more than twice more assets than liabilities they're very stable if there's any problems they are easily able to repay their debt and whatnot right. if you go to tesla you see a huge difference first of all their debt is 2.9 and it's literally it's let's say three three billion and they have 15 in cash so um yeah so sorry they have how much 17 18. so they have 18 in cash so that means they have 15 billion more cash than debt right and if you look at it here that in the previous six months of last year was 5.2 they're actually reducing their debt from 502 to 2.9 and they're increasing their cash from 17.5 to 18.3 uh mild increase only four percent but still an increase you remember gm is down 16 tesla's up four percent. tesla only sold 250. tesla increased theirs to 64 by 64 let's say 65. tesla by 50 from 17 to 26 however because tesla increased their sales by 65 they're in they're like all gucci. tesla did 1.6 billion there's no comparison one year later tesla is up 238 to 5.5. net income tesla has more net income than gm and significantly more and they're growing at insane pace. tesla is growing cash. tesla is at 6.3 tesla has more than six times more cash than debt you understand what kind of level of security it gives you as a company for bad times ahead. assets versus liabilities right 2.2 this is the ratio for tesla. tesla's valued at 800 billion. tesla obviously tesla seems like the way better company.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,u1aMVEn5Jbw,2022-07-20T14:16:32Z,Why I'm NOT Obsessed With The Q2 Financials Of Tesla,Tesla,hey tom what do you think of tesla's q2 financials coming out today at the end of the day yes he did and it's not because he or i or whom hates tesla i love tesla it's not because the stock is garbage because i absolutely don't think that it's a tesla stock has a lot of retail participation it's very volatile trading the stock around earnings is a bad idea so for me Tesla is a generational investment right i look at this as one quarter out of 40 quarters in which i'm going to spend with the company which you need to ask yourself before you invest in a stock like tesla you either think that tesla is way too expensive at this p e ratio gotta help these people or you think that tesla is a generational opportunity because of its margins because of how it's shellacking the auto industry and because of what's happening in the entire auto category basically switching to eevee and this company having an edge whatever that may be both cases make sense tesla is not cheap obviously you're paying for a lot of future execution in tesla i 100 agree with people who say hey for me that's just too expensive i don't want to pay for future success that much because it's not certain and it isn't nothing beyond death and taxes isn't certain if you're saying hey for me personally i'm pricing in execution which tesla have proven in the past to actually hit on mark so if tesla is the kind of company that keeps executing and keeps doing the impossible i'm ready to pay whatever the price may be to get in on that now because i assume that in one year and two years is going to be too expensive whether you're on that camp or you're in the camp or basically saying well tesla has a 300 stock i don't want to buy it at 700 right now it's gonna be worth 700 in a year maybe if they execute this is where you should be looking at the company at the business and the company not at the stock and whether you buy tesla at 650 700 750 800 it don't freaking matter it doesn't matter because if you're a long-term investor tesla is either going to become a generational massive behemoth or it's not and it's going to be basically trash company either of these options can happen and the fact that you bought it at 650 700 750 800 will not matter at all for your outcome if it busts then even if you bought it at 650 you basically screwed if it explodes the fact that you bought it at 100 instead of 650 won't matter see what i'm saying here if you're staying long term trying to find the perfect entry point it's like trying to put a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] golf ball through him you know one of those little pigs and come on bro it's absolutely pointless everybody's trying to figure out what's gonna Tesla stock it is what it is be careful out there see you tomorrow,1.0,0.6

i created my youtube channel i created it to advanced software apprenticeships and somehow i just wound up talking about volunteer like because it just i just got super into it i wanted somewhere to talk about and i had the channel as well whatever just start talking about up the platform here and i got hooked up with them through my work um and ended up forming a developer relationship with them and now i have access to like a free foundry stack where i can build software and um you know hoping to maybe launch startups on there one day but right now my mission is just to try and get as many other engineers to understand the platform and hopefully open it up to as many as possible because i feel like that'll really help unlock a lot of value for them and for for the overall software community so yeah that's what i do and one of the things that really drew me to palantir was people like tom and others were extremely extremely high on the company and one of the things for me is that i always try to really understand the product first before i i really say invest a chunk of my of my net worth into something and the biggest problem i was having was truly understanding what palantir's value proposition was especially versus other tools and so I'm super forward looking looking forward to this conversation because I think it's going to help me really understand exactly what paluntir's value proposition is from a product perspective and I'm super excited to dig deep with coach strap and tom so so my biggest question would be what what is palantir doing today that the competitors can't copy and say like six to 12 months like that's really i think that's a good way to start the conversation because then we'll be able to sort of deep dive into okay exactly what what is palantir doing from a mechanics perspective i really want to understand if it's a a true mode or is it just a clever way of utilizing ui to streamlining workflow et cetera et cetera let me try and give you kind of a holistic view that it's volunteers like foundry's like a layer cake right it has like three huge layers which is like data engineering data modeling and you got ai and application development right and within each of those there's dozens of products right so like foundry has over has hundreds of microservices that make up the platform along with dozens and dozens and dozens of individual modules that are just full product suites that you would use right so imagine like one of those suites is a full data engineering platform with version control systems with code pipelines built in that auto deploy everything you need once you write the code so it's like kind of like something you would spend a lot of time building if you were ahead of technology at like facebook or something you would build this platform for your data engineers but in foundry it's out of box right and but that would represent several several years of custom development work where you just can't go buy a platform like that now there are a lot of companies trying to offer that right like databricks is trying to build that and offer it and snowflake is sort of trying to build out and offer it but there's still a lot of integration work going in that's just one layer of foundry like the next layer up where you've got data modeling like that is all what they what they call their ontology system right the ontology is what enables what we call domain-driven design in software so it's like we can actually build software systems that act on representations of real-world entities and that includes their behaviors and they do that through a powerful set of custom functions you can write to represent behavior but they also include an event system so you can respond to events and that ontology can implement those behaviors as if it were a real world thing right you want to auto rebalance your supply chain you want to do some crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in response to an event that comes in you want to run a simulation all that's enabled in that like sort of data modeling layer of foundry and then above that there's the ai and apps layer right and that's where things get real interesting because what's happening let me kind of take us let me try and tell you about what's happening in sas right now like one we're drowning in it right so like about 70 of an organization software now is sas and so like at my company that represents over 200 products there are sas products to manage sas products that's how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up this is getting right so so what happens is is the industry now is talking about this idea of data apps and the idea is we're going to bring the apps to the data warehouse we're not going to have sas applications that are silos where this gui lives over here and all my data's siloed over here we're actually going to bring the apps into the data warehouse and build everything on top of that that's going to be like the new cloud basically when that happens when that revolution takes place takes place boundary was way ahead of that game like they knew 10 years ago that that's what they needed and so they built a suite of low code tools including like quiver and contour workshop workshop being one of the most impressive where you can they built skywise using workshop right so like they built an entire multi-million dollar software application using their own tools that's how powerful they are right so like and they knew that the data warehouse would be the application platform of the future right and so they have those low denocode tools to let you build full-fledged apps where you don't need a software engineer anymore you just need to understand your data and you need to be able to have the same type of skills i would say like a traditional bi user would have maybe like a tableau user or some other user or some other person using their low code system right so it's not no code but it is definitely low code although you don't need to they do have a lot of built-in functionality you know um so so yeah okay so that's kind of like the three layers and how they're differentiated but to like if you're saying what could the competitors build in six to 12 months i think the better question is it would take them 10 years you know like you want to get caught up to foundry you're looking at a 10-year time horizon for sure like in terms of all of the apps that are available and all of the modules the the thinking of knowing that the data warehouse would be the future aws that was the thing that kind of set them apart and that's what they spent so long building you know yeah yeah imagine imagine you had a it's like a big data os right it's the os of the future for you to build all the software your organization needs where in the past we had microsoft office and we had google right so like foundry even has like a google docs thing in it which is crazy right why would they do that well because now that your data is being built on foundry apps all the data is now accessible too they even have a chat application right so like that eighty percent of data that of the organization that's untapped because it's largely unstructured foundry has an app for that meaning all of your data is now accessible right so i think that that was that's the other thing that differentiates it is like it's truly like an operating system you know what what is that experience like in palantir and would you say it's any different any easier or any more complex i would love to hear more totally differentiated from anything else you're going to be using unless you build a big data like a data engineering platform using open source tech for your company but there's there's two primary ways you model data in foundry to get the data into the format that the bi users are going to use it which is the ontology layer so like everything goes from the ontology layer when you're talking about bi users or app users but the first one is like there's a set of there's a complete online software ide environment that has spark embedded in it and you can do pi spark programming directly in there and you can use both sql and you can also use spark directly right and so it has version control built in so you get a master branch for all your pi you create what's called the code repository that's a complete pipeline of all the transform functions that go from the raw data set all the way out to the ontology layer you have branching built in so you can create branches you can do a pool request review in there of the code changes you make it has a complete ci cd system that will deploy all that code you have to you don't write any infrastructures code the spark system is fully managed for you you can control all the settings of the spark cluster so you have like the complete capabilities of spark at your disposal to build just about any damn thing you want right so it's like you could the it's un unlimited what you could do in terms of like data transformations um the other way you can do it is visually so they have a set of visual tools that allow you to build data pipelines i forget the name of the tool in there um for but there but there's this tool in there that is a visual user tool that lets you go from a raw table to something to the way you want to visualize it right i don't use that tool personally because like i'm writing uh code and spark but that's the other method and it also is version and this is the cool thing about foundry is they took um a change management like platform like git and they created a whole bunch of custom stuff on top of it but everything you do in foundry is versioned right which is pretty awesome so like including the ontology like a lot of people ask like like what if you're making all these changes there's all these downstream apps like how does the system keep up with the changes like there's a whole change management system in there as well and conversion the ontology all your pipelines are versioned like it's pretty incredible platform when you look at it from that standpoint but there's the so the the capabilities are far beyond what you would have say in tableau where you're primarily using like sql right so you have you have a lot of in and the fact that it has like a custom git implementation built on it so you can do code review and you can do release management and you don't have to write infrastructure as code it's a huge accelerant right because now when i'm sitting down to like i can get straight to the data i can get straight to the modeling there's none of all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] integration work that takes like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] two years to find out that your engineers didn't know what they were doing like i can't get to like one month i've got the data it's all done and we can decide right there did we screw up or not in the data model and it's going to actually derive some value for us i don't have to sit there like fumbling around like three blind mice you know trying to yeah trying to figure out if did the team screw up or not you know does palantir in any way help bridge that gap because one of the things you mentioned was that um any typical sort of like a bi analyst or a bi uh person that would typically do visualization some is somebody that could potentially be uh create more values and volunteer is that is that the case with this tool kind of walk me through that because that's one thing that i'm really curious to learn more about yeah i mean if that question makes sense yeah it makes total sense because i live that every day you know it's like the tension between the people who actually need to make a business decision the analysts and then the technical people responsible for owning the data and getting into a format that they can securely access it that's a complete cluster at most companies yeah and so the way foundry solves that problem is that it's one it's a holistic platform for every actor in your org so your analysts are absolutely gonna be inside foundry using it so it's all that data is governed under one security model the other is they have this program called preparation and in preparation you can do your own transforms of the data you have access to whether that be like intermediary data raw data clean data whatever you want to look at and you can prep the data in the format you you want it in so like part of the premise of foundry is that we are going to remove the engineering bottleneck right and so we give you tools you the analyst that allow you to like bypass that engineering bottleneck problem further like the barrier to entry on spark programming is so low you don't need to know jack about spark like all you need to do is know pi spark if you can write sql you can program in pi spark you don't need to sit around and wait for your data engineers and their esoteric platform they created that has like 50 000 dependencies that now you need an ide to like install them all resolve all the conflicts just to write one transform right you can literally log in through a web browser write the transform in your web browser issue a pull request and now you've got your data in the format you needed it so that bringing that barrier to entry down to the point where it's equivalent to a bi tool you use like tableau to write a sql like join or something that's going to unlock people like you and it's all governed under one security model that's the power of like first power first party integration right so they're they're gonna and i believe that that is probably one of the biggest value props is in order to move at the speed of the data stream the org has to remove the engineering bottleneck because that one you touched on that's one of like a hundred you know it's like yeah there's there's like yeah so like that's the other thing that i'm psyched on the platform and really like trying to evangelize to the engineers out there could you say that it could become a platform where so i'm trying to think i'm trying to i'm trying to like run this down like say three to five years from now right so is this something that we could say could potentially become a platform where you even remove the analyst layer and allow just decision makers to tap a platform to make their decisions without having to say have anyone develop anything is this the sort of like that's that's the goal right yeah it's like yeah it's uh we're in the early days the the reason being is like there aren't enough models of data that exists right now to make that totally possible right like hyperauto would be the closest thing i think they've gotten to where you could say you don't need an analyst anymore you know because what it is is hyperauto you you kind of explored in one of your videos they have this thing called software defined data integrations and there isn't a lot of documentation out there about like how does that system work but they created artificial intelligence and some uh heuristics to look at data inside known systems and one of the questions you had is like how do they do that right and interpret what the data actually is well like one of the ways you do that is with a heuristic like a regex right you write a regular expression you can tell that that data is a time you know or that data is an address or that data is you know a person's name but you can also build models to do that and what they did is because they were doing this stuff for so long dealing with these systems like over and over and over and over again is in order to speed themselves up they came up with these tools to actually look at the metadata and the data itself using models ai and basically interpret what you're actually modeling what is it is it a car is it a car part is it what car part is it and then from that what they do is they create your entire pipeline like all of your data transformations your ontology layer and your app layer for you automatically like and that happens within hours of the data being ingested then you can sit down and you're starting from a standpoint that an actual person is responsible for inventory in a plant can now start rebalancing the response to alerts that the system is telling them about so it's like it's pretty crazy that they're getting there that fast but that's only one like it's i don't know how deep that integration goes number one i don't know how many types of data it can interpret but as they scale and that's part of what i love about their go to market strategy is that the way you scale that is by generating massive network effects with huge companies that do business with hundreds of other suppliers you know hundreds of subs basically right and on that level it makes a lot of sense if i want to get to is a world in which i understand as much of the data and can model it effectively kind of in a universal way using uh software-defined data integration going out and finding the biggest companies on earth and generating massive network effects and understanding everyone's data is the way to do it so yeah and so i think they're gonna i think we will get there but i think there will always be a job for an analyst because no system is ever perfect and right you also need human like machines are good at certain things people are better at others you know so it's there's there's a role in there and i don't think we're getting to general artificial intelligence anytime soon so like i think there's a role in there for the analyst because there's not every problem is going to be a machine problem you know and also like in a lot of these scenarios maybe you're using some kind of explainable ai to to come up with a set of signal data but an analyst still needs to look at that and review how the ai came to that decision typically especially in something where it might be critical like you want to make a purchase or you want to transfer money or whatever it is maybe you're taking internal action of some kind but it's high stakes you're always going to want an analyst in there to kind of review what the what the system's coming up with and responding to that signal data and foundry's made to do that for sure yeah i mean even at my org right like we evaluated foundry and the decision was to not use it you know um i think that a large part is due to the price tag number one it's not cheap um the other is no one knows how this thing works right it's like a giant black box looking at the platform i could spend several years training on this platform it's not something you learn overnight and so one of the biggest criticisms that people have is like dude it's like drinking from a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fire hose man you know like i don't understand this thing and um and and the other is that even when they're evaluating the features themselves it not everything seems like it to a software engineer you're telling them you're going to use an online ide for example like most software engineers will say no i want to work locally but the local development experience isn't as good as the online experience and and that can lead to people feeling frustrated in a way so maybe they need better integration into ides for example would be one thing that i think is important i think they need a command line interface like they don't have one right now like that's another thing that the developers are critical of the other in machine learning is like they don't think it's performant enough to do real-time inference when you need a feature store you know but that that's theoretical and the reason it's theoretical is like we didn't get a chance to scale it and test it like internally at our org but the feeling from the engineers was like hey this thing isn't going to work for for feature store side but like that's a super like what i told them too is like that's an edge case man like most of the time we don't need a feature store to do real-time embedding of these features and to request inference request that is one thing they beat them up on the other is like it's not obvious when they present a lot of those ml and ai capabilities like what how they would work and like what libraries are all supported even though like everything they need is there so it's i just get a feeling from like a lot of the engineers that they see it as a really different way of sort of working the terminology palantir uses is really foreign to them um it doesn't feel like it's aligned with open source tech even though it is right so they're using a lot of open source tech under the hood same tools you would typically use so yeah i think it's just a very intimidating platform i would say that the online ide is not epic you know like it's not the best online editor i would much prefer like stack blitz i like i would prefer to work locally although the local integration is fairly good so you can definitely do high performance local workloads but if they can improve their online ide with a command line interface and a lot more generators and make it a little more performant in the autocomplete features i think it would go a long way to like improve the experience for engineers and then the other side to it is like really cleaning up how they talk about the ml side and proving out that they can handle that low latency high concurrency requirement for model serving i think would go a long way but um i think that's more presentation than it is like substance you know so the one thing you mentioned correct me if i'm wrong here so the one thing you mentioned is that palantir is taking steps to try and essentially auto generate and i'm gonna try to use layman terms here so auto generate kpis or or columns or some sort of data points for users to to hit or exceptions that come up and say yo something's happening in your business you need to jump on this by utilizing data sets from previous companies or previous applications to try and do that did i did i explain that correctly was that something that they're looking yeah with hyperauto they're doing that and it's not it's not kpis it's they generate a whole app like a skywise like app that's meant for inventory management and that includes the data pipelines and they do that directly from the erp systems you're using so like i believe it's sap and a couple others they go and they have this mod these models they built along with heuristics to interpret the data that's in those systems and then they'll completely auto generate your entire pipeline for the to the ontology layer and then the app that sits on the ontology layer that does the supply chain management and all that kind of stuff so and that includes alerting there's there's features that are built in there and then from there you can extend it you can start building all your own features on top of it so so one of the things with the aips though so one of my understanding is that palantir doesn't actually own the data it's it's the user that owns the data so how would it be able to leverage the data sets to do that unless it actually knows what data you're using or is that just part of the deal that you strike that says you still own the data but we have the right to kind of look through it and see what kind of data set you're using so that we can generate these mls and sort of ai tools to try and predict these things for other businesses walk me through that a little bit because that that point is confusing to me yeah so like as far as in ip agreements they have with their customers i have no idea like right that would be it's totally speculative but like every company i've worked for we struck ipa agreements on you know what we own what's our core tech what are we going to be able to take with us what are you getting you know what's your your ip so like when you're doing these projects i don't need like i can develop a base model take that base model i don't need your data from that then on and continue to improve that base model down the road on additional data so my guess is when they were building software-defined data integrations as a feature is that they came up with some kind of ip agreement for that as they were analyzing all these data sets yeah but they absolutely don't own the data it's a processing layer so like yeah i always tell people like how many fisa requests do you think palantirs had that number is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] zero because they don't own the data dude you know it's just a processing layer i think a lot of people don't know that about volunteering like it's just a processing layer would you say um so would you say palantir is more geared towards companies that have a tremendous amount of data and needs from a data perspective versus say a large majority of companies so i'm trying to like figure out as i think about palantir's long-term uh customer base right so far so based on some of the explanations you've given is that it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a tool that has a lot of capabilities it sort of reinvents how traditional engineers would interface with a product like this um but it sounds like the feature sets it has and the capabilities it have it has are profoundly uh great okay but is this reserved for say your facebooks and your googles and your and your advisors like you're really really large companies that are gonna have a lot of data or is this something that is also being geared towards say say a humongous majority of the businesses that exist today that have data but they don't know how to use it like any any sort of small business right you can you can pick and choose who whatever business you're talking about if these guys want to take advantage of the data they have to hire some some you know third-party dude that's in a different time zone that is not doing what they're asking right so how is paluntir viewing this market or is it just not geared towards that because i think i think if we really think about long-term potential of bi tools or any sort of tools that leverage data i think that is the market that they have to crack so i would love to hear a little bit more about it yeah i mean we all know that like i mean we're not talk what's funny is like there's a book called palantir foundry by use case this guy kai wrote it it's dope if you want to check it out it's a good way to kind of learn more about the platform but like in there the book opens with like a use case of a woodworker who makes like i forget what it was maybe it was like russian nesting dolls or something it was a small business though maybe like 15 or 20 people but explained how they were able to improve their business using foundry right so like but but i think the broader point is like bi and data analytics is valuable no matter what business you're in i mean tom probably uses bi and data analytics to understand his youtube audience you know it's like you need a one-person shop and take advantage of data i don't i don't think the size of the org dictates that um so but i think the broader question the one to unpack in there is like how is palantir seeing this problem you know and like i i think it's obvious from the go to market strategy they're not going after the smb space yeah like it's it's straight up full-on enterprise you know but i think palantir is absolutely going after enterprise you know they're not going to be going after the same customers as snowflake or salesforce right now you know but i think that speaks to maybe where they're at with the tech you know and like it's just not ready to scale to you know 25 000 customers they're looking at it as like we want to get the global 2000 we want to get the enterprises where we can generate massive network effects and we'll scale our technology and invest in making or make investments to scale our technology alongside those initiatives as more and more people on board with this system now that's a really risky strategy if that is the i'm speaking for myself this is an intuitive understanding of where i see it but that is an incredibly risky [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] strategy no one i know has ever gone to market that way every single product i've been associated with from day zeros infinitely like we have a scaling model built in you can sign up on the website customers are onboarded into a multi-tenant environment automatically there are no scaling issues so like like it's weird that they wouldn't be you know walking and chewing gum at the same time going after both markets i think that that points to some inherent issues related to scalability of the product i don't know i don't know that speaking for myself but that that's my feeling but i don't know if it matters in the long run if they're right if they're right about how they how this product can generate network effects for their customers and their strategy works they win if they're wrong they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lose and they lose big time you know and they've lost in other spaces they lost in the data warehouse space why are they losing the data warehouse space because they didn't go to market seven years before everyone else with a data warehouse product you know so that that inability to read the market and get good product market fit could be a weakness for them yeah it's something that i worry about a lot when i when i see their strategy playing out but at the same time very i love the product i can see how it's going to be a huge win for those orgs that are adopting it I wish my org would have adopted but like i think that um i see a lot of a lot of potential upside in what they're doing it's just you got to be right you know like i have no doubt that the product is is really good like from the very beginning i i knew the product has to be the change in lingo since their yeah but to have somebody no somebody who i'm sure that it's a good product yeah because we have somebody who obviously has experiences is somebody that that's it's able to to verbally say in a technical matter like two technical people we're sitting there understanding why it's a valuable product but I'm still the the the the one thing that I'm still skeptic about is um from from an investment perspective say how how are we sure that this is going to be a company that's going to have a runway from here to say five years from now if the scalability and its go to market strategy could potentially hamper it right because of because of how adamant they are that's the risk man that's why the stock's not out a hundred right now it's like in my opinion and by the way like just full disclaimer do not invest based on what i'm saying i do have a relationship with volunteer i do have access to a free foundry stack i have to give some disclaimers but like i don't want i can't really speak to the stock but um i've been calling this out prohibited from speaking yeah i can't even speak but like that's the execution risk right that's what i've been calling out yeah you can talk about the strategy the market don't say anything about the stock i don't want you to get into trouble because i know the the rules and regulations unfortunately yeah you can talk about the strategy yeah and you can the strategy is inherently risky because of what you're saying you know like like that's an inherently risky strategy and and i always say like what happens down market like with the snowflakes and the data bricks that's going to have an effect on you you know because that's who gets certified right like if all the engineers are certified in snowflake and not foundry that now we can now we're having hiring full discussions right so like yeah these are things where the competition gets a vote the market gets a vote and if if they decide to break a different way because your platform wasn't accessible or affordable or whatever like these are all inherent risks and go to market strategy that says hey we'll worry about the smb space later let's let's focus on the enterprises because that's where the network effects are going to be generated like you know that's risky i mean i do think i do think the fact that there's a product that exists out there that is almost like i think of so based on your explanations i think of volunteer like you said like an os like a do everything thing that utilizes data to like just help you be as powerful as powerful as humanly possible utilizing data like that's that's how i am sort of perceiving palantir and if they have a platform that's that's unique in this way and is able to make it as easy and as efficient as humanly possible for the users to really capitalize on those things if they're really trying to utilize the entire thing and all and businesses exist that are looking to leverage that that's phenomenal but like my how many businesses actually exist out there that are that even know that they need to do that right that they even know every business knows they need to do that so like well who's been talking about digital transformation well it would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the whole industry's been talking about digital transformation for five years where is it it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nowhere because it's hard you know so like everyone wants to get there i don't i don't see anyone saying we don't want to get there like everyone wants to get there i think that at the end of the day like more people on youtube know who talenteer is than [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] engineers you know and like that's one major problem you know is that like if you're thinking about how do you approach digital transformation and you're the cto working with the ceo trying to figure that out if palantir is not top of mind and none of your engineers have pallents you're top of mind you're not going to be part of those discussions so i think that one is just an educational kind of outreach thing people they need conferences they need certification they need open access they need a developer community like asap you know to help ramp that thing but at the same time you know you were talking about premiums as well yeah freemium i mean that's a requirement right like if i'm an engineer and i want to actually try the platform i'm not going to pay a million dollars to like you know try the platform and you need to be able to evaluate something before like you're going to make a multi like a multi-year seven-figure deal with a company you know like that's yeah unless you're willing to jump off the cliff with them and some and a lot of organizations have because they see the product is that valuable and like i see it when i'm you know when i when i use foundry i'm like dude this thing's just gonna [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] take over the world one day like that all it's all dependent on you've got to ramp that dev community people need to know who you are it can't just be youtube investors that know what palantir does his honest opinion about volunteering he has no skill in the game a complete bystander and he told me look i think that they're going to struggle for a couple years because of their go-to market strategy i think is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up but he said look the product is that good i think in five to six to seven years this is gonna be industry [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] standard and there's gonna be basically no choice but to use their stuff it's it's better to think about it like it's am it's aws it is that's where we're going you know and it's it's like when people adopt it it will replace the cloud it's sky i don't know if you know what sky computing is but it's this idea that we're going to have apps that sit above the cloud providers underlying infrastructure and that's where we're going to build all of our value from now on well we won't even know the details of the underlying cloud provider like where is it deployed i don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know it's got it's got a high availability rating i've never seen before though so it's probably deployed like everywhere i need to make a t-shirt where is it deployed i don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know that's awesome i love it i gotta make this thing that's happening i don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know that's very common that's a very common issue we need to get this in the t-shirt bro i'll give you 30 and you're 30 and i'll take care i'll take i'll take 70. that bad russian man invested math it works we have

Tom Nash,ffBYQFMVVpM,2022-06-25T20:26:40Z,What Palantir Actually Does? w/ Codestrap and Sceptic Guest Farzad [LIVE],Tesla,a former tesla a very undervalued undersubscribed channel experiences in business intelligence software enterprise software so and the volunteer skeptic though no hater i would just say that so i would call it healthy skeptic I worked for tesla for about four years building out essentially the the bi kpi reporting platform for service distribution and operations for the last four years the analogy I can draw just based on the research I've done is that the like I'm going to use tesla and palantir as an example so so and thomas you and I talked about this a little bit when you and I sat down so so the the users of palantir appear as evangelical about the product as tesla drivers and tesla owners right but I think where tesla benefits is that they have a leader who's willing to go out there and really communicate the the mission and then there's users and people that actually understand when they when they interface with the thing they understand what it is in the case of palantir because it's technical in nature unless you have someone out there that's like trying to dumb it down to the general user base or just to companies that are trying to somehow uh really leverage their data if they don't really invest time in that because it's technical by nature like I feel like like where do you go from there you know and sort of I don't know if it's and you guys maybe helped me understand is it a lack of is it too much trust in the product that people will eventually get it or is it just not an understanding or a lack of of sort of investment and saying that you know what we just don't think that's the right strategy or is it that they if they do that they're going to grow too fast like I'm I'm trying to get my head wrapped around that because if you're if you're a company that's in the space and you know you're technical you have to invest time in explaining what you do and like you should squash anything I think certain companies like tesla as an example they have the benefit of people understanding what they're doing but from volunteers case they have to solve that problem bank companies have had an incredible advantage in the marketplace because they figure out figured out how to operationalize data and they had a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of it and that's let them become the companies they have become tesla is no exception there by the way if you like critical thinking if you like tesla you need to be subscribed to both of these channels,1.0,0.6
Tom Nash,ffBYQFMVVpM,2022-06-25T20:26:40Z,What Palantir Actually Does? w/ Codestrap and Sceptic Guest Farzad [LIVE],Databricks,now there are a lot of companies trying to offer that right like databricks is trying to build that and offer it and snowflake is sort of trying to build out and offer it but there's still a lot of integration work going in and i always say like what happens down market like with the snowflakes and the data bricks that's going to have an effect on you you know because that's who gets certified right like if all the engineers are certified in snowflake and not foundry that now we can now we're having hiring full discussions right so like yeah these are things where the competition gets a vote the market gets a vote and if if they decide to break a different way because your platform wasn't accessible or affordable or whatever like these are all inherent risks and go to market strategy that says hey we'll worry about the smb space later let's let's focus on the enterprises because that's where the network effects are going to be generated like you know that's risky you can't do it with just databricks you can't do it with just amazon or gcp or microsoft or any other platform the only one you can do with is foundry so eventually people are gonna in my opinion are gonna get to that point where they just go i have to adopt this platform which is the only one like it out there that can actually deliver the value and i'm suffering as my competitors start to out you know out compete me so there is like global trans industry trends maybe databricks gets bought out you know so like i would say look for mergers and acquisition positions to shape the land space,1.0,0.1
Tom Nash,ffBYQFMVVpM,2022-06-25T20:26:40Z,What Palantir Actually Does? w/ Codestrap and Sceptic Guest Farzad [LIVE],Snowflake,now there are a lot of companies trying to offer that right like databricks is trying to build that and offer it and snowflake is sort of trying to build out and offer it but there's still a lot of integration work going in but i think palantir is absolutely going after enterprise you know they're not going to be going after the same customers as snowflake or salesforce right now you know and i always say like what happens down market like with the snowflakes and the data bricks that's going to have an effect on you you know because that's who gets certified right like if all the engineers are certified in snowflake and not foundry that now we can now we're having hiring full discussions right so like yeah these are things where the competition gets a vote the market gets a vote and if if they decide to break a different way because your platform wasn't accessible or affordable or whatever like these are all inherent risks and go to market strategy that says hey we'll worry about the smb space later let's let's focus on the enterprises because that's where the network effects are going to be generated like you know that's risky I mean the numbers are pretty good i mean it's not snowflake numbers the snowflake is killing it right now but they are selling a commodity let's be honest it's a little bit different strategy but the numbers are like you look at this company and say well they're really built for tough times or is it going to be snowflake because they just announced a similar feature so right right and there may not be a snowflake eventually you know if someone decides to buy them out right so like as companies look to compete against palantir i expect to see some consolidation there and like a lot of companies that you know we thought were going to be like oh they're going to do great on there no it's like maybe that maybe microsoft needs to buy snowflake to make its products competitive you know like maybe databricks gets bought out you know,1.0,0.0
Tom Nash,ffBYQFMVVpM,2022-06-25T20:26:40Z,What Palantir Actually Does? w/ Codestrap and Sceptic Guest Farzad [LIVE],Microsoft,yeah yeah imagine imagine you had a it's like a big data os right it's the os of the future for you to build all the software your organization needs where in the past we had microsoft office and we had google right even even a microsoft product power bi whatever you want to call it right what what is that experience like in palantir and would you say it's any different any easier or any more complex i would love to hear more i mean to me like if i were looking at that platform and i was microsoft and i did evaluate like microsoft's intelligent data platform it's a pilot dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um spoiler alert but like the legend [Laughter] invest based on that advice [Laughter] looking at snowflakes claims on their new features and stuff and um they're just nowhere near where foundry is right you know and it's going to take a better part of a decade to catch up on that platform in my opinion yeah i mean like looking at the microsoft solution i was like oh my god you couldn't pay me to work in the state you know like it's just it's a first party integration of a bunch of their products you know you can't do it with just databricks you can't do it with just amazon or gcp or microsoft or any other platform the only one you can do with is foundry so eventually people are gonna in my opinion are gonna get to that point where they just go i have to adopt this platform which is the only one like it out there that can actually deliver the value and i'm suffering as my competitors start to out you know out compete me so there is like global trans industry trends maybe microsoft needs to buy snowflake to make its products competitive you know,1.0,-0.8

Tom Nash,ffBYQFMVVpM,2022-06-25T20:26:40Z,What Palantir Actually Does? w/ Codestrap and Sceptic Guest Farzad [LIVE],AWS,the thinking of knowing that the data warehouse would be the future aws that was the thing that kind of set them apart and that's what they spent so long building you know it's on par with aws you know so multi-year several certification levels it's a 10 in terms of complexity you know but so is aws says gcp you know there's no no real differentiation there like i think it's the part people miss with foundry is like i will never build another app again on aws i'm gonna build it on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] foundry man like why am i building rest apis and these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] react gui's sitting out here in these silos that i can only deploy through terraform onto aws most of the time if i have a good team maybe i can deploy it to gcp or azure you know but like with palantir and foundry i can my apps run everywhere right by default i don't have to write any infrastructure as code you know so like but it is a deep platform on par with the learning curve you're going to have with those other platforms but the good news is is that whatever i learn in foundry has immediate business value to my company and not to aws because most of what i learn on aws is their esoteric way to talk about things and deploy things and all the code i write related to aws is zero business value like none big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] donut versus foundry that investment yields immediate business value and every line of code that's produced by the engineer or the operator working on that platform delivers immediate business value so i think that it's it's a much better investment in terms of of training you know where we're investing now like we pay to certify our engineers on aws we have a whole training platform we pay to have instructors come and teach our engineers about aws that's not cheap by the way that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] expensive and what they learn has no business value the only reason it's that we do it is because we need that we leverage cloud computing and the only way to get on there and actually run our business is to invest in the training yeah yeah versus foundry where it's a little bit you're going to get a higher rate of return investing than that you can't do it with just databricks you can't do it with just amazon or gcp or microsoft or any other platform the only one you can do with is foundry so eventually people are gonna in my opinion are gonna get to that point where they just go i have to adopt this platform which is the only one like it out there that can actually deliver the value and i'm suffering as my competitors start to out you know out compete me so there is like global trans industry trends it's better to think about it like it's am it's aws it is that's where we're going you know and it's it's like when people adopt it it will replace the cloud how long has palantir been around for 20 years 17 years i think i don't know close to and aws is what uh 12 something like that do you guys know how long yeah it's like 12 years short right but but i would i would also point out like anybody's got kicked in the teeth for most of the years it's been around like people were not going to move to the cloud and they're still fighting that battle yeah but how old is foundry all this founder because but in 30 like i think a lot of people make the mistake of being like oh they've been around for 20 years no look [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you couldn't have built a product like foundry until 2017. like hyperscalers didn't exist to power it do you know how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard it was to do this kind of stuff back in the day like you would rack and stack custom servers good through one iteration and then reorder that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] again that's why only [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the government and fang was invested in this stuff because they're the only ones that could afford it you know until the hyperscalers came along with the storage and the compute resources and the platform services required to actually enable something like foundry you just weren't going to be you weren't going to do it you know it wouldn't be cost effective so like i think that we're at this they came along at the exact right time to take that product to market it's just questionable whether or not the strategy of and and people are like they don't know what the go to market strategy is the go to market strategy is we're going to generate massive network effects for the largest customers in the world by creating these or these consortium models you know so when they create a strategic partnership that's a business consortium what they're relying on is the more people within that consortium that use foundry the more valuable foundry gets and that's how they're going to grow it you know but like it's questionable whether that's going to work but i don't question the timing of when they brought it to market because that was the only time like the exact right time a product like this could actually be feasible financially you know,1.0,-0.2

Tom Nash,Tsbe5IuXDjE,2022-06-13T19:52:48Z,Patrick Bet David Talks About The Biggest Market Crash Of Our Generation (LIVE),Investment Company Act of America,how sometimes you look at the investment company act of america their mutual fund from 1934 it's done 12.3 percent if you would have stayed them but if you would have taken it out on the top 10 days the 12.7 percent would have become 9.2 percent if you were to take top 20 days you would have been only at seven percent so it's better to leave in the market and never take it out okay sure i i i can't see that argument all i'm saying is i am taking a risk but my risk is a different kind of a risk right now,1.0,0.0
Tom Nash,H3lNQGaffCc,2022-06-13T12:14:58Z,We need to talk about what happened with Celsius and Bitcoin,Celsius,I just found out that celsius one of the leading cryptocurrency lenders and in fact one of the more aggressive ones for the past few months is actually saying that you cannot take out your own money your own money you cannot take it the withdrawals are blocked. celsius came out and said hey we might have a problem here um yeah we can't let you guys take your money we don't have enough of it it's extreme conditions. The problem is that these guys are taking what i think is extreme moral gymnastics to justify what they're doing because for me this is theft they're stealing money from you the clients this cannot happen in america. so when crypto actually started falling celsius got freaked out and basically said hey you can't go to the atm basically now this made thing worse. i do have an interesting piece of information i think that the celsius specifically is more about celsius being a little bit of douche bags in the sense that they're offering exuberant interest like 20 and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and i think they were investing in luna which was a stupid thing to do in general so very careless very aggressive and now you know they're paying the price so it's more of a celsius thing than a crypto thing.,1.0,-0.9
Tom Nash,H3lNQGaffCc,2022-06-13T12:14:58Z,We need to talk about what happened with Celsius and Bitcoin,Luna,it's literally what happened with luna so i guess it doesn't happen in america. i think that the celsius specifically is more about celsius being a little bit of douche bags in the sense that they're offering exuberant interest like 20 and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and i think they were investing in luna which was a stupid thing to do in general so very careless very aggressive and now you know they're paying the price so it's more of a celsius thing than a crypto thing.,0.9,-0.8
Tom Nash,H3lNQGaffCc,2022-06-13T12:14:58Z,We need to talk about what happened with Celsius and Bitcoin,PayPal,i mean it's not like paypal or facebook or amazon or any other stock is doing better i mean the entire market is in the toilet except oil i mean everything is down so it's not the crypto thing so i wouldn't celebrate just yet.,0.8,-0.2

Tom Nash,ija8NNu7MQc,2022-06-06T04:15:36Z,The future of energy prices and Palantir (w/ energy expert Sachin Sharma) - LIVE,Palantir,"you and I are both uh very uh outspoken investors of Palunteer and uh this is a topic that's been heavily debated. I want to kind of hear, we never spoke about this on air because we mainly focused on on oil so far, but I'm uh kind of known to be the head the head bull of Palunteer on the internet, but I I don't think many people realize because I bring you on in your hat as an energy expert that you're also uh quite interested in Palanteer. So, can you walk me through like a five minute bull thesis of number one, why you're so excited about panere and why you think the price is going to come much lower than it is today because I know that's what you think. So, uh so I work in oil and gas and my current role involves I'm a data strategy advisor of a very large company. I mean very large I could only say I have done several digital transformation projects in in in energy industry. So that how I got exposed to like what are the different challenges that you get to see. So when I see Paluntia I mean and I've shared it in past in terms of product solution there is no match. There is literally no match. Okay. I think what people miss is the complexity of data the the the velocity the variety the volume. There is no way. I mean all these companies are going to put all of their data at one place. You need some solution which is kind of ontology that works out. When you see how much oil companies spend on data and you see okay like what is the what is the largest transaction that is happening or happened it is with Palantia. Okay. So why companies are investing so much money uh on Palandir? I mean because the kind of value they get out of it. Palant has a lot of issues with it which they need to sort it out. And I have been I mean like even when I met the energy team in in Palant I mean I'm very vocal in sharing my view that what they are doing is right or what were the areas they can improve upon. But when you share some also information later about that meetings also once you finished with the thesis is this okay uh the discussions like most of the time the discussions you do with the companies are are pretty much like under uh non-disclosure agreements. Okay. So let's just say you met with Palunteer team and uh you had firsthand experience. Yeah. So the I'm not someone from retail who don't know what they do. I exactly know what they do. I exactly have seen what their product creates in terms of value. I also understand like what are their internal challenges at this point which is which is why they are I mean like few things they need to sort it out. Okay. Um so product is unmatched. Okay. when I see the macro of the sector see for me three things are more important when I invest in a company that first this company is going to be around in 10 years down the line because if a company goes bankrupt I mean it doesn't matter how good the product was so zero debt I mean they are critical for us infrastructures and US uh uh security and all and what a lot of people don't know that companies which are critical for for us for whatever reasons there is always a kind of a backup plan like if companies start going into undergoing concern. There's a backup plan to sustain that company which nobody discussed and it never comes out on on on out but there is there are people in in in in different departments who take care of this part. So is Palantier going to be around in 10 years? Yes. Okay. Is the sector pretty hot? Yes. I mean the expenditure in sector whether you call about digital twin the data platforms the AIM ML supply chains AI at scale I mean yeah they are growing at a kar of 10 to 30% every year so that means every comp every company in this sector has a good future as long as they manage to stay around during this recession and downtime okay I do not see a future where snowflake goes 10 times from here and palenda stays here You see all these companies are moving in unison. They're going up, they are going down. The difference what is happening like when you see a company like Snowflake, it has a very high institutional ownership. Okay. So that means it's its multiples are far higher when we look in terms of Palantia. But Palantia multiple of nine versus snowflake multiple of 28. It's not justified from my point of view. So think about this uh Tom. Let's say that Palenthia goes and Palenthia builds a revenue of 5 billion. Okay, which is reasonable by 2025. Okay. And we still take a multiple which we have as of today which is nine which is beaten of multi multiple at this particular point. We still talk about a company that is 45 billion market cap that is still more than 100% from what it is today. Now if a market bounce back okay and people realize that a product is good and the difference between a snowflake and Palantia multiple still stays but it kind of converges a bit and we talk about a multiple of 15 to 20 then we are talking about a company that could easily be somewhere around 75 to 80 billion. Okay. Now if the company comes out really well and they manage to sort out their issues they have in the self-s serving capacity I mean it can even go higher than that. So when I see like in terms of risk and reward to me the reward is far higher. Palanti has several issues they really need to sort it out but like today the stock is 87% down. Yeah so many stocks are down at this particular point. Yes I mean it balance is not the only one. I mean Tesla is almost like 40 50 versus 40 45% down. I mean the snow plague is around 60% down from its top. I mean AI is down like more than 90%. So when I see this criticism like of Palantir is down from 45 to six. Yeah. But you need to also be very clear that what is macro market macro, what is sector macro and what is company performance. Okay. Yeah. It's not like the market went went up and Palunteer went down. So So the I think NASDAQ is down like what 5% over the past six months. It's the index index is down 25 and there there is also the difference I mean like what is happening because now the the amount of passive investing is quite a lot. So when you invest in passive investing it's a weighted volume weighted investing. So that means what is happening the money over the time goes from the bottom of the market to the top of the market. So index is actually so when the indexes uh decrease by 20 25% and when you're in high-tech there's a divergence. Yes. Okay. industry or the market is expecting indexes to fall further but lot of these companies are already into very undervalued territory. So in my case because I know the product I have talked to people in company okay I have talked to a lot of people in their competition their customers uh so my view for them is is quite bullish but that's me I would you agree to me that their biggest challenge in the way they sell the commercial side of the product because obviously they have no problem with the government side they have that perfected they have been doing this for so long. And you know what they say, once you're in the government, you're in the government. This is kind of very hard to lose these contracts, especially when they kind of became the kind of the SpaceX to the NASA, like the piloter to the CIA, this private kind of intelligence agency for the government. But my question is because I'm more interested in commercial side. So on the commercial side, it seems to me they're faced with massive challenges because even though the product, I agree with you, is unrivaled. And if you don't believe me, watch some of the slides I shown. I' I've broken down the work they did with um with Airbus and some of the test cases that appear in the internal presentations with Airbus. You can see that the product is just insane. Oh, it takes a meeting. So, yeah, but Airbus is very different than the US uh B2B uh enterprise software marketing and sales because uh it's a very closed club with relationships uh being already existent and your Salesforce is brand new. It's green. Nobody have relationships and they're a little bit like a bull in a china shop. So they're coming in and these guys have already invested tens of millions into this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] infrastructure and then they they need to slowly convince them to to move. But it seems to me like they're going right now about it and I spoke about it before. It's like this Alex has this mentality of yeah just destroy everything. Let's build it scratch. This is going to be better. Yes, but it doesn't work politically inside these big organizations if you try this way. while instead you should basically do more of kind of hey here's the free feature you can use and you can learn about the software and you build lobby around it which kind of which they haven't been doing see Palenth has made several mistakes okay the first mistake Palentia made was that they didn't invest in their salesforce because they thought that product is so good people will just buy it and that was a that was the wrongest in a B2B context people don't buy things just because it's good people buy things because they try to visualize that once this thing is bought how the company dynamics will change how especially in enterprise software especially in enterprise especially in enterprise software so that there is a context which is more important I think this is where they they underinvested and they thought we have such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good product everybody will just buy it I think that he said it in the interview we don't need sales people yeah and you know I discussed like so so you know in my role I spend a lot of time studying companies like why one company is so good and And at the end of the day I have to kind of nurture it down to like five six bullets to a senior executive like why a company succeeds in a certain way. So in a data and digital world a company to succeed it has to have certain characteristic. One of the first characteristic that company has to have a product which is like a killer product. That means everyone wants it. Okay. So foundry for us is a killer product but a lot of people in industry even don't know it. So it's a killer product but people don't know about it. So in a way it's not that killer because people are still have not reached a point where everyone say that I don't care I want foundry in my office. It's not commoditized like snowflake where it's just simple. It's not it's not commoditized in a way. The second thing is time to value that yes when foundry is installed it can deliver value fast. So time to value is pretty good in execution phase but acquiring foundry that means reaching somebody in Palantier then getting the procurement done is not easy. So the time to value if you see overall in terms of procurement is is not simpler. The the entry ticket is quite high. So you need top down and executive decisions on that part. The next part is flexible and scalable. It is flexible and scalable once it is purchased. But it is not flexible and scalable when you are in the process of purchasing. You have to okay either you buy like this or buy like that. Nothing is like product have to be very thin. That means like for example a lot of time you you're missing something and you say okay yeah I mean this is like $25 I will spend more time thinking about it if I need to decide I just buy it. So if the product is thin that means if you spend time you will actually waste more money than the product actually is it doesn't exist with palant the portability interoperability is is top class I mean take the case of BP they have AWS and Azure in upstream downstream whole different ways but they use ontology to to connect it the domain expertise is something they have worked hard the domain expertise especially in terms of government and medical have improved but they need to bring more domain expertise to all the industry ities they sell okay the low code no code the the SI integration the partner ecosystem marketplace these things don't literally they don't they don't exist to make it uh mark I mean they have low code no code but can you access it like bubble IO or web flow no can you access it like power apps at this point no so these are the kind of things which are missing if you go to snowflake I mean snowflake I have said snowflake is a gold standard when it comes for partner ecosystem and client relationship management. There is no company that comes close to it. Even the the old linking government. So that is something they have a simple product. It's just like a database. Here you go. Boom. Out of the box and you know every time I interact with the snowflake team I mean it's it's just pleasure. I mean these guys are they know how to approach the client and how to approach their product has certain limitations but that's why their partner ecosystem is is pretty good to help it. So there are things which uh which Palanteer has to sort it but like I said it's easier to solve sometime the business and non-technical things when you are talking about the sectors which requires really cutting technology okay so in case of Palantier I think the technology is there so the question for me is always is that is it going to be a niche company or is it going to be the real juggernaut monopoly I don't see situation where where Palantier goes I mean Palantier can fail if a whole data sector fails And I don't see that happening. They made some strategic choices. For example, they say, ""Okay, don't don't want to work with Russia. They don't want to work with China."" And they anticipated a world which is which is a bit volatile and they're going to be more skirmish which is happening now. So a lot of companies have actually exposure to it. They are taking write out because of Russia. They don't have to take I mean their business is actually going up. So when you see that what happened in the price of share which is actually reflecting it there is nothing happened in the price of share that means that component we know on the ground it exist Palankier has an upside because of the current macro it doesn't have a downside but the stock price is not reflecting it so that means it will reflect it at some point over the time yes and you have seen you have seen 1999 2001 okay I mean you have seen 2008 200 2009 people in 2001 will come and tell you and dude I have no clue what's going on in the market. Okay. But yeah, I mean when the market is down it looks pretty erratic. It looks pretty irrational and that's why you need a sane hat to go through with it. What do you think about the this picture? You know I got this picture from a couple of my Palantia friends before it was it even came out. No, it's a it's a see it's a it's a statement the way I see it Tom. See lot of companies have come up with the hashtag help Ukraine and do this do that in Silicon Valley and Wall Street. How many people actually have ended helping the frontline soldiers in Ukraine? So just Elon Musk the one I know of with the with with his internet thing. Yeah. See you can help Ukraine in three things. Okay. Like for example, first thing is that in terms of supplies, refugees and people coming out of it. The second thing is see the only way Ukraine will actually survive this is by winning or by providing resistance to Russia. Okay. So which companies are actually helping on that front? Palanteer is there, Space, Starling is there, but everything else you talk about and people making all these kind of virtue signaling in in lot of places. Yeah. And the guy actually goes there and u and you know it's not they said it I mean like the only reason they are there because they're saying that the data analysis and analytics is actually helping them to fight Ukraine better than they could with all of this. And you know he he made on the statement. He said like when a country decide that they will go down the wire to save their democracy and their freedom and then you put them with the with the with the power of data they actually it becomes like what used to be the gorilla warfare in in in in 100 200 years back where still you're not that strong but you can still pose a credible threat to a to a far stronger enemy. So, uh, before I let you go, you've been vocal about this offline with me in a minute. Uh, how long do you think, uh, and when Palanteer finds a bottom? I mean, how I guess the other way to rephrase the question is how low can the share price go in the near future? So, I I'm thinking at least $65. That's where I think it I mean, yeah, same same for me actually. So, you know, uh, two ways to look at the bottom prices. The first point is that you need to see that if you need to liquidate company today that means balance not selling it just liquidate as of today what is the value of balance as of today with amount of their cash their remaining performance obligation their IP you would say that and again people can have their own view you will say six to seven billion six to seven billion yeah yeah so you will say that in that particular case you will still get $4 kind of a per share because okay so to me that's like the liquidation the going concern kind of valuation for for now when the when we already have seen tested 6.4 so it's fair to say that 6.4 force is is achievable on the bottom side that pretty much given we have also seen and there's a there is at least a general consensus in large investor community that indexes will break down at some point of time and when indexes fall everything falls it doesn't matter what price it is so in that kind of situation I mean I wouldn't I I would see that Palantia testing 56 for sure okay but that all depends that when indexes break down and how fast indexes break We haven't seen a circuit breaker uh in the recently and you know you don't go into recession in these kind of market especially a few circuit breakers. Yeah, we don't have few circuit breakers. So I mean uh I would expect two or three circuit breakers before we make eventual recovery. Uh before I let you go, I want you guys to look at the pinned comment. There's a pin comment in the chat right now that's been uh posted by Rich. uh, I'm going to put it on the screen after this call. Check out Sachin's channel. Search Sachin Vats on YouTube.

Tom Nash,ija8NNu7MQc,2022-06-06T04:15:36Z,The future of energy prices and Palantir (w/ energy expert Sachin Sharma) - LIVE,Chevron,"I want to show you an article that came out on Seeking Alpha and on Seeking Alpha they're actually interviewed the CEO of Chevron. I don't know if you've seen this article where he's talking about Yeah, I saw I've seen it. So in this article he's basically voicing what sounds to be a very critical position towards the US regulators. basically saying that uh you guys have killed the industry. That sounds like that's what he's saying, right? No, he he's right. I mean, and I'm with him on Explain his argument like in layman terms for me, what exactly does it mean? So you so like we discussed uh Tom just now that uh so if you want to invest in more refineries, refineries are long-term mega capital project. you need like 7 8 years of investment and then over the time of next 10 20 years you will actually break even and make money over that investment. So you need 20 10 15 to 20 years of demand uh assurance and you need that kind of regulatory framework that where you are sure that your investments are safe. This is what we discussed and this is what exactly is saying that there is no security there is no guarantee that if I put this money that uh I'll be protected I mean I'll make money for my shareholders on that part. So it is very clear that uh he he's simply saying that you you don't want US production to go up. You don't want uh uh you don't want to provide us a framework where as an industry we can at least thrive or at least contribute meaningfully. Okay. Yeah. I mean then why we do investment it's better we buy back stock and we give money to shareholders as a dividend. So where would he go? Can he does he does he imply that they they can go to other countries to build fundaries then? I mean what I mean Chevron has to sell oil. They need refineries. So when he says there's not going to be any new refineries. So that means I mean they're not going to go out of business, right? So what is he actually saying that they're moving out to Mexico and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So the answer is two parts. The first part is that yes they can go in other parts where they can build refinery but that's not easy. So I'll give you an example for the time being. So if you take the case of India, India imports 87% or 88% of its its oil needs in general. So that means even if there's a fullblown uh green drive you still need oil before you make the full transition but the downstream in in India is actually is I mean the refinary industry has a lot of big players. So somebody like even for the places they are safe okay it's not that easy for Chevron to go to China or to India and to build a place for themselves. So it's it's easier to to say like okay we can go out and we can build on refineries but you can do like 1 2 3 that's it. You cannot do it like in a strategic move like okay this I'm going to build 20 refineries outside US. So that is first thing. The second challenge they are having is that uh when you go like like for example you're going to build a refinery okay there are two ways you do it. You do it to yourself or you do it in partnership. You go to middle list or you build with some of the partners there. that's more likely because that's a technology transfer but then you don't make that kind of revenue don't have control on that kind of project. So they are they are the projects in in downstream I don't think that many are going to happen if uh the situation stays like that there's something else has happened in last five six years that people have not noted and if you go through the shareholder reports people will say that that the super majors they say that they have highgraded their portfolio that means they have reduced the exposure to a lot of countries so they are their presence global presence in in last five to six years is less than what it used to be 10 to 12 years. So it is counter strategy in both ways. So what what does it mean like is this an empty threat? Can they what happens to Chevron as a company if they don't ever build new refineries in the US? I mean can they still just I mean at some point they need new refineries to replace outdated ones, right? It depends. It depends. See they are present in upstream, midstream, downstream. So they can decide that we want to reduce our downstream. So they say okay more money is in upstream or midstream. See they are in an integrated oil and gas company because the industry was designed in US in such a way that you make a lot of money if you are integrated. If that incentive is no more and having downstream exposure is is a is a liability. I mean yeah it's better to to to drop it. I don't think that is happening but I also don't see a situation where they are going to invest a lot of money in building infrastructure and refineries and new fields in US with current regulatory framework as well. So what basically needs to happen it sounds is that uh we we need some assurances that the era of the ESG scam slashrenewable fantasy needs to kind of be rejected by governments for oil producers to actually ramp up production.",1.0,0.1
Tom Nash,ija8NNu7MQc,2022-06-06T04:15:36Z,The future of energy prices and Palantir (w/ energy expert Sachin Sharma) - LIVE,BlackRock,"I would agree with what black rockck has set as a mission but the way it was implemented and executed it becomes more a euphoria and cult rather than any ground movement. So it is way off. It is way off. Like for example like when you talk about ESG uh you have to talk ESG in the same way it is talk on Wall Street and Silicon Valley. If you do not agree with that term I mean yeah you are not ESG. So that's so for example say I come from Southeast Asia. Okay, Southeast Asia is an entirely different culture. Okay, people the way people think about religion is different. So lot of pe things which which people in Europe or in US will agree on ESG, people in Southeast Asia will not agree on. So where is the inclusiveness here? Okay. Are these people or the living if you go to India or if you go to China and you say that this is what some few people in Silicon Valley has decided to BSG, you need to follow it. I mean there was an interview recently for foreign minister for India uh Jes and this this lady was asking asking the that there is only two exes in the world the China and the and the and the US and the guy said it in a very simple way. He said see I represent one fifth of the world's population. I think I'm entitled to have my own side and you Europe has to come out of this mindset where Europe problems are world problems but world problems are not Europe problems. So this is what ESG is missing. Like we don't talk about Africa. We don't talk about Latin America. I mean know are these continents these people don't exist. They don't have a say. So that is where I think Black Rockck has missed it. They made a playbook and then everybody started deploying that playbook without thinking. Uh yeah I think you you do something you you get to get to see the price of it. And this is exactly what is happening.",1.0,-0.2
Tom Nash,ija8NNu7MQc,2022-06-06T04:15:36Z,The future of energy prices and Palantir (w/ energy expert Sachin Sharma) - LIVE,Tesla,"Also what happened with the success of companies like Tesla and if you see like SpaceX uh the I mean Elan was like for he has shown that yeah you can make money and business in lot of other ways also without offshoring things. Okay you if you do do a proper vertical integrated uh supply chain and manufacturing you can actually build different sources of advantage. So there is a shift that is happening also. Uh the question is who makes most of it companies or countries like China or countries like US? I think that's pretty much going to be the defining factor. Do you find it laughable? Because I do to be honest and it's a little bit of a guiding question. I'm aware of this but uh I kind of like like to ask questions with my own opinion built in. I so I would you agree with me it's laughable that after years and years where the US auto like when I was a kid in the 1980s and even in the in the 1990s US cars were the best in the world like if you got a US like a like a Chevy or a Ford truck they were the best best technology best electronics they were unrivaled this was like the dream I always dreamed like my dad will have like a an American car says etc. Right? And then what happened is that over the course of the 2000s, the Japanese, the Koreans have completely demolished the US auto industry. that may so at this point GM and Ford and Chrysler are lagging behind for the past 20 years trying to play catch-up being bailed out by the government carrying massive debt basically trying to survive while they're getting absolutely destroyed by by Korean and Japanese and now soon Chinese companies and then all of a sudden you have an American company fully integrated in the US that is kicking everybody's ass, taking over the world, and the government is making concentrated efforts. The Biden administration, if you don't like it, unsubscribe, is making concentrated efforts at kicking this company the nuts and basically saying how great the failures of GM and Ford are and how Tesla should be ignored. I find this just I feel like we're in the Montipython [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] skit at this point because this is just not unreal. You know what I mean? No, I agree. I mean it looks unreal but there's a there's a reason for that. Uh see in politics there are there are some tenets that you you need to follow before anything. The first tenant of the politics is is the only good things are those that are under my control. Anything that is not under my control is evil. So that's pretty much what is happening is like okay they don't think that they control Elon Musk. uh Elon Musk has a lot of say and lot of power in terms of drawing or making move about an opinion so they don't control it. So from their point of view Elon Musk is is it doesn't follow that tenant. I mean Tesla is almost like 40 50 versus 40 45% down.",1.0,0.9

Uh the question is who makes most of it companies or countries like China or countries like US? I think that's pretty much going to be the defining factor. How many people actually have ended helping the frontline soldiers in Ukraine? So just Elon Musk the one I know of with the with with his internet thing. Yeah. See you can help Ukraine in three things. Okay. Like for example, first thing is that in terms of supplies, refugees and people coming out of it. The second thing is see the only way Ukraine will actually survive this is by winning or by providing resistance to Russia. Okay. So which companies are actually helping on that front?

They're going up, they are going down. The difference what is happening like when you see a company like Snowflake, it has a very high institutional ownership. Okay. So that means it's its multiples are far higher when we look in terms of Palantia. But Palantia multiple of nine versus snowflake multiple of 28. It's not justified from my point of view. So foundry for us is a killer product but a lot of people in industry even don't know it. So it's a killer product but people don't know about it. So in a way it's not that killer because people are still have not reached a point where everyone say that I don't care I want foundry in my office. It's not commoditized like snowflake where it's just simple. It's not it's not commoditized in a way. if you go to snowflake I mean snowflake I have said snowflake is a gold standard when it comes for partner ecosystem and client relationship management. There is no company that comes close to it. Even the the old linking government. So that is something they have a simple product. It's just like a database. Here you go. Boom. Out of the box and you know every time I interact with the snowflake team I mean it's it's just pleasure. I mean these guys are they know how to approach the client and how to approach their product has certain limitations but that's why their partner ecosystem is is pretty good to help it.",1.0,0.3

disrespecting patronizing insulting and making fun of retail investors no less taxpayers money paid for the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're about to see check this out this is from the scc's own youtube channel you can't make this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and it's your investment i'll take meme stocks invest your investment julie i'm gonna do some research first well played julie locally we can do research investing is not a game always do your research before making an investment decision learn more at investor.gov before now i applaud their decision right to educate investors about the importance of doing research i'm definitely all for it but i've never seen anything like this this looks like the game show from requiem for a dream this post-apocalyptic game show this is what game shows would look like if the nazis had won the war i'm not even kidding you this is just insane so they put out this garbage now it's just surreal the narrative that they're trying to sit here which is what i'm mostly annoyed about is that it was all your fault in that meme stocks is the only problem with the stock market and the sec is going after you since you're the problem and you just made it happen the only problem is that even if you invested in safe stocks let's say invested in netflix six months ago six months ago in netflix you lost 70 of your money i mean let's talk with the sec about the 140 short interest that they let happen with gme how the hell did you let it happen now it's a pr media battle to see whose fault this whole thing was obviously they can't blame the billionaires and the hedge funds they gotta go after the retail investors the 20 of the money in the stock market is retail investors 80 of the money is not it's all institutional but then again it's easier to go off these faceless nameless people make them look like idiots throw some pie in their face and show them patronize over them oh poor you retail stupid investor you don't know how to even do research while in reality the sec fell asleep at the wheel let this whole thing develop they let people 140 short interested company without doing anything and instead of owning up to their mistakes they're trying to preserve this narrative as if the only thing that happened with gamestop is the demand from retail investors because of the social media insanity caused this to happen if they didn't let companies like melvin capital short the half out of this company none of this happens in fact i find this ad a little bit ironic you know why because the only reason the gamestop mania happened is because there was so much research done on reddit especially on wall street bits before it a little bit went to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so much research led to this idea of oh this company shorted more than a hundred percent we can punish these guys who for years basically took advantage of us let's just go at them let's squeeze the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of them the amount of research that went into making the gamestop squeeze happen is unrivaled in fact guys like a roaring kitty put in years of their life researching this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now there's nothing wrong with encouraging research and careful assessment of investments i totally agree with the idea but the execution here is just awful they're using this to set this narrative as if gamestop was your fault let's be clear gamestop was the fault of the sec who let companies like melvin capital short gamestop more than once which is unthinkable to me and their attempt instead of coming out and saying hey we were wrong

Tom Nash,wIgsTF4iLGc,2022-05-14T11:59:24Z,PALANTIR: The Media Lies About Insiders Dumping Stock,Palantir,so let's talk about what can only be described as a hit piece against palantir by cnbc and i hope everybody's enjoying this saturday morning i am now check this out cnbc put out a very long video with mr sorkin and his guest i don't know who the guest is talking about how palantir basically had their insiders sell one billion dollars worth of shares in the height of the price action on talenteer in 2021. so the whole narrative of this piece was that while everybody was gaga about this company these guys were heavily selling it off and all the way to one billion dollars worth of sales while the retail investors got screwed now here's what they're not telling you because this whole narrative is complete garbage bs and i'll explain so here's the story here so basically we had this plan that was granted to alex carp about 12 years ago in 2010 and in that plan he received 16 million shares of volunteer for cents on the dollar i delivered something ridiculous pretty much for free and you have to remember in 2010 i mean the company was pretty much you know an esoteric government contractor private company a lot of liquidity i mean it is what it is now a year later in 2011 he got another grant of another 10 million shares i believe so in total 10 plus years ago he got 70 million shares of volunteer now the expiration date on this was i believe december 3rd of the top of my head december 3rd 2021 so unless he would have exercised meaning that unless he would have purchased the shares based on the option agreements that he had these option agreements would have expired on december 4th 2021 which means that if he wanted to buy these 70 million shares of valentine he had to do that by no later than december 3rd 2021 and much like alex carp i'm assuming sean sankar and steven cohen and a lot of the other insiders had similar plans i'm assuming with smaller amounts but the idea was very very similar so basically what happens in the situation that's what they're not telling you which is i think an atrocious way of reporting about this is that basically alex carp had to exercise all those options by december 3rd 2021 and he did so when he did that he basically paid tax on the market price of the shares so if you exercise 70 million shares at a market price of about 24 dollars per share which it was back in the day that means you're in the hook for about 1.8 billion dollars of taxable employee benefits which is pretty much like salary so you're getting taxed at his tax level with state tax and whatever i don't know if it's california state tax or colorado whatever it is i don't know it's probably close to 50 because it's an employee benefit it's not a capital gains tax so you're on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars probably close to 700 800 million dollars of tax on these employee options exercise i have to understand that there's no money coming in i just want to explain this when you exit the options you're actually paying money you're paying whatever i know 20 30 cents per share to buy the shares so you have an expense you're buying a lot of shares and then you have to pay tax because the government sees this as a benefit from the employer to you rightfully so you're getting shares for 20 cents that are worth 20 right so the difference between the couple of cents that you pay per share to buy it and the market price of the share is a benefit to you so you should be taxed for that 100 i have no problem with that but the problem is that for the recipient of the options in this case alex carp steven cohen and champs-anchor there's no money to pay i mean none of them have 800 million dollars or more I believe it was a billion in total with all three of them included so and that's common practice anybody who's in this industry will tell you that this is common practice what needs to be done in this situation is that you exercise the shares sorry exercise the options and you sell shares in an adequate amount just to pay the tax because i mean if they wanted to sell more shares then just to pay the tax they would have sold at a higher amount sorry at a higher rate not just the tax now look i know it sounds convoluted but i'll explain a second so basically now going back to the cnbc article so cnbc told you that all these insiders sold one billion dollars worth of shares now i just showed you that alex carp alone hit what seems to be like close to 800 million dollars worth of tax bill if you add on top of that i don't know exactly how much maybe it's less me i just sped on my phone whatever i don't know probably more probably less i don't know but he had a couple hundred million worth of tax bill to pay and that's indisputable what exactly the amount was i'll just assume 800 million for the purpose of this video for simplicity and if you add in sham sankar and steven cohen it's probably close to a billion it's exactly the number that cnbc told you that they sold so what happens is you sell shares and you take the proceeds from these sales okay and then you essentially pay taxes with it but the one thing you have to realize is when you sell these shares you also have a tax liability on that that's capital gains tax rate so you're selling you're generating another taxable event you're paying off capital gains tax and the remainder is being used to pay off the tax on the employee options exercise so the entire narrative here one billion dollars worth of insider sales in 2021 is just employee stock options exercises and selling just enough to pay the tax bill that's it there's no extra money i mean alex harp isn't a billionaire he doesn't even qualify as a hundred millionaire at this point i don't believe so i mean his salary is about like a million a year i mean he's wealthy and i'm sure he's doing just fine and he's going to be extremely wealthy one day when he sells the shares but he hasn't gotten any new money so these sales is just to pay the taxes on the options and i don't know why cnbc refused to talk about it because this is literally common practice elon musk did it every single founder did it it's not unusual now the other thing they talked about is the delusion and they'll pull up these charts showing you the dilution of the shares and palantir and they'll share world volunteer in 2018 had 600 million shares and now they have two billion shares that's not good but what they don't tell you is that from 600 million shares to 1.75 billion shares that's just the dpo when the company decides to go dpo which means direct public offering and not ipo not initial public offering by the way ipos screw the retail investors and dpos are equal opportunity kind of game that's why you do it you try to benefit the retail investor so when you go the dpo route employees get more stock so they can create the market because the only ones who can create the market is the current shareholders and employees so basically 1.75 billion shares was the result of the dpo and that has nothing to do with the investors that actually bought it in the free market because i mean they were already buying it post this delusion that happened before the dpo now there's more things that happened that added to the solution because they they went i believe all the way to 2 billion shares 2.1 billion shares as alex carp actually got a new plan for the next 10 years which expires in 2030 i believe or 2031 and that new plan adds more stock-based compensation but again standard stuff all i gotta say about it and just look at the dilution it's still diluting quite heavily um i they're still deluding about 10 per quarter which is a heavy dilution but it's not like they're not like doubling the share the share count every quarter why they still heavily diluting 10 percent water is a big delusion i'm not gonna lie it's because they're setting up a whole new sales department which did not exist until like a year and a half ago so there's a lot of stock based comp that's involved in that as well now there's a third criticism that is not being made against palliative which i'll make here as devil's advocate here which i again i don't know why they would not explain this so the one criticism you could have against volunteer is basically saying well look alex carp had all these shares expiring in late 2021 what happens if the company does not go public he has to exercise them and he has to sell in the private market to pay for the tax and the amount of money he would have gotten in the private market would not have come close to what you get in a liquid public market so potentially you could say that their decision to go public in october 2020 a year before the expiration of all these options was driven partially by the desire of insiders to essentially get a better price and for the stocks they're selling to pay the tax on the options exercise and potentially it may have been one of the causes because i mean another potential reason would be the insanely good market because as you remember in october 2020 the market was incredibly good and if it takes six months to plan an ipo or dpo this case and they started in march it seems like they rode the wave as well but there's a lot of companies that did that volunteer wasn't the only company who tried as a company you always trying to you know go public when the market is the best it's just good business and i don't think it's a huge problem but i mean these things should be said and again have not been covered in mainstream media but i can say about it you know just you know don't believe the hype do your own research i actually mean it go read the stuff i mean it's all public information,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,AgPrs5Ik6wg,2022-05-02T14:34:32Z,Warren Buffett Bets $5.5 Billion On Activision Deal - is He Wrong?,Warren Buffett,this is tom nash and warren buffett just took a huge bet against wall street and trust me you want to hear about this because beyond the popcorn value there's a lot of money making opportunities right here you don't want to miss out on let's do this now what's shocking here is of all people of anybody you can think of to be against wall street is the crazy grandpa from omaha and let me show you how and since in my videos the bottom line always comes first i'm not gonna drag you through the video just to share with you my conclusion so my conclusion is quite simple the crazy grandpa from omaha aka warren buffett aka the dominator is actually bidding heavy against wall street here he's going balls deep into this with a lot of money now what initially started is a small 800 million bit which was actually made by one of his lieutenants now has become a full-on warren buffett personal bet of 5.5 billion that this deal is actually happening at a much higher price than what was originally the original 800 million dollar bet and so my bottom line is very simple i believe that warren buffett is correct here and i believe that the wall street analysts are mispricing this deal because of lack of understanding of the video game industry as i will show you in this video i'll walk you through what warren buffett is doing how he's doing it and if you're interested how you can also tag along with him for these nice 26 percent essentially this wasn't even warren buffett's deal to begin with initially one of his lieutenants at berkshire hathaway made an 800 million dollars arbitrage deal it's called the risk arbitrage you essentially bet the deal will go through and will not fall apart now this was a small bet worth about two percent of the entire stock of activism not a huge deal but basically the play was quite simple they bought it at sixty dollars per share they being berkshire hathaway and if the deal actually goes through they'll get 95 per share meaning a nice 58 gain on an investment of 800 million dollars not bad now nothing to get excited about if you break your hath away but a really nice play and what happened on friday is actually quite astonishing because warren buffett came out and said hey from now on this is my decision this was made by one of my lieutenants but now i'm personally deciding to quadruple in fact 5x this bet all the way to 5.5 billion dollars at a higher price at 70 bucks per share and that basically means he's going all in because going above 10 isn't an option from a whole bunch of regulatory reasons i'm not gonna get into this right now but it just goes to show you he's all in now what he actually did here he increased his cost basis from 60 to around 70 with this deal essentially cutting into the profits instead of 58 arbitrage right now they're looking 40 not bad for a bet that i think is actually very very logical now if you jump in on this right now you're gonna be buying at seventy five dollars per share for a ninety five dollar per share deal which means you're looking at twenty six percent arbitrage not as good as warren but quite nice giving what i'm about to show you well step number one could be to actually try to go for this deal along with warren buffett and berkshire hathaway take your 26 percent and enjoy them,1.0,1.0
Tom Nash,AgPrs5Ik6wg,2022-05-02T14:34:32Z,Warren Buffett Bets $5.5 Billion On Activision Deal - is He Wrong?,Activision Blizzard,microsoft announced the acquiring activision blizzard for 95 dollars per share which is a massive 50 premium over then share price 64. now what actually happens here that if you're a shareholder of activision blizzard all that means once the deal completes you're getting 95 per share into your brokerage account simple as that this was a small bet worth about two percent of the entire stock of activism not a huge deal the shareholders of activision in fact 98 of them approved the deal and of course like everything in life nothing is simple and peachy there are issues that you need to be considering for example unlike the twitter deal which has a five month expiration period this deal has over a year until june of next year so you're gonna be looking at a long period until you actually see any money if any that's something you have to be considering however that's just a timing issue the main risk in this deal and everybody knows that is the competition analysis the antichrist issues the ftc this deal has to be approved in 17 countries in order to go through activision makes a very famous game called call of duty a call of duty was a staple in the video game community trust me as a gamer i can attest to that it's very common both on microsoft consoles and on sony consoles and the fear would be that microsoft would come in and say this is going to be an exclusive just for our consoles we're not going to let sony access to this game,1.0,0.5
Tom Nash,AgPrs5Ik6wg,2022-05-02T14:34:32Z,Warren Buffett Bets $5.5 Billion On Activision Deal - is He Wrong?,Microsoft,on january 18 2022 just a couple of months ago microsoft announced the acquiring activision blizzard for 95 dollars per share which is a massive 50 premium over then share price 64. what better way than to go after microsoft she's already going after facebook and after amazon but that's exactly the problem the ftc is a governmental regulator it only can fight so many fronts at the same time it has limited resources to go after facebook and amazon and microsoft at the same time it's not going to be easy and she has to pick her battles and going after facebook with their well-documented issues and the pr nightmare that they are i mean it's not me saying that it's kind of a known deal it's much easier than to go after microsoft which hadn't really had any issues with the ftc for the past two decades also i mean it's a harder case if this deal goes through microsoft is going to become one of the biggest gaming companies in the entire world along with sony and tencent and yes this is the biggest acquisition in the history of microsoft but having said all that this deal is still a very tough case for the ftc to pursue because the ftc has to look at this deal in either of two ways either as a horizontal merger or a vertical merger now they can of course go for the vertical argument and say that microsoft provides consoles and platforms and now they're buying a vertical producer of games now in that case they'll have to show that this reduces competition because they're going to deny access from other participants of the market to this video game company now in this case what it actually means is that activision makes a very famous game called call of duty a call of duty was a staple in the video game community trust me as a gamer i can attest to that it's very common both on microsoft consoles and on sony consoles and the fear would be that microsoft would come in and say this is going to be an exclusive just for our consoles we're not going to let sony access to this game now that has been already eliminated and that is something i expected the wall street analyst to know because microsoft came out day one and said hey we have zero intentions to make call of duty and exclusive it's bad business nobody wants the best selling game in history at least a shooter to be on one console instead of two that's cutting your market in half for absolutely no reason and you know the ftc might ask microsoft to sign a legal document stating that they're not going to do that and i'm sure microsoft will but in essence this makes the whole case either as a vertical or as a horizontal merger a problem for the ftc and in fact professor daniel crane an expert in antitrust from the university of michigan actually said the following if i microsoft i'm expecting pushback from the ftc however i'm feeling pretty confident about my odds here,1.0,0.7
Tom Nash,AgPrs5Ik6wg,2022-05-02T14:34:32Z,Warren Buffett Bets $5.5 Billion On Activision Deal - is He Wrong?,Wall Street,warren buffett just took a huge bet against wall street and trust me you want to hear about this because beyond the popcorn value there's a lot of money making opportunities right here you don't want to miss out on let's do this wall street is essentially saying hey we think it's more likely than not that this deal isn't happening they're betting against this deal now what's shocking here is of all people of anybody you can think of to be against wall street is the crazy grandpa from omaha the crazy grandpa from omaha aka warren buffett aka the dominator is actually bidding heavy against wall street here i believe that warren buffett is correct here and i believe that the wall street analysts are mispricing this deal because of lack of understanding of the video game industry as i will show you in this video that is something i expected the wall street analyst to know because microsoft came out day one and said hey we have zero intentions to make call of duty and exclusive it's bad business nobody wants the best selling game in history at least a shooter to be on one console instead of two that's cutting your market in half for absolutely no reason,1.0,-0.8
Tom Nash,AgPrs5Ik6wg,2022-05-02T14:34:32Z,Warren Buffett Bets $5.5 Billion On Activision Deal - is He Wrong?,Twitter,now just for reference if you're looking at twitter versus elon that deal isn't priced at a 26 arbitrage in fact that deal is priced at 49 with the payout being 54.20 as you all know so that deal has about 10 risk this deal shows 26 risk essentially with that amount of risk pricing wall street is essentially saying hey we think it's more likely than not that this deal isn't happening they're betting against this deal unlike the twitter deal which has a five month expiration period this deal has over a year until june of next year so you're gonna be looking at a long period until you actually see any money if any that's something you have to be considering,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,91YWvauUkQ4,2022-04-30T14:42:03Z,META Stock - Finally Too Cheap To Ignore?!,Meta Platforms,so facebook is it to buy these prices i mean it's down a lot numbers are quite phenomenal but there are risks now this video will show you the opportunities but also the risks you need to be aware of if you're considering putting some money into facebook let's get started now just a few months ago facebook was trading at 320 dollars ever since then they only gotten better look at the financials however the price went down to the 200. now that creates an opportunity but it's not without risks now first of all let me show you the fundamentals right now the company is trading at four times sales that's not a lot considering the fact that everything else across the board is pristine i'll show in a second they have great free cash flow operating margin is insane they're actually insanely scalable and they don't have a lot of risks internally as far as expenses and growth look at their operating income it's growing like crazy six billion six years ago 47 billion in 2022 look at the revenue versus cost of goods it's about 6x and it doesn't change when they did 18 billion in revenue the cost of goods were three now they're doing 120 the cost of goods is only 23 and as you can see the gap remains their very scalable business as it should be now does the business generate cash flow we want our cash flow 5.5 billion dollars in 2015 now six years later 30 billion dollars in free cash flow that's a company that's trading at four times sales with 30 billion dollars in cash flow now look cash versus debt 16 and a half billion cash 14.5 debt net cash positive check right what else do you want in the company cash versus liabilities 16 versus 41 about 40 cash of liabilities assets net of goodwill versus liabilities 145 versus 41. three and a half times more assets versus liabilities without goodwill and look the company doesn't have any crazy expenses they're monetizing traffic that is based on user-generated content without any competition in fact the only risk internally might come from anti-trust issues because of the fact they don't have any competition but i think that ship sailed a long time ago i don't think the antitrust authorities especially in north america are going to go at facebook at this stage now looking at the company from a broader perspective there are risks that you need to be aware of despite the phenomenal numbers i just showed you first of all you have to understand that facebook is extremely sensitive to currency risks to forex facebook is a global business it's not heavy north america it has a lot of income that's coming from abroad and as you notice recently the dollar somehow god knows why is getting stronger and stronger that means they're getting less and less money from their foreign geographies where they're operating now at the end of the day it's not going to kill facebook but it's definitely going to cut in into their efficiency now the other thing you have to remember if we are headed to recession if we're going through inflation increase rates and then eventually recession and that seems to be a global thing right now going on especially with the geopolitics china lockdowns commodity crisis food crisis potentially if we're going to some bad times discretionary spending is gonna go down advertising spending is gonna go down at least in the first stage companies that rely on ad revenue are gonna take a hit and facebook is not immune to that and you have to remember that when you factor in these beautiful numbers,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,yIQQPPhEJ2s,2022-04-29T18:51:44Z,Cathie Wood Doubling Down On TDOC Stock - Big Mistake?,Teladoc,the lady is doubling down on teledoc i guess she called the teledoc and he told her to double down on the company i don't know what happened we gotta talk about this. but in all honesty in no truth we have to be honest i mean she isn't that bad i mean doubling down on teledog is a slightly crazy thing to do it's a little bit bananas but before we talk about teledog and what i think about her buying more shares let me just kind of defend kathy here because look if you want to judge a fund you got to stretch it out a little bit you know it's like old shoes you got to go five years to see what the fun has done now over the past five years kathy has been pretty much average plus nothing to write home about but not so bad i mean over the past five years she did about 90 percent i mean that's a little bit more than the s p 500 at 80 and a little bit less than the crazy grandpa from omaha warren buffett that did 100 so you know she's kind of in between an index fund and warren buffett nothing exciting but i mean it's not horrible she did have some horrible two years right now oh that was a doozy now as far as teledog look there's a question here how good this company is and how good this company can be now kathy wood did invest more stock after that company reported one of the most abysmal results anybody can imagine but i mean she didn't want balls deep into this company let's be honest she bought six hundred thousand shares now six hundred thousand shares a rough calculation is about 20 million dollars now you have to remember she already has a position of 1 billion dollars in this company it's one of our biggest positions so another 20 million is meaningless what's important here is not the increase which is incremental again it's not the size it's what you do with it it's the fact that she didn't sell you have two people here on opposite sides of the spectrum on the one hand you have bill ackman with a sizable bet on netflix just as big or almost as big as the stellar dog bed which basically are comparable cases and you can see how bill ackman despite his massive loss basically pulled out and said hey made a mistake kathy's doubling down she's doing the opposite now is there ego involved here well maybe partially but i think she's just going along with this company now whether i think it's correct or not that's a whole different enchilada let me explain going balls deep or at least staying balls deep on a company like teledog in this climate is a little bit problematic and let me explain why well first of all there's a thesis problem the thesis on this company is feces and let me explain i was part of the crowd who thought that the world is going to change forever because of the pandemic that patterns of behavior are going to be forever changed the people just want to stay home as much as they can now that doesn't really work like that because what we found out during the pandemic and after the pandemic is that people don't want to go to work because they don't want to be around everything that does not require them to be at a place where they don't want to be and be with doing they don't want to do which is work everything else they want to go outside and do that outside recreational stuff leisure vacations fitness even medicine imagine going in front of the webcam saying hey doc i have this little tucker carlson in my nutsack can you see what it is can you tell me what it is i mean it's not really comfortable i mean you know you want to see the doctor you want him to see what you got i mean unless you're refilling prescriptions it's pretty much more convenient to go to actually see the guy now here's the thing most of the stuff that teledoc are offering already exist talk to any professional in medicine and id these are not innovative things i mean telemedicine has been around for a long time i really don't see what's the unique factor of teledoc i mean they're nice business they're just a nice little provider of telemedicine which will do somewhat well but to think of them as the next tesla of medicine is the next disruptor in this medicine world it's kind of cuckoo it's kind of bananas,1.0,-0.8

Tom Nash,3OY6FQd5dp0,2022-04-29T13:14:54Z,Elon Musk Sells Tesla Stock To Finance Twitter Deal,Tesla,elon musk according to the wall street journal sold 4 billion of his tesla stock after agreeing to buy twitter and obviously these two events are connected and in this video i'll show you exactly how much he's selling what's the debt structure on the twitter deal and how much more he needs to sell of tesla if any and there's an important update you don't want to miss about future sales how much more if any he needs to sell now obviously as you will see in the article this cell is driven because of the twitter deal he needs some cash to finance that deal another 12 and a half billion dollars loans against tesla shares which is again the structure is basically right here and you can see the 13 and 12 and a half that comes to about 25 and a half billion dollars now as you just saw from the headline he sold 4 billion worth of tesla stock that still leaves 17 billion dollars he has to bring in order to get the deal done obviously he's in the short for 17 billion so a lot of people are speculating that because he still needs another 17 billion dollars to complete the deal going to have to sell more tesla stock and that's the important part because if he has to sell more tesla stock there's going to be more pain on the tesla stock side because if you look at the tesla share price you see exactly how it played out you can see exactly when he started to sell what happened to the share price it went from a thousand dollars and a little bit above all the way down to 870 yesterday now it's slightly coming back up so him selling more shares can potentially put more pressure on the tesla stock and its price so that is why he actually went on twitter today and tweeted this tweet no further tesla sales planned after today no further tesla sales planned after today that means he's not going to be selling more tesla shares now again you can interpret it in a bunch of ways today is still april 29th which means that he might sell more shares today and no more sales after today so again we don't know exactly where the box stops but will he sell 17 billion dollars of tesla stock in a single day i highly doubt it if anything it's probably going to be very similar to what he'd done so far so maybe another two three four billion dollars worth of tesla stock elon musk has plenty of tesla stock to go around he holds about you know 150 160 billion dollars of tesla stock if my math is correct which means he just sold about you know not even five percent of that i mean let's be honest it's not a huge deal especially if you want to buy a platform like twitter which he believes is transformational for you know the survival of the human race now you have to understand if you want to invest in an elon project which is tesla you have to take the good with the bad or the bad with the good he is what it is i mean he's not the sort of guy who's going to make strictly financial decisions as far as risks for the deal based on funding clearly those are slowly evaporating as he's selling tesla shares i'm sure certain tesla shareholders are not happy about that but it is what it is you want elon you get the good the bad,1.0,-0.2

Tom Nash,EEJzq7T3ezk,2022-04-28T11:28:41Z,The true meaning of freedom of speech 🎤,Twitter,hey this is tom and we got a big problem right now the whole twitter deal is basically going sideways and not from the corporatey side that obviously is going to work itself out i mean nobody has an interest for this deal not to go through i believe the deal is 100 happening even though ellen took a few shots at the current chief legal officer or whatever she is i don't know and they might say that this is a breach of their own agreement can't basically talk trash about them i mean what's their interest let's say they pursue this do they really want to cancel the deal and not sell at 54.20 i mean the deal will go through in my opinion the problem with the whole twitter deal isn't the corporate side the problem is the whole discussion on twitter right now which kind of ironically people miss the whole point of this the whole point of why elon purchased this is because it was one side was getting to talk their piece their narrative and if you went sideways from that narrative they shut you up so he's buying the platform to release this. If you think about the whole twitter takeover by elon as defeating the walk and getting the whatever the right back on twitter that goes against everything elon is trying to do. but i'm saying the same thing can happen with twitter the same mistakes can happen if we the people who come back twitter and basically say hey you all have been basically setting the narrative you'll better sit the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down and we're going to be dominating the platform from now on that isn't absolute freedom of speech that isn't what elon is pushing for i just want you to know that the whole idea is to fix something that's been broken for a long time as somebody who came from outside the us i've seen this happen and it was painful for me to see this happen where the ability of people in america to disagree with each other and have a meaningful discussion talk about points they disagree with each other without screaming at each other without blocking each other without punching each other has basically died there is no way in america anymore to talk to each other about things we disagree about for example politics for example gender stuff right for example um pretty much anything that has to do with the the way we want to live our lives so if we disagree we watch different television shows i watch fox or i watch cnn my friend or my neighbor he watches the other show either focus cnn i basically block who i don't want to hear to on twitter and i never see their opinions and even worse these platforms won't even show me their stuff because they know it will make me upset and why make me upset right i want to stay on the platform right more ad revenue so they're going to show me things i agree with and basically we've been living in echo chambers for a very very very long time please do not support people who support turning twitter into a different echo chamber the whole idea is to free up the platform let you hear things that i know you deep inside and redevelop reintroduce the ability of our society to talk to each other on things we don't agree with and have a handshake at the end of it basically like in a good fight come shake the hand of your opponent say thank you we agree to disagree i appreciate you telling what you feel i feel differently but it's okay we'll talk about it some more all the best instead of turning it into this dehumanization right now when you look at it you basically see people that dehumanize the other party if they don't agree with you then they basically reduce to rubble i don't think that should be the case so in my view let ilan do his thing and understand that the idea here isn't to punish a certain group even though they've been misbehaving even though they acted like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] even though they abused their power when they had it doesn't mean that you should be the same in fact you can prove that you're better by actually allowing them to have a voice just like you and elon said the same thing if you don't agree with me look at what elon is saying ellen said specifically that i hope my worst critics stay on the platform once i own it i hope my worst critics stand the platform once i own it it's exactly the point don't forget why he's doing that now i know a lot of you will unsubscribe because of this video because i talked about politics and gender and stuff like that so be it i'm good with that no problem we can agree to disagree i still love you i still respect you all the best,1.0,-0.5

Tom Nash,MftZ5z4YwUQ,2022-04-27T14:35:34Z,How To Benefit From This Stock Market Crash,FCA,I'm going to be adding a new stock which i've never had before and i'm going to show you in a second check this out on the screen right now this is the stock i'm talking about it's called fca this is from tip ranks the stock is valued at 49.93 dollars by 15 ratings which is 24 percent upside i'm not investing because of the tip trends ranking i just think it's very interesting to see what analysts are saying about the stock there's a wide range of analysts that are talking about the stock if you screen by five star analysts some are telling that it's a sale some selling it's a buy there's a guy who gives it 36 37 upside that's somebody gives it 28 downside so you can pick and choose whatever consensus you want to actually get on board with but that doesn't matter the aggregate result is that 15 analysts are seeing in aggregate at 24 upside for the stock around 50 now if you actually take a look at the stock it's a copper producer it's everything opposite of the excitement of the growth and the tech plays but i believe it's a huge opportunity this is a 61 billion dollar company the short interest is very low under two percent it's a dividend company and they're in a very hot category as i'm about to show in a second over the past six months the stock did about three point four percent over the past month it's actually down 18.6 and i believe that this cliff coming down from 50 all the way down to 40 is a huge opportunity i'm going to show in a second why now before we go into the numbers the financials the free cash flow and all that stuff i want to show you some assumptions which are really critical for why i'm going balls deep on this company and this is the reason why i'm so excited about this company i wanted to highlight some key points for you and i did it in a simple word format so it's easy to digest look at the screen electric vehicles they need copper we know that right batteries motors wiring we also know that charging infrastructure not only supercharger networks but basically even home chargers electrical grids they need copper as well so for example internal combustion engines require 23 kilograms or 50 pounds per car of copper as standard so even regular cars they need copper 23 kilograms or 50 pounds per car now for evs that's 80 kilograms or 175 pounds per car four times more now tesla on its own is gonna make three million evs within the next two years now by 2030 based on the most conservative estimates the most conservative estimates we have 25 million evs globally riding around now 25 million times 80 kilograms per vehicle that's 2.2 million tons of copper that's 10 of the current global annual supply and mind you the global annual supply of copper doesn't really grow it is what it is and if you listen to some professionals from the copper industry they'll tell you that 25 million per year that's it they can't get out more than that it's very very difficult now look ev charges also you have to consider the fact that they also need copper one kilogram copper per charger including home chargers and if you don't have fast charges eight kilograms that's not even included in the 2.2 million tons so i think it's safe to assume based on these numbers alone just on the eevee industry not talking about commodities not talking about inflation not talking about increased demand reopening none of this stuff just based on the eevee industry copper is going to be a hot commodity in the next few years however however this company specifically is somehow still undervalued despite quite phenomenal numbers i'm going to show right now on the screen and i want you to see the margins beyond the a plus here as what they are and this is just based on current pricing of copper and as prices will by definition go up it's inevitable these margins are going to grow wider and wider that's just how it is and i want you to look at the valuation of this company because the valuation is really interesting price to sales 2.4 forward price to sales 2.15 so these are low low multiples this is pretty much as low as you can get now a company of this sort which will give you also a dividend as you can see right here a dividend company 61 billion dollar market cap nobody's shorting it look at the financials here because this is really where it gets interesting so as you can see the revenues fluctuate you know it's a copper company the price of copper basically you know they live and die by the price of copper so some years you'll see 18 some years you see 21 20 then 14.6 then 14.8 then 16. so the price fluctuations are really important for this company so if you're investing in this company you're investing based on the assumption that prices of copper are going to go up because supply will remain the same demand will go up simple 101 economics which i believe to be true now you're already starting to see this happening look 14.2 in 2020 then 22.8 in 2021 24.6 trailing 12 months now this 14 might be coveted induced but they had 14 billion years before but whatever you want to say about covet and fluctuations and reopening right now the trailing 12 months it's the best year they had in the past 10 years 24.6 no year comes even close to that now look the more interesting part here is the efficiency because they're price dominated look at this cost of revenues really doesn't change so this year where they made 14.2 billion cost of revenues was 10.1 then they went to 24.6 cost of revenues went up by what 25 that's it the same thing goes for sg a sg a doesn't change from the year where they had 14.4 billion to the year when they have 24.6 billion revenues sgna actually went down so as you can see it's all about the price action the company will make the same amount of expenses but if the price of copper gets pushed up they'll make a lot of money without any increase in expenses which is the cool part and i want you to see their ebitda right here so they went from 2.2 3.8 10.5 11.8 and same for dividend per share as you can see right here the dividend per share went from 20 cents all the way to 38 cents and in the last 12 months it went to 45 cents so as the company is growing and the margins are growing because of increased demand and increased prices of copper you participate not only in the share price actually a nice little dividend which is always nice to have especially in recessionary times and looking at their cash flow i want you to look at what i just highlighted 5 billion dollars of net income per year this is insane trading at 60 billion market cap so 60 billion valuation for a company that gives you 5 billion net income it's a really low valuation now looking at the cash flow operations look 8.3 billion per year this is insane now look at this stuff right here i want you to look at net change in cash 3.7 billion so this is cash in the bank company is just generating cash at the wazoo no need to get capital no need to be sensitive to higher interest rates because they're printing money essentially and looking at their balance sheet you can see just the strength they're sitting on the pile of cash 8.3 billion dollars in cash total assets are 48.8 billion let's see if they have any goodwill no goodwill so straight up 48 let's just say 49 billion in assets total liabilities are 24.8 so almost not almost actually 2x uh assets versus liabilities so a strong balance sheet with a lot of cash do they have debt here let's see if they have total debt is 9.6 billion so straight up cash for debt they're almost at complete balance so they can repay the debt right now if they wanted to i mean i guess they'll have to as the interest rates will go up but this is one of the healthiest companies we've seen which is that copper is going to be in high demand because of the ev industry and the amount of cars the amount of infrastructure it's going to require also on the infrastructure side not just the superchargers also the home infrastructure also the electrical grid if everybody now has an ev or every third person has an ev the electrical grids inside the cities will have to adjust it's not going to be enough to sustain that without making massive improvements and investments in local infrastructure that's going to require a lot of copper as you just saw electric vehicles need four times more copper than internal combustion vehicle i mean it just seems to me in a highly inflationary environment where there's massive demand for commodities and precious metals and we have a booming ev industry to assume that the price isn't going to go up it's a very interesting bet which i'm not going to take i'm going to take the opposite out of the bed especially for a company that dropped 20 of the past five days from 50 to 40 a company that seems to be right on track to be an immune company towards all the insanity that's in the market now so instead of selling off my stuff and going crying in the corner having a pity party i'm gonna be changing my strategy and adding plays that traditionally i don't have in my portfolio to protect myself and play a little bit more of a defense through copper prices in fact i think this might be the best way to get exposure to the electric vehicle industry without paying insane valuations like if you want to invest in electric vehicles and you're afraid to invest in tesla for example because of its insane valuations i don't know why would you i mean tesla is a great investment but this company will allow exposure to ev industry at what price to sales of 2.4 i mean for me it's a no-brainer but again you got to do a research talk to professional make sure you cross your t's and dot your eyes or whatever make sure you know what you want to do before you actually invest don't just do it based on the youtube video,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,1rZx7pPSuVg,2022-04-19T14:42:12Z,How Elon Musk Checkmated The Entire Twitter Board,Twitter,I think what's going on right now with Elon Musk and Twitter is very similar it's easy for me to see that Elon Musk has already won the battle it's done it's finished it's just not really evident yet for the Twitter board the mainstream media and most of the people who are covering the story and in this video I'll show you how Elon Musk has already completely clean house it's just a matter of time for the place to actually play themselves out simple as that stay with me okay so let's go over the timeline of what happened first of all 9.1 percent were acquired by Elon Musk and eventually eventually he reported it basically sending the stock price up towards the 45 dollar area now that being said the following offer from the Twitter board was very interesting because once he got to 9.1 percent almost immediately the board offered him a c essentially they said hey Elon Musk come here you're the biggest shorter that we have come on the board be one of us only thing is you know don't screw with our Honey Jar you know we're really having a good time here we're getting paid there's not really a lot of work here to be done I mean you know just stay on board we'll give you a seat but you know don't [...] with our livelihood okay so the reason is that you know these guys are professional board members they don't really get paid to get the company to profitability to actual monetization to any sort of alpha for the shareholders and as evidence you can look at what the stock did for the past eight years eight percent basically Elon looked at this and he said well let me think about it he thought about it and he came back and said well I thought about it no I don't accept your offer thank you so much sayonara now there are a lot of speculation why he did this and it didn't help that the CEO of Twitter came out and explained what happened by not providing a reason essentially just giving us a chronological kind of explanation of when things happen without any explanation of why things happen of course for that we had to wait another day or two when Elon actually made an offer to the board to buy the whole thing at 54.20 and within that offer it was very evident why he didn't join the board essentially he said literally to their faces hey your guys are a bunch of clowns you guys are a bunch of bozos I can't get this thing overhauled like it needs to be with all of you on the management and the directorship team you're just not good enough you all gotta go and it's clear to me that you're not gonna go out of your own free will so I'm gonna have to buy the whole thing and I'm offering you nice really generous price to just go home and that was the opening fire to this whole story of course what happened next is that the Twitter board actually leaked by sending a few shareholders and talking to a few of the mainstream media basically leaked out that they're not gonna accept the offer it was very quickly made clear through Dimension media that the board thinks that the offer is no bueno they're not going to accept the offer now that's kind of a recap of what happened and that's where things stopped until the board actually came out and let everybody know hey we're not only not accepting the offer we're gonna adopt the poison pill the poison pill I'm going to talk about in a second but essentially they're going defensive they're actually saying we don't want to sell to you okay so that was kind of the chronological order of how things played out now let's talk about what's going on behind the scenes what's actually going on as far as what the chess match is looking and how Elon completely outplayed them it's just they don't see it yet it's like when you're playing against Gary Kasparov right you can't see it yet but Gary knows you lost probably like 17 plays ahead of you so check this out so first of all you have to understand what are the interests what are the opposing interests on the one hand Elon Musk wants to own the company and he wants to own the company for two reasons one reason is basically that he wants to restore freedom of speech to Twitter which is kind of unanimously recognized as a very heavily moderated place as far as freedom of speech goes now that's either here or there whether you agree with it whether you don't agree with it whether you like the opinion means that they're promoting or not the fact of the matter is that you know freedom of speech was designed to kind of protect things that make us cringe that make us feel uncomfortable of course not wild things not violence not racism none of this horrible things that we will not tolerate as a society but anything that kind kind of makes us feel uncomfortable you know the gray area the cringy stuff this is what the freedom of speech concept is supposed to defend not things that we agree on think about it so basically that's goal number one for Elon a goal number two you have to understand that Elon is taking on all of these World transforming projects but at the end of the day people forget that he's actually pretty good at making money I mean the dude took Tesla an electric vehicle company imagine that 10 years ago laughable and he took it from 5 billion a year to 50 billion a year in fact more than 50 billion a year in Revenue in just five years Elon Musk understands that if you create something transformative something disruptive that improves significantly the way we live it's going to be worth a lot of money look at Tesla I mean it's not a project it's not a pro bono thing it's not volunteering he wants to make money and he knows long term it's good business to give people freedoms and give people quality of life things that Twitter are not just giving yet and if you want to ban my account Twitter go right ahead I won't be the first probably won't be the last now look here's the thing on the other hand you have the board of directors people who collectively without Jack Dorsey who's actually leaving in about a month hold 0.01 of the company so they're essentially not shareholders they're board of directors who gets paid to basically do nothing if you look at their performance I mean that wasn't great and yet they're all still there a bunch of mbas and phds and Fufu boys who do jack [...] and get paid comfy job good money wide then I want to go home now in a company like Twitter with eighty percent institutional ownership companies like Vanguard BlackRock Pension funds mutual funds I mean none of them are active they're all passive so the board has a lot of strength a lot of power a lot of longevity so if you get on the board of Twitter in a company that's 80 cents on the dollar basically Pension funds and the mutual funds you get to keep the job for decades my guy and that's exactly what they want so they don't give a [...] about the company they just want to keep their salary so they're fighting Elon and now we're getting to the interesting part what's actually going on how Elon won this chess game because his moves are pure Brilliance so first of all he bought nine percent of the company just to get below the threshold of the 10 you would think as a reasonable person that holding 15 of a major public company is going to be pretty much enough to be the heavy hitter in the house to basically control the company in fact for most companies anywhere from 15 to 25 percent is literally defined as control Twitter is a very different animal this is a company where you literally need 51 to control it because the board is just too strong and as I said Jack Dorsey just said they're dysfunctional it's not me saying Jake Dorsey said it the former CEO the founder of Twitter was on Twitter just saying that the board was continuously dysfunctional and the reason the company is looking the way it's looking not me Jack Dorsey said it right now you have the situation where Elon got to 9.1 percent they say Hey you have to cap at 15 and he realizes hey if I cap myself at 15 if I'm not allowed to buy more than 15 if I take this board seat that means this party goes on and we don't get to change anything with Twitter so he realizes hey I gotta get to 51 but how if I just start buying up shares in the free market I'm gonna Spike the price this thing is going to spiral out of control there is no way I can buy enough stock he basically says hey I'll buy the company off you dear board of directors at 54.20 and I'll take it private he makes an official offer at 54.20 mine the 420 and basically he knows that this offer is not going to get accepted because he knows this board of directors has absolutely zero to do with the actual best interest of the shareholders now he knew that the offer is going to get rejected obviously but what also he knew is that once he made that offer at 54.20 he created a cap nobody will buy the share at anything beyond 54.20 because if Elon Musk is about to take it private at 5420 there's absolutely zero incentive to buy even is sent higher than that in fact you probably want to buy Max at 50 to live a little bit of a wiggle room for any sort of risk so basically he did that as a measure to actually assure that he can buy cheap stocks on the free market while they go back and forth about this offer which both sides here know that are not going to happen the board knows because they know they're [...] and Elon knows because he knows they're [...] so basically he knows that this is just a game and in the meanwhile while he was going out and saying hey 54 20 54 20 this is the cap the board actually sent out a few big major shareholders like a five percent shareholder and basically said hey this offer is too low this is a 70 company blah blah blah blah blah and basically they started creating a narrative war on Thursday trying to see which one of these narratives will come out on top if elon's narrative comes out on top the price caps at 54 probably at 50 if they win and they convince people that Elon will have to bid much much higher for the deal to go through then the price goes to 55 60 65. and on Thursday you saw a clear knockout the day closed at 46 dollars and then we went to Good Friday so there was no trading so basically the board lost so now the board basically said okay we lost the narrative battle nobody believes us this is a civil company the definitely not with us as managers because I mean for goodness sakes they literally hired Goldman Sachs to prove that what they're doing here is right when Goldman Sachs research which is actually separated I have no doubt about that but Goldman Sachs research just said that it's a cell at thirty dollars so even though it's legitimate when you separate you know the buy side from the sell side I get it but the same entity Goldman Sachs says it's a solid Theory and then you hire them you hire them out of all the options you had in the market you hired them to argue that 5420 is too cheap that means that you're either negligent or you complete idiot or on purpose you're trying to lose this case none of these options are good as far as the qualitative Judgment of this board of making this decision and by the way they actually added JPMorgan to the mix after they find out about the little oopsie not that it changes things because the mistake already has been in the open and you know it's just another proof of the negligence of the current board and this functionality right now we have this weird situation when Thursday kind of runs out and basically the board is like okay so we're losing what can we do next and then they basically come out and say okay so we're gonna enact the poison pill and this is how it's going to work in reality assume that there's only 100 shares for this company 100 shares Elon owns 10 rest of the shareholders they own 90. and now we have the poison pill in place so Elon goes out in the free market and buys 10 more shares now Elon owns 20 shares rest of the shareholders they now own only 80 shares so they own 80 he owns 20 now at this point we have the poison pill triggered because he went about 15 so in this case actually leads to more dilution the board basically says hey dear shareholders why don't you buy more shares of the company at a massive discount I'll give you 40 shares of the company at half the price deal of course I mean it's a no-brainer they all buy the shares or at least some of them buy the shares and at this point all of a sudden we have a brand new situation Elon still holds on to his 20 shares but they're no longer worth 20 of the company because now we have 40 more shares in the mix and now his 20 Shares are only 14 of the company and the rest of them there's 86 percent of the company so by doing that essentially what we've created with the looted Elon Musk so now he has to buy even more shares and get even more money in the play just to get back to 20 at which point they can do it again and they can do it again and they can do it again essentially costing him in obscene amount of money to get to 51 percent now this sort of thing would be extremely effective against somebody who's highly leveraged essentially who has a loan from the bank to get the [...] done and he absolutely is sensitive to the price if you don't have your own money or enough of it and you're basically relying on loans if they do this [...] to you you're done I mean there's just not enough money it literally doubles the price if you actually make the calculation however if you're going up against a guy who is the richest man on earth who can easily easily borrow as much money as he needs against Tesla stock and is highly determined to buy this company do you really think that this is going to stop him especially giving the next number I'm about to show you because the next number is going to blow your mind check this out Elon offered them 43 billion dollars for 100 of the company 43 billion for a hundred percent of the company if now in this new scheme his total cost per share is going to be about 90.95 with the poison pill how much can he buy with about 95 per share with the same amount of allocation of cash 43 billion roughly about 50 which is exactly what he needs to kick all of these guys out take control of the company and basically do whatever he wants he doesn't need the 100 them going the poison pillar out changes nothing because in a sense he was counting on spending 43 billion anyways it was just a head fake it was a faint to get them to do this so he can buy up the whole thing at about 95 bucks and be done with it but we're jumping the gun here I'm gonna go over every single option that may or may not happen the next few days but before that let me explain what happened next because what happens next is really important so the board will get sued make no mistakes about it if this deal falls through and it doesn't happen the board will be sued by the shareholders because they cost them tens of billions of dollars instead of selling their shares at 54.20 the shares will end up at a much much lower valuation if this deal falls through because essentially they're enacting the poison pill which deludes the company and drives the price down and when Elon Musk basically says okay no deal I'm basically selling out my 10 and leaving if that happens the share price is going to go way way down and basically you're going to have the situation where a lot of these shareholders are going to go in front of a judge and sue and say hey these directors took care of their own instead of me instead of enacting their fiduciary duty they were thinking about not getting fired and they cost me the difference from fifty four dollars to whatever the share price is going to be at that time and they're going to be right however the directors will either be protected by directors and offices insurance and if that thing doesn't really apply they all have an indemnification Clause from the company which will have to pay the damages on their behalf so essentially they know they're going to lose this court case they know that this Goldman Sachs [...] is not going to fly but they also know that the company is going to pay up and actually they won't have to pay a single time they're only trying to prolong the process to collect more salaries and more chicks and it's sad because we have a guy who's willing to put 20 percent of his net worth the richest guy on Earth willing to put one-fifth of everything he has on the planet to take this company and make it better on the other hand we have a bunch of mbas and phds and Fufu boys who hold 0.01 of the company basically not shareholders who are holding this company hostage just to get paid and nobody can do a damn thing about it and there isn't enough activist shareholders because they're all mutual funds and pensions and stuff like that to actually push the board and say hey this isn't cool it's really really sad and knowing Elon in the next few days Twitter is going to be very interesting he might offer to paint those who knows he might offer to start his own platform just as a joke but knowing the situation it's much much easier to buy Twitter even in this crazy situation than starting your own platform it's just too complicated there's a good one just laying around doing absolutely nothing just buy that one even if you have to overpay now there are other Alternatives here for example Elon Musk can improve his bid basically offer them more than 54.20 cents maybe over 60 maybe 65 at that point if that happens it puts more pressure on the board to actually agree to this deal because it actually makes it less of a case for them to say hey this offer wasn't good enough of course the board will claim that this isn't in the best interest of the company regardless of the price he offers because of his entanglements with the SEC in the past they're basically going to say that Elon is a Loose Cannon and then he's in hot whatever the SEC they don't want him owning the company regardless of the price I mean that's an option the other option that he might just do with direct tender he actually insinuated something about that on Twitter it seems but that's also kind of nowhere here and there before we know exactly what's going to end with this offer we also may see other bidders come in but that's again kind of shaky because the companies that would love to own Twitter like Google or Amazon or companies like Facebook who would love to own it at any price they won't be allowed to do it from a regulatory perspective it's just not going to work from an Anti-Trust perspective they're not going to get that opportunity they know it they won't even bid the ones that can bid I mean do you really want to go into a bidding war against the richest men on Earth who has no Financial motivation and he's adamant about owning this company and the company is basically hot Dudu I mean they can't make any money and they're complete in shambles I mean seems very unlikely so it seems to me that the most likely scenario is that Elon is playing for the chess here and he already won he basically just made a calculation and he basically said okay so I'm gonna spend 43 44 45 on this now I'm gonna tell them I want to buy 100 at 45 they're going to do a poison pill and I'm going to have to end up buying things again and again and again chasing myself until I get to 51 when I can kick them out and think about it the price 54 dollars buys you 100 the company according to his original offer now they're doing the poison pill and the base point is 5420 now that means it's probably going to have to pay anywhere from 90 to 95 dollars per share once it gets to 51 percent so if 43 billion buys you 100 the company at 54 how much does 43 billion and change buys if the price is 95 per share roughly exactly what he needs to control this company which is 51 which is exactly the number he's chasing not a hundred that's why he already won he has the ability the money the determination and the motivation to get it done the board is just gonna [...] up the company they're going to screw over to shareholders they're not going to pay a dime for this because the company will pay out the damages and eventually it won't change anything you don't just gonna buy it for a little bit more money and they're all going to be left without a job because unfortunately in this case the poison pill does nothing but poison the current existing shareholders of the company that's the sad truth and the poison is actually not that important to the board because they don't own any shares of the company and I think the shareholders of Twitter at least the ones that do care need to know about this who's on their side who's not on their side because in this case it seems like the board isn't really on the side of the shareholders not that it's going to matter this is exactly how I think this thing plays out but hey I've been wrong before maybe I'm wrong again let me know in the comments if you have a different Theory let me know if you agree with me disagree with me.,1.0,-0.8

even in this crazy situation than starting your own platform it's just too complicated there's a good one just laying around doing absolutely nothing just buy that one even if you have to overpay now there are other Alternatives here for example Elon Musk can improve his bid basically offer them more than 54.20 cents maybe over 60 maybe 65 at that point if that happens it puts more pressure on the board to actually agree to this deal because it actually makes it less of a case for them to say hey this offer wasn't good enough of course the board will claim that this isn't in the best interest of the company regardless of the price he offers because of his entanglements with the SEC in the past they're basically going to say that Elon is a Loose Cannon and then he's in hot whatever the SEC they don't want him owning the company regardless of the price I mean that's an option the other option that he might just do with direct tender he actually insinuated something about that on Twitter it seems but that's also kind of nowhere here and there before we know exactly what's going to end with this offer we also may see other bidders come in but that's again kind of shaky because the companies that would love to own Twitter like Google or Amazon or companies like Facebook who would love to own it at any price they won't be allowed to do it from a regulatory perspective it's just not going to work from an Anti-Trust perspective they're not going to get that opportunity they know it they won't even bid the ones that can bid I mean do you really want to go into a bidding war against the richest men on Earth who has no Financial motivation and he's adamant about owning this company and the company is basically hot Dudu I mean they can't make any money and they're complete in shambles I mean seems very unlikely so it seems to me that the most likely scenario is that Elon is playing for the chess here and he already won he basically just made a calculation and he basically said okay so I'm gonna spend 43 44 45 on this now I'm gonna tell them I want to buy 100 at 45 they're going to do a poison pill and I'm going to have to end up buying things again and again and again chasing myself until I get to 51 when I can kick them out and think about it the price 54 dollars buys you 100 the company according to his original offer now they're doing the poison pill and the base point is 5420 now that means it's probably going to have to pay anywhere from 90 to 95 dollars per share once it gets to 51 percent so if 43 billion buys you 100 the company at 54 how much does 43 billion and change buys if the price is 95 per share roughly exactly what he needs to control this company which is 51 which is exactly the number he's chasing not a hundred that's why he already won he has the ability the money the determination and the motivation to get it done the board is just gonna [...] up the company they're going to screw over to shareholders they're not going to pay a dime for this because the company will pay out the damages and eventually it won't change anything you don't just gonna buy it for a little bit more money and they're all going to be left without a job because unfortunately in this case the poison pill does nothing but poison the current existing shareholders of the company that's the sad truth and the poison is actually not that important to the board because they don't own any shares of the company and I think the shareholders of Twitter at least the ones that do care need to know about this who's on their side who's not on their side because in this case it seems like the board isn't really on the side of the shareholders not that it's going to matter this is exactly how I think this thing plays out but hey I've been wrong before maybe I'm wrong again let me know in the comments if you have a different Theory let me know if you agree with me disagree with me.,0.9,0.9

Tom Nash,6GHe0zjb5jY,2022-04-14T11:05:50Z,Elon Musk Launches $43 Billion Hostile Takeover of Twitter,Twitter,"As we mentioned, as we predicted, as we all said in money talks and as I said in my own personal videos, when Elon basically refused to get on the board of Twitter and my estimation was that the reason was that he doesn't think that the existing management is good enough to take Twitter forward. Elon Musk launches 43 billion hostile takeover of Twitter, makes an offer to buy. I believe the purchase price that he offered was 54.20, which is about 10 dollars per share higher than the closing price of Twitter yesterday. In pre-market right now, we'll see a spike, massive spike, eleven percent plus five dollars already on pre-market. So the stock is already jumping up so basically he's giving it a ten dollar premium. If you've been holding Twitter shares, that's good for you. Elon has made a best and final offer to buy Twitter Inc. saying the company has extraordinary potential and he will unlock it. The social medias company shares sort 18 musk announced the offer in the filing. Compared with Twitter's market valuation of 37 billion dollars. Somebody says I might actually start using Twitter again. It's not that easy to create a competitor for Twitter. What will happen to current Twitter CEO from India? Based on his tweet about the way he described Elon not taking a seat on the board saying it's for the best, he's hoping that Elon takes over the company. This is from seeking alpha where Elon Musk first to buy Twitter for fifty four twenty a share. On April 13th 2022, the reporting president delivered a letter to the issuer which means to Twitter, which contained a non-binding proposal to acquire the outstanding common stock of the issuer not owned by Elon Musk for all cash consideration at 54.20 per share. This represents a 54% premium of the closing price of common stock on January 28th and a 38% premium over the closing price of the common stock on April 1st. It's just a proposal, it's an offer, so there's no guarantees that it will be accepted although at this premium it seems very likely. If the proposed transaction is completed, the common stock would become eligible for termination of its registration and would be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. This is a letter from Elon to Twitter to the chairman of the board. I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be a platform for free speech around the globe. However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve the societal imperative in its current form to what it needs to be transformed as a private company. As a result I'm offering to buy a hundred percent of Twitter for fifty four dollars and twenty cents per share in cash. My offer is my best and final offer so basically is it take it or leave it. He's saying Twitter is an extraordinary trigger, Twitter has an extraordinary potential, I will unlock it, fire. The final line Twitter has extraordinary potential, I will unlock it, it's fire. Yesterday on Money Talks we one of our topics was uh that Kathy Wood explained why she sold Twitter, they completely liquidated Twitter like don't you find this amusing it she did it again. Literally the worst moment to sell. Kathy literally saw Twitter just before the spike, unbelievable. Jeremy van der Stye is saying 75% is needed to be able to delist. I think with such a huge premium, 54 dollars for the share, he might get it. I think it's a very attractive offer with a premium like that it would be more likely than not that he'll get the threshold that he needs to get everybody to sell. Twitter is jumping in pre-market 51. If you're a shareholder current shareholder of Twitter and if this offer goes through that means you're gonna get fifty four dollars and twenty cents for each share you hold which means a lot of money and a big profit for most of the people who bought it in the 30s. Twitter is meant to be public in this in a sense yes but when it was public we had issues with the way they handled freedom of speech so in the sense he's right. He can take it private, own 100% of it and then float 10 or 20, he can make it private and public again if he really wants to. It shows you how much he cares about Twitter, that whatever you like him, you dislike him, you think Twitter is great, Twitter is horrible, but you got a guy who's like a super wealthy guy, the richest man on earth, willing to invest one third or one fourth of what at one fifth it doesn't really matter of his entire net worth into this company. I want that if I'm a fan of Twitter, I want a guy who cares about the platform that much. I agree Twitter does have significantly more potential than can be realized with this ownership structure.",1.0,0.6
Tom Nash,6GHe0zjb5jY,2022-04-14T11:05:50Z,Elon Musk Launches $43 Billion Hostile Takeover of Twitter,Tesla,The billionaire who also controls Tesla first disclose the stake of whatnot. I don't think he's gonna sell any Tesla stock. I believe what he can do here is is take some leverage because as you know interest rates are really low so it would make a lot of sense to take some cheap capital while interest rates are still low and then just leverage to steal. He's obviously good for it so he'll get the loan no problem. I don't think he's going to spend his own money on that like straight up. I don't like it it distracts the mind space from Tesla.

Tom Nash,u2F9BVd8K0Y,2022-04-11T13:40:59Z,What just happened?!,Twitter,hey this is tom and for lack of a better word what just happened so the ceo of twitter posted last night and elon will not be joining the board of directors of twitter and he put out a very chronological description of the timeline of how this happened but he didn't offer an explanation or any sort of a reason why elon decided to relinquish his seat and make no mistakes about it he wasn't fired he wasn't kicked off and they did not retract their offer he decided not to join which was clearly stated in the post on twitter so why does he not want to see it on the board i mean it's a really good way to influence to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done to transform everything he basically wants to do with twitter so listen what happened with twitter i just i impersonated myself i don't know what that was anyways i'm not gonna edit anything out i can't be bothered have a long day not interested in editing today look okay so i think ellen started engaging with the members of the board of directors of twitter and the ceo and the current management because obviously we all know for a fact that negotiations were taking place so they're going back and forth back and forth talking about it trying to figure out the best formula to do it obviously their play was to keep him as close to them as possible and to prevent him that is from taking over the entire company and that was clear stated because they basically said hey we'll give you this board seat voluntarily all you got to do is sign a little piece of paper that says that you're not going to go about 15 as long as you're a board member and for three months after you leave the board which is reasonable i mean it's kind of a you know cards are on the table no problem with that and elon in principle agreed to this term obviously because he went along with this nomination to the board now what happened next i think is quite alarming because what happened next is something changed elon's mind now you may read the notice from the twitter ceo where he makes it sound as if they put up requirements out of eland which he didn't want to accept and that's why he slammed the door in them that's kind of what's insinuated in the twitter post and i hope i don't lose my twitter account over this but i might with their history who knows they might take my blue check mark away oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i'll have one now that i care about my twitter profile and if they want to shut me up it's fine he basically said these are a bunch of buffoons in bozos that are not good enough to turn this company into what i want it to be it's basically it's a no bundle no bueno no bueno no bueno all of these guys gotta go and if you look at his uh twitter back and forth with carl icahn about firing 12 floors of people i mean that seems to be the rationale he basically said well these are clowns i mean can't work with these people i mean they all got to go so it means that he understood that the current management and board directors of twitter is not good enough and i can only support that look they have the platform for a long ass time they still haven't figured out monetization it's still not really making any money the freedom of speech issues are staggering not even gonna begin so they're basically playing god as far as censorship of what the truth is and what it isn't and i find it weird anyways so twitter has been screwing up for a long ass time they haven't been innovating in anything i mean what have they done lately right so i think he thought hey i'm going to come in i'm gonna teach these guys how to turn this thing from twitter to a new tesla the tesla of freedom of speech and social media and he basically said oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me i mean these guys are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clowns can do it they all gotta go and that's why he basically said i'm not gonna be joining the board because he obviously now understands he has to go above 15 to basically kick all these guys out and i would make an educated guess or rather an educated bit that this time next year the entire management of twitter and their board of directors are going to be working on their linkedin profiles looking for a new job if not sooner now here's the thing i think twitter is going to be saved by elon and i think them pushing away elon with their whole oh background check right we want to have a background check on elon and he has to behave and he has the fiduciary duty so he can post tits on twitter and stuff like that right so i think they did a mistake it's a strategic mistake because they had an opportunity to work with inland to make twitter better and now they lost it the training is out of the station as far as what elon is going to do look in 2030 much like with tesla everybody will remember that elon founded twitter nobody remembers how elon got into tesla and basically became the founder I think it's the rebirth of twitter the saying that it was with tesla come in take a broken organization that's lost its way and making it into the world's best software company that still a lot of people think of as a car company he's going to do the same thing with twitter obviously he needs new blood for that and for a lot of people he's going to be viewed as the founder of new twitter and that's fine now my message to people who think that this is going to be a platform that is going to allow extremist views and vile discussion i mean look the whole idea of freedom of speech as long as it's not like violence and like racism right is being able to tolerate things that make you feel uncomfortable that's the whole idea the freedom of speech isn't designed to protect comfortable speech that's kind of an understandable thing right it's designed to protect things that make you feel uncomfortable that's the whole point and twitter over the years has become a public utility they no longer can be viewed as a private company that can do whatever they want and block and ban and censor whoever they want their public utility for a lack of any other alternatives and i think elon realizes that you know you go ballistic on this company he's about to test the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of twitter i can't wait to see what happens see you next video,1.0,0.6

Tom Nash,RHoScC1OzmU,2022-04-08T12:57:40Z,We need to talk about PLTR...,Palantir,oh palantir what is going on this company is down 45 over the past six months it somehow went up 16 over the past 30 days and now it's coming back down seven percent already in the last five days currently trading at just under 13 after we've seen 27 dollars just six months ago and even 40 dollars way back when now did i have enough am i getting off that's what she said train of the palantir hype is this enough for me did i get enough abuse to just say hey no my sport for war well the answer is obviously no and in this video i'm gonna give you the bottom line as i always do in the beginning and then i'm gonna show you my analysis and my process why i'm not only staying in the company why i'm actually in fact increasing my position every single day right now now i believe that this is the best time to buy palantir for a multitude of reasons which i will elaborate in this video but if you just need the bottom line yes i'm still bullish more than ever right now i'm allocating every single cent i have available to increase my penalty position because i believe that this is a generational opportunity okay so let's talk about why i'm so bullish on valentine but before we do as always don't click nothing don't smash nothing and mainly don't buy nothing now check this out first of all thank you for staying with me now i'm going to explain to you my rationale behind my obsession with volunteer now more than ever now look there's two things that are going on in the world right now which make palantir into a very exciting opportunity without even looking at the fundamentals of the company look number one chaos you can agree we have de-globalization we have supply chain [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we have a total mess and it's just getting worse and just getting started on the other hand inflation massive inflation we just heard that walmart is offering truck drivers entry-level salaries of 110 000 just to get people to come to work now shout out to my truck driver friends my grandpa actually used to be a track driver it's about time you guys actually get paid no doubt but here's the question if we're heading into massive inflation and massive geopolitical [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what better software to use than talenteer and i'll explain on the one hand you want a software that is compatible with high inflation environment on the other hand you want something that's basically optimal in time of chaos and uncertainty and palantir check both of these boxes quite easily number one as far as inflation proven stocks this is a company with high growth high margins high cash flow it's cash flow positive sitting on a pile of cash no debt they basically don't need to acquire capital they will not be hurt when the cost of capital goes up as interest rates actually go up in inflationary times the second prong of inflationary protection is the fact that their clients are extremely sticky they have 131 net retention go check what that means that means their clients aren't leaving that means it's going to be easier for them to roll over the cost of extra provision of services because in inflationary times things are bound to get more expensive whether you're producing goods or services and 131 percent net retention is going to be way easier for them to roll over their cost on their clients and other companies other competitors now the third prong of that is they literally don't have any competitors in time of uncertainty and chaos where would these guys go you can frankenstein your way into a some sort of a compatible service that gives you some of the things that palantir does but this frankenstein [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going to cost you triple if not quadruple it's going to be half as good and it's going to take a year to compile while you have this thing here for one-fourth of the price it works as good if not better than what you can actually compile and you can get it within three weeks simple and it will make sense of this chaos supply chain insanity and will actually allow you to get a massive edge over your competition both for governments and for companies so in a time of chaos and high inflation a company with no debt a lot of cash free cash flow up to a zoo and sticky clients rich sticky clients which would absorb most of the price increases is exactly where you want to be now palantir is no slouch unlike what you hear in mainstream media this company is legit they'll give you 41 revenue growth year over year every single year now the company is guiding for 30 percent up until 2025 but every year they hit the 40 mark right now they're at 1.5 billion dollars of annual revenue go and check how much revenue they had just two years ago you're going to be shocked now look even if they maintain the 30 conservative estimation by the company they're going to hit 6 billion in 2025 in annual revenues do you understand what we're talking about here a company that's literally growing at 40 percent while giving me 80 gross margin which is a sas kind of golden standard and 30 operational margin and if you don't believe me go look at the financials it is 30 operational margin 30 find me a company that gives me 40 annual growth and a 30 margin operational margin and 424 million in free cash flow over 1.5 billion in revenues without any finance just from operations you're going to be very very lucky to find anything that comes near that at these price levels at these multiples and look you're going to hear a lot of excuses about stock based comp which is actually coming down go check what i'm saying here you're going to hear a lot of excuses about the company not being scalable and how the customer count is so low look it grows 71 customer account year of year last year i mean 70 growth in the amount of customers you're serving in one year i mean what else do you guys want now look i'm not here advocating for volunteer i'm just sharing my opinion i'm excited about it and i'm excited to talk about it you may hate it you may dislike it that's fine and look whenever we have a situation right now where the company is performing better and better every single quarter and yet the price drops more and more every single quarter we have this inverse basically relationship the company is getting better the price is getting lower now if you're seeing a good business getting better every year and getting cheaper every year what are you going to do about it i know what i'm going to do about it i'm going to buy as much of it as i can and you know what let's hear your opinion about it what you guys think about planeteer you love it you hate it you don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] comment below let me know if you like it if you hate it if you hate me all hey comments are welcome no worries about it comment below let me know what you think about talenteer what do you think i'm full of it or are you on board

Tom Nash,aKv7C9sda8s,2022-04-04T11:25:03Z,Why Elon Musk Bought 9.2% of Twitter,Twitter,elon is buying twitter just announced elon musk is buying twitter he's buying 9.2 of twitter the stock is up 25 congratulations to justin for calling it on march 25th. elon posted the poll asking y'all do you think that twitter is enforcing freedom of speech in an adequate manner and he said this poll is gonna have massive massive implications and now we're seeing exactly what he meant as my partner in crime said he's gonna buy twitter and he did so congratulations to justin and twitter shareholders. first of all let me explain i think elon has zero interest in twitter in any other case he would have never never ever even considered buying twitter of course with elon he might just buy it to close it down i would not be shocked if that's his idea of what's to do with twitter. i think he's genuinely seeing how shitty freedom of speech has become on twitter if you're not on the mainstream media narrative if you're not on the narrative of big corporations if your thing is not something that the big corporations agree with you get silenced i mean corporate lack of freedom of speech on twitter has been a big problem of course me saying that might get me banned off twitter at this point i mean who knows and i think elon is just stepping in to do his part he's a freedom of speech absolutist and for better worse i think he's going to fix twitter because twitter could be much more than people talking about will smith slapping chris rock it could be a massive research tool informational tool something along the lines like reddit but lace you know how would they put it less insole like a mainstream version of reddit that actually is accessible to everybody else and the short format so twitter can be this huge resource and i think elon is stepping in to do his part. I think elon is going to buy the whole thing he doesn't do partners and there's no need for partners i think he's going to buy the whole thing and turn it into this massive absolute freedom of speech global informational asset and he's going to make a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of money in the process because twitter is going to go through the roof as the only mainstream social media that actually will allow people to do that and have that level of freedom speech so good for elon and if you own any twitter stock good for you. today's show we're going to talk about obviously twitter tesla shanghai.,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,8KPo2msxWOQ,2022-04-03T21:49:09Z,5 Reasons You Shouldn’t Panic About The “Yield Curve Inversion”,Fed,the fed has been buying a lot of the 10-year and the 30-year bonds a lot and what happens when the fed buys a lot of bonds in the market a lot of 10-year and 30-year they push the price up they push the price up they push the yield down so a lot of experts are saying that the 10 year and the 30 year has a very artificially low yield because of the fed's aggressive buying and that yield basically is inverting with the two-year and that's artificial and actually that argument does make a lot of sense,1.0,0.1

Tom Nash,AZ1odQeJjeQ,2022-03-28T12:55:14Z,Tesla JUST announced a new stock split!,Tesla,tesla split it's happening and now it's confirmed by tesla themselves it's happening tesla just announced they're going to ask shareholders for approval to issue more authorized stock basically to allow for a split now the board already approved it shareholders obviously still need to approve it but i see no way where this thing doesn't get approved it's essentially like asking your shareholders hey do you want more free money obviously they're going to say yes not to the stocks but it's free money but less time a split happened in august 2020 this stock doubled that was a five to one split and this time we don't know nothing we don't know how big the split is gonna be two to one three one four one five to one fifty seven thousand to one nobody knows yet the only thing we know it's happening it's been approved by the board and we're still pending shareholder approval which i assume we will get now here's the problem on mainstream media you're going to see a lot of this language talking about a dividend this is not announcing a dividend there's no dividend coming forget about it there's no dividend when they say dividend they mean a split a split by way of a dividend is when you are the shareholder and you're getting more stock as a dividend you can call it dividend in kind but basically it's just a dividend that's basically out there to carry out a split nobody's getting any money there's no money coming chill nobody buy a new car just yet unless of course it's the tesla in that case go right ahead now check this out tesla actually managed to avoid any backlash from its investors because essentially what they did today they announced the dividend but also they announced that they're shutting down the shanghai factory for a day or two or three nobody really knows until they figure out what's happening with kovit now the cynics will say well you know it's illan basically pumping up the stock it's elon doing this on purpose to you know overshadow the fact that shanghai is being paused and whatever it is now obviously that's a bunch of horse polonie i mean it's as good as saying that elon is bored because he doesn't have a girlfriend anymore and that's why he's splitting or it's a pump or it's whatever it is all the haters and the bears will always find excuses of why this is a bad idea to invest in tesla and you know every time i want to say the same thing when it was 800 when it was 900 when it was a thousand you know keep shorting the stock see how it works out for you i've said it before this was your last chance to get it at 900 bucks now i was wrong for about a month but as you can see right now long term you can't beat a good performance time is the worst enemy of mediocracy and the best friend of a good company and tesla is a good company if you've seen one,1.0,0.9

The u.s economy is pretty much on the brink of collapse without the petrol dollar... the u.s sent patriot missiles to saudi to protect them against the houthi rebels in yemen which was a sign and this was confirmed by u.s official basically the peace offering to saudis and today a u.s official confirms that iran and the u.s are halting stalling on this agreement of this nuclear weaponry or nuclear energy whatever they want to call it because the u.s is now dragging their feet and they don't want to remove the iranian revolutionary guard from the list of terrorists which is exactly what saudi have been saying to do...

Tom Nash,mLz5_LcBcGQ,2022-03-19T22:03:13Z,Will China save Russia? (It’s Complicated),Russia,welcome to another video my name is tom nash don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing just listen in this video i'll explain to you exactly what's going on with russia and ukraine beyond the propaganda from both sides and what i think is coming next because i don't think china is about to rescue russia like everybody on both sides think let's start russia's economy is in shambles and it's been going downhill at an alarming rate since 2014 which is when the us actually started sanctioning russia for annexing crimea the russian gdp per capita went down by 35 can you imagine an economy going down 35 in eight years russia's economy is a total toilet the us has a gdp per capita of 55 to 60 thousand dollars depend on the year russia is about fourteen thousand before twenty fourteen since 2014 it's single digits it's 8 700 per capita it's abysmal it's nowhere near where western modern countries should be definitely with so much resources in the ground so he had to solve this problem now annex in crimea was hugely popular in russia and gave him a lot of boost he basically said well i'm going to use my military power to cover up my incapacity as far as economics i'm going to take my military i'm going to get a seat at the table with u.s and china because they'll have to respect me and negotiate with me after i do it so i'm going to get some clout from them i'm going to get people rallying behind the flag and forget about the fact that the economy is the toilet and i'm going to do everything while causing a rift between ukraine germany and the us ukraine is going to be mad that nobody's coming to their protection like they promised germany is going to be fighting with the us because germany would not want to sanction me because i own them because i supply most of their gas and the us would want to shellack me and this triangle of hate is going to dissolve nato so we're going to get all this in three days of blitzkrieg boom boom boom the government is gonna run away because they're crumb puppets and we're gonna take over ukraine not a single shot fired where it matters basically crimea 2.0 now obviously that didn't happen the war is now in its third week the government is still standing and most importantly the people of ukraine are not welcoming him as a savior which i thought he was sure of now because of that the military effort is costing him more and more money more and more casualties is becoming less and less popular back home in russia and he's essentially alienating himself and no longer can be considered as the liberator of ukraine they freaking hate him so even if he wins which probably seems to be the case with the amount of military power and just the sheer numbers that russia has over ukraine what's next let's say he conquers ukraine which by the way would be a monumental task if the people aren't cooperating which they're not so it's a humongous country let's see him do that first but assuming he's done that let's say he stays and occupies ukraine i mean the cost of this is going to be insane his economy can't handle that let's say he wants the puppet government if he's not there to prop up the government and he leaves the moment he leaves they're going to overthrow the government if he stays it's like him occupying the country he'll need hundreds of thousands of men on the ground to keep it going money he doesn't have so there's no realistic way for him to win here also if he actually conquers ukraine that's the worst thing that can happen to him because that means there's not going to be a deal the only way out for putin here is to sign a deal with ukraine that the west will approve because that's the only way out of these sanctions if putin beats ukraine if he i think the worst thing that could happen to putin is this government will run away if putin actually takes ukraine by force the door is closed on any removal of these sanctions but if they work out a deal then the sanctions can be lifted so putin needs the solution to come from an agreement but the problem is his military has gotten exposed for the piece of trash that it is and he has no achievements on the ground to leverage to an actual peace agreement that he can actually sell back home as a reasonable one so he can't do the peace talks until he has some achievements but the military is just total doodoo so now the military is resorting to bombarding civilians which is alienating the local population even more and pushing the settlement even further so he's trapped and now even his own minister of finance is saying well half of our assets our foreign reserves are frozen we can't access that now the other half is pretty much also very heavily leaning on gold and that 130 billion that he has in gold it's not that liquid you know gold markets are just not as liquid as equities as you would think moving that much gold is going to be impossible probably he could move anywhere from 5 to 10 to 15 of his gold reserves in the next let's say two months and even that is going to crash the gold market because it's going to be dumping all this gold in the market the price is going to crash basically rendering his own gold pretty much worthless so he's stuck there's no money coming in except from gas oil and commodities which is a lot of money still because everybody still needs his gas all in commodities but it's not enough money to do anything but survive he still needs much much much more foreign currency to keep the ruble afloat the russian bank the russian central bank needs a lot of foreign currency to prop up the ruble and with access to foreign currencies blocked by the eu and the us he's basically locked out out of the only instrument he has to save the ruble from crashing which is exactly what's happening right now the ruble is crashing inflation is going through the roof the economy is falling apart russia is headed to bankruptcy so how can he get out of it well a peace agreement would be nice i don't know if that's in the cards it doesn't seem like it the other option for him is basically to have china step in and save his ass but here's why china is a complicated solution which i don't think he has well for first look if china saves his ass look at what he went through he went through all of this craziness to lose the entire cloud of the eu which is now completely disengaging from him it's basically unifying under nato sweden denmark all these countries finland are trying to join nato so nato is uniting he's getting isolated he's getting cut out from europe and mainly that's the crazy part that europe is militarizing and talking about diversifying out of russian gas in the next 10 years so you're losing clout in europe from being the guy in europe into being owned by china if china saves russia china basically owns russia they're the only option as is this but even that even that shitty option is not really on the table i'll explain why look president xi and putin are best friends forever the bromance is so strong it's as good as it's ever been but it's meaningless because all about interest china has to play this very very carefully they have to say the right things or putin is right nade are the bad guys and we support putin but you guys should all just get along you notice this they're staying neutral they're saying all the right things to be nice to put in but they're staying neutral because they don't know how the chips are going to fall and they don't want to find themselves on the wrong side of history because they don't know what putin might do so they're not supporting him fully now the other part is that you know china is a net exporter and they have a huge market in the us they have to tread very very carefully they don't want to get sanctioned by the us and basically cause a cluster freak internally for russia that's not something they're interested in now also look china beyond this whole thing is also in a really bad situation right now internally china much like the us is going to pay much more for gasoline and for oil and for gas now while the us can pretty much take it and people are not going to like it for china that means potential local instability that means potential loss of power for xi they can't afford it so china is now slowly moving away to this camp of understanding well this war is costing us a lot of money and potentially putting our own government at risk because of elevated prices of oil we have to get them to find a deal so china is not going to cut off ties with putin they'll still say you know the lip service about how nato is wrong but i think china at this point is much more interested in pushing putin and ukrainians into an arrangement that finishes this mess rather than providing weaponry to russia so that's why i think putin can't really rely on china to bail him out here,1.0,-0.8
Tom Nash,mLz5_LcBcGQ,2022-03-19T22:03:13Z,Will China save Russia? (It’s Complicated),Ukraine,welcome to another video my name is tom nash don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing just listen in this video i'll explain to you exactly what's going on with russia and ukraine beyond the propaganda from both sides and what i think is coming next because i don't think china is about to rescue russia like everybody on both sides think let's start russia's economy is in shambles and it's been going downhill at an alarming rate since 2014 which is when the us actually started sanctioning russia for annexing crimea the russian gdp per capita went down by 35 can you imagine an economy going down 35 in eight years russia's economy is a total toilet the us has a gdp per capita of 55 to 60 thousand dollars depend on the year russia is about fourteen thousand before twenty fourteen since 2014 it's single digits it's 8 700 per capita it's abysmal it's nowhere near where western modern countries should be definitely with so much resources in the ground so he had to solve this problem now annex in crimea was hugely popular in russia and gave him a lot of boost he basically said well i'm going to use my military power to cover up my incapacity as far as economics i'm going to take my military i'm going to get a seat at the table with u.s and china because they'll have to respect me and negotiate with me after i do it so i'm going to get some clout from them i'm going to get people rallying behind the flag and forget about the fact that the economy is the toilet and i'm going to do everything while causing a rift between ukraine germany and the us ukraine is going to be mad that nobody's coming to their protection like they promised germany is going to be fighting with the us because germany would not want to sanction me because i own them because i supply most of their gas and the us would want to shellack me and this triangle of hate is going to dissolve nato so we're going to get all this in three days of blitzkrieg boom boom boom the government is gonna run away because they're crumb puppets and we're gonna take over ukraine not a single shot fired where it matters basically crimea 2.0 now obviously that didn't happen the war is now in its third week the government is still standing and most importantly the people of ukraine are not welcoming him as a savior which i thought he was sure of now because of that the military effort is costing him more and more money more and more casualties is becoming less and less popular back home in russia and he's essentially alienating himself and no longer can be considered as the liberator of ukraine they freaking hate him so even if he wins which probably seems to be the case with the amount of military power and just the sheer numbers that russia has over ukraine what's next let's say he conquers ukraine which by the way would be a monumental task if the people aren't cooperating which they're not so it's a humongous country let's see him do that first but assuming he's done that let's say he stays and occupies ukraine i mean the cost of this is going to be insane his economy can't handle that let's say he wants the puppet government if he's not there to prop up the government and he leaves the moment he leaves they're going to overthrow the government if he stays it's like him occupying the country he'll need hundreds of thousands of men on the ground to keep it going money he doesn't have so there's no realistic way for him to win here also if he actually conquers ukraine that's the worst thing that can happen to him because that means there's not going to be a deal the only way out for putin here is to sign a deal with ukraine that the west will approve because that's the only way out of these sanctions if putin beats ukraine if he i think the worst thing that could happen to putin is this government will run away if putin actually takes ukraine by force the door is closed on any removal of these sanctions but if they work out a deal then the sanctions can be lifted so putin needs the solution to come from an agreement but the problem is his military has gotten exposed for the piece of trash that it is and he has no achievements on the ground to leverage to an actual peace agreement that he can actually sell back home as a reasonable one so he can't do the peace talks until he has some achievements but the military is just total doodoo so now the military is resorting to bombarding civilians which is alienating the local population even more and pushing the settlement even further so he's trapped and now even his own minister of finance is saying well half of our assets our foreign reserves are frozen we can't access that now the other half is pretty much also very heavily leaning on gold and that 130 billion that he has in gold it's not that liquid you know gold markets are just not as liquid as equities as you would think moving that much gold is going to be impossible probably he could move anywhere from 5 to 10 to 15 of his gold reserves in the next let's say two months and even that is going to crash the gold market because it's going to be dumping all this gold in the market the price is going to crash basically rendering his own gold pretty much worthless so he's stuck there's no money coming in except from gas oil and commodities which is a lot of money still because everybody still needs his gas all in commodities but it's not enough money to do anything but survive he still needs much much much more foreign currency to keep the ruble afloat the russian bank the russian central bank needs a lot of foreign currency to prop up the ruble and with access to foreign currencies blocked by the eu and the us he's basically locked out out of the only instrument he has to save the ruble from crashing which is exactly what's happening right now the ruble is crashing inflation is going through the roof the economy is falling apart russia is headed to bankruptcy so how can he get out of it well a peace agreement would be nice i don't know if that's in the cards it doesn't seem like it the other option for him is basically to have china step in and save his ass but here's why china is a complicated solution which i don't think he has well for first look if china saves his ass look at what he went through he went through all of this craziness to lose the entire cloud of the eu which is now completely disengaging from him it's basically unifying under nato sweden denmark all these countries finland are trying to join nato so nato is uniting he's getting isolated he's getting cut out from europe and mainly that's the crazy part that europe is militarizing and talking about diversifying out of russian gas in the next 10 years so you're losing clout in europe from being the guy in europe into being owned by china if china saves russia china basically owns russia they're the only option as is this but even that even that shitty option is not really on the table i'll explain why look president xi and putin are best friends forever the bromance is so strong it's as good as it's ever been but it's meaningless because all about interest china has to play this very very carefully they have to say the right things or putin is right nade are the bad guys and we support putin but you guys should all just get along you notice

this they're staying neutral they're saying all the right things to be nice to put in but they're staying neutral because they don't know how the chips are going to fall and they don't want to find themselves on the wrong side of history because they don't know what putin might do so they're not supporting him fully now the other part is that you know china is a net exporter and they have a huge market in the us they have to tread very very carefully they don't want to get sanctioned by the us and basically cause a cluster freak internally for russia that's not something they're interested in now also look china beyond this whole thing is also in a really bad situation right now internally china much like the us is going to pay much more for gasoline and for oil and for gas now while the us can pretty much take it and people are not going to like it for china that means potential local instability that means potential loss of power for xi they can't afford it so china is now slowly moving away to this camp of understanding well this war is costing us a lot of money and potentially putting our own government at risk because of elevated prices of oil we have to get them to find a deal so china is not going to cut off ties with putin they'll still say you know the lip service about how nato is wrong but i think china at this point is much more interested in pushing putin and ukrainians into an arrangement that finishes this mess rather than providing weaponry to russia so that's why i think putin can't really rely on china to bail him out here,1.0,0.0
Tom Nash,mLz5_LcBcGQ,2022-03-19T22:03:13Z,Will China save Russia? (It’s Complicated),NATO,welcome to another video my name is tom nash don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing just listen in this video i'll explain to you exactly what's going on with russia and ukraine beyond the propaganda from both sides and what i think is coming next because i don't think china is about to rescue russia like everybody on both sides think let's start russia's economy is in shambles and it's been going downhill at an alarming rate since 2014 which is when the us actually started sanctioning russia for annexing crimea the russian gdp per capita went down by 35 can you imagine an economy going down 35 in eight years russia's economy is a total toilet the us has a gdp per capita of 55 to 60 thousand dollars depend on the year russia is about fourteen thousand before twenty fourteen since 2014 it's single digits it's 8 700 per capita it's abysmal it's nowhere near where western modern countries should be definitely with so much resources in the ground so he had to solve this problem now annex in crimea was hugely popular in russia and gave him a lot of boost he basically said well i'm going to use my military power to cover up my incapacity as far as economics i'm going to take my military i'm going to get a seat at the table with u.s and china because they'll have to respect me and negotiate with me after i do it so i'm going to get some clout from them i'm going to get people rallying behind the flag and forget about the fact that the economy is the toilet and i'm going to do everything while causing a rift between ukraine germany and the us ukraine is going to be mad that nobody's coming to their protection like they promised germany is going to be fighting with the us because germany would not want to sanction me because i own them because i supply most of their gas and the us would want to shellack me and this triangle of hate is going to dissolve nato so we're going to get all this in three days of blitzkrieg boom boom boom the government is gonna run away because they're crumb puppets and we're gonna take over ukraine not a single shot fired where it matters basically crimea 2.0 now obviously that didn't happen the war is now in its third week the government is still standing and most importantly the people of ukraine are not welcoming him as a savior which i thought he was sure of now because of that the military effort is costing him more and more money more and more casualties is becoming less and less popular back home in russia and he's essentially alienating himself and no longer can be considered as the liberator of ukraine they freaking hate him so even if he wins which probably seems to be the case with the amount of military power and just the sheer numbers that russia has over ukraine what's next let's say he conquers ukraine which by the way would be a monumental task if the people aren't cooperating which they're not so it's a humongous country let's see him do that first but assuming he's done that let's say he stays and occupies ukraine i mean the cost of this is going to be insane his economy can't handle that let's say he wants the puppet government if he's not there to prop up the government and he leaves the moment he leaves they're going to overthrow the government if he stays it's like him occupying the country he'll need hundreds of thousands of men on the ground to keep it going money he doesn't have so there's no realistic way for him to win here also if he actually conquers ukraine that's the worst thing that can happen to him because that means there's not going to be a deal the only way out for putin here is to sign a deal with ukraine that the west will approve because that's the only way out of these sanctions if putin beats ukraine if he i think the worst thing that could happen to putin is this government will run away if putin actually takes ukraine by force the door is closed on any removal of these sanctions but if they work out a deal then the sanctions can be lifted so putin needs the solution to come from an agreement but the problem is his military has gotten exposed for the piece of trash that it is and he has no achievements on the ground to leverage to an actual peace agreement that he can actually sell back home as a reasonable one so he can't do the peace talks until he has some achievements but the military is just total doodoo so now the military is resorting to bombarding civilians which is alienating the local population even more and pushing the settlement even further so he's trapped and now even his own minister of finance is saying well half of our assets our foreign reserves are frozen we can't access that now the other half is pretty much also very heavily leaning on gold and that 130 billion that he has in gold it's not that liquid you know gold markets are just not as liquid as equities as you would think moving that much gold is going to be impossible probably he could move anywhere from 5 to 10 to 15 of his gold reserves in the next let's say two months and even that is going to crash the gold market because it's going to be dumping all this gold in the market the price is going to crash basically rendering his own gold pretty much worthless so he's stuck there's no money coming in except from gas oil and commodities which is a lot of money still because everybody still needs his gas all in commodities but it's not enough money to do anything but survive he still needs much much much more foreign currency to keep the ruble afloat the russian bank the russian central bank needs a lot of foreign currency to prop up the ruble and with access to foreign currencies blocked by the eu and the us he's basically locked out out of the only instrument he has to save the ruble from crashing which is exactly what's happening right now the ruble is crashing inflation is going through the roof the economy is falling apart russia is headed to bankruptcy so how can he get out of it well a peace agreement would be nice i don't know if that's in the cards it doesn't seem like it the other option for him is basically to have china step in and save his ass but here's why china is a complicated solution which i don't think he has well for first look if china saves his ass look at what he went through he went through all of this craziness to lose the entire cloud of the eu which is now completely disengaging from him it's basically unifying under nato sweden denmark all these countries finland are trying to join nato so nato is uniting he's getting isolated he's getting cut out from europe and mainly that's the crazy part that europe is militarizing and talking about diversifying out of russian gas in the next 10 years so you're losing clout in europe from being the guy in europe into being owned by china if china saves russia china basically owns russia they're the only option as is this but even that even that shitty option is not really on the table i'll explain why look president xi and putin are best friends forever the bromance is so strong it's as good as it's ever been but it's meaningless because all about

Tom Nash,N0ZKemtR88U,2022-03-16T21:40:59Z,The FED has a major problem…,Federal Reserve,so we finally have the first rate hike in three years interest rates were raised for the first time since 2018 and the market pretty much took it in stride it's not to knock on john powell and his press conference i mean look he didn't crash the market which was good he didn't blame putin for february inflation like biden did which was good and he didn't say anything about inflation being transitory so you know three out of three look on the serious note we're looking at point twenty five percent rate hike now markets have been ready for this and i gotta give credit when credit is due the fed basically deserves a lot of respect they made it a very soft landing nobody was surprised and the market pretty much took it and just enjoyed the ride now the fed when credit is due we have to give them the credit they did a good job massaging the market into this now the real question remains is how much of the next interest rate hikes are priced in because that's a whole different enchilada and i'll explain basically we're looking at five or six more rate hikes this year in 2022 meaning we're gonna end 2022 with anywhere from 1.75 to 2 interest that's right now a given the fact is that we just saw 0.25 puts us on this course to 2 by end of year and the real question how much of that is priced in into the market that's a question i don't know nobody knows but let me tell you something else that is not going to be enough and i'm not talking about the 0.25 i'm talking about the 2 percent for every one percent that the fed is gonna hike we're gonna pay 200 billion in interest payments to service that debt it's a lot of money right now they just did a minimal 0.25 percent it's not that bad but as we get closer to one percent it's going to start being painful and if you just go back to a minute ago i told you we're probably looking at 12 if you really want to fix this so what's going on right now the fed has to communicate as if they have free will to do whatever they want when in fact they don't until the government fixes the problem as far as finding solutions to handle this national debt they can't really raise interest beyond you know quarter percentage points here a few quarter percentage points there they could probably go all the way up to two percent by end of year but at that point they're going to be locked out the government is the one that needs to find solutions because it needs to allow the fed to do what paul volcker did in the 70s now i'm not saying they need to raise 20 interest but i'm saying they need to be able to be at three four percent today at minimum which they can that means lowering energy prices there's a lot of stuff the government needs to start working on to allow the fed to do their job and right now none of this is being done and that's the real problem that's the haagen-dazs in the pizza these interest rates on their own are meaningless without actual solutions from the government and that's why i think the entire debate on mainstream media is lacking because nobody's talking about that point what's the government doing as far as allowing the fed to raise interest rates right now they're locked out because look if the fed raises interest rates abdu wazoo and the government didn't solve these problems it just means we need to print much more money we need to print much more money we're flooding the market again with more dollars causing more inflation so we really ain't really solving anything think about it now look it's still a nice progress at least we do have that crossing of the threshold of actually raising interest rates for the first time in three years we've managed to do that the market didn't crash hallelujah now it's time to get to work the real world that's not gonna be easy,1.0,-0.25

Tom Nash,OL5_ga3K4og,2022-03-10T14:34:46Z,"The Tom Nash Show: Inflation Getting Worse, Palantir, Oil Prices and Amazon Stock Split",Palantir,speaking about people who know things ahead of time let's talk about palantir so there's a really interesting chart right now circulating on reddit and on twitter in fact i retweeted it myself showing you how since the price has started going down from the mid to high 20s in november all the way down to what we're seeing right now which is pretty much the dpo price the percentage of ownership by institutional investors have been going up quite significantly in fact since november the amount of institutional holders and Palantir have gone up by 50 percent these are the sharks who buy when everybody's panicking so while retail is going out and basically selling out institutionals are going up and i've said this is going to happen months ago i tweeted about and i told you hey as price comes down institutionals are going to swoop in buy cheap wait for six months to a year sell it back to the same people who were selling and panic getting out of it it's exactly what's going on now look to be fair the pool isn't big for institutionals so a 50 increase sounds like a lot but in fact it's an increase from 500 to 700 or 750 or 780 depends on how you measure it and when there's still 2 billion shares so it's still like 35 36 of the float it's still dominated by retail and as long as it's still dominated by retail we're gonna see crazy volatility a day what plus eight the next day minus eight who knows but hey this is just the cost of doing a dpo a direct public offering when you don't do an ipo there's not any institutionals in it however if this trend continues and institutionals keep pouring in the future for Palantir looks very bright but then again it's a slow process it's not gonna happen overnight,1.0,0.4

Tom Nash,R_PAXuu6fqY,2022-03-09T11:14:21Z,Why It's Literally Impossible For Dollar To Lose Reserve Currency Status,US,the dollar is not collapsing there's no great reset coming it's going to be bumpy and unpleasant but when the dust settles the us dollar is still going to be the king and the u.s economy is still going to be the king it is what it is the collapse of the door perhaps losing its reign as the world's reserve currency a collapse of the u.s economy crazy inflationary spikes leading to a stock market crash is this the beginning of a cataclysmic failure event that we need to prepare for so the question here is is this whole thing going to backfire on the us collapsing the dollar essentially also taking away the dollar's prime position as the world's reserve currency the thing is that the dollar has at least the us dollar has a cheat code because the us dollar since 1974 and thank you richard nixon for that is basically insulated from inflation from a collapse from any sort of dethroning attempts because in 1974 opec agreed to go full-on u.s dollars essentially every oil transaction in the world that's coming from opec which holds about 80 percent of the world's trade is done in u.s dollars which means hedging is done in dollars development projects are done in dollars meaning hedging of development projects are done in dollars everything that has to do around the world all trade is basically done in us dollars eighty percent of it is done in us dollars that solidified the us dollar's position as the world's reserve currency so the question is will opec ever agree to change that and to go with the chinese iran well for that you need a few things that china and russia can't deliver it's as simple as that for a currency to challenge that for opec to agree that that needs to be currency that's located in the country with the you know rule of law yeah not really in china or in russia with safety for investors you know 80 85 percent of the world is still going to be on the dollar the reserves banks are going to be in the dollar and if that's the case the demand for the dollar is always going to be higher than other currencies because when you talk about the collapse of the currency look there's two things that can lead to collapse there's internal inflation that's basically price driven you know loss of purchasing power in your own country due to you know money supply due to interest rates stuff like that that we always talk about but the other thing is how the currency is traded versus other currencies and if you are the you know the standard if the us dollar is the currency in which everybody buys oil the demand for us dollar by the physician is always higher protecting it from inflation and protecting it from devaluation protecting it from you know not ever being the world's reserve currency and while we probably head it to some sort of a bear market's less recession and the dollar is not going to be as dominant i mean it's not as dramatic as some of these you know gold pumpers and doom and gloom idiots will tell you the dollar is not collapsing there's no great reset coming it's going to be bumpy and unpleasant but when the dust settles the us dollar is still going to be the king and the u.s economy is still going to be the king it is what it is,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,8Z00gcmbuzY,2022-03-08T16:15:14Z,Russia threatens Europe’s gas supplies as U.S. bans Russian oil,Russia,it's one thing if you're paying more or much more than before it's a whole different thing when you get nothing threat from russia to cut off supplies of gas to europe our business editor stephen carroll joining us here on set with all the latest stephen stewart this is the latest escalation of threats from moscow russia's deputy prime minister has warned of catastrophic consequences for the global market if hit with an embargo alexandra novak says that moscow could cut natural gas supplies through the nordstream one pipeline which links the country to germany europe gets around 40 of its natural gas from russia and around a quarter of its oil so first of all let me just calm you down the united states is probably in the position where it's never going to be in that place of complete shortages because it doesn't rely on the eastern part of the world for anything on the flip side europe is in a whole different enchilada i mean they have a big problem europe actually uses russia for a major import center for everything for example 40 of the natural gas that goes to europe comes from russia but countries like germany going all the way up to 60 percent i mean look even if you take away the natural gas still one quarter of the european oil imports are coming from russia now russia globally is only about a 10 player but in europe they're two and a half size that not to mention the fact that look russia and ukraine are commonly referred to as the bread baskets of europe they literally supply like 25 to 30 of the global wheat market two countries the global wheat market not to mention the fact that russia supplies like 16 of the world's natural gas 12 percent of oil 50 of palladium palladium in case you haven't known that is pretty much in every non-ev car av car electric vehicle car it's extinct certified cpa shout out to my friend chris now look here's the thing um it's a big supermarket of commodities metals energy food and europe is not just in a position to pay more like we are in the us europe is actually in the position of not having food that's a whole lot worse however fortunately for europe the incentive for russia to pull the plaque on that is not so high obviously russia would love nothing more than to pull the plug and starve europe out of electricity and out of food the problem is once they do that they're basically taking away 50 of their budget right away and for a country that's been completely locked out of its foreign reserve and we're going to talk about that in a second that's a death blow now obviously russia is irrational and obviously they got a leader that might say well you know people can starve i don't care I'm going to hurt europe maybe they will do it i don't know but as a utilitarian totalitarian kind of cost-benefit analysis it doesn't seem plausible that this would happen but who knows at least for the very least the flow of energy and wheat and commodities continues even though russia made threats direct threats that they're going to screw around with the supply chain just to show europe where the fish are pissing from let's see what happens and the real question is what's going to happen to the western economies if one would decide not to buy russia's commodities and energy which would be crazy at this point because we don't have alternatives or two russia says we're not selling to you which is kind of crazy in the same amount but who knows with russia or number three they just can't supply it because you know they gotta dig it out from a war zone and there's interruptions now obviously we're gonna see a major spike in the cost of living major spike of inflation and it's not going to be good neither for the economy nor the stock market we're about to see some major turbulence no matter what happens and as long as this happens russia seems to be in a quite comfortable position their economy is getting decimated the ruble is getting annihilated however they're not going to starve to death as long as we keep buying their commodities in oil and gas and we're not in a position to not do that because we don't have enough supply chains lying around to get it anywhere else and when i say we i mean europeans not so much the americans on the other hand russia can't potentially sell it to china but again it lacks supply chains to do that to replace europe so it's kind of this mexican standoff slash to the worst people living in the same house slash crazy marriage of efficiency i don't know but at this point russia seems to be quite insulated from the brunt of this by being able to sell commodities and oil obviously we took away and we froze their foreign reserves which is basically killing their currency but as far as functioning with this they can actually pull through for a good few months this is not nothing to collapse the economy in a few days this can continue for a while as long as you keep buying now the real question is what happens in the west given the fact that we just saw a precursor for a crazy supply chain interruption price increases and inflation and you can actually look at the bloomberg commodity index and see that just in the past two weeks it's up like 14 insane number in the past year it's up 60 that has nothing to do with the war because look here's the crazy part the commodity index has been on the crazy spike because of inflation now it's gotten even worse now the question is since this is literally you know the worst time for a war to happen as far as inflationary pressures i mean was this the plan of putting all alone to do this at this timing who knows and honestly figuring out what's next gotta be the toughest gig in the market right now because hey we don't know what's next for russia ukraine this conflict slash war slash invasion can go on for months it seems now even though we initially thought it's gonna take days kudos to the ukrainian resistance these guys are insanely good and powerful and no much love to them we don't know if opec is going to come to the rescue so far opec has basically said hey we're not going to save you i mean it is what it is sue us so that means until this stops until the fighting stops and we see some sort of a resolution some sort of certainty prices of commodities metals and energy will be going up it will going up on based on fears based on actual supply chain shortages and potentially based on further sanctions from both sides on each other and as long as this keeps happening we're going to see more and more inflation pushing the economy into recession,1.0,-0.4

it is what it is sue us so that means until this stops until the fighting stops and we see some sort of a resolution some sort of certainty prices of commodities metals and energy will be going up it will going up on based on fears based on actual supply chain shortages and potentially based on further sanctions from both sides on each other and as long as this keeps happening we're going to see more and more inflation pushing the economy into recession,0.9,0.6

Tom Nash,zpp6_Sjucyc,2022-03-02T22:21:51Z,"The Tom Nash Show: Palantir, Russian Economy Collapse, Ukraine's Bravery, Jerome Powell and Tesla",OPEC,you have to understand that basically opec is the actual price that is for oil and they won't let it get to 150 160 because essentially at a certain price all demand actually starts lowering at a certain price it doesn't make any sense to buy more oil even if it means shutting down or slowing down your production or not touching your car simply so basically what's going to happen is that opec and that's historically been proven is going to find an equilibrium point where they say well enough is enough we're going to release more supply to reduce the price the problem is that opec is a bunch of gangsters we literally are stuck in the war between a crazy dictator invading to a sovereign country pushing up the oil prices up and a bunch of you know cartel members who are supposed to decide to stop the price increase at some point it's not a good place to be in but over the long term opec at least in the past we're consistent at pulling the brakes at some point because the demand is actually not worth the squeeze at some point the price is high but they're not making as much money because the demand goes down there's a whole curve that shows that let's hope that that's exactly what happens here because at 150 per barrel we're going to have a really horrible time over here in the u.s and in europe and pretty much anywhere outside of russia,1.0,-0.2

Tom Nash,L44ZBpcjE9w,2022-03-01T21:59:46Z,ARK Invest Reveals TRUTH about Selling PALANTIR!,Palantir,today we're actually reacting to a very interesting two-minute clip by meet kevin he interviewed the head of research for kathy woods arkhanvest and basically asked them a question why did you guys completely liquidate your palantir stock position completely to zero what happened now i'm going to warn you that this is kind of a breakup conversation you know when if you ever had a breakup conversation after you broke up it never goes well i mean i've been on the receiving end i've been on the giving end whenever you have a conversation when one you know the dumped party is saying well why did you leave me why is it not enough for you you're never going to get a good answer it's it's just it doesn't exist and i've i've you know i've been on both ends it is what it is so don't expect to have a fuzzy warm feeling kathy dumped us and it is what it is now i am curious academically what happened because nothing in my analytical side that has no emotions the explanations that they gave so far don't really add up with what are supposed to be and the way they're behaving just it kind of doesn't add up for me for some reason i'm actually looking forward to hearing what brett has to say because obviously he's a smart guy to get some more insight into the thought process of what made them sell palantir because maybe we should be concerned as well you know maybe the bull case is now not as strong let's see what he has to say i'm honestly completely open to hearing what he has to say about it you know this one's common talent here what happened sure i mean like i described as we're in risk-off periods we tend to consolidate the portfolios and so um you know we had some concerns about their competitive positioning within the government space and thought we had better risk money elsewhere uh and so it's not you know they're when you're making a decision to like consolidate a portfolio it's not like those are easy decisions but you look at kind of like the risk return profile for all of your positions and say what's lowest on the staff rank relative to something else that we think has comparable upside that makes sense so so in risk off periods to make the simple basically when prices are going down narrow into the ones maybe you have the most conviction in is that that's what you're saying exactly yeah yeah if we have a better edge somewhere else then then we'll operate somewhere else so i want you to pay attention here he's saying um our level of conviction i love that face by kevin it could be a great thumbnail in times kevin if you're watching this i you should screen this this is this is the best thumbnail face ever uh so he's basically saying hey we don't have as much conviction in palantir as we have in our other stocks in our portfolio fair no problem there i completely understand now i'm curious about the second part is what kevin is alluding to is why what leads you to having less conviction volunteer versus when you bought it at mid-20s that's the part i'm curious about what what did you think about their idea of investing into specs to uh the talent here to to basically try to vc partner with them and then get that software contract is this was this a little bit of a gimmick was that strategic you know or is the bigger focus on government and maybe their government activity not growing because that is something that stayed stagnant yeah i think for us it's more um kind of i think that they had a really differentiated product in government a few years ago and then their competitive positioning has diminished and then the government has those government contracts i think that they've shown a higher interest in multi-sourcing so so you know it's an interesting company i think that the you know the technology is super interesting we're very bullish on ai generally i think that the um marginal competitive weakness on the government side just left us with you know other places to go that's fine okay i would if i was kevin i would push back here a little bit because basically he's saying well listen i love you you have a great character i love what you do i love you as a person but i'm not in love with you this is what he's saying to valentin pretty much now what he's actually saying here on the serious note and i want to be serious here a little bit is basically hey listen um we don't mind about the specs which would have been a valid argument a lot of wall street investors don't like companies who basically function both as a as an innovator but also kind of as a vc holding company it's a very strange mix and it's a very hard show to pull off he's not going there he's not saying he's saying i have no problem with the specs he's saying that we're we're seeing a decline in their government business and that's why we don't feel as confident about it or not now again i want to see if he has anything more to say about palantir and if not i'll break down what he just said because it's a really problematic statement hold on a second all right let's move on from that one let's go to okay so he's going to a different stock so basically here's the deal and this is the part where it never added up for me because if kathy wood is calling herself innovation in fact she's saying that if you buy a sark the the the inverse arc you're betting against us innovation okay so if your innovation and if you keep preaching about a five-year horizon I would argue that palletier is probably a top three of the innovative companies you have in your portfolios across the board so except from tesla and I can think of one more but let's say palantir is a top three innovative company in your stable and uh if you talk about a five-year horizon would it be more probable than not they're gonna be extremely dominant in in the commercial sector yes in fact i would also argue that most of us long-term palantir bowls honestly don't really care so much about the government side it's all the commercial side is where we see the massive growth of the company so the government side is kind of the legacy side and if you look at the palantir slides they'll show you it's stagnating so this is nothing new the government side has been exhausted it's been fully utilized i mean there's only so much governmental agencies that need this sort of gotham products i mean there's not a lot more of market share to explore there uh unlike the commercial side which is wide open for an enormous amount of time so again even if you think that and that's fine if you do if you think hey you don't have enough government business that's something that's been known for a long time nobody was claiming here that palantir has a massive upside because of the government business everybody was buying into the commercial side of things which is a kind of a self-contradicting statement if you're an innovative five-year horizon fund why would you sell an extremely innovative company that's now trading at half of what you paid because their legacy government business sorry about that is basically my software is out of date because essentially the government business is dropping so hey listen i'm not any less bullish on palantir in fact i've released a whole video today earlier today explaining why i'm more bullish than ever in palette because of what just went on for the past four days over there in europe and russia and ukraine,1.0,0.8
Tom Nash,bY8dtykwDZ8,2022-03-01T07:00:44Z,Did Palantir Just Become The World's Most Important Software Company?,Palantir,hey this is tom and let's talk about palantir so the past 96 hours proved one thing unfortunately which is alex carp even though everybody mocked him was 100 right about his predictions regarding where we're headed as a society and as a global community he kept saying for the past two years that we're going to a more chaotic more messy world more conflicts more logistical nightmares basically a world where simple actions international borders are going to be a challenge both in the commercial side and on the government side now i say this with a great deal of sadness because i honestly did not want him to be right because as much as i love me some volunteer and i do it's not about that for me like i'd rather the world be a better place and all of us have a better life and not have to deal with the second coming of the ussr or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the guys are doing over there i'd rather have a world without that even though you know my palette investment might not pan out so much i honestly do i mean i lived through the horrors of the cold war and i don't want that what would it be for me to be a volunteer millionaire in the world where everything goes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but unfortunately it seems like that's what we're getting right now and in that aspect alex kept saying hey the pilot is going to be the most important software company in the world now mind you he didn't say the biggest software company in the world he said the most important one now i personally think that they might be the biggest in 10 to 15 years um but that's a whole different discussion and i think that what happened in the past 96 hours proves why that is actually what's going to happen and unfortunately unfortunately his prediction was correct because what just happened is basically that intersection where palantir is at which is cyber security right ai data defense military logistics and organizational data of a complete chaos new unfolding situations being you know new rules being written all of these things uh are basically tailor made for a company like palantir volunteer thrives in chaos and uncertainty not to mention the fact that the company is built like a fortress alex has been fortifying the company for a black swan event for years he bought up gold remind yourself anybody so he bought up a lot of gold and and also the balance sheet is completely clean of debt so the company is basically it's cash flow positive 420 million dollars of free cash flow so the company is built for hard times their solution is basically made for hard times and the main challenge that they had and i mentioned this in my previous videos is that their total addressable market outside the us was very limited because nobody liked them in europe europe has become this pacifist basically liberalistic a little more war kind of uh continent and that's fine the problem is that's what we've been trying to tell europe is that hey guys listen it's okay to be peaceful but if somebody's coming to your property with the intention to take your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or your life and it's not going to help you to speak to them and try to calm the situation down if you don't have a stick any sort of diplomatic solutions don't work if you don't have a leverage if you don't have an alternative if you if you don't have the threat and i just spat on my screen again why every video i make i spit on my screen at least once anyways i'm not gonna redo this video [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it um i already just demonetized it by saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it basically europeans have miscalculated i think that part is you have to have a military option if you want to have a diplomatic solution now they've grossly underspent military defense i mean germany mainly it was a joke um the biggest economy in europe completely you know a joke over spending on military and defense basically saying we don't need the we don't need to protect ourselves everything will be fine um and also they hate volunteer for being exactly the opposite as far as conceptually volunteers the kind of company that says hey we have to prepare you know if if palantir in europe are two neighbors living next to each other and europe is that neighbor that says yeah everything will be okay and palanti is the neighbor that's building a bunker stocking up on on on thin foil cans of food and water supply builds themselves a tunnel buys a shitload of guns so one is a preparer and the other one is just a relaxed kind of a normal human being and it seems like the preparer was right in this case at least so europe will now basically have to open itself and basically say well okay palantir is not as bad as we thought plus we need you right now palantir's total addressable market both in the government and the commercial side is going to increase exponentially in europe where i think their biggest weakness was because whether you're a government and you need gotham or your company that's operating in europe and you need solutions to how to move goods in this craziness no fly zones right wartime cold war borders whatever is going to happen a lot of uncertainty and logistical supply chains are going to be a mess so i think volunteer i don't know what happens with the stock price in the next year and i neither know or care but if i look at the next decade i think valentina is definitely shaping up to be one of the most important software solutions on the planet i mean it's a no-brainer so kudos for alex carp for predicting this I was hoping that he's wrong because i'd rather my palette investment go to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] than to live in a world that's chaotic but you know the world and our parents is two things we don't choose we get the parents that we get we get the world that we get even some i say the people are now getting what they deserve it's i don't subscribe to that point of view but it's going to be really challenging for the next decade and let's see what happens but in any case i think you know i'm that's kind of my theory and you may disagree and that's okay and you don't need to buy volunteer stuff but that's my theory why i think palantir just over the past 96 hours doubled their rest of the world tam government and commercial and i think certain institutionals will try to uh play that down so they can load up on volunteer I almost am confident that what's going to happen right now is the slow realization that palantir is undervalued but it's going to take time,1.0,0.85

Tom Nash,vzvIxAMwdUY,2022-02-24T22:02:37Z,PLTR: Something Crazy Just Happened!,Palantir,so what the hell just happened with palantir the stock started at negative eight finished the day at plus 13.4 what just happened why there's a good reason but in order for me to explain to you this reason in under five minutes i gotta explain the geopolitics of what just happened because what transpired in the last 24 to 48 hours is going to change the world in a serious way for the foreseeable future and i think palantir is going to be a part of that whether you like it or not now a lot of people talked about palantir about the intrinsic value about dcfs about a five dollar valuation and i've just sat and waited and what just happened in the last 24 to 48 hours is just proof that everything alex karp said even though he was uncoherent even though he was rambling on even though certain people had trouble understanding what his point everything he's been saying for the past year just came true. The one company that thrives and all of these three elements is palantir. A company that has been developing a platform which is foundry for the commercial sector and gotham for the governments is pretty much now the hottest commodity in the market. Every single government in the west including europe yes you remember a few days ago i said europe hates palantir well guess what now they know they need valentine because there's a bigger enemy now they've seen the bigger enemy they no longer will hate palantir all these european governments would need foundry they would need gotham and they would need palantir to protect them from the big bad wolf. So the european hate to planeteer is gone with the way that russia is behaving and now palantir is basically sitting there with the cyber security company saying well this new world order that we're about to experience is going to make us the hottest commodity in the market every single western government is going to need us and the one person sitting there and saying i told you so is alex carp. What you saw today was a sign was a precursor to what is coming in the next two or three years complete heat up of a new cold war electronically and a demand for gotham which is going to drive palantir into much more government tam which i didn't even think existed up until a few days ago because i thought the commercial side is going to be much bigger so now they just become a two-headed monster. As a long-term investor buying valentine at these prices given what i just told you for me it's a no-brainer. I think as a long-term investor with what just happened in russia and ukraine and what's about to happen investing in a company that has gotham for me it's a no-brainer they just increase their time exponentially so that's kind of my theory about what happened.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,JFf7s0Fulbw,2022-02-24T14:28:23Z,Russia - Ukraine Crisis News & Updates: LIVE,Palantir,are you buying valentin today potentially yes i will be buying a tesla today for sure because tesla is at 700 as far as palantir probably not sure yet a hundred percent. ready to load up on palantir under ten dollars i think that's a that's a very a very real possibility to be honest. a lot of my audience is interested in volunteer and i understand this i'm in the same situation obviously. so now let's move back to what's going on with palantir so let's go to volunteer real quick so uh opening up valentier and let's open pre-market volunteers see where where we at right now with volunteer so i'm assuming right now volunteer as you can see on the screen right now is not doing so well in fact doing quite horribly as you can see on the screen parentheses right now pre-market minus 8.15 percent minus 8 in pre-market down to nine and a half dollars which is i believe the original dpo price might be even lower. i guess the question if you want to ask yourself at this point is okay so that's the price is this a good time to buy a volunteer i don't know but here's the question you want to ask yourself if you believe in the company if you believe in the management if you believe in the business if you think that the company was worth ten and a half dollars yesterday what changed from yesterday so finally it was worth than a half dollars yesterday does it worth one dollar less today because russia invaded ukraine uh everybody can answer it for themselves i personally don't think that that's the case but i'm sure there's a lot of people who are giving out five dollar evaluation to palanti right now they probably will disagree with me so for me the answer is quite clear. sell everything and buy palantir in the dip i don't think that's wise heinz i totally understand where you're coming from with this but i wouldn't go all in on one stock and i wouldn't try to time this market so i would be very careful. mikhail galushka is saying be strong guys i lose all my portfolio tesla and palantir but will never give up yeah i'm in the same boat with you mikhail my tesla is 10 of my portfolio volunteers forty percent of my portfolio so as you can imagine i'm down big but let me just remind you that it's not a loss until you sell it's just a virtual loss if you haven't sold i'm not selling so i have patience to wait until it goes back up. chris brown is saying hey volunteer below 10 anything to worry about or buy the dip opportunity and hold so let me pull up volunteer and let me just kind of tell you my opinion about what i think is happening here so that i'm back so plenty right now is at 9.66 cents. as you can see right now on the screen palantir is down big quite significantly so nine dollars 68 cents so the question is and i can't tell you what to do chris but i will tell you something how i think of it so the way i think of it is basically well piloteer was worth at least 10.4 dollars yesterday so now it's worth one dollar less so is the russia ukraine conflict devalued palantir by one dollar hmm is now volunteer seven percent less valuable than it was yesterday because russia invaded ukraine i would make the counter argument that it makes palantir more valuable because volunteer is actually a company that thrives in chaos and thrives in times of crisis and but you know let's see i can't tell you what to do definitely not to buy or sell the dip i don't know but that's kind of my logic and how i look at it. i feel like tom has convinced us this valentine was undervalued at 16 now under 10 he's not sure if he's buying that's crazy to me well henry i bought 85 000 of valentine at 12 i haven't sold a single share in the past six months of volunteer so my own conviction is very strong about volunteer i have zero interest in price action in the short term and it's a long term play for me so i'm not really i'm not phased by valentine price drops at all but i'm just well i just will tell you that if you have price sensitivity in the next year you probably should not be touching volunteer,1.0,0.2

Tom Nash,MNJCmtNm7ws,2022-02-20T18:54:05Z,Palantir's Dilution (and Profitability) Problem,Palantir,talent here is no different now what actually happened that over the past few weeks we saw an increase in the chatter around talenteer because you know drama draws these discussions as kathy wood is selling off the stock price is going into the toilet dropping faster than my grandpa after the new year's party everybody has something to say about palantir some of it is actually legitimate criticism i want to progress and address in this video i want to show you guys some of it is complete nonsense and some of it is kind of on the fence in the middle but in any case i want to present a balanced view in this video i want to give you all these narratives bad narratives about the company and some numbers to show and confront that and you'd be surprised with some of them i actually do agree and so if you want to hear like a balanced analysis of the problems with palantir i guess stick around because this is going to be interesting so what are the biggest negative narratives what are the biggest negative catalysts for palantir out there because you might have heard part or some of them but i don't think you ever saw anybody confront these with actual numbers with some of these i might actually agree i'm going to surprise you this isn't going to be a fanboy type of video i'm actually going to give you the numbers some of these are legitimate so the first thing is that the company is not profitable there's a lot of narrative from value investors basically saying well tom this company is not making any money they're not profitable you're just buying into the insane growth and that's true there's growth there 41 of revenue growth so the growth is there nobody's arguing about the growth but the value investor is basically saying well tom this company is not profitable well the reason is because they're looking at gaap profitability valentine's gap loss for the quarter was 14 so they did negative 14 net operating margin on gaap basis but the adjusted operating margin was 29 positive so why did we have such a big difference from adjusted operating margin of 29 which is really impressive and gap operating margin negative 14 well the reason is because the only difference the only difference between adjusted operating margin and cap operating margin was stock based compensation... it's a tax benefit so if that's the case if the only difference between gap profitability and actual profitability is just the stock based comp then it's just a tax thing there's no loans in the company zero debt they have three times more assets than liabilities they don't have any goodwill on assets and they just generated 424 million dollars in free cash flow from 1.5 billion in revenue as far as volunteer not being profitable that's true for tax purposes but it's just a tax benefit in actuality they just put 424 million dollars in the bank from operations now let's talk about the second narrative which is the dilution so there's the big debate about planeteer's dilution which was massive... palantir has two lines of businesses which i think should be actually separated i think it would be healthier for the company to spin off foundry and separate foundry and gotham into two separate companies because on the one hand you have one late stage company which is gotham the government business which is kind of in the milk and cow stage it's basically just you know getting revenue not really growing that much on the other hand you have the commercial sector which is just taking off i think it's year five or six for foundry so a lot of employees are coming in into that business and need to be retained and that's why potential is giving away a lot of stock based comp when you give stock based comp to employees you basically have a vesting period of four to five years which the employee can't live without losing their options which are not yet vested so it's kind of a prep for a war that's coming against the big boys when the microsofts of the world decide to take on valentier it's going to be very hard to retain employees unless you give them a chunk of the business and that's the theory behind it but it's definitely deluding the other shareholders make no mistake about it the thing is and i'll be frank they gave a big chunk of the business uh not gonna lie so they did 100 dilution two years ago last year we had 14 dilution so from 100 to 14 and in the last quarter of this year we had 2.5 so basically the annualized rate at the dilution right now is 10 that's coming down from 100 just two years ago so basically they're slowing down the stock-based compensation because they've hired the big chunk of employees they need to keep going with foundry and i don't expect to see a lot of stock based comp a little bit is fine every company has it and nvidia even has it every company has stock options for employees to buy i think that palantir now is at the stage where it becomes at the same levels like in nvidia or in amd companies like this where you know it's minimal... The problem isn't the delusion here the problem and that's where i think a lot of the bears they missed the point the dilution is not the problem the problem is how certain are you that the choices of to whom to give these stock base comp is correct because if this choice isn't done correctly you just gave half of the company to bozos and the question should not be well tom why are they deluding the question is how we can get more assurances that the stock based comp was allocated to rock stars and superstars and not bozos and to be honest we can't and i have to agree with the criticism here although this side of christmas was never made but i'm kind of agreeing with myself not a first but i'll tell you where i stand on this i agree with the criticism however i tend to think the things in the way that i i look i think peter thiel and alex harp are good judges of character so if i had to choose i think it's more likely than not that peter thiel would allocate these options in the correct matter to rock stars with his experience and and track record in the business but to be honest i don't know so it's an actual risk we don't know and you know when you hire an employee and you give him a lot of money you don't know how good is going to be until six or 12 months down the road until you see a whole year so until you throw them in the thick of it you don't really know now the next point is the company is expensive now look at volunteer right now there are 13 price to sales snowflake is moving between 1780 crowdstrike is at 30. cloudflare is at 45 i think on the other hand c3ai is at 9.3 so it's not the cheapest one for example like c3i is cheaper but it's definitely not up there with the more expensive players like a crowdstrike or a snowflake or a cloudflare 11 or 12 or 13 this company is actually a very good price point not the cheapest one i'm not going to sit here and say that 13 multiple price to sales is cheap but compared to the similar companies it doesn't seem to be that expensive now about the other point here that's being made is that the government business is slowing down for the company it is but check it out the government growth started at 76 percent in the first quarter and ended on 26 declining throughout the year so first of all there's a lot of seasonality with government business government years usually start at the lower half of the year and thank you alex from ticker symbol you for pointing it out to me and so you see a lot of government activity and alex talked about this on the call on the lumpiness you see a lot of lumps so they come cyclical becomes seasonal and that's okay the other thing is that honestly even if it declines it's not a huge deal because the focus for me is the commercial side I think the bigger total addressable market is in the commercial side and there we see a total growth of basically going from 19 28 35 47 quarter of a quarter and in that environment we're definitely seeing growth and I'm much more excited about the tam and opportunities in the commercial sector so I'm not really that impressed by the claims of the government sector going down even though they are the main revenue driver right now with like 60 revenues but it's not the future of volunteers so however on the commercial side there is a legitimate criticism and i agree with it and most of the 47 growth from the government came from government but what about the commercial side so the commercial side we had about 34 growth if you look in the us you had 132 in the final quarter that's insane but that's just in the us so if just in the us you had 132 quarter how the hell did you have 34 on annual basis that's because the rest of the world grew by 16 pretty much nothing so why first of all it happened on the self-imposed kind of basis palantir is putting resources on the u.s market right now and you know they hired i think 70 or 80 new employees over the past year they started the year with 12 employees and they finished with like 80 something employees on the u.s commercial sales side so they're putting all their eggs on the us currently and that's one number two you have to understand even though they have less resources to put on on rest of the world in europe and there are self-imposed limitations because the government work they do valentia has a major problem people hate them in the eu they're viewed as a cia kind of company remember what ross gerber said on david's show they think of volunteer like this as this you know government evil spy company and until volunteers solve this problem and you know figures this out they're going to have to deal with a lot of hate and a lot of pushback from european clients the only way to do it is just to attack the us become an industry standard and then when the u.s companies use palantir and they're kicking ass basically the european companies will say well you know what they're going to make us so much money i think they're not that bad it's just business you know money talks walks the one point i want to make here before i let you guys go is what about the guidance they're guiding for lower operating margin for next year instead of 29 adjusted operating margin they're getting for 27. that's bad right not really they're hiring a lot of sales people a lot all over the world and that's gonna bite into their margins i think two percent basically is driven by that so assuming that the sales people actually do their job and generate much more income much more revenue then the reduced margin would not be a problem because at the end of the day the cash flow from operation is going to be much much bigger but then again nobody really knows i just wanted to give you kind of an objective picture about what's going on with this company obviously some of these concerns are real and you know it's a risky investment like any other i'm as bullish on it as i ever was in fact the q4 financials for me were a big sign that this is a company that really not easy to find 30 plus percent growth year over year 30 adjusted operating margin sticky business insane mode great software rich clients cyclical business uh net retention in the us was 150 net net retention on the government side was 140 i mean it's a really good business not a lot of companies out there that can give you something like that probably like a google or a tesla and can't think of any others for that matter i'm sure there are but i mean there's not a lot of good companies like this i know that the narrative right now is to hate on volunteer and that's okay if you want to invest in different companies i mean there's plenty of other stocks out there and i'm fine with it as long as you enjoyed the video i'm cool with it thank you so much see you tomorrow,1.0,0.7

Tom Nash,NLpm9K2BXis,2022-02-16T19:16:26Z,We really need to talk about Palantir...,Palantir,oh okay so we have to talk about palantir there's a lot to cover in this video before we start don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing let's talk about palantir the queue for financials and what's ahead starting right now hey thank you for staying with me my name is tom if this is your first time here as always you know we don't click nothing we don't smash nothing and we don't buy nothing so the only thing we're going to do here is talk i'm going to talk you're going to listen and then at the end of it you're going to put a comment below basically answering my main questions now this is exactly the game plan for the next five to 10 minutes so the q4 financials are coming out tomorrow before market open so i'm assuming we'll see the results at around 7 00 a.m now this is a good opportunity to let you guys know i will be streaming the entire q4 earnings including one hour ahead so 7 a.m i'm gonna be live with sasha yanchin he's going to be co-hosting with me and we're going to cover everything you ever want to know about valentin the q4 numbers we're going to be there one hour ahead of time breaking down everything so if they actually release the data a little bit before the call we're going to have it for you first thing so 7 am be there or b block i would have said square but they changed it into blocks so be there or be blocked i guess so let's talk about here and what's ahead so obviously the company took a massive bidding of the past 90 days and you know my position on this i think that the company is insanely undervalued and now more than ever so the first question on everybody's mind i'm guessing is will this actually move the needle if the q4 financials are astonishing will this move the needle for palantir will the share price actually go up now i'm going to be honest with you nobody really knows including myself but i can speculate that i don't think that's going to be the case unfortunately because here's the thing palantir is grossly misrepresented in institutional ownership only 35 percent of planetary float is being held by institutionals guys like blackrock vanguard goldman sachs all of whom by the way are shareholders of palantir i didn't just name them randomly but it's still only 35 just for comparison we have amd at 70 percent we have nvidia at 70 percent we have snowflake at 68 so all of these companies are hovering from 65 to 70 institutionals while palantir is at 35. actually their institutional ownership is even lower than tesla believe it or not the queen of retail 35 for palantir 41 of tesla even tesla the queen of retail has more institutional investors than palantir now as part of the turf i guess when you have a lot of retail participation in a stock like palantir you know we tend to be a little bit more fickle a little bit more volatile that's how retail investors are and that's why you're going to see a lot of volatility in the stock for quite a long time and the truth is that institutionals have been pouring into volunteer they have been buying the dip however it's still not enough 65 of it is being held by retail investors who will be quite volatile and quite itchy to sell and buy and i don't think q4 financial is actually gonna change that in fact i assume stellar q4 financials 1.5 billion dollars in revenue about 400 to 450 in free cash flow and guidance to about 2 billion next year all great results but i don't think it's going to move the needle when you're actually going to see retail participation go down to the 30s and then institutionals go up to the 70s or at least the high 60s like we have the amd and the snowflake and the nvidia's which i just showed you then you're going to see more price stability and more of an incline so far institutionals are happy to nibble at it by the dip a little bit and slowly get in but you know it's a long term investment so i'm not concerned so if you have any hopes of buying palantir and then hoping for a crazy bull run after the q4 financials i don't think it's going to happen now beyond the obvious there's a few things i really want to see in this q4 financials and those are specific issues that i care about and i suggest you pay attention to them as well because they're quite important the first thing i want to see if palantir is able to accelerate commercial growth outside the us in the u.s they have stellar commercial sector growth in saying can they do it outside the u.s because it's going to have a massive impact on the potential total addressable market tam of talent here so i want to see the row rest of the world commercial sector growth volunteer it's a very niche data point but one that i think is critical here now the second point that i don't think gets enough respect or at least enough coverage in mainstream media as far as volunteer is the fact they're still highly concentrated this company only has 200 clients and to make things worse only about 40 of them which is the top 20 percent hold 50 of the business of volunteer so palantir is dependent for half of its revenue on the top 20 of their clients only 40 clients and that's a huge risk now the number has been growing quite significantly things are definitely getting better but i want to make sure that this keeps happening because with 200 clients and 40 holding half of your revenue it's a huge business risks that i don't like to have in the company i'm investing in now the next point has to do with volunteers history now palantir started out as a government service provider in fact they've been exclusively that for almost a decade and a half and as such they've accumulated a big backload of government clients and when the commercial sector started out just a few years ago it was grossly misrepresented now things are getting better in fact in q3 we saw 60 government 40 commercial things are getting better but i want to see some progress i want to see more government versus commercial evenness i guess equilibrium if you might call it that so i'm not expecting to see a 50 50 split right now in q4 i think that's too early but if we can see 55 government 45 commercial if we can see an improvement a trend that is getting better we're getting closer to that equilibrium i'm going to be happy with that now the last point of concern for me is the growth in sg a the sales general and administrative expenses for the company now i know they hired a lot of sales people in fact a lot of them they had no sales force up until just a few months ago they are spending a lot of money on that but all i'm saying is that the sgna has to start trending downwards they had 750 million sg a just three years ago trailing 12 months they're almost at 1.4 billion of sgna that is way too much now i'm assuming that once they have the first ramp up of the sales force they get that in place and we'll see some reduction that obviously i think also these numbers include a lot of stock based compensation which actually is declining as well so i just want to see some downwards trend i don't want to see a crazy increase in sgna because so far every increase in revenue have been completely correlated to increase in sg a so we didn't see any actual you know difference there so they went from 600 to 1.4 billion in revenues and they went from 750 to 1.3 billion in sg a so it's almost one to one correlated we have to see some efficiencies we want to see the margins getting better and i think it's going to happen but i just want to see it and not just talk about it and now let's talk about valuation and my own target price for palantir now i've made a whole video with the dcf showing you why i have 35 for this company as my own target price of course i'm not a financial advisor you got to do your own research find out for yourself my reasoning behind this is quite simple i see palantir as a massive disrupter similarly to how tesla disrupted the auto industry i think volunteer is about to do the same to the business intelligence data and ai industry and for the next 10 years i see them almost monopolizing this business and while that's happening i'm also figuring out that data is slowly becoming the new oil pretty much i think the next decade is going to be all about data and i'm really excited about what planeteer can give you if you want to look at more specifics of how volunteers actually do what they do how their system works what kind of benefit they offer to clients what's the bottom line savings they can show to clients everything is available online there's a whole book with test cases from palantir and skywise that have actually saved airlines quite significant amounts of money skywise is obviously just an implementation of foundry for the airline business there's a lot of test cases out there which you can read and educate yourself so whenever you hear you know people tell you well we don't know what valentina is doing there's a whole book showing you exactly how they work what they do and how they save money if you just really want to know about it it's easy to do it if you just want to keep screaming that you don't understand their business that's fine as well i don't mind in any case i'm really excited about where this is heading i feel like the palantir community have upgraded over the past few months we weeded out all the tourists and speculators and now just the hardcore people who believe in the company and who want to do actual thorough in-depth research and stay in it for the long term i could not be more excited about the future of this community of palantir and the stock price as well obviously will follow it might take a year or two or three it is what it is i have the patience and i don't mind if you don't don't invest simple,1.0,0.7

Tom Nash,KO-TcmnedTg,2022-02-16T13:53:40Z,Elon Musk Just Did The Unthinkable!!,Tesla,The only company that spent zero dollars on advertising its electric vehicles is the company that actually makes the most of them which is tesla so tesla that actually made almost one million pure electric vehicles last year spent zero dollars on super bowl ads and while you may think well they did this to save money that is true there's no need to advertise when you're the king of the hill and nobody else can even come close to you you have to understand that elon musk's decision was kind of iconic to me because while this whole thing was going on we actually found out that elon musk donated 5.5 billion dollars to charity so basically this is what happened yesterday we had the super bowl ads come out and we had all of these legacy oms throw hundreds of millions of dollars at this market with no products to really offer while tess is basically saying well we're gonna spend zero dollars on this and instead you know let's have elon donate five and a half billion dollars for charity and by the way that donation is kind of funny enough related to a tweet he had november so in november some idiot actually posted it with saying well elon's money can solve you know the world's hunger problems or some communist like this and basically elon for some reason replied saying hey if the u.n comes up with a plan i'll donate six billion dollars now we don't know where this donation went we only know that it happened really close to that tweet we also know the amount was really close so we can only guesstimate where he donated it but knowing elon no it probably went to the un or something similar like that so if you ever wondered why tesla is doing so well and why people feel so positive about tesla besides the tesla q morons and the the haters and the bears why well you just had a five minute explanation of why tesla is killing it and these other clowns are burning money investors money by the way on ads when they don't even have a product to sell so if that's the only thing you ever wondered about tesla and elon that should be it but before i let you guys go i just want to throw and sprinkle around just one more piece of item while everybody in the u.s politics game that has any sort of affiliation with this administration was basically criticizing elon saying hey we should tax elon ellen is evil he's not paying enough tax he's a freeloader remember that while politicians who are by definition freeloaders and i mean all of them from both sides of the map are criticizing elon for being a freeloader this dude just in the same year paid the biggest tax bill in history and also in the same year donated the biggest donation i've ever heard of five and a half billion dollars to charity in a single year i don't know how many more philanthropists out there that giving money like that usually when you have that kind of donation i mean you know there's buildings and you know cities with people's name on it and the thing is he didn't say anybody nobody knew about the until three or four months later when we saw it in the filings for tesla,1.0,0.9
Tom Nash,uz-IMgwxAxM,2022-02-05T14:58:11Z,Dave Lee Shares His Mind Blowing Theory About Tesla's Future,Tesla,you made one of the most brilliant videos and i told you this offline about the tesla q4 earnings more so the call that was following the earnings and what elon said and how you're seeing tesla's future so first of all welcome how are you dave thank you tom yeah it's good being on your channel and i've appreciated having you on my channel just a week or two ago yeah how was the interview with justin yeah just know it was great yeah yeah it's been a pleasure getting to know him and what he's doing as well yeah yeah so justin also told me had a great time with you so i i i was just speaking to another guy earlier and i described you as a tesla visionary i think that's the best way to describe what you do do you think that's accurate um yeah actually i don't know i kind of look at myself as just someone who who holds a good amount of tesla stock for a very long time so what's interesting is i don't really trade in and out of too many stocks or i don't trade in and out of tesla much so almost like almost all of my tesla shares are from 2012 2013. um yeah i picked up some more along the years but yeah so and then almost all my net worth probably you know over 80 95 of my net assets are in tesla stock and that's how it's been for a long time and so it's not something i try to do or it's not something like i'm thinking about tesla like to try to convince people at all there's nothing really about that i don't really you know care too much you know if people are in the stock or not but it's more like this personal thing where i think about it a lot it means a lot to me and um what means a lot also is just thinking about issues clearly about trends in the future and so to me tesla is like a test case it's like a metaphor um of how you think about the world and investing all together and so i look at it more like you know it's a fun exercise to look at tesla to try to figure it out because you could use a lot of the same principles for other stocks other fields you know the future 10 or 20 years we're still going to be talking about probably what happened you know with tesla 20 years 20 years back. Do you get at all annoyed by the lack of recognition the tesla is getting or maybe not getting but by the government or this is something you just kind of get amused by like i guess the question is yeah if there's something that annoys you or this in the gordon johnson category we're like just say or whatever like yeah to me i'm not too annoyed like i think i've seen much like crazier stuff happening like in 2018 i remember going to cnn going to fox and he was going to drudge report going every single big media news outlet in a course of one week and they all had uh hit pieces against tesla and elon musk on the front page like it was just like blasted like everywhere you went um that's that's more of a big deal and that's where tesla was struggling and media was just trying to kill the company. When biden doesn't recognize tesla it's like you know i move on it's yeah it'll be fine. I'm getting ahead of myself because a lot of people i'm sure are not familiar with the thesis but like just if you can walk me through in the audience through kind of the progression of how you felt uh the timeline is for tesla for the next like five to ten years. With ai day tesla basically came out with this full stack kind of saying we're doing like the sensors the hardware we're doing the neural nets the training we're doing the computer the chips we're doing the testing the validation the software deployment we have the cards we have everything we have the whole package no one in the world is doing what we're doing with real world ai and then they said you know our next big thing is or next thing we're working on is this ai robot. So all last year i've been kind of tweeting about it thinking about it like if tesla could make a robot and port over their ai expertise like this could be the next big thing let's say 10 or 20 years down the road. This past q4 earnings so this is just like a week and a half ago or two weeks ago elon says this is going to be the most important product development in 2022 this ai robot and this just messed up everyone the analysts are freaking out saying like tesla's lost focus and you know the stock is plummeting but i'm thinking wait a minute this is not what i'm expecting i'm expecting this robot to be a priority three four five six years from now why is it moved up so much. What tesla is doing is they're saying we think we figured it out how to make ai navigate move itself and not just in a car but we think it's going to work in a robot. People ask me like oh how can tesla compete with the best robots in the world right now but you know they look they talk about boston dynamics boston dynamics is not an autonomous robot it's basically programmed you know heuristically to do whatever this is autonomous rope this is the state of art autonomous robots and tesla i think can make something in like three months that can beat all of these guys you know it's um yeah they're way ahead in terms of their ai and that's that's the whole thing if you stick real ai into these robots they're gonna be able to like you know run you know and actually be coordinated and do crazy stuff. If tesla really prioritizes this focuses it develops it over time they could provide you know a robot that's very useful and actually people buy it and if they do that they can possibly corner the market because no other company is working honest on this like tesla is and if they corner the market that helps their development because they get all this data from all their robots and it makes it harder for the next company to to get a market share position because they have to beat tesla they have to be better in some way than tesla which is going to be hard and so if tesla actually jumps out in a lead gets a big market share they eventually could be the winner takes all market or winner takes most for ai robots. Elon can make sure that it's used in the right way for example you know he doesn't like it if it's like exactly like a human with their facial expressions that's why it's like a black face right now he wants it distinct he doesn't want like a terminator type of you know boston dynamics robot that's why it's like it's a lean looking you know kind of harmless type of looking robot he doesn't want it to to outrun a human right that's why he he makes it where it's only going to be walking at a certain pace and so elon wants to try to safeguard this where these ai robots are are used for good to help humans so if he could wait dave sorry to interrupt you but you remember the game detroit become human no no no no no never played that there was a game no i'm not a so there was a game that came out where it was a futuristic game about these robots that were like agi robots and they look very humanoid looking robots and there's no distinction like basically from a from a from human beings yeah so the only thing the only thing with distinction think them is like these little circles on the on the forehead but other than that like they look completely human and so that was kind of i don't know how i interrupted you go ahead sorry yeah sorry i apologize no no no no no that's that's important because like this is that's basically the turing test right so there's this like you know test in computers like can you tell the difference between a human versus a computer and you can apply it to audio if you listen to something is this a computer talking or a human or writing is this a computer that's written this article or a human or visually like you can say hey is this video a human or a computer and this is getting more and more blurred because computers are getting so good at being able being able to write and speak and do many things and that's why you have like for example these deep fakes coming out right like impersonating other people and so you have this blur where people aren't sure like is this real or not is this something just made up or not and this is just showing how fast right ai computers are progressing but i mean eventually the idea is yeah if elon could corner the market and make sure the ar robots are used for good then he works with regulators to make sure that the right laws are passed so that it won't be used in the future for free for bad either you know and then by doing so it's like tesla has kind of safeguarded the future of humanity against possible like evil ai robots right and it's this combination of using technology innovation going to the market first using data advantages with all the data that they'll have with robots and cars and then basically you know using i think regulation eventually once they get there but it's it's it's kind of the answer to elon's concern five six five five or six years ago you know that ai would get out of control but this poses another interesting question which is will tesla then solve agi. This is the future that elon and tesla are preparing for and that's what you got to do you've got to start early enough where you're the groundbreaker you know in these technologies getting the market lead and so that's what q4 earnings was all about you know elon was saying hey we're going for it this is our priority and um yeah and so that that was misunderstood by the markets because you know they want to focus on the next year next you know two years max they want profits and earnings and all that stuff and they're scared that that you know elon and tesla will get sidetracked from making cars right and just be all in this um kind of like facebook what facebook has gone through where they're just talking metaverse metaverse metaverse but they're not really showing the revenue or the profits yet right and so investors hate that type of you know kind of distraction or or that kind of talk. I think that's unique like elon and tesla they're one of the only companies that actually have something that benefits like is so critical to the future of humanity as part of their mission statement right and so if they had to choose between making more money or you know doing something better for the earth or the world they would choose doing something better for the world you know and um yeah and i think elon has shown that over and over like um like by giving the patents away for free for tesla's you know all their patents um i think he's willing to you know open up the supercharger he wants to license fsd he's not wanting to destroy all these other you know automakers you know with it like he doesn't have that intention you know. Who is in second place for artificial intelligence in the physical real world and you know there really isn't like a real second place per se like you have a lot of people buying for the digital online world like you have open ai you have google and facebook and some others um but in terms of actual like physical world navigating interacting with the physical world it's like there's not really any company on the level of tesla in terms of ambition like think about it in 2017 they put a fsd computer in all of their cars regardless of whether the person purchased fsd or not it just came standard this fsd computer and this was like probably about a 3000 investment that tesla put into every single car you know but if you think about the margin that's like you know that's a huge amount of margin hit per car and no oem would would sacrifice five to ten percent margins you know just to put in a computer that might help them in the future right. And so elon made this big move where he's like yeah 3000 bucks per car because we we need the data and this is the future and what other company has is doing that you know 3000 dollar computer in over a million cars right out there in the physical world gathering the data and most people don't understand what's really going on they don't understand this is a huge data collection fleet that's every day even right now today you know the whole fleet is capturing all this data and feeding the engine to make it better and better and there really is like no close second place to a tesla's doing in the physical world it's kind of mind-boggling and you need that type of expertise and data if you're going to make ai robots work because it's about you know navigating the physical world so yeah it's extremely bullish on tesla's chances I think of making an ai robot I don't know when the timeline is I mean it still it could be quite a while but the market potential is so big meaning it's multi-decade you know tens of trillions of possible dollars or more and um it's okay it's okay if tesla doesn't have it right away because they've got electric vehicles that are just growing like crazy right now they're in the beginning of this hyper growth stage and then they got fsd you know coming up in a few years and then you've got tesla energy coming up as well if you've got massive like hyper growth stages tesla's going through they don't need the robot at all and the other thing is it doesn't even cost that much I think to make the robot because they're using most of everything from their fsd program they're using the same chips the same hardware the same people the same computers the same neural nets so it's not like facebook's metaverse thing where they're spending 10 billion or more you know a year um losing money trying to make something happen tesla doesn't need to do that they just need to you know do what they're doing and then just keep on you know investing on the side with the ai robot as well but yeah it's um it's fascinating i don't know if there's a single company out there that is involved with so many multi-trillion dollar you know markets and that has kind of like this first place lead at least right now with perhaps the biggest market of all which is kind of these ai robots um yeah it's it's definitely a crazy story and then you have people comparing tesla pe to forge pe and then then i see this every once in a while on youtube we're like okay then so yeah i think that if your scenario plays out which sounds to me like if if i don't see why can't at this point it sounds very like the path there is just wide open right now as long as they execute and as long as he stays committed to this idea if he follows through and he executes and everybody so nobody has even started working anything close to that at least not anybody with the amount of resources that he has which is billions and billions so by definition i mean it's not even about going to be about who's going to be the biggest company in the world obviously they're going to be the biggest company that ever was i mean it's not even going to be close there's going to be this behemoth of a global corporation that controls like if you win agi what does it mean as far as market cap. Back in like you know in the early days of tesla investing i was spending almost all day writing forum posts on this forum clip called tesla motors club. What happened was i remember back in 2014 or so i was spending like the whole year just every day like five or six hours typing these long posts and the number one debate and argument i was having with people was i was convinced that tesla was on the path to becoming the largest automaker in the world that they could take out toyota eventually if the model 3 was going to be successful because then they could just take on the next kind of markets. Elon actually was forecasted the model 3 he called it the gen 3 car and he said it's going to be a 35 000 car we're going to try to sell 500 000 by 2020. People had a hard time believing that but i was like i think they could do that they just need to shrink the model s make it cheaper and if they do that i think they can be successful take on the bmw 3 series but i think they actually have a very very good chance of becoming the largest automaker because they just need to go to downstream like cheaper cars cheaper segments right and they could they could become the largest but believe it or not like probably 90 percent of people are arguing me day and night saying impossible impossible tesla will never you know become the worst largest automaker zero percent chance officer but these are tesla bulls these are people who have the stock you know. Fast forward to 2022. I'm not saying that tesla is going to 100 for sure take on ai robots and have you know this crazy you know market cap but i see actually very very good chances you know probabilities if they continue to go on this road and they continue to execute they make actually a really good ai robot I think that's that's where it leads you know they think about the model 3 it's just gotten better and better every year they keep on improving it they keep on making it cheaper it keeps on getting better it does more things I have a 2017 model three but it drives itself almost you know it's like you have fsd beta right now it's crazy this is five years later. I think this is fundamentally a crazy different type of product tesla is improving their efficiencies the costs are going down massively the value they're creating is going up a lot especially with autonomous driving like that just increases the value of their product and their offerings they're already at around 30 gross margin you know for their cars imagine what's going to happen if this continues right so if they continue to give more value through autonomous driving it's just going to go up I think. I'm calculating like for example operating profits to be like probably 30 billion dollars by the you know let's say end of next year or soap at an annual rate and then it goes up to probably 45 billion in 2024 i mean the operating profits are going so fast because the company is so lean and um yeah their products are in such big demand and i would be concerned if tesla wasn't innovating fast enough where they're not giving additional value to their cars you know and then maybe the price has to come down the margins have to come down as they increase volume but if they are giving value and this autonomous driving kind of feature that they're working on actually plays out then i don't think there's going to be a huge issue or a problem with with margins you know and that's one of the reasons why I drive the the fsd beta almost like you know several times a week in my car to make sure like it's progressing on the right track and i've been actually pretty happy with it I think they're they're improving it actually pretty fast. I look at this and I'm saying these guys are so efficient so adjusted ebitda margin right yeah so adjusted ebitda margin we're looking at a company going from 17 23 on ebitda it's 23 23 cents on the dollar with under a million units economies of scale are everything here it's exactly hard the more you build the better your margins by definition so a million cars is is really not a lot so a million cars pandemic years supply chain shortages no chips basically outages stoppages you name it so in that year they went from 17 to 23 cents on the dollar on ebitda I I find it insanely efficient and I'm saying well this is just and this is for me why so now you hear my bullish theory so why am I still bored so this is on the most razor thin margin business you can imagine because this is talking about a business that has 30 gross margin which is basically by the way 30 in hardware it's insane it's it's a lot so if but when i think about fsd and i think about 85 gross margin or 80 82 gross margin where it's exactly it's going to be within 80 and 85 gross margin and we're talking about 40 ebida which is sas tech level margins plus in add this to tesla's ability to be insanely efficient like they're on the on the brink of of an insane jump into selling software and not selling vehicles in fact it is going to be so much more profitable selling the software and and licensing the software they might as well give the cars away for free in a few years I don't think they will by the way but i mean like this it wouldn't be it would be the if you take the pie chart right of tesla's revenues in five years the amount of hardware in it is going to be so minimal versus the amount of of of licensing software and and the stuff that are basically scalable up to wazoo because there's no cost there's no capex there's nothing you it's like a course like a digital car things you don't sell by the way and neither do i but i mean that's why i'm bullish i i don't see like i don't i I hear your vision and i'm fascinated by it I think it's going to be epic if it happens and I think it might but i look at it like a simple man I look at the financials like efficient company I don't know how the they do it and imagine when they sell five million units what the margin is going to look like and they're selling fsd at 80 gross margin I mean people are going to look back so i tweeted a few days ago or i made a video said 900 bucks it's your last chance and people like tweeting back at me oh tesla is under 900. it's been two days I was talking like like in the in the long term i mean i think this is pretty much the next jump for them because i see like once fsd becomes like not beta and publicly available and licensable because i can't see mobilelite competing with them sorry mobile mobile has a nice product i i don't see them competing with tesla's fsd yeah i think it's going to be the next sleep that quantum leap that tesla does which is going to surprise a lot of people i think and that's that's why i'm so bullish in the next couple years. Check out operating margin like a year ago q4 2020 it's like five percent right five point four triple the triple like think about this like this doesn't happen very often that you go from five percent operating margin to 15 but then it wasn't really 15 it was probably closer to 18 if you back out all the one time i didn't check out the one that you got the stock by the payroll tax yeah yeah so how do you go from 5 to 18 operating margin in one year you know the covered year with shortages yeah like and the secret the secret of their sauce i think is their lean operating expenses they're i mean this last quarter it was a lot because the one-time expenses but with if you pull out 600 million or so it's back to how it was you know before um so yeah their operating expenses just don't go up that much year over year and um that's why their operating margin is going up so much it's um yeah it's just it's just amazing they've they've got such a good business model. I look at the revenues and the revenues when like right from q4 2020 9 billion to 16 billion automotive yeah automotive from nine to 16 in a year but regularly credits regulator credits stay the same this is the let's say yeah at the 300 level and all you remember how like a year ago it was fashionable to talk about regulatory credits for tesla yeah all and nobody's saying that right now it's like you don't hear that argument anymore now it's all about like they found new fod but i think that narrative is like stick a fork in it it's done yeah well the the biggest narrative in the past years was tesla loses money off of every car they sell which is not the case you know i mean it's um yeah definitely we're not gonna name names but we know who we're talking about obviously i don't want to offend anybody this is like i would have if you were not on the channel i would have done it myself i've done it before i don't want to drag you into this drama i know this cheers yeah yeah i also found it funny how you put like a disclaimer on my interview on your channel like foul language or something like this i don't know like yeah yeah like parental advisory yeah yeah yeah actually some people have contacted me in the past saying that they watched my videos with their kids so i have to like yeah feel a little careful sometimes i just can't i can't help myself i feel like if i don't do it yeah i hear you i have a pain in my stomach you know like i have to when i'm pastor but but i i've toned down a lot in the past year I really people don't know how it used to be like this is like I'm getting better this eventually like I say mother lover now and people seem to like it. I think I've never heard although I'm sure now people will copy you like you know every good idea has a lot of others but i've never heard anybody break out this agi theory before so i want to be sure that we know where it started where it's originated this is really fascinating if you write which there's very probable reason to think you are i mean i don't even know how to value tesla this month i don't know what the valuation is gonna be this market cap is gonna look like a job but let's see what happens i mean there's only two certainties in life we're all going to pay taxes we're all going to die everything else is available right.,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,uz-IMgwxAxM,2022-02-05T14:58:11Z,Dave Lee Shares His Mind Blowing Theory About Tesla's Future,Apple,did you see something about apple that other people didn't see right the ios platform etc if you have that advantage then yeah it's it's it's pretty it's a different angle on the company because you could say oh the growth I'm expecting is far greater than what other people are expecting you know because this is not just a slightly better product but it's a revolutionary better product so that's how I kind of look at it,0.8,0.6
Tom Nash,uz-IMgwxAxM,2022-02-05T14:58:11Z,Dave Lee Shares His Mind Blowing Theory About Tesla's Future,Toyota,i was convinced that tesla was on the path to becoming the largest automaker in the world that they could take out uh toyota eventually if the model 3 was going to be successful because then they could just take on the next kind of markets right. it's just so outlandish that toyota could be overtaken right now it seems more realistic but back in 2013 or so it's like toyota was the king it was like the god of cars right um and so yeah i mean fast forward to 2022. i'm not saying that tesla is going to 100 for sure take on ai robots and have you know this crazy you know market cap but i see actually very very good chances,0.9,0.1
Tom Nash,uz-IMgwxAxM,2022-02-05T14:58:11Z,Dave Lee Shares His Mind Blowing Theory About Tesla's Future,Mobileye,i can't see mobilelite competing with them sorry mobile mobile has a nice product i i don't see them competing with tesla's fsd yeah i think it's going to be the next sleep that quantum leap that tesla does which is going to surprise a lot of people i think and that's that's why i'm so bullish in the next couple years,0.9,0.0
Tom Nash,IV_KBAJoo1k,2022-02-03T22:59:24Z,I sat down with Meet Kevin (and asked him some difficult questions),Meet Kevin,did you expect that people would get so uh upset about that because did you expect the level of animosity that's going to create no i had no idea otherwise i wouldn't have done it i think i lost like 500 subscribers in like an hour that's brutal no creator will admit it but we don't like losing subscribers now and and it's uh i'll tell you i mean it's been a lot harder for for almost any every finance channel to to grow subscribers uh in in just the last uh probably six months or so i mean crypto channels are going slower finance channels slower everything is just slowed down. do you do you not think that uh framing it in a different way would have saved you a lot of the grief like basically probably i don't have a pr team though no but like i mean what if you would have just said hey guys a lot of this is analytical a lot of this is is methodology crowd psychology but sometimes you have to go with your gut and i'm just going with my gut which is a fair game but if you would i think if you would have said that way you basically eliminate any sort of criticism of oh how could the system give you different answers within the 48 hour span I think you would have saved yourself a lot of trouble. do you think that this this kind of you think then being transparent is counterproductive for for a guy in the youtube finance community because i mean yes and and you think it will change the way you operate because of what you just went through probably not it it certainly made me think that i let me put it this way i wouldn't recommend it to anyone else uh you know if if somebody's not not already got everything out there and it's kind of oh nothing left to show there's no reason to start that uh it's it's really bad because people over analyze every single move. it's like i think he has great work ethic he's amazing at youtube but he's not an analyst he's not analytically minded and basically his argument i think which i think a lot of people share is that well you're killing it on youtube you're you're don't sleep obviously i don't even know like what is it one am 1 30 a.m oh yeah it's like 12 35 right now you don't sleep you you put on you put up five six videos a day so everybody loves that part but like a lot of people are saying well kevin like just uh you know a couple of uh months or years ago i don't know they dug up this clip of you saying i'm never going to do a stock market course remember that's now circulating over social media and i think it's fair for a person to change to change their mind because i'm going to tell you right now it's fair to change your mind because if you decided to do a course and people are buying the course and people are not asking for refunds and basically giving you positive reviews which is i've never heard anybody say anything bad about your course then the price whatever you charge the fair price if somebody's paying and they're not refunding it's i have no issues with it so it's okay to change your mind i don't i feel it's nice for social media to have a sound bite of you saying i'm never going to sell a stock market course and then like show like the 995 whatever you charge for the course i think it's funny and the but i don't think yeah i don't think it's uh i don't find this morally wrong but yeah well you know where where it comes from is do you think this criticism though is like uh it's coming from the from a from more a place like well you're really good youtuber but like we don't trust you as a stock market analyst yeah i mean i i think trust is for any individual to determine you know rep reputation is what other people think of your character as w what you are uh and i think my character is one of an analyst and i think if people uh even watch the live analysis that i do of uh earnings uh whether i'm pulling up 10ks or or 10qs or i'm reviewing what the federal reserve is doing live or presidents or whatever i think people know i'm an analyst at heart and for somebody to suggest that i i think is uh uh is is uh somebody who who doesn't watch the channel regularly and that's fine. as far as the course thing it's totally true back in 2017 and 18 i remember specifically i took graham stefan to a rental property in newbury park california and we were talking about how uh we neither of us wanted to sell courses and uh and that quickly changed it it did for both of us for both of us uh but we we both thought you know courses not for us we don't want to do them uh and the the thing that really changed is that we realized the youtube algorithm really prioritizes uh hot topic sort of videos and it's very difficult to do like a stream of of let's say 100 or 200 videos in a row where you really walk somebody through your thesis on whether it's real estate or stocks or something to where if somebody goes chronologically then they understand how your brain works how you analyze stocks you know how you analyze the news or markets or people or whatever that's very very difficult to do just on a youtube channel and so you know those sorts of videos won't perform even though they are the most critical in my opinion and that's where we both individually realized the courses could be very very useful for that and if somebody doesn't want to pay they don't have to you know there's there's no force for that they can they could try to learn themselves or or we get their perspectives from wherever they want. however and here's where i the point i want to touch on is i think that the the courses uh in itself is what's g what's getting you in hot water because people are people are not seeing i think the stuff that you were mentioning which is the insane amount of expenses and time that's put into this and they're basically saying well kevin is a grifter right kevin is still in the courses kevin is that that i think that and i feel like there's a lot of this that's driven out of people looking at you and saying well i'm not i'm not less talented than him i should be making millions of dollars why is he making i think do you feel like a lot of the criticism to you is kind of people have to disguise it as professional criticism because they're just secretly jealous or in the way they have like a cognitive dissonance about it i mean it could be that it could also be that it's it's easy content right it's it's easy content to make fun of people especially if you've got a channel with you know 1 000 subscribers 3 000 subscribers 50 000 subscribers it's so easy to just go oh my thoughts on me kevin and the most shareable content is the content that's going to get the most views and so somebody can make a video you know shouting or yelling or being extremely critical those are videos that are most likely to do well so i think part of it has to do with how society operates which is ultimately what the youtube algorith youtube algorithm is but yeah i think there could also be an element of of what you've described absolutely. do you do you feel like sometimes letting people know like they like you have a lot of new audience that kind of joined in the last 18 months that haven't seen the previous iteration do you sometimes not want to give them a glimpse of like the the kevin who traveled all the way to florida and barged into the grand cardone office and like that like do you never do not want to make that kind of content every once in a while just to give them a glimpse of the more edgy stuff you used to do i'm happy to i i mean i i love it i put some edgy stuff on twitter and instagram uh less less on youtube now uh mostly because of the production time that goes into it i mean from for me i just look i'm like my gosh some of the old videos the the more edgy kind of real estate stuff like i i used to do titles like i just left my family for a model uh and it was a picture of like leaving my wife or whatever for a mom and uh when you click on the video it was me at a model home i talked about the benefits of new construction real estate or whatever you know and uh you know but i would do these real estate videos or like my house is sinking in quicksand or whatever uh that was a good one uh those videos they would take me a day to film eight hours eight to nine hours of editing with music and and re-watching and production it's a lot of work uh and so now i've been a lot more freestyle where i i don't have the time to pull that together together i don't have the time to uh you know vlog my i just want to ski trip i didn't vlog it uh maybe i should have but even if i did am i going to sit and edit it all together probably not i really need to hire an editor then maybe i could do that again first of all i don't want to do it you should uh because i mean every person i speak to who was on your channel from the old days like i was we all say we kind of missed the real estate stuff because nobody was saying oh the real stuff there was trash we all kind of missed that and i think there's a demand for this content as well that's a good point i need to uh i'm gonna write it down i i if if anybody knows an editor i need one i'll write it down right now we gotta find something I know a few good ones I'll send you some some really good please thank you. nobody would go back if i told listen people who criticize you for not going back to it completely are just not fair it's like you at the end of the day this is a business you got a family you got kids it's it's a financial it's a business it needs to be viable there's no business in the world that would go back to a business model that makes seventy percent less income it's not it's never happening bro no i would i would never do it. I think you faced with stride some tough questions that I asked you I wasn't going super mickey mouse on you you answered you've been honest you've been truthful uh if people want to hate you they can hate you I'm I I said from the beginning I'm not part of that wave I don't I'm not I'm not I'm not hating on anybody because they're successful you know people want to hate you this interview isn't going to help but if people really want to understand what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happened I think this interview would really give them a lot of answers uh honest ones and I agree yeah so it is what it is thank you so much for coming on and you know let us know below if you want kevin to come back we'll see well hopefully you don't get a ton of dislikes tom thank you so much we'll see what happens.,1.0,0.1
Tom Nash,IV_KBAJoo1k,2022-02-03T22:59:24Z,I sat down with Meet Kevin (and asked him some difficult questions),Federal Reserve,I would have gone back to here we go uh the day they released the january minutes from the federal reserve which was the meeting they had on december 14th and 15th which they released the minutes I think it was like january 6th or 7th I can't find the exact date but one of those like the first week of january and I would have told myself kevin this is the worst report that you've ever seen unfortunately it took me like two weeks to like for it to actually like process in my mind like wait a minute maybe this has a portfolio impact uh and uh and I wish I would have just fully processed it when I had my reaction to it uh and made a video about it and fully applied it to my portfolio then so that would have meant I would have sold about two weeks earlier. and so the fed minutes combined with markets in my opinion not at all pricing in the the financial uh conditions that we might be up against plus all of the other earnings that we've gotten since when I sold but we're more talking about uh when I decided to sell uh to me it was it was a no-brainer to sell so it was a combination again of federal reserve earnings expectations cpi catalysts when I thought cpi would go down and the biggest piece of the puzzle really is this balancing beam that the fed has us on and that is we are either going to see an inflationary recession where inflation continues to run consumer spending goes down now the sudden we're basically in a stagnating economy where we have high inflation and a recession which is terrible and i do not believe the fed will bail us out and i'll explain why in just a sec or we go into a deflationary recession prices fall consumers stop spending and we go into too much deflation i don't think that's likely i think it's more actually likely that we might go from an inflationary recession to a deflationary recession like that's how we end up getting deflation is going through a recession uh and i think the best case scenario is we just get supply chains chill out inflation starts falling so we get disinflation and we just recover that's the best case scenario unfortunately we also got those gdp comps or the gdp release this was another factor the gdp release came in at i think we had an annualized gdp of like 6.9 percent it was 5.5 percent year over year or whatever we're not going to beat that again next year and so when i put all these puzzles together i'm like oh my gosh we've got the potential for negative gdp in q4 2022 we've got a fed that has told us they do not care about asset valuations asset valuations are high those are a risk a systemic risk to markets and our economy in other words they would prefer that asset prices come down we have high job openings which means the fed's going to focus on inflation instead of jobs and we have high inflation with no end in sight for inflation when we start putting all these pieces of the puzzle together the picture became a lot more clear and i think actually a puzzle is a great way to picture it like if somebody threw a bunch of puzzle pieces on my desk i look at them like okay this is in my way i'm just going to keep making my videos i'm going to keep working but i slowly put these pieces of puzzle together and then the picture became clear oh my gosh and so that's why i think it felt so abrupt because it was really the combination of this gdp print and the odds for a negative gdp print next year netflix the fact that the fed is not here to bail out a stock market the insane balance that the fed has all of these things together for for me plus the fact that earnings guidance my expectations were going to be all negative uh which so far they have been er to me was just a very clear sell signal. Now if we have a negative gross domestic product read because people spend less on goods and services everybody's going to freak out and they're going to look at the federal reserve and they're going to say fed bail us out you bailed us out in 1987 and you ended the panic you bailed us out in 2003 you ended the dot-com bubble you bailed this out in 2009 you ended the recession you bailed us out in 2018. you ended the crash of of the end of 18. you bailed us out on march 23 2020 you ended the pandemic pain of the stock market right every single one of those stock market corrections uh has ended with a bailout by the fed since 1987 every single one has been bailed out and now they can't what happens if we get a negative gdp read and the fed says sorry not bailing you out because inflation's too high we got to keep fighting inflation that is when people freak out that's when we hit a real bottom so i i'll tell you what i agree and what i disagree with your analysis I agree that the fed is not in the position to pump more money into the system they literally cannot do it anymore so that part is correct. there's no bailouts coming they just seven percent inflation and that was a while ago we're on pace on point two per month probably going to close out q2 with almost eight maybe even eight percent very close to double digits so ain't happening no more money from the fed I agree. my thought process was so if we need to see like at minimum at minimum just just to start the conversation three four percent interest right now today yeah at minimum it's just never the tip of the iceberg and we're at expectations of 0.9 which is kind of the four hikes whatever they're talking about in 2022 then i thought to myself well the fed will have to basically come out and say well this is going to be much worse than we thought and that is going to be the triggering for the real bottom to come in and basically create a crater where everybody will be able to pick up pennies in front of the stream roller and then i was cruising with that for a few weeks even a few months and then on we heard the jerome powell speech and i think you called it correctly before you went and uh be on the original video when you called it a nothing burger it was like you said it was a nothing burger the the fed speech the john paul speech the latest speech he gave oh oh okay okay okay okay and it was like you said it's going to be a nothing burger and it was it was a plain vanilla he basically tried not to say anything he basically said well we'll wait and see we don't know we'll wait and see we'll let you see and the market took it as a more uncertainty the market dipped even more as it usually does after one of his speeches the man is a serial market crasher and and then on monday we had three fed officials come out and basically i'm gonna use esther george as an example from kansas city basically saying hey things are bad but we can solve this by by reducing balance sheet which would basically eliminate the use of further interest rate hikes and more and more voices from the fed there were two more guys that came out basically saying we'll raise in march but after that we we don't know and they're basically we're insinuating well we're probably just going to do 0.25.5 this year that basically made me realize these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just decided or at least they're going to decide to kick the can down the road because they're looking at the bond market and the bore market is pretty much giving them a mini uh solution the bond market is the the 10 year is what 1.79 1.8 let's just say 1.8 for simplicity it's it's nearing two percent it's up 60 on the year from 1.1 so the ball market is kind of fixing it for them and these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are going to say well you know the bond market is is doing the job for us the the market the economy is kind of slowing down like maybe we can wait another six months and see what happens and that's that's it's i think it's a wrong move 100 don't agree with that but they'll do it because politically that's the easiest thing to do and they're going to kick the can down the road and and what basically ends up happening is that it sends a signal to the market party on you remember stifler from uh from american pie like party on dudes the entire market flies up on this euphoria again because the market is completely manic depressive right now so we have this massive run for a couple of months I don't know if how many months but we have this massive run until they wake up in six seven eight months and they say well cpi is at like nine percent we're about to hit double-digit cpi we're calling it quits we're we have to raise interest rates otherwise we're gonna we're gonna go down in history as the guys who who caused the worst inflationary crisis in the history of the united states they raise interest rates I don't know how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're going to fund it it's a whole different question by that time they probably have they need to have a solution but they'll probably figure it out in six and seven months and that basically it's like i gave the example you know when we were kids and the parents would go out of town we'd throw a crazy party I don't know if you were a bad kid like me but i was like a really naughty kid but then they come back a day earlier and then they walk in the door and then everybody's like the the speed at which this party empties to it's you and your parents it's like literally 25 seconds everybody's gone and then that's how the market is going to behave is once they say it's going to go so our main disagreement isn't about the methodology because we agree on the path we don't agree on the timeline I think it's six months down the road you think it's happening in march and that's the only difference we have. I can tell you they have some tricks up their sleeve uh and then there's some problems with balance sheet reduction quickly uh the government if they need to raise money to pay more interest they can tax which is really unpopular cut benefits which they do but by the way to interrupt you but there's i mean i know you deliver like i am in the laffer curve raising taxes isn't going to raise collections no no no of course not it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] movie right that's what they're gonna you know you're gonna hear these things but the big one that they can use for actually paying higher interest if they needed to is selling bonds the treasury department can just sell the bonds directly it doesn't have to be done through the fed uh so so there are some options there the the problem that we have with the fed right now is the balance sheet reduction is uh something that's probably going to take about 18 months to actually hit the market and that could potentially let inflation actually overheat even longer uh because balance i mean all you have to do is look up the reverse repo market and you see how much cash the banks have it's going to take probably 18 months to actually see you know these balances go down to zero to where we're actually tightening so uh i i do think that some of the doves over at the fed say hey you know an option is just balance sheet reduction maybe we don't need as many rate increases but more and more as we get these earnings calls coming out from companies i think you're right we're just going to see inflation blow up more and more and more but it's not just the companies and the supply chains it's like you said the cpi is broken in how it measures inflation we're going to get that housing inflation that's going to come in which always comes in late comes in six to 12 months late and the fed's going to be in a terrible place and they won't be able to get a handle on inflation uh and like you said they might have to end up going with a much more aggressive approach which they did already say that was it neil kashgari on friday said they want to walk the walk uh and start raising rates otherwise nobody's going to believe them anymore.,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,IV_KBAJoo1k,2022-02-03T22:59:24Z,I sat down with Meet Kevin (and asked him some difficult questions),Grant Cardone,kind of like getting sued best thing you could ever do to learn about the legal system is get sued I think you got sued by grant right some did you not yep yeah yeah you're getting sued by grant cardone is is definitely it's either gonna make you or break you and i don't think it broke but this is not there's like so do you not miss the the ease of just doing real estate of how nobody nobody was upset you had the fan base that was completely kind of educational you're still getting plenty of views do you not miss the the good old times where things were clean and kind of harmless. do you do you feel like sometimes letting people know like they like you have a lot of new audience that kind of joined in the last 18 months that haven't seen the previous iteration do you sometimes not want to give them a glimpse of like the the kevin who traveled all the way to florida and barged into the grand cardone office and like that like do you never do not want to make that kind of content every once in a while just to give them a glimpse of the more edgy stuff you used to do. when you were doing your grant cardone videos I was exposing the fake gurus you remember my i don't know if you saw me back then like the dan lok type of guys oh yeah yeah so back in my early days so as you so we both transitioned out of this our previous niches into what we're doing now so when i was doing this i was very critical of people selling courses.,1.0,-0.2
Tom Nash,IV_KBAJoo1k,2022-02-03T22:59:24Z,I sat down with Meet Kevin (and asked him some difficult questions),Nikola,if you told me three years ago that I'm going to be on the financial times having a legal battle against nikola trying to shut down my channel i would have told you like like there's yeah i understand.,1.0,-0.5
Tom Nash,IV_KBAJoo1k,2022-02-03T22:59:24Z,I sat down with Meet Kevin (and asked him some difficult questions),Business Insider,oh business insider is now talking about how kevin sold all his stocks you know it's just nuts did you believe if i told you like uh two years ago you're going to be on business insider analyzing your your stock market trades that does not sound something like yeah you would have said there's no way.,1.0,0.0

Tom Nash,IV_KBAJoo1k,2022-02-03T22:59:24Z,I sat down with Meet Kevin (and asked him some difficult questions),Bloomberg Terminal,you know i pay just as an example i pay three thousand dollars a month for the bloomberg terminal something like that it's like 28 hours a month i pay uh you know thirty five hundred dollars for uh for for retail tracking or fifteen hundred dollars for the reuters terminal and and these are monthly fees right so so i might be paying seven eight thousand dollars a month for research and in my opinion it is a drop in the bucket because if i can get just a little bit of extra perspective or that little bit of extra oh my gosh i haven't been rethinking about it that way it's worth it for me i will gladly spend money for people's research uh and and the course is really no different than that i've i i don't have issues at all with people selling courses. I have this little thing it's this little two-factor authentication thingy here from the bloomberg terminal and on may 19th of 2021 I got a code on here that said pray p-r-a-y and on a live stream I remember saying pray that's weird I wonder what that means ah whatever and I remember saying that uh and so it's on my channel too it's maine uh february 19th you can see it and uh the market ended up crashing you know the next six weeks were terrible we had a little recovery in april uh we got a horrible market in may right it was terrible and so I told everyone the next time I see something like that I'm a cell and I was mostly facetious because I'm not just going to sell off the superstition but uh on uh like two days before I sold I got a code and it said sh9 t and the ninth letter of the alphabet is I right and so I looked at that I'm like oh my gosh there's that same thing that happened on february 19th of 2021 it's just it's a sign and I don't I don't know if I believe in in you know karma or whatever or signs or whatever but that stupid little thing and I know how crazy it sounds but that made me sit down and say you know what I need to look at those puzzle pieces and that's when I put all the pieces of the puzzle together and I'm like oh my gosh that's where the white board came out that I showed you a picture of that's just one of them I think we drew like five or six different iterations that night I mean it was maddening but obviously that's kind of like a joke you didn't uh sell because of the people will take you okay okay you have to be careful about how you explain these things but I think like on the serious note uh I think what you're saying is basically the explanation that I'm getting is is the netflix earnings came out and the the reaction to the earnings as well as the guidance basically made you kind of re-evaluate everything and then you were kind of like the guy the detective standing in front of the board with all the the little post-its and the pictures and the little flags and then and then you had the like oh my god moment right second I'm imagining this kind of scenario playing out yeah exactly.,1.0,0.7

Tom Nash,IV_KBAJoo1k,2022-02-03T22:59:24Z,I sat down with Meet Kevin (and asked him some difficult questions),Netflix,when we started earning season and netflix earnings came out and i saw netflix plummet you know that 20 or whatever it was that's when i started that was sort of that catalyst where i'm like this is not normal those sort of fluctuations even though netflix gave bad guidance instead of six and a half mil of user growth they gave about two and a half mil i think which is which is like 35 i mean it's terrible guidance right that guide made me really nervous and made me go back to that book it made me go wait a minute we have such a miserable guide from netflix one of the fangs. basically the explanation that i'm getting is is the netflix earnings came out and the the reaction to the earnings as well as the guidance basically made you kind of re-evaluate everything and then you were kind of like the guy the detective standing in front of the board with all the the little post-its and the pictures and the little flags and then and then you had the like oh my god moment right second I'm imagining this kind of scenario playing out yeah exactly. you remember the john mann commercial for netflix uh no so jon ham the actor from from that uh that show i forgot the act it was like about the ad agency in the in the 50s i forgot the name it was a famous show on netflix manhattan admin man bedman medman thank you but i didn't know i didn't even know that it's called manhattan admin why they call it madman oh i i just found out thank you i'm too rushing for this so basically so john hamm is in this netflix commercial and he's like everybody's getting their own [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] film they're on specials like and he's crawling through every single like obscure actor like he's getting a show and he's why not john hamm and he's basically going on this rampage.,1.0,-0.7
Tom Nash,IV_KBAJoo1k,2022-02-03T22:59:24Z,I sat down with Meet Kevin (and asked him some difficult questions),Tesla,my top three holdings are palantir tesla google and the s p 500 and that's where the vast majority of my money is most of the stocks i cover and i analyze i don't invest in i'm i'm very specific about the companies i like. i'm going to put it in the same stuff i have right now which is palantir tesla s p 500 google not in any specific order because i think we're gonna primarily where we're gonna see this run up is in the s p 500 so and nice i probably think we're gonna have a nice 20 run until it crashes. hey love tesla don't like the price gonna wait for a dip you might never get the chance if you like good company just buy it so they were talking about these events. I can buy tesla 950 still fine great put 40 back in or rebalance a little bit whatever right big deal the risk is averted. the lucid is like the 50 to 65 year old right who just wants that feeling of like quality or luxury or whatever but there are some things that tesla just blows them out of the water on right but dude is there enough time for a luxury brand like what's the time doesn't make sense absolutely not they need to strip a lot of the features they have uh to to increase that tam addressable market but the problem is then it's gonna start losing some of the things that make it so kind of unique like i mean they've got these the little window shades in the back you push a button and they come up you've got a seat massager in in the front of the car you can set the seat warmer to either your butt your back or both right like it's all these little crazy little features that that you're like who needs that but that's what makes it different right and i feel like when they start cutting these features out for the 70k car you may as well just buy a tesla.,1.0,0.6

Tom Nash,XsC_et78uAg,2022-02-02T16:04:54Z,Why Google is my 3rd biggest position,Google,i told them hey tesla patenteer and google and everybody were kind of shocked google is your third biggest position it's kind of boring it's like a toyota corolla not a lot of not a lot of excitement there right and i get it but yet this is it look at what's going on today this isn't of course proof of anything a one day spike in the price is meaningless but it's a nice glimpse into what google can be in the next year or two and i think it can be phenomenal now check this out in this video i'll explain to you why google ran up in the pre market over ten percent three thousand dollars per share right now this isn't the split the split you all heard about the 21 split that google is doing is not the reason it ran up there's other reasons and they're much more fundamentally based also in this video a lot of you have been asking me well tom in your recent video yesterday you told us that you're changing the timeline you're basically saying well there's a bull run coming for the next six months and then there's gonna be a pullback so does this mean that your entire inflation stocks and everything you've been talking about for the next six months is meaningless no i'm going to explain to you how it still all makes sense and what's my strategy precisely i don't think i was clear enough on that so if you want that part i'm going to put this timestamp and if you don't care about google you can jump straight to that or if you want to hear both let's do it so google 3000 bucks per share 10 percent up hallelujah now of course if you're on my patreon community and subscribe to my patreon bro as if you're in my patreon community of course you saw that on april 21st we posted an alert saying well google is undervalued and we listed a lot of fundamental reasons which i'm going to cover in a second but basically we told you hey this is a 2200 stock in fact it was 22.75 and we think it's insanely undervalued now initially we gave it a 2 500 price and then we raised it again and again all the way to 3 000 which is my current price target for google now since then after the latest roundup we're already at 32 up on google which is kind of impressive in this year in the past three months i mean it's nice to see a little bit of green we had a lot of red god knows my portfolio was extremely red but it's nice to have and it's nice to enjoy it doesn't mean that we can't enjoy a good call even though a lot of our other coils are in the toilet which they are not going to lie shout out to the growth sector and kathy wood but still let's talk about what's going on with google so what happened with google why this stock ran up 10 in pre-market is it only the stock split well obviously no a stock split is meaningless fundamentally it does nothing for the company or for the shares you own the same percentage however if you have an underlying powder keg this little match that's called a stock split can ignite everything however if you don't have the underlying fuel the match will be meaningless and in the case of google this little match that is the stock split ignited everything now it didn't hurt that the financials the q4 results came out insanely good bidding expectations across the board i think that is what sparked this run but i think mainly it is just the market catching up with how good the company is so first of all let's talk about the fundamentals of this company before we go through the results the q4 results were insanely good we're talking about a company that's probably like as blue chip as they come point 36 less than half a percent of short interest there's literally nobody dumb enough to short this stock in fact i'd love to see who those point 36 percent are i'm assuming these are people who accidentally clicked the button were cleaning the keyboard pe 26 pe 26 for this company this is insane price to sales under 8 7.7 56 gross margin 35 percent ebitda margin i mean these are insane numbers look at their balance sheet 142 billion dollars in cash 30 billion in debt they literally have 5x cash versus debt 75 billion dollars in net income this is net income not revenue net income 75 billion dollars i mean this is as good of a value stock inflation stock growth stock disruptive stock anything this is like in any category you can put the stock in it's going to be insane this is why it's my third biggest position i mean this is kind of you know a no-brainer not to mention the fact that we haven't even mentioned the business side of it which is basically that google is a monopoly in the retail ad space there's nobody that comes close to them i don't know why the ftc haven't really done anything about it i'm assuming at this point it's too late but google has been monopolizing this field for a while now and there's nobody coming close now that's just the fundamentals that helped us say that 22.75 was a cheap price and of course 32 later i think we were right but then again you know it's just a one day spike let's see what happens but i'll tell you in a second i see a huge upside so look at the q4 financials because it was more of this greatness everything got beat eps beat 30.7 versus anticipation of 27.3 75 billion dollars in revenue versus 72 anticipated 32 revenue growth in a covet pandemic cluster freak year i mean 61 billion in revenue just from ads alone i mean do you really think that splitting the stock 20 to 1 so that the stock cost 128 per share really makes that much of a difference if the companies do do no it only makes it different if the company's gold and in this case the combination of these factors and that stock split came right on time i'm not even kidding you now why do I see this company going all the way to 3500 by end of year 2022 which is my new price target because what we're looking at here is a value stock that behaves like a value stock for all intensive purposes with growth that is equivalent of what growth stocks give you anywhere from 30 to 40 percent so if i could tell you you can have a basketball player that can shoot threes like steph curry and dunk like you know lebron james or whoever yeah giannis and tecumpo and can play defense like dennis rodman and can you know play in the post like hakeem alajan this is literally the perfect stock I don't know how much more analogies have in me for this but i mean this is insane their value and the growth stock and probably in the top five in each category i mean this is the scottie pippen michael jordan hybrid of stocks so therefore 3 500 by end of year is a no-brainer a lot of my money is gonna go towards this now let's talk about my money and what i said in my previous video what's going on with the market i just told you yesterday that the stock market is about to go through a bull run of about six months and then a massive fallback and i explain why i'm not going to go through the same explanation again but the question a lot of you ask me well tom does this mean your inflation stock list is meaningless does this mean that now we just go yolo on the market because it's going to go crazy no and i'm going to explain why in a second so let's talk about what's going to happen in the next few months given the fact that i just told you i anticipate a bull run from 4 500 s p to 5 500 and then a pullback of about 30 to 35 40 now i'm not gonna yolo my money into the market based on this anticipation of prediction whatever you want to call it i mean this is not the kind of guy i am because at the end of the day this is just a prediction and a theory and of course it might be wrong i'm not going to gamble my life savings on this theory because i accept my own limitations and the fact that this might be nonsense i'm going to take my 30 which i have sitting on the sideline waiting for the pullback and i'm going to deploy all of it right now in the market 30 of my cash which is sitting on the sideline for a whole lot of time is going to come and participate in the game i'm going to deploy over the next couple weeks into the same stock i absolutely love

Tom Nash,FAMZbejD_2s,2022-01-21T14:52:25Z,Reacting To Alex Karp Latest Interview,Palantir,honestly this was probably the best alex carp slash palantir interviews i have seen in the past year or maybe even ever Alex Carp just did a whole 55-minute interview with Kevin Warsh if you haven't seen it I suggest you do I think there's a lot of value in dedicating a whole hour into watching this video because they break down a lot of the stuff that you're wondering about Palantir that for the first time Alex Carp actually talks about you know slings and errors are interesting like you know we get attack data platform financed by the CIA so you should watch the whole thing the link is going to be below in my description but it's also on Palantir's YouTube channel which you can access quite easily now I care about very specific things when it comes to Palantir so I did watch the whole thing but for me the philosophical debates of how the world is changing macroeconomics in that respect and Palantir's vision that's interesting to hear about but I don't think it has a lot of weight for me as far as the valuation of the company I'm interested in very specific things and as far as those things I think that they did cover three topics where I think that they had a lot of value for me so the first topic was basically the competition he basically said well all of the competition we have right now is not really competing with any of the stuff that we're doing because they're very narrow solutions we're talking about a platform with 400 different solutions that we can offer and while they trying to scale up and offer stuff that are a little bit more than what they can give we're trying to scale down well that's both a shot at them and a in a a and a could be a legitimate critic critical interesting question about Palantir our our products are uh deeper than any other products on the market have an institutional veracity that's differentiated are doing things that are arguably more important I don't think anyone would I don't think that's a really subject debate I do think what is a legitimate question is if a product is uh future oriented and has a pre requires a depth of understanding of the product and or um uh it doesn't inherently map to selling a wrench to a pre-existing technical org will you capture the full value of those products so I think you can ask the critical question of various companies you mentioned to there are many are the products actually thick enough to be valuable You could ask the question of Palantir is it thin enough to be fully monetized and um and I think both questions are legitimate what I would say is our view of Palantir's we're we're very differentiated in building these products before they exist um and uh on the thick part we are without competition so then there's a question of on are we able to supply parts of our product or various products for example products that we're building now products that we have in Foundry to an enterprise that may in fact prefer uh something that fits into their architecture that is thinner um and and that gets into a very legitimate question which is okay forget now it's like is Palantir building the product of the future but willing to supply into the current environment by providing products that are more digestible into a an organization that maybe isn't it wants to go their own way and wants to buy a certain product for a certain thing but does not want to buy all Foundry uh by the way so the answer in the near term has been yes but um in the future we are going to continue to focus very much on what you are calling kind of thick future oriented products because they're differentiated but then as the parts of this product become less differentiated and more for lack of a better word commodity like there's eight companies that supply them figuring out ways to decouple the product and sell these things in a modular way partly because there's an assumption which is just not true that is very intuitive that if you have a full stack product that the sums of the product are less valuable than if they were taken apart i.e that each wrench each part of that product is inferior to a product that's just that product is actually not true at all it's actually the opposite and part of what we will be doing over the next couple years is both continuing to build things that are on not understood sell them to deal with the macro conditions that you have um have outlined that I agree but also um democratizing parts of our product so that people who want a different version of the product can also buy it we're not super ideological there as long as our core mission is to continue to be entrepreneurial outsiders in the product realm which is where again I we would like to continue to stay in a world where we're not competitive I mean our platform is massive and just too thick in his words and what we're working on is basically creating a modularized kind of structure when clients can pick and choose whatever they need from Foundry because Founder is freaking huge and I think that was really interesting because I think in that for the first time he alluded to the fact that they're trying to work out a model where smaller businesses can actually access Palantir and Foundry which has not been possible Palantir has been known to be a government contractor on the Gotham side and they've been known to be a Fortune 500 destination for companies not a lot of small businesses can afford Foundry and most of them don't need like 80 percent of the platform they need very specific things so basically Rxharp talking about it and how they're trying to create like a modular structure when clients can pick and choose the little things they need is a huge huge comment because it actually talks about the fact that in two years Palantir is going to be available as an operating system as a BI system whatever you want to call it for pretty much any business anybody can afford volunteer at a certain configuration whatever it is the little stuff they need and I think there's going to be a massive growth engine I absolutely loved how he actually broke it down I think that was probably for me one of the best pinnacles of the interview I did also like the second part where Kevin Warsh asked them about employee retention at some level all you are is trying to recruit the best talent on the planet and then build a culture so they can do the most incredible things and if I if I've got that right or somewhat right tell me about what that's like today in the world versus four five six by the way it's it's recruit retain and lead without the people feeling like you're a dictator so there is a leadership part it's just very different to begin to answer your question the the way people think so like world-class engineers there's a track is attracting world-class engineers retaining them but retaining them while also um inspiring them maybe to think differently about how they would build a product if you build a product for engineers you have a very interesting product that no one buys i.e where buying is a metaphor for worldly impact so you you you do it is it is it is the the like the the recruitment and retention is a cultural plus in our case track record of doing this uh which is you know unique in in in the world basically in my view and the view of the people that come is commonly known fact that Palantir gets among if not the best software engineers in the world and we've been doing this for a long time and we're still getting the very best in the world so but then there's so there's that but there's also you know if you want you know Foundry to be built or PG to be built or Apollo to be built or or you want to modulate these project products so that you can sell them in different ways you need to you have a high convincing it's not conviction but high convincing culture meaning you're going to have to convince people that are basically not fireable because they know they're the best in the world and they also know unlike most people who evaluate software that the ability to build a product is not is maximally uh unfair in the sense that really only a couple people in the world can build the kind of products we have and so you you have to convince them cajole them uh get inside their thought process to build the product it's not just the one that they might want to build but one that will actually disrupt the world and Alice Carp really broke it down in a way that I didn't really think about it and he said it's not only about retention Kevin it's about recruiting retention and direction without being a dictator which I found fascinating and I could not agree more he basically talked about the fact that hey we got the best talent and I think in the industry in the enterprise software industry in the BI industry everybody knows that Palantir attracts the best talent in the industry it's not only about recruiting the best people because once you recruit them you have to retain them because otherwise they'll leave you know if they get a better offer but even if you recruited them and you managed to retain them you have to be able to rein them in and to get them to do what you need for the business and not to get them to work on their own little manageable side projects that they're interested about that don't have a lot of total addressable market so you have to be able to also direct these people and it's not so easy because we're talking about the top point five percent uh of of these sort of employees in the industry and the way you basically achieve that according to Carp which I found really fascinating how to explain this is basically you can achieve all of these three factors recruit retain and direct without being a dictator without telling people well you're gonna do this because I told you so the way you do it if you convince them that what they're working on is the next big disruptive piece of software it's basically if you do that they'll come they'll stay and they'll do what it takes to make it happen if they're going to be part of that vision and I think what he alluded to as well here is that that's the part of the stock based competition if you give out a lot of stock based compensation and you convince these employees that this is the next you know best enterprise software this is a massive disrupter then you recruit retain and direct without really working too hard on being an and absolutely loved his answer and it now makes a lot of sense for me which it also did before but now it should make a lot of sense to you why stock based compensation was such a huge part of what Palantir is doing now at the end of the interview he took a little shot at Ross Gerber you know slings and errors are interesting like you know we get attack data platform financed by the CIA but I the one of the things I would say is you get the slings and arrows because if the terror attacks had happened uh that uh that our software with the help of uh people using it uh stopped uh you you would not have the slings and arrows actually if this thing's a layer hose often because the situation is good enough you can hate us and we helped make the situation good enough you can hate us and you know it's like maybe that's the price to pay for what many of the things our software does but it is it is an interesting thing that many of the slings and arrows are only the result of a situation that's good enough so you can you know go try to attack the reason why it was reasonably good and he basically Kevin asked him about the criticism that they're getting and he kind of laughed it off yes we're funded by the CIA hardy harhar basically his answer was quite brilliant he basically said well the only reason people like Ross Gerber he didn't name him specifically right but the only people that people are allowed to criticize us and tell us oh you're like the CIA funded company is because we help western governments to allow you the freedoms to criticize us if it didn't help western governments to allow you the freedom to criticize us then you couldn't just look at what's going on in China why don't you try to criticize the CCP while you live in China see what happens and I think that's the best answer right now you can criticize all you want the US there's no other place on earth you want to live in as far as freedom of speech and go to China and try to exercise your freedom of speech see what happens go to Russia and try to exercise your freedom of speech see what happens so this is all fluff by a bunch of people who don't understand what Palantir is and what it isn't and they can keep barking and yapping about how Palantir is funded by the CIA which is completely nonsense by the way and it's their prerogative no problem at all I think you should watch the full interview I think it was brilliant and kudos to Kevin Warsh I think he did the phenomenal work I just want to give him my own highlights I hope this was helpful,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,GAkdcEAG9uc,2022-01-20T14:08:16Z,What's Next For Palantir?,Palantir,in the case of Palantir it's really evident how clear that is now i'm going to answer a simple question in this video is Palantir my biggest failure or is this the beginning of a beautiful friendship between the man and his stock... the question is should Palantir be included in this category or not because that question if answered correctly can make a lot of people a lot of money and can cost a lot of idiots a lot of missed opportunities... now the question is why would Palantir be classified in this if you actually have an idea about the fundamentals this is a company with zero dollars in debt ever since 2021 they are a company that are sitting on 2.5 billion in cash which means they don't need to take leverage or debt which means they're completely insensitive to interest rates whatsoever and this is a company that's about to close this 2021 in a few days at a 1.5 billion dollars revenue with about 400 million in free cash flow people seem to forget that Palantir is operationally profitable for three quarters already people don't understand that stock based computation that brings the actual profitability is not a cash flow item it's an accounting item so Palantir will close this quarter with a 400 million in free cash flow for the year now we're also talking about a company that has some of the richest clients in the business i mean they have government clients massive government clients but also only fortune 500 companies really on its business roster so these are companies that are completely insensitive to marginal price increases due to inflation so a company that has no sensitivity to increased rates and a company that can easily raise their prices with the clientele that they actually work with that doesn't have a lot of competition in fact none and we'll talk about in a second that might change in a few years and doesn't really have to put any money in order to increase the output so they don't have to invest in capex to increase the amount of services they provide because it's a sas business so the question is should a company like that be included in bad growth stocks because i think the disparity here is actually very amusing Palantir the company not Palantir the stock but i think the company had one of the best years in its existence in 2021 and yet Palantir the stock is lagging behind like a piece of fart that everybody just wants to forget about because how embarrassing that was and i think this kind of dissonance if you want to call it or arbitrage whatever you want to name it can create massive opportunities for people who actually understand what Palantir is and what it isn't because what we have with Palantir is a company with eighty percent gross margin yes i just said eighty percent and companies is currently trading at nineteen price to sales and don't forget that this whole narrative of alex carp is now gone because the men finished selling the stocks he needed to exercise the options from 10 years ago so alex carp won't be selling for at least a decade longer stock-based compensation that they gave out to attract some of the best employees in the market which they did is actually down by 40 percent in q3 so stock based comp is coming down alex carp is done selling their margins are phenomenal free cash flow is insane and yet people are talking about how this stock should be avoided at all costs unbelievable and here's the funny part for the past few weeks we had a lot of short sellers jumped the boat we went from three percent short interest to six and a half percent short interest on Palantir so we doubled the amount of short interest in this company and i'm going to enjoy watching these guys get slapped by a rubber band once this thing gets released because with every short selling pressure and you have to understand that the current price is definitely affected by 100 increase in the short interest eventually if the business is good this rubber band will release whether you want to call it short squeeze or whatever it doesn't really matter but they're playing a very dangerous game the short sellers that is and they're going to get shellacked and i'm going to be sitting there with my popcorn and my tea enjoying every goddamn second of it and the 15 question here is how much is Palantir worth even at the most bare case possible because it's not really that difficult to give you the bulk case here and to say well this is a 500 stock so the real question is what if the interest rates actually go up to let's say 10 percent and let's say that Palantir only grows thirty percent per year for the next five years they don't explode out of the stratosphere let's assume they're going to spend 200 million in capex in the next five years let's throw a bunch of bearish assumptions into the model and see in the worst case scenario how much Palantir should be valued at right now so let's do it on the screen right now you're seeing my dcf model for the bare case for Palantir i assumed a 30 annual growth from 1.5 billion onwards for the next five years which is basically the bear case of Palantir if you know the business of this company i assumed an 80 margin on the cost of goods sg a and r d expenses are right here in front of you with a nice little growth every year but i also added some bearish assumptions for example i assume that they will pay 21 nominal tax which is not true companies never pay 21 nominal tax also i've absolute also absolutely ignored any net operating losses they have from former years which they can use for tax credits so i don't think Palantir will pay taxes anytime in the next five years even if they make that money because there is so much accumulated losses over the years but let's assume they pay taxes from the first dollar let's just assume they also have capex expenses of 200 million for the next five years which is again a total insanity and let's assume a 10 weighted average cost of capital let's just say that the interest rates go up to an insane amount giving us a 10 weighted average cost of capital and let's assume a four percent perpetual growth and as you can see right here it's going to give us a nice 44 billion dollars valuation now the company is currently trading at 29.2 billion which means it has a massive upside but hold on a second we still have the ebitda multiple you have to look at the multiples this is a company that should be multiple at 25 but i use 18 just to keep it conservative for no reason other than that and i'm getting 55 billion dollars for that as well i always average them out and if i average them out i'm getting 49.6 and that is a 70 upside right now today and if you want to play around with this model yourself and change the numbers the parameters and see what you get based on this template you can get it on our patreon page it's five bucks per month you'll get this dcf as well as a bunch of others participate in their zoom calls but mainly you know you'll be supporting the channel and i think that's important in itself as well because we don't really try to monetize in any other way besides the patreon page which keeps the lights on i guess so the question is if this company is 70 undervalued right now on the worst bare case possible we just presented to you an insane bearish assumption gives us a 70 upside why are people ignoring this because essentially we have a company here that's just about to give you 1.5 billion in revenue with an extra three billion insecure transactions that they already have lined up so even if they don't sell any more projects they can give you 1.5 billion for the next two years after 2021. nobody of course talking about that a company that just beat their own revenue expectations for q3 instead of 30 44 of course nobody talking about that and don't get me wrong i'm not complaining i don't mind buying a 70 upside stock at 15 and letting everybody just sit around and laugh at me and then we'll see what happens next no problem i also don't understand people who seem to be annoyed by this if you're a Palantir investor and you haven't done margin or you haven't used options you just straight up bought stock you shouldn't be concerned right now you should be just sitting back drinking your tea and enjoying this carnage because you know what's gonna happen after that of course if you use leverage or use options that's a whole different deal but i told you that this is a prime example of

Tom Nash,SRH7De4g05A,2022-01-19T11:49:25Z,CEO of a competing software company puts out ads against Tesla…,Tesla,spent six figures on a new york times ad bashing tesla basically saying do not be a tesla crash test dummy basically going at the full self-driving software of tesla... and then elon musk has had some responses to someone else tweeted that it's so weird that the most vocal critics of full self-driving always have a huge financial interest in a competing solution and musk responded to that indeed... i have no as you guys say i have no financial interest in tesla no short positions puts anything like that my my entire financial uh uh interest in tesla is i own three of them i own three teslas i own two roadsters on a model s um that there's no financial interest if people say you know financial interest it can you say i'm a competitor... are you not a competitor of tesla and he immediately says well no then he goes to the humblebrag which is the rich man's playbook basically saying well i own three teslas hardy har har if you own three tesla's mother lover why the hell are you wasting our time with this... basically by the time he answers the question he goes and actually explains well i provide software that certain competitors of testa are using to build their own full-sip driving and that makes me maybe a competitor but what's better than the competitor to criticize their competition... so the guy owns three teslas and obviously as you can see from his ad he had to rely on old youtube videos of old full self driving just to cheer pick some data to make his point but obviously from the ad you can see he doesn't have full self driving having three teslas and no fsd i mean he's probably just salty he didn't get in and this is his way to backlash... this is what I see here a rich guy too much money to throw around spends six figures on an ad bashing his competitor and doesn't have actual first-hand analysis of the software relying on all the ass youtube videos of previous versions to make his point to cheer pick some data and make them look bad... now this is just another syndrome of the entire mainstream media and the competitors spending so much energy and time trying to bash teslas how much money is being spent so much energy everything is going towards hating tesla however they completely misunderstand how this works if you want to get better if you want to beat the best you got to beat the best so focus on yourself make your own products better why are you spending time and energy and money bashing the competition focus on you... just go to the main page right now there's a front page article saying hedge fund manager tells you to forget about tesla focus on these three cheap evs instead and he names ford and vw so the amount of fud money resources and energy that being invested into bringing down tesla instead of them focusing on themselves it's actually pretty amusing because all elon has to do here is just tweet one meme or one joke and he gets more pr more cloud than any of them combined and he does it with zero effort and zero dollars how about them apples... the problem is once you put out a six-figure ad in the new york times bashing tesla and you're not disclosing that you have relationships with their competitors that means to me you're full of and I'm never going to take you seriously... what it proves to me is that dan o'dowd is trying to protect and save his trash outdated software by bashing the competitors because he can't compete I think that instead of spending six figures on this new york times ad you could have just bought some tesla stock because they're about to take your lunch and your competitor's lunch and put you out of business so might as well invest right a better use of six figures instead of buying that piece of ad you mother,1.0,0.8

Tom Nash,UqFusRjo_XY,2022-01-13T13:10:02Z,Tesla's Fair Value - Overvalued or Undervalued?,Tesla,i want to tell you a story about a tesla a failed smartphone and a deadly vacation and this is not clickbait... elon musk went to work he took over tesla when it was a complete third and he went through multiple potential bankruptcies only to come out as probably the best fastest growing car company that's about to take over the world and i know i know tesla isn't exactly a car company but they're about to take the launch of every single oem at least in the us quite soon now what i want to share with you in this video is my new target price for tesla but as you know in my videos i don't hold you hostage i'm not trying to keep my retention numbers high just so you watch the other video where i'm going to tell you my target price the bottom line always comes first so my bottom line is that my target price is going up to 2500 now before you fall off your seat check this out a year ago when the share price was 400 i said that my target price is 1500 and everybody said i'm crazy now especially wall street analysts who are basically lagging behind always late to the party always unable to truly evaluate potential and growth they almost you know are late by a whole year only now these guys are joining the party at 1200 1300 we've been here all along now there's a good reason why i'm raising my next target price it isn't because of hype it's because of actual fundamentals and numbers which i'm about to share with you check it out but before we do i do want to ask of one thing which is don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing don't do nothing just watch the video i'm trying to sell you jack now when elon musk invested his entire fortune into spacex and eventually tesla i'm sure a lot of smart people told him hey ellen you're being an idiot this isn't the smartest way to invest your money this is a really dumb idea and it's going to basically bankrupt you and those same smart people who told them this out of good intentions i'm sure are the same type of people not saying that they're the identical people but they're the same type of people who are now telling you that tesla at 1500 is way too expensive the tesla is at 2000 is imaginary tesla 2500 is a complete fable those same people who were unable to understand the vision are now saying that tesla is overvalued right now when clearly tesla if you look at 10 years forward is a 5x company i'm not even doubtful about it but you know baby steps let's start with 2500 then we can talk about 5000 in a couple of years but you know it's an easy no-brainer for me to see that path and in this video i want to share a little glimpse of it with you so you can do the same trajectory as i and do your own research and find out now there will be a whole dcf which i did on tesla to reach to my 2500 price. Tesla just released the q4 delivery numbers and there are 934 000 vehicles which is very impressive and a lot higher than anticipations which already are quite inflated about 16 beat which is quite insane but this isn't the whole story the story is that if you look at the december deliveries for china you find out exactly where we're headed just in china the company delivered 70 000 vehicles just in the month of december and if you carve out q4 entire q4 for tesla we're talking about 309 000 vehicles just that alone it means we're on pace as it stands right now without any further capacity at 1.2 million vehicles if we just duplicate these quarters four times now obviously capacity is increasing china is ramping up austin is about to get operational berlin is just starting the operational so i'm thinking that by 2023 we're probably looking at three million vehicles per year which is quite insane but as it stands right now even the 934 000 that they just released it's literally a 90 increase from last year and with the insane increase in capacity as we mentioned with austin with china with berlin there's no reason not to see this ramp up happening in next two years and to see tesla delivering more and more vehicles and you know what happens when tesla delivers more vehicles obviously eventually the share price goes up now that's not always immediate and the share price tends to be volatile for example we just saw the fed come out and be all hawkish sending the share price 200 down but that will happen with a stock like tesla the question is what happens long term over the long run you know when in doubt zoom out and as i mentioned before the latest pullback we just saw was macroeconomic so you had an opportunity to make a lot of money i invested about a thousand bucks i'm sure a lot of you did the same thing and even though this isn't financial advice and i'm not a financial advisor i'm just a guy in it i did this track suit on the internet sharing his opinions which might be an accurate might be wrong might be the rams of a madman i'm just saying that when you have a market pullback like that which is macroeconomic in most it's an opportunity to make money so what i think will happen once the q4 financials come out quite soon well we're probably going to see anywhere from 16 to 18 billion dollars in revenues that is insane now the low end of estimates are talking about 16 the high end is about 18. whether you're in the high or low end these are insane numbers so what i think we'll see because of this recent pullback by the fed and all this microeconomics we'll see probably tesla go to an all-time high as far as share price sometimes after the q4 financials of course there's a lot of profit taking around q4 financials q3 financial so the volatility is there but you know when the dust settles i think that once everything relaxes we'll see an all-time high for the share price right after the q4 financials right in time for us to make money and if that's not enough for you think about these numbers right now tesla holds about two-thirds of the u.s easy market which means they own about 2.6 two and a half percent of the entire auto industry in the U.S. what happens as evs get adopted more and more obviously that's exactly what's going on everywhere especially in the United States you know what's going to happen when the 2.6 of the market share in the us becomes 5 what do you think is going to happen with the share price and of course you will hear a lot of smart people especially wall street analysts who are known to fall asleep at the wheel and let the thing just go past them and be late to the party tell you that this isn't possible that you're overpaying that this is expensive and of course these same people are the same people who miss the boat the first time they don't see that this is just day one they missed it on day zero we're still on day one this is still a 5x multibagger stock but you don't have to do it you do you see you tomorrow,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,0qWstoOPgvo,2022-01-09T22:44:52Z,Cathie Wood Buys MORE Palantir Stock. Again. Here's My Theory Why.,Palantir,hey this is tom and in this video i'll explain to you why kathy wood and arkhanvest just purchased 1.2 million shares of volunteer there's not a lot of secrets here it's a great company but she has a great reason which i'll show you here using a full dcf yes i'm gonna do a full dcf on palantir you'll get to see it step by step because that dcf is basically critical to me showing you why kathy wood loaded the boat on planeteer just last week and she was not the only one a lot of institutional money is flowing into palantiy recently in fact companies like blackrock vanguard a lot of the big hitters are putting more and more money into palantir the institutional holdings of this company have doubled doubled in the past four months and the pace is only getting stronger and stronger now out of those eleven hundred institutional shareholders in poland here you know how many of them are short 22. literally two percent 98 is long two percent the short now that shows you everything nobody in smart money is actually shorting this talk out of this crazy 22. now the real question is why all of this institutional money is flowing in why kathy wood which actually holds about five percent of the institutional float 32 million shares she holds about five percent of the entire 700 million float so the question is what the hell is going on here now in this video i'll show you why using even the most insanely absurd conservative assumptions palantir is still grossly grossly undervalued and why if you're an institutional money with some patients that's a good entry point for you i mean if you look at a company you say well this company is outperforming it's growing nicely the management is good it's getting revenues free cash flow and the stock price just ain't matching up because of different reasons like macroeconomics fear of interest rates or basically you know just general fudd like they had with tesla for a couple of years if that kind of disconnect exists between a share price and a company's performance usually institutionals look for an entry price but because they're patients and because they're not idiots they'll wait for a sweet spot and i think that's what they're seeing right now essentially it's 16 bucks 16 and a half bucks they're basically saying well it's going to be very hard for us to lose money on this talk if we get in at 16 and a half if we have patience because as i'm about to show you right now i mean even with the insanely conservative assumptions that i've used there's still 50 upside from 16 and a half all the way up even if you think the company is total garbage and you know if you have a good deal like that a lot of institutionals will jump on it which is exactly what's going on Let me show you on the computer okay so this is my dcf 2022 2027 five-year dcf revenues are based on a 30 annual growth based on the company's guidance which i think is sandbag i think they're intentionally giving a low estimate of 30 annual growth but will use it just to keep it conservative this is the cost of goods structure for the next five years selling general administrative now if you look at the historical numbers you'll see that this actually is lower than the sgna in 2021 and 2020. the reason is that 2120 was also loaded with sbc stock with computation that kind of artificially inflated sgna and if you look at years without sbc basically before the dpo which by definition created a lot of sbc and before alex carp got his new batch for the next 10 years you see that it's around 700 million so we use 750 and we give it a nice little bump every year also we have r d expenses right here which is in line with what the company is doing and now we can talk about the ebitda so basically the result is this ebitda right here and as you can see right here we use the 21 tax rate now this is insanely conservative over the past five years the company lost a lot of money they've accumulated a lot of losses which they can carry forward to years where they actually have profits because if we add it up we get about 11 and a half billion or 11 billion here a lot of it will be offset against the many many years of losses the company accumulated over the years so not all of this will be paid because as you should know a lot of four words can be done with losses losses can be carried forward to years in which you have gains from previous years in which you lost money and god knows pilate lost a lot of money so this is another ultra-conservative assumption as you can see right here we have capex assumptions of 200 million over the course of the next five years which is again a joke it's insane planeteer is not going to invest half not even one-fourth of this number it's not a company that has a lot of capex i mean it's a software business i mean they don't really invest in buildings and and machinery and stuff like that i mean the expense is basically r d and salaries so this is just a crazy assumptions just to you know go crazy here um a 10 discount rate and as you can see right here at four percent perpetual growth rate right here and at this point you should also pay attention to this number below the net debt is 2.2 billion a lot of cash very low debt as you remember this was intentional by the company and if you calculate all of this you get two numbers the dcf value is 44 billion and the ebitda multiple which should be 25 we used 18 here just to be conservative will give you a nice 55.1 the average will give you 49.6 which is 49.57 higher than the current price of 33 billion and 200 which the company is currently trading it so even if you apply the most conservative assumptions in history completely go ballistic on this company it still has 50 it's pretty much free money for these institutionals and they're literally picking it up from the ground and you'd be shocked how simple the formula for this is basically great company panic selling equals money simple as that now all of these institutionals will be quietly buying as the price is dipping all the real investors gonna be shaking their balls gonna be shaking their arms gonna be shaking they'll be paper handing out of the stock while these guys quietly move in this is exactly what's going on here but then again not everybody is built for a two three four year holding period even though they say they are i mean this is what the stock requires if you don't have the stomach for a couple of years of losses because virtually stay away from this,1.0,0.9

Tom Nash,bKyq4vw9Tac,2022-01-03T23:16:16Z,Tesla Stock: what to expect in 2022,Tesla,tesla just had one of the craziest single day runs we've ever seen it pull off 14 for this company in a single day who could have seen this coming oh who tom maybe some guy who posted the video five days ago saying ellen just sent tesla's stock to the moon now jokes aside and that's not a joke actually i did put out that video tesla just had an incredible run coming off of insane delivery numbers they broke their own records they shattered expectations they went from 500 000 vehicles last year to 936 000 in a single year in a covered year supply chain shortages no chips everybody's struggling and yet they've almost doubled production and deliveries nobody knows how these guys do it but they get done now despite everything i just told you tesla is still grossly misunderstood and grossly undervalued by mainstream media wall street and a lot of retail investors because i think tesla is about to have a breakout year in 2022 and i think a lot of people again will miss it and i'm not talking about gordon johnson i'm assuming this guy will be serving fries and burgers by the end of this year at a mcdonald's 93 price target my guy really i'm talking about everyday investors and wall street which completely misunderstand how insane this is about to get now we talked about tesla being a 1500 stock when it was 400. now slowly but surely every single one of the big shops joined us we got now everybody at 1500 sitting nice and tight but we have been there since 400 so you know welcome aboard step right in now i'm going to tell you why i think 1500 is not going to be enough i'm not going to change my target price today but i have a theory that 1500 is just going to be a stop in the road on the way to greatness they're about to be the biggest meanest baddest not an auto company ever so check this out my estimates for 2022 as far as deliveries was 1.5 million cars i said it before these deliveries certain people agreed with me but a lot of people called me crazy because i also said they'll do 1.5 with ease 2022 and a lot of people criticize me for saying that now those same people are gone now after what happened but the real question is i mean even if wall street adjusts they're probably going to go up to 1.5 like i did and i'm going to go way higher than this i'm going to tell you that given what we just saw i think tesla potentially can get to 2 all the way to three million vehicles delivered in the next two years and i'm going to tell you exactly how this is going to happen but regardless of that path i think 2022 is going to be an insane year for tesla because of inflation in fact i think they're probably a company that's going to enjoy the inflationary pressures more than anybody else because they're going to see the competition crumble and they're going to be basically increasing capacity getting more sales and completely not cutting into their margins i'm going to talk about that in a second so check this out basically right now we have 936 vehicles coming out so let's say a million now factor in berlin and austin that's another two million vehicles in the next two years the pace isn't going to be a fixed rate it's probably going to be a little bit on the exponential side but let's say there's another 2 million in capacity so probably 1.5 and that's a conservative estimate for next year and probably 2.5 to 3 million in the year after that now a lot of people who thought that 1.5 is an outlandish number now we'll have to admit that 1.5 million for 2022 is a conservative number and that's fine but here's the kicker here this year is going to be extremely inflationary and if you really honest with yourself 2023 is probably also going to be insanely inflationary so this is going to separate the boys from the men the strong companies from the weak ass companies and let me tell you exactly what's going to happen the companies with high margins the companies that can raise prices and not lose demand the companies with low debt and high cash and the companies that can increase production capacity without spending capex are going to do phenomenally better than anybody else in the market and if you listen carefully i just described to you tesla because the margins are getting better and i'm going to talk about in a second but their margins are already a very nice place but just forget the margins let's talk about price sensitivity which is none in tesla they've already raised prices the waiting list have not become shorter and i'm assuming they'll do a few more price increases just to keep up with inflation because as you know in inflationary times cost of capital goes up cost of goods goes up cost of production goes up and they'll roll it over to the customers which will gladly pay because this is superior product now they've been telling us the germans are coming for the past five years i'm assuming they'll keep telling us while tesla keeps killing it so their customer base isn't price sensitive so price increases are definitely not going to impact demand also they have two more million capacity already in place with berlin than austin which will cost them zero dollars to actually get rolling because they've already invested this money when cost of capital was cheap they've completely reduced debt they've been really busy repaying their debts and if you actually understand the tesla model you understand that the fremont factory is probably a dinosaur at this point because their gross margins on those cars from fremont is somewhere in the vicinity of 20 now the gross margins of the cars are going to be coming out out of china out of austin out of berlin is about 40 so if i'm correct in q4 numbers that are going to come out within a few weeks i hope in the financials we'll see a spike or at least a significant increase in gross margins because more cars are coming out out of china which has better margins in fremont it's a modernized factory which basically you know it's easier cheaper and faster to build in a modern dedicated factory cars than in fremont which is a converted place they kind of you know half-assed just to get things started now when austin and berlin join they give you the same amount of gross profit which is about 40 gross margin now those extra 2 million vehicles is not just extra 2 million vehicles they're an extra 2 million vehicles over the next 24 months which are coming with a 40 gross margin again in inflation times these high margins are everything you need to survive because that basically gives you the cushion now whether you think inflation is going to be horrible whether it's not going to happen tesla is going to kill it but if you add in tesla taking lunch from the auto manufacturers and inflation basically pushing on everybody else but the companies who prepared for this which is tesla it's an insane setup i think we're going to hit my target price of 1500 quite soon and i think we'll have to reevaluate the company in 2022 i believe in the first half and then um again we're going to be ahead of the pack going at a higher price and then everybody will catch up and still to this day i don't understand how people just see money lying on the ground completely ignore it and just keep walking this is literally what's going on when you don't invest in tesla but again just my opinion might be inaccurate might be wrong might be the ramblings of a madman you know might be you know completely nonsense you have to do research i'm not a financial analyst i'm not a financial advisor just sharing with you my opinion i'm a guy on the internet with a sweater you know it is what it is as always huge shout out to the

Tom Nash,LoLak72tMnM,2022-01-01T22:47:15Z,"Ross Gerber: ""Palantir is LITERALLY the Worst Company in The World""",Palantir,palantir literally the worst company in the world literally as bad as nazi soldiers helping trump get elected that's the whole reason they were established selling your personal information to the highest bidder now imagine my surprise waking up finding out that rose gerber went to the dave lee podcast and talked briefly about palantir and in those five minutes he managed to spew so much nonsense i honestly don't know where to begin now unfortunately even though i like ross a lot and i don't want to do this to him but i'm about to knock you out i mean when you say things like that i mean where was your research i mean that's easily verifiable so let's start with the basic facts here is palantir literally the worst company in the world i don't know i don't think so personally but you may think that but let's talk about things you can check so first of all his claim was that palantir was established to get trump elected only problem is palantir was established 13 years before trump ran for presidency which means they either anticipated him running 13 years ahead of time which means they have an amazing software or that's absolutely false you get to decide which i think it's quite obvious and the second point that was brought up in the discussion is the dilution matter now this is a well-known thought about palantir and i think it could be easily avoided just by people checking data and facts now ross my guy i expected a little bit more from you now as far as dilution goes you should know this but the share count of palantir has not changed since the dpo so when the company went public they had 2.1 i think 2.15 billion shares that has not changed the reason is because when you go public and again this is a little bit disappointing because i expected him to know this especially with him being very bullish on tesla and with everything that just went on with elon basically exercising options selling stock to pay for those options but i don't remember if i ever heard ross gerber say that elon musk doesn't care about the shareholders they literally did the you know the identical thing the same thing exercise options that were given a long ass time ago sell some stock to pay for these options and move on but in the case of of tesla it's kind of a selective a little bit of a selective analysis right when alec tarp does the same thing as elon he gets called out by ross which again is something i don't understand now alex carp much like elon was granted about i think 70 million shares of volunteer when they were pretty much worthless in 2010 and 2011 exactly like elon with his batch of options now over the years i mean he spent a good decade basically building up the company and making it into what it is today these options are expiring on december 3rd so they've already expired my guy so this whole past year was basically him getting to the point where the options are about to be worthless now ellen's options are actually expiring on august next year and him selling right now is okay but alex harp literally sold the minute before the options were expiring and that somehow is wrong so basically what happens when you exercise options and in the case of alex harp he had no choice but to exercise because they were about to expire when you access options you're paying tax and quite a hefty one about 50 even though you're actually spending money to purchase these options you're not getting any money and now you're on the hook for basically the fair market value of the stock times your tax bracket which is you know as i said roughly 50 so you have to come up with this money somewhere it's a lot of money we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars so basically what alex carp did is the same thing that ellen did submit 10b 5-1 plans sell every time he exercises sell exactly have to pay for the tax and nothing more and yet in the case of palantir this is fud in the case of tesla somehow nobody brings it up i honestly expected a little bit more i guess fairness from ross or to be a little bit more educated about basic things because i don't know what's worse he either did not understand that or he knows and yet he's being very selective about his analysis of volunteer versus tesla again not my place to judge i fully respect the guy but i just i expect it more now i do want to talk about the stuff that really i think irked a lot of people from the palantir community it is essentially the whole private information so he basically called them merchants of private information to the highest bidder yeah it's literally you know against what they stand for that is why they left silicon valley because and they're they're feud with the facebooks and the googles and and the apples is the fact they do not collect personal data in fact palantir have been on record multiple times unless you think they're lying which would be quite easy to expose because they have so many clients working with these products basically palantir have been on record multiple times saying hey we don't collect personal information we don't sell personal information and we don't move information from one client to another we have no use for personal information we don't even use it to train our ai systems we look at big chunks of data and we analyze it on the macro level to help the organization make better decisions case in point what they did with airbus the foundry platform takes all the data from all the planes flying around and basically helps guys like maintenance workers to preemptively perform a sort of little maintenance on the plane to prevent a big breakdown of the engine or for example if they want to optimize scheduling so they look at how many flights went on time how many not on time they don't look at specific john does or john smith's or whatever that went on board and where they're going and where they're headed it's meaningless to them it's pointless if you understand the platform you understand that personal personal and specific information is meaningless in the system they're looking for predictive mechanisms based on big movements of data and how things work on the macro level why would they why would they care about personal information not to mention the fact that i mean i wish they would have sold personal information like apple and facebook google they would have had 10x more revenue if they did that i mean that's probably one of the reasons that's holding them back a little bit because they won't do it and the sad part is i think a lot of people will miss out on palantir because this sort of fun seems to be very effective now i don't mind i know that the share price will catch up with the quality of the company and i'm happy to buy more at the reasonable price but i think a lot of people are missing out on volunteer because they hear guys like ross and other people basically spreading this fud about the company i don't know if it's intentional or not it's not of my business i'm just here to set the record straight about all of the issues that were brought up if you enjoyed this video please let me know below also as always don't click nothing don't smash nothing don't buy nothing i'm just here to give you the information
