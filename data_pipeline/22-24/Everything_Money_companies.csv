Everything Money,zERf0w6frYw,2024-09-26T09:55:00Z,What No One Tells You About A.I. Investing,Tesla,remember electric electric vehicles remember how everybody thought I was so negative about them they said that's the future this only three years ago and I said ignore ignore ignore ignore ignore how many of those companies are doing well today Tesla isn't even at its all-time highs it is still 40 and at one point it was 75% below its all-time high and has not reached the all-time high almost three years ago that's my plan my plan is to wait because eventually the AI boom will lose its luster and there'll still be major profit in those companies but people won't pay the premium for it so I'll wait till it's died down a little bit that's the best way to do it in my opinion that's the plan that makes the most sense to me,1.0,-0.4
Everything Money,zERf0w6frYw,2024-09-26T09:55:00Z,What No One Tells You About A.I. Investing,QQQ,another plan that I even will do was I will wait until QQQ and the NASDAQ is selling for much lower value valuation numbers and start dollar costing in there why because it's much easier to buy an ETF and let the natural companies go in and out now are you going to make the 700 800 900% profit in one year no but if you look at history and you look at buying QQQ when valuations are low it can far outpace the S&P 500 returns you just got to be a little patient and also diligent because remember the 100 companies in the NASDAQ that are top ones probably aren't going away way when the valuations drop significantly and price drops significantly I want you to be the kind of person who doesn't have the fear doesn't have the can sit there and look at ETF and say this Market's not going away let me buy the top hundred companies at once and overall probably do better than the market,1.0,0.8

Everything Money,_Y9MWPSjivk,2024-09-03T09:55:00Z,If Chiptole Does this...I'm Buying Their Stock,Chipotle,"Chipotle stock has always had my attention the reason being I love Chipotle nothing made me happier I live in Northeast Ohio when I had three chipot within 15 minutes of me I loved it because I thought to myself great now I don't have to be embarrassed when I go there two or three times a day that is a fact I used to do that they also just had a historic stock split of 50 to1 their stock since then has dropped 15% and Starbucks just stole their CEO by paying him $13 million to move companies there is one major issue that chipotle has that concerns me and could affect their future growth and it concerns me as a consumer I'm going to go over all the reasons why the stock is or is not worth a buy spoiler alert I'm buying Chipotle in this very video now guys Chipotle is currently at $53 a share after the 5 for one stock split so it's equivalent to having 2650 share price today now remember stock splits don't mean the stock is cheaper it is not cheaper there's nothing about value in a stock split whatsoever Mo all-time high $69 a share the equivalent of 3 20 of sorry 3500 just back in June yeah just back in June right before the day of the split actually I think that was the actual day of the split was June 18th okay decent return invested Capital 11 a half% Over The Last 5 Years 16% last year company has grown tremendously but look at this Mo look at this price of free cash flow 57 53 5year of 87 and 91 on earnings profit margin a lot higher in the last 12 months than the fiveyear average that's great gross margin 27% Revenue growth huge why because they're opening more locations guys in 2018 Chipotle had 2400 stores or so I believe and now in 2023 it's drown 40% I think it has 3,400 stores that's a lot 3440 3440 that's a lot lot of stores now for me personally Mo when I go to chipot when you go to Chipotle first off one thing I never do I never order online I always order online and how much do you get jipped off in those portion sizes because I don't like walking through the line what does that even mean because it's that place is made for automation to me the automation is for the portion sizes I've always ever since day one I remember walking in and going like I knew certain P certain employees at certain locations did a better job with portion sizes and is inconsistent I feel like it's inconsistent even in person that's my problem with chipot you're right but let me ask you a question if you don't have the pressure of somebody sitting in front of you saying give me chicken what are you gonna do I guess I've never really had problems online you're a liar that's 100% not true consistent in person as it is 100% false by the way the only thing you're right it's more consistent over online because you get ripped off every single time at least in person you can sometimes be like well it might be more but it might be disproportionate food man sometimes I look at you know good friend of ours Darnell he'll sit there and go that's not 4 ounces like he will literally look at some go that's not 4 ounces this place is made for automation I know 100% I agree with you yeah that's what this new CEO should do well what they need is I think they need the spoons to have just be like measuring measuring cups yeah that's it it's like the measuring just boom there there's your there's your size yeah that's it yeah I to me that's the biggest issue the other thing is I do think the in the in restaurant experience has really plummeted I love the fact that lines aren anymore because so many people do online but the in restaurant experience has just plummeted remember that one we went to the other day the Indians game how messy it was inside oh my gosh it was a disaster it was a disaster yeah all right now Chipotle has said they're committing $50 million to fixing this whole portion size problem and they can easily afford that because look at their free cash flow last year 1.3 billion in the fiveyear average of $856 million with how much I go to Chipotle and mo goes to Chipotle it actually does bother us now this is obviously you know great problems to have as a human being let's just go to Chipotle right now test it out all right let's go to really test Chipotle's portion control I decided to buy the same bowl at three different locations here in Northeast Ohio rexville Independence and feron the bowl consisted of white rice chicken fajita vegetables mild salsa corn salsa and cheese no modifications I could not believe the results the smallest Bowl weighed in at 17.6 oz in Falon the second highest was 20.9 2 oz at Brecksville and the heaviest was Independence at 21.16 o all three had an average of 19.9 Oz but the biggest surprise that came to us was the disparity between the smallest and the heaviest Bulls so we reached out to some of our fellow YouTubers as well as our community members across the country to determine just how consistent Chipotle is and here here is what we found out as you can see our lightest Bowl was a poultry 17.39% see an increase in customer satisfaction and same store sales thank you to everyone who responded and helped us gather the data for this video told you I was going to buy Chipotle now guys. so Mo eight pillars great eight pillars there's six of them except for valuation valuation and the good news is Mo they haven't been buying back a lot of shares that's a good thing you know even though this is a check mark it's one of the few check marks that actually goes well it depends if this company was 10 times higher in price I'd be like hang on a second we don't want them buying back any shares uh let's see what analysts are saying doubling their oh my God doubling their profit in the next five four years wow even the revenue growth is huge the revenue growth is double digits low to Middle double digits all day profit growth 20 plus per. guys this is a premium company that deserves a premium this is why the whole portion size and the whole restaurant experience bothers me so much because I look at dirty restaurants I look at you know Annoying workers behind like you know kind of like there's very few of them that have great workers now right yeah the one in brex I think has phenomenal workers oh really that one except for my one incident but yes they have phenomenal workers over there even the one on 18 but there's other ones we know that's gonna be a bad one yeah all right so let's go stock analyzer tool and check out Chipotle I know the last time I did this one just because it's been so far out of re all right so I did a 10e analysis I did 59 and 13% that might be way too low especially the way analysts believe it's going so let's do this Mo I'm going to do six okay 11 and 16 okay profit margin I'm doing eight 10 and 12 they just did 133% last year right and free cash flow is a record of 12% what should I do here Mo I would increase it a little bit should you should I on the high side if the if the revenue growth is so high let's do this let's do do 8 10 and 14 so I'm going to deviate from my usual you know doing splits in the middle and making it even so I'm going to keep the 8 and10 and I'm going to go to 14 on the high side okay PE I did 18 21 and 24 I think that's fair it's currently at 52 PE 57 price fre CH cash flow and my desired return of 9% per year this is intrinsic value this has no margin of safety but remember guys if you're in the community you need to put margin of safety in here because the future is unknown and we're humans and we make mistakes ecoli Could Happen ecoli by the way you you joke about that that's exactly it I went on Facebook and actually wrote I'd rather have ecoli than not have Chipotle that was one of my I thought my best posts ever you would got burrito bucks for Life first off I wanted I wanted ecoi because I want to do was Sue Chipotle and say here's our settlement I want Chipotle for Life once a day I can have it for free random things can happen these things do happen so hit the analyze button boom I got a low price of $13 a share high price of 62 middle price of 27 guys it's just too expensive for me I got to be patient I'm waiting I have it in my watch list at $25 a share I'm probably going to increase it to 30 that way I can start selling puts at lower prices now guys you've heard me I go to Chipotle so much I'm separating the company from the stock price I love Chipotle I love the food even with bad experiences lately I still love the food and go there every single day I'm avoiding the stock right now because it's not at my right price I increase my watch list to 30 bucks a share",1.0,0.3
Everything Money,_Y9MWPSjivk,2024-09-03T09:55:00Z,If Chiptole Does this...I'm Buying Their Stock,Starbucks,Starbucks just stole their CEO by paying him $13 million to move companies,0.9,0.0
Everything Money,jIW8b5FRDpE,2024-07-10T09:55:00Z,Tesla Stock Is Up 51% In 30 Days...Why?,Tesla,"guys Tesla is up 51% in the last one month that is right 51% when I see Twitter back to talking about how these are the stocks you own forever and Tesla's one of them again after we had the flip Mo what was it before before when when Tesla was at 4:15 two and a half years ago it was Tesla stocked forever then what happened then uh Elon went to buy Twitter now X if I remember correctly correct um um there's a lot of news that drove this stock around yep and news nothing fundamental no that's right fact everything fundamental is getting better and better and better at 4:15 to now 262 revenues almost doubled up almost 100% yeah I'd like to just show two are you talking about 2021 yeah the peak of 414 which was on yep November 4th 2021 53.82 billion in Revenue in 2021 the last 12 months last 12 months 94.7 billion guys it's like 90% increase in Revenue this is proof absolute proof that news follows a stock price I've said before I'll say it again there will be a time when people say you're stupid to own Tesla that all the Bulls who sit there and say I love Tesla I would never sell Tesla will have their reason for selling Tesla Tesla will be a much better company in the future than it is today when everybody's saying you got to own Tesla forever and that's the beauty of of investing it's the emotional part emotion drives investing what I'm trying to teach is this process of looking at it and saying wait a second if the fundamentals are getting better and it made sense at X price and now the price has fallen why would I not buy more but what usually happens out there and what's going to make you different as an investor is you're going to realize that this is just a ticker price what matters is the fundamentals of the company the revenue the profit and as long as the revenue and profit are growing and the business is getting better as the stock Falls you should want more of it now making the initial purchase is important because you have to sit there and realize that every investment's the present value evolve future cash flow and now Mo on that very same Twitter I'm getting people saying Paul you don't understand the power of this company being a tech company FSD is huge now FSD is huge for those you don't know that's full self-driving and they're charging currently $99 per month well what do you think the gross margin is on this night by the way gross margin means for every doll every unit they sell how much of this is profit before overhead and all that stuff 70% I would guess it's 70 or 80% let's call it 75% so every extra unit they sell they're getting $75 probably per month in extra added profit okay so times 12 months equals $900 per year in extra cash flow all right so every extra unit they sell if you apply a 20 multiple to this it adds $188,000 in market cap right so we had $75 month in profit times 12 months 900 bucks times 20 PE equals $188,000 in value for every time they sell a unit now to generate the Kathy Wood idea of trillions of dollars in value driven by their technology right now they're 500 no they're more than that 700 billion dollar company let's call it one trillion 900 900 3 billion I'm sorry so one trillion dollar market cap to get to5 trillion that's $ trillion do in value divide that by the 18,000 per car they sell FSD on What's the total value they have to be in 222 million cars jeez oh man okay before I get into how reasonable this number is I just want you to understand this this is very very important for understanding investment the story about FSD is wonderful the story about Tesla is wonderful I'm not against Tesla I have a cyber truck on order I had a model X plaid I'm not against Tesla I love Tesla I think Elon Musk is brilliant but I separate stock from the from the actual company I don't know where Tesla stock is going in the next few months I don't know where it's going in the future my job here what I'm trying to teach you is that you have to look at Tesla and say can I pay a reasonable price for the company today that makes sense on this company I'm only focusing on FSD Mo 50 million cars a year are sold worldwide okay now remember our goal is to sell is to have 222 million cars actively buying FSD there are 283.15 a year on F SD so that's the issue here guys we're in the US where the average car is like 40 the average new car is like $40,000 okay in the US we sell 15 call it 20 million new cars a year I don't think it's t 20 million but it's called it 20 million that means it would take 11 years of 100% of the cars on brand new cars selling let me said there say well Paul some people are going to buy for their you I get it it was all brand new cars because Buick just sign a deal with Tesla about putting they they're talking about it it's very close in talks about putting FSD in their cars wonderful but it has to be put into there I don't know what the other technology will be but let's assume every single car for the next 11 years they'd finally get there that 220 sorry it was 50 million cars not $50 million this is what I'm looking at going it's going to take 11 years to get that covered assuming that every single car correct it's like best case scenario now if 50 million cars are sold worldwide let's say 25% of them which is an egregious amount a percent by this 12.5 million what are we at 18 years or so of cars before they get there my point about this isn't to say it's going to take longer my point is to say it's probably not likely and in that time what's going to happen with technology are other people going to come out with other versions of FSD maybe maybe not there was map quest for a long time then it was Google Maps and now it's Apple Maps right I look at the saying guys FSD has a great future but to just add $1 billion doll in free cash flow to to to Tesla one billion in free cash flow would be20 billion in value at a 20 PE times 20 remember $188,000 per car in value it takes 1.1 million cars having the software 1.1 million why do I keep putting dollar signs here I'm so used to it guys this year they're hoping toell 1.8 million cars now is there a lot of growth potential in this absolutely but remember people said before Oh Tesla's going to grow like guys they're struggling to even hit this 1.8 million the stock is up a ton and guess what happened they missed their deliveries they didn't even hit their deliveries guys this 51% run up is a combination of many things I think one of them is short sellers having to bail now maybe I'm wrong because now I read today like short selling has gone up to 3.7% of shares outstanding are now short on Tesla wow the point I'm trying to make about all this data is guys there's a great story but as professor aswa says a story without numbers is a fairy tale numbers without a story is an Excel sheet you got to couple them together the story of FSD is a wonderful story it's a great story the numbers on FSD not so much and how much is the FSD price Fallen oh yeah it used to be what $12,000,000 then it dropped it was a one time 12000 y then it dropped to 10 then it dropped to 999 bucks a month I I don't know guys the same point like I probably if if the software wasn't perfect I probably wouldn't pay $99 a month even if I had a Tesla but look at this this is just autopilot this is not even full self-driving Tesla vehicles using autopilot technology look at how many millions of miles driven per accident it's only gotten better 7.63 million miles driven before an accident when the US average is 6 670,000 miles this is 12 times safer now I also saw some other report that said Tesla's had the most accidents from November 2022 to November 2023 I don't know what that was about but this is a report here and it says Tesla vehicle is not using autopilot it was still better by 50% than the US average but how much better using autopilot guys the autopilot the full self driving it is absolutely awesome I love hearing about it is a great tool but don't overpay for that now guys this is exactly how our community talks about stocks it is not just a ticker price we have to look Way Beyond the ticker price there is something behind that price there's a value and our goal and the goal I'm trying to teach here is whatever you're looking investing in I want you to have a new way of thinking and that way of thinking is there's a value and there's a price I want to buy when value is significantly higher than prices and that's why this whole entire software is made but if you watched our channel before you've probably noticed that we have limited daily spots for this community and software and the reason for that is because the software as it exists today includes everything we have to offer for stocks retirement in real estate as you can tell from all these tools up here it helps you in all those areas now we are making some changes behind the scenes so that in the near future that offer is going away as we've been getting feedback from our community members people have expressed that they want us to focus on specific aspects of everything money for them they want to focus on what applies to them in that moment they don't want to have too many options like the Cheesecake Factory they want to say this is what I'm focused on right now so if you've been watching for a while you'll remember that I built this software selfishly for myself that's how the software started people ask how do I get that software and it was always built for my team and I so we could use it to constantly make the right decisions for Real Estate stocks and retirement but as the channel is grown and our community is grown it obviously has to become a lot less about me and more about how I can can better serve you and the community members so the good news is we have not made those changes yet so if you go there today and join you'll be grandfathered in for life with all of these tools 100% of them you'll get them for life no matter what and I'm telling this now because you still have that time so go click at the link below before we make these changes go do it right now if you sign up today you'll be able to keep all the tools even after we make those changes and trust me this will be the best decision you've made all here that is what's key about investing with like-minded people there are people in our community who absolutely love Tesla and think it's awesome and I would tell people out there if you own Tesla stock and bought it real cheap it's hard to decide should you stay in or stay out is there a lot of potential for Tesla of course but right now the numbers look like a car company 95 billion in Revenue $13 billion in profit it's better than the average car company don't get me wrong but you have to sit there and realize that over 90% of its Revenue comes from I think it was 83 84% Mo remember we did the numbers like wait a second the other services included like used car sales and I was like wait a second it's like 90% plus cars guys if I'm a high school athlete and I'm a top prospect I'm not a professional athlete yet don't pay me professional athlete money let Tesla become the software business that you think they're going to become valued in there you have to account for that but remember you got to sit there and put some sort of value to that future and the chance of it happening so let's see what analysts are saying about this Mo do you see this big time growth in EPS according analysts almost tripling oh yeah I was surprised to see this a drop this year of 20% but going to $743 in the next four or five years Revenue doubling revenue dou from 100 to 28 billion you know what the interesting part is Mo if this 28 billion was all software and there were like Microsoft that had 30% bottom line it'd be a $60 billion business which is 15 PE and today's numbers guys that's what I mean people are overpaying for the future they're overpaying for the future the average car company sells for between 0.5 and one times Revenue Tesla's currently selling for almost 10 times Revenue this is Microsoft money Microsoft's like 13 but fair value is probably around 10 times revenue or something lower than that people are valuing this as a software company 100% without a car component if you don't agree with me that it's a car component company I don't to tell you if you used to think that and go wait a second those numbers are adding up I think there's hope for you I do think there's value to Tesla being a software business the question is what's that value so that's when you pull up stock analyzer tool Mo I'm Gna pull up the last time I did Tesla so I remember when I did this one and I did a a low middle and a ridiculous high so we can go through that if you want Oh Revenue growth same numbers 720 and 60% Revenue growth by the way only did five years though profit margin 820 and 35 this makes it more software like yep right so we're sitting there saying listen they crush it next five years and guys they're not going to have this kind of profit margin 20% re I mean I don't well maybe it will next five years maybe it will PE I did 18 25 and 30 what about you I did the same numbers okay and a 9% desire return because that's the market return 9 or 10% let's put what's the market value but remember you need to have a higher when you're doing this s from the software you need to put a higher desired return for a larger margin of safety you need margin of safety because the future is unknown and we're humans we make mistake you've got to be able to sit there and factor in what mistakes am I making in all of these assumptions You are making mistakes we are I am I'm making a ton of mistakes the question is what's my margin of safety but here's what's interesting let's hit the analyze button by the way the fiveyear analysis was for Kathy Wood's 2030 prediction correct guys 4 on the low side 2,000 on the high side with 60% Revenue growth 247 in the middle so if you want to see my reaction video to Kathy Woods egregious price target for Tesla watch this next video thank you for your time",1.0,-0.3

investing it's the emotional part emotion drives investing what I'm trying to teach is this process of looking at it and saying wait a second if the fundamentals are getting better and it made sense at X price and now the price has fallen why would I not buy more but what usually happens out there and what's going to make you different as an investor is you're going to realize that this is just a ticker price what matters is the fundamentals of the company the revenue the profit and as long as the revenue and profit are growing and the business is getting better as the stock Falls you should want more of it now making the initial purchase is important because you have to sit there and realize that every investment's the present value evolve future cash flow and now Mo on that very same Twitter I'm getting people saying Paul you don't understand the power of this company being a tech company FSD is huge now FSD is huge for those you don't know that's full self-driving and they're charging currently $99 per month well what do you think the gross margin is on this night by the way gross margin means for every doll every unit they sell how much of this is profit before overhead and all that stuff 70% I would guess it's 70 or 80% let's call it 75% so every extra unit they sell they're getting $75 probably per month in extra added profit okay so times 12 months equals $900 per year in extra cash flow all right so every extra unit they sell if you apply a 20 multiple to this it adds $188,000 in market cap right so we had $75 month in profit times 12 months 900 bucks times 20 PE equals $188,000 in value for every time they sell a unit now to generate the Kathy Wood idea of trillions of dollars in value driven by their technology right now they're 500 no they're more than that 700 billion dollar company let's call it one trillion 900 900 3 billion I'm sorry so one trillion dollar market cap to get to5 trillion that's $ trillion do in value divide that by the 18,000 per car they sell FSD on What's the total value they have to be in 222 million cars jeez oh man okay before I get into how reasonable this number is I just want you to understand this this is very very important for understanding investment the story about FSD is wonderful the story about Tesla is wonderful I'm not against Tesla I have a cyber truck on order I had a model X plaid I'm not against Tesla I love Tesla I think Elon Musk is brilliant but I separate stock from the from the actual company I don't know where Tesla stock is going in the next few months I don't know where it's going in the future my job here what I'm trying to teach you is that you have to look at Tesla and say can I pay a reasonable price for the company today that makes sense on this company I'm only focusing on FSD Mo 50 million cars a year are sold worldwide okay now remember our goal is to sell is to have 222 million cars actively buying FSD there are 283.15 a year on F SD so that's the issue here guys we're in the US where the average car is like 40 the average new car is like $40,000 okay in the US we sell 15 call it 20 million new cars a year I don't think it's t 20 million but it's called it 20 million that means it would take 11 years of 100% of the cars on brand new cars selling let me said there say well Paul some people are going to buy for their you I get it it was all brand new cars because Buick just sign a deal with Tesla about putting they they're talking about it it's very close in talks about putting FSD in their cars wonderful but it has to be put into there I don't know what the other technology will be but let's assume every single car for the next 11 years they'd finally get there that 220 sorry it was 50 million cars not $50 million this is what I'm looking at going it's going to take 11 years to get that covered assuming that every single car correct it's like best case scenario now if 50 million cars are sold worldwide let's say 25% of them which is an egregious amount a percent by this 12.5 million what are we at 18 years or so of cars before they get there my point about this isn't to say it's going to take longer my point is to say it's probably not likely and in that time what's going to happen with technology are other people going to come out with other versions of FSD maybe maybe not there was map quest for a long time then it was Google Maps and now it's Apple Maps right I look at the saying guys FSD has a great future but to just add $1 billion doll in free cash flow to to to Tesla one billion in free cash flow would be20 billion in value at a 20 PE times 20 remember $188,000 per car in value it takes 1.1 million cars having the software 1.1 million why do I keep putting dollar signs here I'm so used to it guys this year they're hoping toell 1.8 million cars now is there a lot of growth potential in this absolutely but remember people said before Oh Tesla's going to grow like guys they're struggling to even hit this 1.8 million the stock is up a ton and guess what happened they missed their deliveries they didn't even hit their deliveries guys this 51% run up is a combination of many things I think one of them is short sellers having to bail now maybe I'm wrong because now I read today like short selling has gone up to 3.7% of shares outstanding are now short on Tesla wow the point I'm trying to make about all this data is guys there's a great story but as professor aswa says a story without numbers is a fairy tale numbers without a story is an Excel sheet you got to couple them together the story of FSD is a wonderful story it's a great story the numbers on FSD not so much and how much is the FSD price Fallen oh yeah it used to be what $12,000,000 then it dropped it was a one time 12000 y then it dropped to 10 then it dropped to 999 bucks a month I I don't know guys the same point like I probably if if the software wasn't perfect I probably wouldn't pay $99 a month even if I had a Tesla but look at this this is just autopilot this is not even full self-driving Tesla vehicles using autopilot technology look at how many millions of miles driven per accident it's only gotten better 7.63 million miles driven before an accident when the US average is 6 670,000 miles this is 12 times safer now I also saw some other report that said Tesla's had the most accidents from November 2022 to November 2023 I don't know what that was about but this is a report here and it says Tesla vehicle is not using autopilot it was still better by 50% than the US average but how much better using autopilot guys the autopilot the full self driving it is absolutely awesome I love hearing about it is a great tool but don't overpay for that now guys this is exactly how our community talks about stocks it is not just a ticker price we have to look Way Beyond the ticker price there is something behind that price there's a value and our goal and the goal I'm trying to teach here is whatever you're looking investing in I want you to have a new way of thinking and that way of thinking is there's a value and there's a price I want to buy when value is significantly higher than prices and that's why this whole entire software is made but if you watched our channel before you've probably noticed that we have limited daily spots for this community and software and the reason for that is because the software as it exists today includes everything we have to offer for stocks retirement in real estate as you can tell from all these tools up here it helps you in all those areas now we are making some changes behind the scenes so that in the near future that offer is going away as we've been getting feedback from our community members people have expressed that they want us to focus on specific aspects of everything money for them they want to focus on what applies to them in that moment they don't want to have too many options like the Cheesecake Factory they want to say this is what I'm focused on right now so if you've been watching for a while you'll remember that I built this software selfishly for myself that's how the software started people ask how do I get that software and it was always built for my team and I so we could use it to constantly make the right decisions for Real Estate stocks and retirement but as the channel is grown and our community is grown it obviously has to become a lot less about me and more about how I can can better serve you and the community members so the good news is we have not made those changes yet so if you go there today and join you'll be grandfathered in for life with all of these tools 100% of them you'll get them for life no matter what and I'm telling this now because you still have that time so go click at the link below before we make these changes go do it right now if you sign up today you'll be able to keep all the tools even after we make those changes and trust me this will be the best decision you've made all here that is what's key about investing with like-minded people there are people in our community who absolutely love Tesla and think it's awesome and I would tell people out there if you own Tesla stock and bought it real cheap it's hard to decide should you stay in or stay out is there a lot of potential for Tesla of course but right now the numbers look like a car company 95 billion in Revenue $13 billion in profit it's better than the average car company don't get me wrong but you have to sit there and realize that over 90% of its Revenue comes from I think it was 83 84% Mo remember we did the numbers like wait a second the other services included like used car sales and I was like wait a second it's like 90% plus cars guys if I'm a high school athlete and I'm a top prospect I'm not a professional athlete yet don't pay me professional athlete money let Tesla become the software business that you think they're going to become valued in there you have to account for that but remember you got to sit there and put some sort of value to that future and the chance of it happening so let's see what analysts are saying about this Mo do you see this big time growth in EPS according analysts almost tripling oh yeah I was surprised to see this a drop this year of 20% but going to $743 in the next four or five years Revenue doubling revenue dou from 100 to 28 billion you know what the interesting part is Mo if this 28 billion was all software and there were like Microsoft that had 30% bottom line it'd be a $60 billion business which is 15 PE and today's numbers guys that's what I mean people are overpaying for the future they're overpaying for the future the average car company sells for between 0.5 and one times Revenue Tesla's currently selling for almost 10 times Revenue this is Microsoft money Microsoft's like 13 but fair value is probably around 10 times revenue or something lower than that people are valuing this as a software company 100% without a car component if you don't agree with me that it's a car component company I don't to tell you if you used to think that and go wait a second those numbers are adding up I think there's hope for you I do think there's value to Tesla being a software business the question is what's that value so that's when you pull up stock analyzer tool Mo I'm Gna pull up the last time I did Tesla so I remember when I did this one and I did a a low middle and a ridiculous high so we can go through that if you want Oh Revenue growth same numbers 720 and 60% Revenue growth by the way only did five years though profit margin 820 and 35 this makes it more software like yep right so we're sitting there saying listen they crush it next five years and guys they're not going to have this kind of profit margin 20% re I mean I don't well maybe it will next five years maybe it will PE I did 18 25 and 30 what about you I did the same numbers okay and a 9% desire return because that's the market return 9 or 10% let's put what's the market value but remember you need to have a higher when you're doing this s from the software you need to put a higher desired return for a larger margin of safety you need margin of safety because the future is unknown and we're humans we make mistake you've got to be able to sit there and factor in what mistakes am I making in all of these assumptions You are making mistakes we are I am I'm making a ton of mistakes the question is what's my margin of safety but here's what's interesting let's hit the analyze button by the way the fiveyear analysis was for Kathy Wood's 2030 prediction correct guys 4 on the low side 2,000 on the high side with 60% Revenue growth 247 in the middle so if you want to see my reaction video to Kathy Woods egregious

Everything Money,jIW8b5FRDpE,2024-07-10T09:55:00Z,Tesla Stock Is Up 51% In 30 Days...Why?,X,"guys Tesla is up 51% in the last one month that is right 51% when I see Twitter back to talking about how these are the stocks you own forever and Tesla's one of them again after we had the flip Mo what was it before before when when Tesla was at 4:15 two and a half years ago it was Tesla stocked forever then what happened then uh Elon went to buy Twitter now X if I remember correctly correct um um there's a lot of news that drove this stock around yep and news nothing fundamental no that's right fact everything fundamental is getting better and better and better at 4:15 to now 262 revenues almost doubled up almost 100% yeah I'd like to just show two are you talking about 2021 yeah the peak of 414 which was on yep November 4th 2021 53.82 billion in Revenue in 2021 the last 12 months last 12 months 94.7 billion guys it's like 90% increase in Revenue this is proof absolute proof that news follows a stock price I've said before I'll say it again there will be a time when people say you're stupid to own Tesla that all the Bulls who sit there and say I love Tesla I would never sell Tesla will

Everything Money,pEY90Bf-EG0,2024-07-09T09:55:00Z,I'm Buying Nike Stock,Nike,I'm buying Nike stock and I'm really excited about it in fact I already owned some shares and guys the stock is down big it's at $74 per share when it's all-time high not very long ago November 5th 2021 was 180 per share it is down over 60% and for those of you who are true investors this should excite you so guys back in January I did a video of the five stocks I wanted to buy this year when it hit the right value I don't care I mean Nike even if they don't yeah even if they don't grow and they said I'm still want to pay 17 18 times earnings for that desire return I'm doing nine 10 and a half and 12 boom low price basically 60 high price on one of the assumptions is there 115 and 125 middle price 8090 I'm going to add it to my watch list at $90 a share okay as a place to start selling puts on it yeah it's on my watch list at 100 now year to date the stock is down 30% back then I don't think it made much sense to me but now the price is becoming a lot more attractive and I want you to become the kind of investor who gets excited when a great company stock price Falls so why has it been falling well one thing is earnings just came out recently they missed on Revenue they beat they crushed on earnings per share but Footwear Revenue also missed and apparel Revenue did beat so they missed on two things they beat on two now it's interesting I always say that news follows a stock price and what I'm seeing now is all these other companies who've beaten Nike to the running game there's not much mention of Jordan brand there's not much mention of LeBron and his shoes and how they're all crushing it there's not much mention of apparel and how they're still crushing it this is where news follows the stock price because the stock is down 60% from its high of nearly 180 so what are the fundamentals on Nike so first off guys you have $13 billion market cap okay this is a company that do $6.2 billion in free cash flow last year and look at this Enterprise value of 126 this difference of 13 billion is essentially their debt they can pay off their debt in full with two years of their last year's free cash flow that's a great balance sheet forget about Nike being an amazing company and an amazing brand the fact that the balance Sheet's so good really speaks volumes about it now dividend yield 1.88% which was a lot lower when the stock was much higher it eats up $2 billion of their of their free cash flow guys you'll hear me say it time and time again I know we love dividends I like getting dividends but Dividends are the last thing that a company should do with their cash if this stock was fortunate enough to go from 74 down to 40 I would hope and this will not happen but I would hope that Nike would stop this dividend and start buying back at shares because at that point the market cap would be what 60 billion or so they could buy back 3% of their shares every single year with that dividend payment that's going to be much better for investors than anything they're going to do with that dividend I know Dividends are awesome it's a nice check to receive but it's tax inefficient and when you're buying back shares you've done it the right price and the light right valuation adds way more value to investors now guys look at this return on invested Capital this is a sign of a good moat this is a sign of a strong company that has pricing power this is we want to see companies with higher roic's tend to last longer tend to be able to build on their profit at a much better rate than everybody else now let's go check out our of course our important eight pillars now remember the eight pillars tell a story they're not telling you to buy or sell they're telling you a story and right now we have two x's now you might be sitting there saying well wait a second Paul 23 times 5year PE 25 times free cash flow and this is something you're buying remember guys you need to pay a premium promote businesses businesses that are great Brands deserve a premium what is the right premium everything else is a check Revenue growth 10.3 billion in the last five years that led to only $900 million in net income growth but led to 2.8 billion dollars in free cash flow growth debt low shares outstanding buying back a few shares but again I don't want them buying back expensive shares so this story is telling me okay maybe it's a pricing thing but what premium you want to pay because remember look at this look at their free cash flow now the one-year free cash flow multiple is only 18 because their fiveyear average was four and a half billion versus their one year of 6.2 so their free cash flow has really increased a lot in the last year is that stable are they going to grow from there that is the question that really matters when valuing companies here because obviously the more growth you have the worse this ratio is going to look now a lot of people have been talking about how Nike is losing the shoe game I don't understand how but look at this Nike plans a100 doll and less shoe after sales plummet following a sales slump now some people might sit there and say this is great they're sitting there saying we need to refocus now one thing I love that the CEO said which was very revealing to me he blamed the lack of product Innovation to allowing other competitors to come in and steal some market share from Nike I love that admission to me that's not a c just telling me what I want to hear the stock is down and he made a negative assessment on his company and to me it also said to others in the company guys let's innovate better let's be a better company yes it's wonderful to have a $250 shoe but you're Nike if you want to grow your revenue and profit to much bigger levels you're going to have to be able to expand the people you sell to guys this is the Q4 fiscal year 2024 the breakdown 8.2 billion in Footwear down 4% 3.3 billion in apparel up 3% 6 billion in equipment up 34% so there's a lot of growth potential here and finally Converse $500 million down 18% year-over-year so guys two growth categories to declining they got to turn this thing around but if they're able to turn that around they're going to be able to really grow the profit and free cash flow this company now here's another cool thing China 3% year-over-year growth rest of the world decline of 2% but China's a growing Market you've got the largest middle class 1.6 billion people yes they've had a decline in population last year but a lot of people making more and more money do you think that's going to help Nike sales or not yes there's a lot of Chinese Footwear companies out there I do not disagree with that they've gotten some us athletes to sign on which is great but Nike is still Nike and of course Jordan brand what a Big Brand look at these Jordan sales as a percentage of Nike sales it is growing started at 7% in 2014 had a little decline in 18 and 19 now 13% of all of Nike sales guys I think Jordan gets in like 5% I don't know if the the movie was accurate but he gets checks of 200 300 million dollars a year for his share of the Nike Revenue which is absolutely incredible now here's Nike's Revenue every quarter of the last five years now it's been pretty stagnant actually guys since Q4 2021 pretty stagnant levels so they're going to be invigorated here they got to get back to growth mode this is something important for Nike and for the investors to find appealing of course selfishly I want them to stagnate for a while that way people continue to sell the stock and it goes lower and lower and lower so I can dollar cost average at much lower prices if I'm able to do that then Nike as long as it sticks around and grows like the company I think it is over the next 10 or 20 years I will make a great return on the money invested into thaty from my pocket now guys this is Nike's North American revenue from 2009 to 2023 by segment okay the biggest one growth right here 344 to 764 um million in equipment and we still we still see growth in every category actually this is the biggest one sorry apparel 1.74 billion to almost $6 billion do that is Big Time growth in fact equipment I was wrong is actually the smallest one but look at this Revenue overall 6.8 billion to 21.6 guys remember there's always going to be a lot of negative news following any stock that declines the question is how do you take away the news that really matters versus the news just following the stock price now let's go see what analysts are saying about Nike now remember these are just analysts they have probably more bias than you and I do because they have career risk if they're wrong they need to be around the curve so EPS growth from 378 this year to 636 this is double digigit growth almost every single year okay so not bad a lot of growth still there for Nike Revenue growth boy I literally am reading articles about Nike losing its position and this is examples of news following stock price guys if you've watched our videos before these are the three questions I ask when involving when when I look for a company I want to buy one do I think this company will be around for the foreseeable future will Nike be around for 10 20 30 plus years what does our world look like if 30 years from now there's no Nike okay two do I think they're going to have more revenue and profit in this future than they have today again do you think Nike has staying power forget about the where the stock price has gone look at the fundamentals of the business and number three if the answers to one and two are correct are yes can I pay a price today that factors in this future growth and gives me a good return on the money that I'm investing that is the ultimate question if you're able to answer all three of those as a yes today then it's probably something you want to look at and I think Nike fits that criteria but what is the right price for Nike so this is our stock analyzer tool I'm doing a 10-year analysis remember guys this does not factor in any of the balance sheet okay so Revenue growth first I did three five and s% for my low middle and high all right profit margin I did 10 11 and 12 and the same with free cash flow a little bit higher than history because I figured with they're more direct to Consumer selling there'll be a higher margin for them so they should be able to bump up those cash flow and earnings margins now what's the PE at the end of 10 years that you would assigned to Nike it's a premium company guys the market average is 15 but you got to pay a premium for great companies I put 20 23 and 26 now if you said 30 to me I'd say yeah I could see the argument for that if you said 15 I'd be like you know that's kind of low for Nike it's somewhere in between I don't know the exact number that's what makes the software so great for you you can pick based on your perception and understanding of Nike I feel like 2023 and 26 is a great PE and price to free cash flow for Nike and finally I put in a 9% return why because the Market's going to do nine or 10% so this is the market return this has no margin of safety you need your margin of safety because you're buying an individual company if you just want to match the market buy a lowc cost ETF we're humans we make mistake and the future is unknown so you need a higher return for that margin of safety but based on the market return hit the analyze button I have a low price of 61 high price of 120 middle price of 86 and this includes the dividend so for me I feel like I'm adequately buying at price is it goes lower remember focus on the fact that you want the stock price to go lower and don't forget to click in the

Everything Money,oosAEjbNr8E,2024-06-24T10:00:44Z,3 Stocks To Buy Today Near 52 Week Low?,Monster Beverage,"stock number one monster beverage one of the best performing stocks of all time 60,000 per return guys in 1990 the stock was essentially at two cents per share in 2006 it had hit 200 $272 which is equivalent to 130 bagger already and since then it's up almost 20 times that's the point Guys these companies that M that Compound on each other and compounding themselves this is what is amazing about the power of compounding this is what's absolutely incredible now monster I'm absolutely floored that they were never bought out by anybody and I don't personally drink monster beverages I'm addicted to Coke Zero but one I thing I love about this company market cap 51 a. half billion look at this Enterprise Value 49.3 they have more cash on hand than debt they generated 1.4 billion last year in free cash flow 1.16 in the Last 5 Years and a great 5-year return on invested capital of 16.2% now let's go check out their financials I want to show you guys this Revenue growth number now Revenue 10 years ago 2.5 billion 2.73 3 and a half 38 42 46 5 and a half 63 71 just consistent growth and really high growth at that this is pretty impressive stuff guys in the last 12 months 7.34 billion now here's the interesting part about monster most of the ones that have a h 100 bagger and huge gains they bought back a lot of shares not this company 10 years ago they had a billion shares outstanding now they have a billion four they've actually gone up 40 million shares in the last 10 years let's go back to 200000 where were they in 2000 let's check it out in 2000 they had 960 million shares outstanding so they're still up from 2000 so this is a company that was able to compound without buying shares back isn't that incredible why well it's because of their revenue cuz back in 2000 they did $71 million in Revenue their revenue is up 100x in the last 23 years Big Time growth their revenue is up 100 times in the last 23 years so this sounds exciting right well let's make sure let's go to the eight pillars here eight pillars that we know and love six check marks everything's great except for the valuation metrics one thing I don't like is they're 5year cash flow is lower than their fiveyear net income and uh you know almost 20% lower kind of okay what's going on here that's something you need to understand before you buy this company but like we said go back to this chart the one-year chart it's down 16 and a half perc I mean it's very close got very close to October 2023 lows of $473 so again it's exciting to look at 52- we lows it's a great place to start to look for Value but you still got to then do the analysis the quick analysis sit there and say is this company still a good value let's see what the analysts are saying 9.9 10.1 9.9 10.1 7.2% growth every year in Revenue going for the next four or five years earnings per share 14 and a half 1429 11 and a half 15 and a half 10 so some really good even growth in EPs and revenue for this company so this company still has more fundamental growth involved the question is is 44 times free cash flows 38 times earnings a little too pricey well let's go look it up in our stock analyzer tool I don't think I've ever done monster let's look it up and see if I have Monster I did do monster back in June of 2022 now I'm going to make some adjustments here to my growth assumptions so here are my 10-year growth assumptions five s and a half and 10 so free profit margin and free cash flow margin as you can tell over the last 10 years free cash flow has been lower than profit I think that's a really important thing to understand before you invest in this company why has it been lower because over a long periods of time they should equate out PE I put 15 18 and 21 Which is higher than before because I do think it's a high quality company with a great balance sheet and remember that balance sheet has about $2 billion in extra cash there I did my 9% Market return because the market does N9 or 10% so I'm trying to to find what I consider to be the value but remember you need to put margin of safety because if you're not going to then just buy a lowcost ETF there's no reason to buy any individual company if you want to make the market return in my opinion so let's hit the analyze button congratulations I got points for using the software I have a low price of 26 high price of 55 Middle price of 38 so for me margin of safety might be 30 bucks that's just hypothetical I'm not saying that's the right number I'm just telling you seems a little pricey to me right now go back to monster they were at two cents a share and of course you sit there and go yeah Paul 60,000 per return yeah but from 2000 to 2002 the stock went down a ton you have to be able to say yeah but the fundamentals are getting better that's the hard part that's what makes investing difficult because we're all programmed to look at the stock price going up and down but I'm trying to teach a little bit different here I'm trying to get you to understand the fundamentals and then if the price goes lower but the fundamentals are still okay or the same or better you continue to buy because the fundamentals are monster we getting better even if the stock fell you've got to be able to do that because most people out there all the Lemmings out there just look at stock price and that's it I want you to be different",1.0,0.7
Everything Money,oosAEjbNr8E,2024-06-24T10:00:44Z,3 Stocks To Buy Today Near 52 Week Low?,Pepsi,"stock number two Pepsi current price 166 you all know who are normal to the channel That I love Coke Zero but I will say this Pepsi Zero is a phenomenal drink diet coke in my opinion is better than Diet Pepsi but I do love Pepsi Zero sugar I think it's a great drink I love it when I go to Taco Bell and stuffed stuffed soft tacos and chili cheese burritos in my face I love washing it down with the Pepsi Max that you get at Taco Bell now this company isn't as close as it used to be to its 52e low but it's there it's close enough I mean the company's has been public since 1987 and the total return just in dollar value is 2600% remember what was Monster 57,000 or 60,000 per night and day difference right both beverage companies um different balance sheet $230 billion market cap versus a 33 billion Enterprise Value so about $73 billion in debt net debt now one thing I don't like about pepsy dividend of 3% I know all the dividend lovers out there it's the best thing ever we love dividends I get that but this dividend ate up $6.8 Billion their cash flow last year they did 7.2 billion in free cash flow guys that's like 95% of their free cash flow that's a lot I look at that going is that sustainable I don't know their profit margin very consistent 10% essentially same gross margin as Monster good Returns on invested Capital 15 and 16% I think we'd all agree that even though Pepsi is not the number one soft drink company in the world they're a great brand still and they're very well known and they have great commitment from the people who do love them I used to be a Pepsi guy then I met kzero and I was like all right C zero these income statements I mean the revenue growth isn't as exciting 66 6 3 63 63 and a half 64 and a half and last year they did 91.5 so I mean it's growth but not a ton of growth let's go see what the eight pillars look like very similar to monster except for this debt now you couple the debt with the high dividend yield do I think Pepsi is going out of business anytime soon no with that said what's the first thing they would cut if things started to get a little tight that dividend I'm not saying the dividend for sure is going away probably isn't however it's a high dividend that eats up a lot of their free cash flows so don't buy any company based on dividend because remember it's tax inefficient and I personally believe it's the last thing that any company should do with their cash is pay out the dividend there's so many other things they can do if you can buy back cheap shares but the question is is it cheap well it's selling for 31 and a half times free cash flow 25 times earning so another company with less free cash flow than earnings and it looks like the difference is actually a lot bigger with Pepsi so these are the things to discuss these are the things to understand all right seven 8% EPS growth all right eight and a quarter to 1087 Revenue growth I'm gonna guess low mid single digits yeah two to five percent okay that's about I expect for Pepsi I mean how they really gonna I mean it's Pepsi it's it's like Coke I mean they're not going to grow at 20% a year it's just not possible I mean as the world gets I mean I think I remember Warren Buffett saying the average person in China this was years ago has one Coke per day sorry per year but the average person in the US has one Coke per day so th those are the growth potential in India and in uh China and other emerging economies all right so let's see the stock analyzer tool and see what's going on with Pepsi all right let's see the some of the assumptions I made on Pepsi 10e analysis I did two four and 6% Revenue growth guys I'm not gonna lie how the hell are I gon to do six% Revenue that'd be hard profit margin basically it's 10% so I put 9.75 10 and a quarter 10.75 but look free cash flow I went lower seven and a half eight eight and a half PE you know I did 1720 and 23 is my bias towards Koch showing up in than that should I put a higher number that's the reason why if you use a software you're probably going to do a little better you're going to make your decisions based on what you feel about the company and again my 9% no margin of safety return the analyze button got a low price of 75 to 100 high price of 140 to 180 middle price of 100 to 135 so even though even it might hit him 52 we LEL I think it's a little premature",1.0,-0.3
Everything Money,oosAEjbNr8E,2024-06-24T10:00:44Z,3 Stocks To Buy Today Near 52 Week Low?,Intel,company number three Intel has this company been on a wild ride or what it's at $364 guys you know I have Intel but again don't ever buy a company because somebody on the internet has it we're here to teach a process I will gladly share with you my views on Intel but you need to make your own decisions for me Intel is purely a turnaround play that's it to me the fundamentals are a little hodge podge right now revenue is down rebuilding do I think they're going to benefit from AI absolutely do I think they're benefiting as much as they should right now no they're building or have built three amazing factories in three locations one of which an hour and a half down the street from us in Columbus I think Intel is been beaten up rather thoroughly the 52e high was $51 back in December 52e low was just a month ago at $29.70 C so we're right there on the cusp of it but again this is a multi-year turnaround play this stock has been as low as 22 to 23 in the last couple years let me see yeah 2459 that was the a low that's pretty low guys pretty low this is a stock that was this is what I love showing about the stock this was one of the poster Children of the do age it has not hit its all-time high of $75 back in August of 2000 it's been that long since all-time high look at it and guess what the business has gotten better this is a great Learning lesson this company Cisco there's so many companies like that where even the ones that are still around like Microsoft and Amazon they're not up as much as the revenue and profit is up from their peaks so it just goes to show that in the short run stocks are a voting machine in the long run they're a weighing machine now do I think Intel is beaten up a little bit I do but actually the funny part is I think my fair price in Intel even with if they succeed is only a little bit higher than what their all-time high was so it just goes to show that it's very difficult when you follow the hype and it's very difficult that even if you pay for a great story the story shifts over time that story shifts and the price Falls the question is which story was correct usually when it's going up and up and up that story is not correct and when it's crashing that story is not correct there's somewhere in the middle that over time it gravitates towards so let's go look at the analyst estimates for Intel now they're expecting a dollar per share in profit this year up to $5 now remember guys don't take analysts as like oh they're they're brilliant they're they have the same bias that you and I have we all have the same bias I love the fact that everybody's so negative on Intel yet the analyst is showing growth and if they're able to hit $5 a share multiply that by 15 to 17 times you're looking at 75 to 90 75 to $85 per share in value okay that's not bad if they hit this like I said it's a turnaround play their revenue fell tremendously lately but analysts have them growing considerably up to 93 billion in Revenue in the year 2028 so if they do this turnaround well this could be a great mult bagger but it's not for the Fain of heart because this thing is going to get is ugly before it gets better now I got lucky on Intel I started buying at 45 all the way down to 25 and I sold it at 48 on its massive runup and then I started buying get at 35 as it fell so I've done really good on this on this company borderline trading I remember at 48 bucks going I don't think the risk is worth the I don't think the juice is worth the squeeze here so I exited and then started to go to 51 I'm like oh crap I think it even got a little bit higher than that so I was like okay maybe I was wrong that's fine but I was okay not owning Intel 55 or 60 bucks a share that was fine for me but then it start of fall again I'm like okay now we're getting back into it so again this is a turnaround play these are the conversations to have in our community these are the reasons why you need our tools guys I'm not going to do stock analy on this because it's a turnaround play,1.0,0.2
Everything Money,0sIjOu3wJWo,2024-05-01T09:55:00Z,"My Thoughts on Amazon, Starbucks, AMD Earnings",AMD,"guys three major companies AMD Amazon Starbucks just reported we're here to report them two of them beat on earnings and revenue one of them missed but two companies are down after hours that's what's interesting first company AMD advin Master devices they beat 62 cents per share EPS versus 61 cents and 5.5 billion versus 5.45 billion so barely beat but they still beat they're riding the AI chip wave but here's the interesting part Mo they're down 3% after hours we'll probably find out why but let's look at their quarterly Revenue numbers here's what's interesting the same quarter last year they did 5.35 billion so they're only up $150 million in revenue from there that's 3% not even so this company's not killing it like Nvidia is uh look but look at their annual revenue MO 2014 they did five and a half billion then 4 billion 4.3 all the way up to 22.6 they did more than this quarter almost as much as they did in all of 2014 that's why the stock has absolutely skyrocketed let's look at this chart Mo 5year chart up 478 per 73 well look at this 10 years up 3700% but if you go Max it's only up, 1500% going back to 199 1987 that's when they went public and it got as low as like a dollar a share wow back in 2015 wow that's not that long ago that's not that long ago this is guys it's hard I mean look at 2000 look at 2000 the peak of 2000 was $45 a share they almost got there again in 2006 and then it took them until 200 basically 18 to surpass their 2000 Peak 18 years before they passed that why in the short run stocks are a voting machine in the long run they're a weighing machine this is what's incredible about companies guys we're here to teach you about that the emotion of this company Euphoria despondency depression whatever you want to call it right here is this Euphoria again look at this Mo it went up collapsed went back up again yeah yeah that doesn't happen so what are they reporting what are they saying in their press release so they had um record data center segment they did a revenue of 2.3 billion up 80% year-over-year driven by growth by yeah it's huge um client segment Revenue 1.4 billion up 85% year-over-year so how is the revenue basically flat gaming okay so I don't really know a lot about gaming when it comes to this gaming segment Revenue was 922 million down 48% year-over-year 33% sequentially due to decrease in semic custom Revenue lower AMD radi on GPU sales that seems almost intent that they're kind of trimming something back doesn't it I don't know I would never speculate that I'm sure they're trying to focus on this what else you saying seeing they're also highlighting that so maybe they're maybe it's not intended embedded segment Revenue 846 million down 46% year-over-year you have two of their segments that make up$ four billion dollar their five and a half billion up 80% and you have the revenue basically flat yeah yeah that's interesting that's very interesting now guys you got to remember you got to remember we look at earnings report as an emotional driver for people we don't really make decisions based on these in fact Starbucks later on you're going to see how much is down I got excited I own Starbucks don't own Starbucks just cuz I do or anybody else in Internet do your own research learn the fundamentals and buy it because it fits for your portfolio but I look at this going we look at these quarterly we do these reports only because it's fun to talk about to sit there and see that but we only look for what's fundamentally changing in the business like what's happening in the business that's fundamentally changing the value to us yeah and I don't know that's the I don't know what's going on with AMD this is a $257 billion company $257 billion company 11 and a half times price of sales ratio now keep in mind guys their gross revenue gross profit I'm sorry is 46% Microsoft is 70% and selling for about the same price of sales ratio a little bit higher huh their bottomline profit margin in the last five years has been 10% the last year it was 4% is that really the kind of company you want to be paying 300 times earnings 157 times 5 years 230 times price of free cash flow 150 times the last five years of free cash flow guys that's expensive yeah it is what does it take to justify that this is actually more expensive than Nvidia Nvidia is selling for lower lower multiples than this right and nvidia's up like a th% the last two years I don't remember the exact number but it's up a lot guys this is the emotional part of mesing like right now the Market's saying we're euphoric on AMD well maybe not right now but just 6 weeks ago it was at $227 a share it's now at 152 that's a drop about 33% drop in a matter of six weeks that is 5% per week guys everybody here is worried everybody here about worried about their devaluation of the dollar because of inflation I'd rather have I'd rather have that that's why I always tell people when Grant Cardone idiots like that say 6% is better than 0% I go no it's not because sometimes the downside isn't 0% sometimes the downside is negative 33% in 6 weeks at the end of the day it's going to end up driving the value to where it's going to go so let's do stock analyzer on Advanced Micro Devices and see what we think it's worth I'm going to pull it up in our history Mo I did it in February 27th now guys here's the funny part I did 8 12 and 16% Revenue growth okay they were flat basically over year I did 8 15 and 22% profit margin I did 815 and 22% free cash flow can I make a comment they had never hit the middle number or higher I think I was just trying to show how crazily overpriced it was PE currently 300 price a free cash flow 230 I put 18 21 and 24 I did my 9% return which is the market return this has no margin of safety and we need margin of safety it's very important to put it in there but I put it in here just to say this is what I think the Market's worth why you laughing I just love seeing PE of 300 I'm going to put in there 1821 and 24 it's just it's we're not me Kevin we don't look at a discount to PE hit the analyze button guys look at this I have a low price of 28 a high price of 175 and middle price of 80 so unless you think the highest assumptions are going to happen if you think the highest assumptions are going to happen might look at this because this is looking at a decent return but could have bought it three weeks ago yeah",1.0,-0.8

what's it called it just it just seems like incredible resistance Point guys I don't make my investing decisions based on Resistance but isn't this odd this is going back to 2020 it just cannot break this can't and think about how much good has happened in the stock market since 2020 and a company like Amazon still can't break that high well look at the revenue Mo in 2020 they did we they did a $514 billion in Revenue if you extrapolate out the 142 Time 4 you're looking at 6560 billion but they do the most Revenue in the fourth quarter yeah so even by itself they're basically going to match the revenue so they're going to they're going to be so much higher than just 2020 that's what's incredible here Amazon is incredible business they're everywhere Mo any breakout on Amazon any sort of comments that we'd want to see on how they broke out AWS versus retail Etc yeah AWS well AWS sales increase 17% year-over-year to 25 billion net sales increase 133% just across the board okay let's see what else they did free yeah what was the operating income scroll up 15.3 billion in the first quarter compared with 4.8 in the first quarter of 2023 yeah W over triple good that's a good that's a good metric operating income is a very good metric to see that big increase free cash flow improved to 50 Bill 50.1 billion compared to 3.3 billion the trailing 12 months ending March 31st 20 50 billion in free cash flow can you scroll down a little bit there yep 50 billion wow for trailing 12 months for the trailing 12 months correct oh God I thought it was a quarter I'm like how the hell they pull that off no trailing 12 months $50 billion the company has a$2 trillion doll market cap what's the company 1.86 so you're looking at uh 40 times free cash flow 38 times free cash flow guys for me I look at this gross profit of 16% now a lot of people argue with me and say Paul you're not understanding the numbers Amazon's reinvesting back in itself this gross profit isn't sry well Tesla reinvests back in itself and it's the car business it shows 18% gross profit nvidia's in Intel's investing itself it shows a higher gross profit yeah I I don't Amazon has owned my brain for a long time but when I hear people apply different accounting rules to Amazon that it does to other companies I go wait but other companies are growing free cash flow I can understand that guys if you look at the free cash flow number I get it because why when you invest in yourself you spend on Capital expenditures look at these Capital expenditures the last 10 years 5 billion 5 4 7.8 12 13 17 40 61 64 53 yes they're investing themselves but it shows up on the net cash flow free cash flow number it's cash from operations less your Capital expenditures what I love about Amazon is they're operating cash flow and their operating income is grow is growing that's a very important metric very important metric it means the fundamentals the business are getting better but the question is is it still worth 35 to 40 times free cash flow I don't know I don't know either like guys look at Amazon here what people don't remember about Amazon that's so incredible is look at their Max chart we don't even see it here back in 2000 all the way back over here right here this thing fell 95% so this teaches you two things one a 95% drop in a great company can still look like a blip if I ask you to guess here You'be like a 5 or 10% but two the emotional ride it takes back then the stock was at 13 before they're split down to $6 who here was sticking around for that but Jeff Bezos gives a gave a very very very he says it all the time he goes I looked at this our stock was down 95% but every other metric we had was getting better why there was a disconnect right Mo yeah and the thing is like you could say oh I would stick around there now because you know what Amazon is back then they sold freaking books yeah you were going to stick around back then and if you think you were I think you got to figure things out look at this look at this emotional ride on Amazon like I said resistance Point Falls Big Sky High flat Falls look at Tesla Tesla's at 415 per share just two and a half three years ago now it's at 160 we were made fun of three years ago by saying all these things are driven by one thing and one thing only emotion and emotion rarely gets you a good decision on this channel we're trying to teach the fundamentals that's so important to us what are the fundamentals of the business doing when you buy a stock you're buying a piece of a business when you buy a piece of Amazon you're a co-owner of Amazon by the way do you know on LinkedIn there was a guy who he would put in there at his LinkedIn profile investor in Tesla from whatever he would like actually put all the companies he own stock oh it's brilliant it's the best but that's what you're doing you're buying a piece of a business you're buying a future stream of cash flow the more you pay for it the worse you're going to do the hardest part about investing is when this happens do you understand the fundamentals enough and then do you understand the emotion for yourself enough to say I think I'm okay here the fundamental are getting better the stock price does not reflect that that's what makes investing difficult but most times you're all by yourself you're sitting in your home and you see the stock fall day after day after day you fall you see it fall all the time and you go what the hell is going on here that's what I want to help eliminate for you that's what I'm trying to teach on this channel this is all just news and noise that's all it is news follows the stock price we haven't seen a bad bare market yet we haven't seen a long drown out be Market it's going happen at some point when I have no clue anybody says otherwise is lying to you what I do know is this we have the tools to make the right decisions fundamentally we have the community to help us keep the emotions in check if you make those right decisions and then add to them when things look worse you're probably going to do pretty well every great investor has done well by doing that but it's difficult because it takes the emotional side of investing and tests you on that but trust me when I say this I used to be a big emotional train wreck when it came to investing I'm a highly emotional person today but you see me talk about these companies I literally the next company Starbucks I'm gonna be literally it's down so much and I'm so excited and that is not a lie I'm so excited I can't wait tomorrow to buy shares don't buy them just because I'm buying them actually I can't buy tomorrow but in the next two days I will and sell puts on that that's what's so great,1.0,-0.2
Everything Money,0sIjOu3wJWo,2024-05-01T09:55:00Z,"My Thoughts on Amazon, Starbucks, AMD Earnings",Starbucks,company number three star Bizzle Mo it's down 11.3% right now down $9.99 to 7850 this company not only not only the price is a blood bath but the press release which we're going to go through guys they reported 68 cents versus 80 cents expected huge Miss 15% Miss 8.6 billion in Revenue versus 9.12 us China international everything had same store sales that were down this is a big company they open 324 or so new stores which is great MO is there any sort of Hope in that press release well not really I mean all the all of the highlights are bad the good thing was I guess reward membership which they have been touting for quarter after quarter 32.8 million up 6% over the year prior uh they did open up 364 net new stores like you said so I said 324 so thank you for correcting me that's good um it's but they have said like it's a highly challenging environment out there everything reassurance of everything's going to be okay because all of these things look really bad comparable store sales in the united North America and the US declin 3% 7% decline in uh comparable transactions if you look at International comparable same store sales declined 6% is it a weak consumer China declined 11% you might be right China it might be weak consumer I'm not trying to be a fudster but we saw consumer sentiment today coming at the lowest level since July of 2022 could it be a weak consumer I don't know but Mo I will tell you this look at analyst estimates here EPS of 420 to 804 any comments in there on guidance because their year is going to end here in in two more quarters or one more quarter I don't know they said they're going to discuss their guidance uh on their call okay so when their call happens we're going to see something happen to the stock price either it's going to go lower or it's going to rebound yep guys it's crazy little company here let's go pull it up in our stock analyzer tool star Bizzle I did it on March March 14th now guys I did a 10-year analysis I did 68 and 10% Revenue growth I did profit margin of 10 11 and a half and 13 same with free cash flow kept the same even though free cash flow in the last 10 years was actually higher I did a PE of 17 A2 20 and 22 and A2 same thing price free cash flow all the more reason to join the software you can put your own numbers in here and it all comes as part of that link below and guys I did a desired return of only 9% that basically a market return just to determine there's no margin of safety in here but guys we need margin of safety because valuation is an imprecise art the future is unknown and unpredictable and we're humans we make mistakes I hit the analyze button boom I have a low price of 67 high price of 140 middle price of 100 so to me it's getting interesting so we have decisions to make guys,1.0,-0.7

Everything Money,_f36I7nlqkY,2024-04-11T10:00:26Z,I'm Buying These 33 Stocks,Berkshire Hathaway,number seven Burkshire Hathaway our good friend Warren Buffett and back when I did this video originally Charlie Munger was still alive but obviously Charlie Munger has since past a few weeks before his 100th birthday great company now I will say this though I feel that people just love it because it's War Buffett you got to remember as they get more and more Capital it's going to be harder for them to beat the market so what I'm waiting for is very very very low times in the birkshire haway valuation what's that mean well Warren Buffett always said we would buy back our shares all day long at 1.2 times Book value what's Book value assets minus liabilities so you take the assets minus the liabilities multiply by 1.2 if the market cap is below that number I'm probably going to buy it I'm not going to buy birkshire unless it's an obvious purchase and I think that's an obvious purchase there could be great times to own it but it's so large I'd rather just own the S&amp;P 500 at that point unless it comes to the point where it's so cheap I've got to buy it,1.0,0.4

Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),Target,stock number one is Target and guys by the way I actually own 19 positions but two of them are ETFs GDX and gdxj just for gold miners and four of them are too small for me to be able to discuss in this channel they're small positions so that's why we're not talking about them these 13 are positions you're allowed to own but remember don't buy anything just cuz somebody on the internet does learn a process apply that to the things that make sense to you so Target $168 a share guys it was as low as 103 or so 10188 back in December of 2023 look like the eight pillars here okay so these are seven pill seven check marks now remember guys this is not to tell you to buy or not buy this is purely telling a story and answering that story now one of the things I would say here is long-term liabilities divided by fiveyear free cash flow guys target has a lot of leases they count as debt that's six times to me this is just a check mark So I look at this as an as an8 check mark company and at $11 a share that was pretty awesome I started buying it sub 135 all the way down I think my lowest purchase was on 103 or 105 so I didn't clip the bottom but that's why when you understand why you buy a company as it goes lower you continue to buy more so what is Target Worth to me right now let's pull it up because I haven't done this in a while January 18th of 2024 I made some assumptions here some reasonable assumptions on Revenue growth some reasonable assumptions on profit margin and free cash flow two and a half to five and a half on Revenue growth three and a quarter to 4.75 on profit same on free cash flow now PE and price of free cash flow Target is loved by women women love going there and they love spending money there so I sat there and put 15 17 and half and 12 it's still retail it's still physical location on retail so that's always apprehensive for me and I put my desired return at 9% again only Market return hit the analyze button I have a low price of 111 high price of 240 middle price of 167 having my watch list at 135 I think it's reasonable to account for some margin of safety remember there's no margin of safety in these numbers,1.0,0.2
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),Sprouts Farmers Market,stock number two Sprouts Farmers Market $2.7 trillion doll market cap this company's at $62 a share guys I've been buying it in the low to mid-30s and I've been mad that it keeps going up it is absolutely just skyrocketing they have a great new CEO came from Dollar Tree or Dollar General one of the two here's the eight pillars guys a great company can look expensive as it's growing and again retail so it has higher lease cost now obviously at $30 a share $35 a share the PE and price of free cash flow we're a lot lower so what's the reasonable amount on this company and by all means guys if you want to take a look at this company and my assumptions in more detail please do look but I currently have a mid low price of 32 to 35 a high price of 60 to 70 middle price of 45 to 50 I have my watch list of 40 I think it's reasonable one could make the argument of a higher price because it's growing they only have 400 locations or so they want to get to 15 00 or 1250 so there's a lot more potential for growth there,1.0,0.6
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),Brookfield Asset Management,stock number three Brookfield Asset Management guys this one is going to be one that I wish it was as simple as hey here's the cashlo setter they have a lot of Investments they've done a lot of things they've also lost some properties to foreclosure given keys back to the bank but I like their potential this one very quick it has more to do with its long-term revenues and how set in place they are the the stock analyzer tool looks great on it but there's a lot of moving Parts in this company and I had somebody help me out with this one and we made the investment decision together,1.0,0.1
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),Southwest Airlines,stock number four Southwest Airlines luuv Southwest $22 billion company this is a company look at this look at their profit margin 1.78 1.24 the last five years if you go before covid they were 10 to 15% all day so my bank here is the fact that they have record Revenue 26 billion Which is higher than pre-co they've had a lot of issues especially with the 737s and some of their computer issues as internally as a company I'm buying this purely as what happens when they get back to normal profit margin so all the more reason why I want to pull up Southwest Airline and our stock analyzer tool and show it to you I didn't even do 15% as my middle so I'm looking at these assumptions here very reasonable assumptions in the company 9% desired return it's green all around again no margin of safety by look at these numbers going okay I like this now what Catalyst am I waiting for I'm waiting for stabilization of profit that's it once we get the stabilization of profit even if it gets to seven or eight percent I should still do well in this company,1.0,0.2
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),Disney,stock number five Disney another Play Just Like Southwest where margins are very low 3.4 3.9% when historically they were again 10% or more so again this plays exactly the same as South West in fact look at this exciting eight pillars not pretty six X's but to me with record Revenue they as long as they get back to a normalized profit margin which might take some time but even if they get their profit margin to 78 n% probably does pretty well for the company and unfortunately for me Disney stock has been up a lot lately and um so here are my assumptions here I did do 12% in the middle I did 612 and 18 because they have the Disney plus a lot of high margin stuff hopefully they're able to figure out a way to make really good money on it I hit the analyze button I have a low price of 46 high price of 128 sorry middle price of 128 high price of 270 so even at the middle price if I bought it today I'm still going to make an 11% return based on a discounted cash flow,1.0,0.4
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),American Express,stock number six American Express 29 a share 52 we low of 140 guys 140 per share that's pretty impressive look at the eight pillars here not bad a lot of debt I'm okay with that based on what American Express is but look at this price to free cash flow 12.2 versus a PE of 23.6 they're showing 17 billion in free cash flow last year they're showing 13 billion average of the last five years versus net income of 8.4 billion last year and 6.8 billion in the last five years so for those of you who are new we love when free cash flow is greater than net income love that and they pay a little bit of a dividend nothing major 1.1% eats up only $2 billion their free cash flow that's pretty awesome so let's go to stock analyzer see we stand on this one because I haven't done this in a while I haven't updated it January 16th I did it 47 and 10% Revenue growth profit margin 124 and 16 free cash flow much higher remember because look at their free cash flow relative to profit margin I actually did 1821 and 24 this is the Elite credit card company so I want to give them the elite premium for it if I asked everybody out there today name me the most elite credit card company the exclusive one people say American Express all day hit the analyze button assuming no margin of safety look at all this green it actually worries me that I'm missing something because of high these how high these potential returns are so you're out there and you understand something about American Express that I don't get about the numbers drop it in the comments below I'd love to hear it,1.0,0.8
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),Generac,stock number seven gener oh my gosh guys I got my first purchase of gener and then the stock skyrocketed from there which really really irked me absolute God's honest truth I hate it when stocks I buy go up especially when I just started the position I made one purchase of gen it started to go lower and then it's Skyrocket at 50% I'm in the acquisition mode I'm in I want to purchase more shares I don't want to sit there and buy a small amount and watch the Skyrocket I wanted to go down and down and down so gener great company for generator you drive around you see generators out there this is what you see let's go look at the eight pillars here five checks net income is down but free cash flows up over the last five years so I like to see that at least the free cash flows up versus Net Income a little bit higher debt okay um can't be perfect I'm fine with that now one thing I don't like here is the fiveyear PE is lower than the price to free cash flow which means they're reporting higher net income in the last five years than free cash flow that really bothers me and if you see right here 340 million 5year average net income versus 270 5year average free cash flow okay not the greatest so let's pull it up in our stock analyzer tool and see what gener might be worth we did it on February 20th I did 46 and 8% Revenue growth guys look at this they had 12% decline in Revenue in the last year that's a lot that's a big drop is it because of people spending less money on their homes I don't know here's our price low price of 100 high price of 210 Middle price of 150 I have it on my watch list at 100 doesn't mean I'm buying it at 100 it's on my watch list,1.0,0.0
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),T Rowe Price,stock number eight is T price now guys T price I actually just heard a commercial for them yesterday when I was watching the cows game which I thought was funny T price money manager lots of assets under management this one has a lot of potential for some downfall if the markets fall obviously the stock will fall because their assets under management are falling but I do think it's a good company for all you people out there who love dividends look at this dividend 4.27% I'm okay with the dividend because I don't know what kind of reinvestment opportunity they have but when I start to see this PE start to fall it gets me a little concerned here going why the heck are they paying out this dividend now some things I don't like about the company lower five-year free cash flow and lower one-year free cash flow versus Net Income so that's something to get your head around but they have a good return on best of capital over the last 5 years they have that great dividend for people who love dividends including myself by the way let's go to the eight pillars here two x's free cash flow and net income are down over the last five years is it annoying sure but look at these valuation metrics I love this valuation and if it gets driven down even further it could be a better buy let's do our stock analyzer on this one was the last time I did this February 13th I actually did a 20-year analysis guys because I look at tro as a 20 year plan it's not just 10 years it's 20 years I really want to look at this even longer than that so I did 3 five and 7% Revenue growth which I think is conservative considering if markets go up more than 5% a year for the next 20 years that'll drive up the revenue even without new business 2630 and 34% profit margin lower free cash flow margin I put 1517 and 19 on the PE in price of free cash flone again the 9% desired return hit the analy button low price of 100 to 120 high price of 250 to 285 middle price of 160 to 185 um this is a company that's been going back and forth for a while I'm going to continue to own it and keep buying it where it makes sense to me I have my watch list under 92 and a half that might be too low and I think I know why I did that because it kept going lower I kept changing it so I need to change this now probably to5 cuz I had it I was buying it below 115 before but as it was going lower I was setting new watch list prices and never updated it after it skyrocketed back up,1.0,0.2
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),Paycom,stock number nine paycom oh guys paycom pcom fell suddenly one day down to 150 a share from like $200 and something dollars a share I got very lucky I bought it that day and then it skyrocketed from there if you actually look the one-year chart that was the day I bought it I think I got it at 149 or so it hit low of 146 and then it's just gone up since then now it's starting to come back down which is great it's at 181 a share all-time high of $558 a share guys $558 so this is why you don't look at just the price fall you look at as an indication of hey and remember I had paycom my my watch list for 150 and it got there real quick I loved it made a purchase I'm not done buying paycom but for right now let's see what we think let's look at the eight pillars here valuation metric look at this valuation metrics the 5year PE versus the fiveyear price of free cash flow let's check out the analyst estimates here this is where I like paycom a lot look at this jump It's payroll software as payroll gets larger and larger and larger as people make more and more money it's going to naturally Drive their revenue in addition to extra business look at the revenue growth double digit Revenue growth this is the kind of company you need to pay a premium for so what was my premium let's say let's see what I was paying for paycom back in o October of 2023 so I did 610 and 14% Revenue growth I did profit margin of 18 20 and 22 now if you look at their free cash flow margin it is lower it's been pretty consistent at 177% um because of their higher gross margin I did put a little bit higher free cash flow margin there PE of 17 2023 now desired any return so far back let's do our 9% in here boom low price of 115 to 130 high price of 510 to 560 middle price of 236 to 263 um I think I put it lower at 150 only because I was worried about recession coming imminently and maybe I could be more patient and buy at a better price realistically I probably should change it to a 170 strike price so I can at least then start selling puts at lower prices so I'm changing that on the software here it's already updated,1.0,0.8
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),British American Tobacco,British tobacco is an interesting company so tobacco is a not exactly a very popular business right now however British tobacco is down to $30 a share all-time high in 2017 of 46 bucks for those of you who love dividends can I tell you guys something right now 5% dividend yield look at this price the free cash flow if anybody out here is works at British tobacco can you please get them to cancel this dividend and buy back their shares guys $6.5 billion in dividends versus a $665 billion market cap they could be buying back 10% of the company every year if the stock stay at the same price they would drive up their earnings per share by 10x just by buying their shares back every single year but it'll drive up the price I think it's one of those situations where it's just a negative company based on the industry they're in but worldwide there's still good margin and still a growing World Africa India that's going to continue to smoke cigarettes and do other products and hopefully they take their cash flow and can diversify a little bit eight pillars 5year PE versus the fiveyear price of free cash flow I think there was a write off in here and that's why it's such a different because look at their five-year net income 17.13 very close to their fiveyear free cash flow of 18 so all right guys let's see let's look at analyst estimates even analysts have their EPS going up 484 a share to 752 Revenue declining though in the future not a lot of Revenue growth but again with good margin good multiple buy back their shares they're going to do great hopefully somebody can get out there and get them to buy back those shares I do the stock analyzer tool I just think this is a perception problem on the company September 23rd look at my assumptions of Revenue now this one I actually did do higher margin of desired return negative 3% Revenue growth so I'm having declining Revenue growth negative one and one 20 24 and 28 for profit margin free cash flow 30 33 36 look at my PE actually let me go yeah hit the analyze button look at this thing guys 43 to 65 70 to 90 55 to 75 this is not for the faint of heart the perception of this company has to change for Value to be released I'm making that bet will it happen or not I don't know I bought it around 30 so I'm a little bit down right now I'm fine with that if it fell to 15 and everything was still the same I'd probably buy more if it fell to 20 I'd buy more if it fell to 25 I'd buy more in fact let me add to my watch list at 275 and probably sell some puts on it,1.0,-0.1
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),3M,next company 3M they've had some legal issues lately their balance sheet isn't amazing not awful but not great free cash flow is great look at this they took their writeoffs and their lawsuits very early they showed a$7 billion loss here but look at that free cash flow 5 billion and 5.4 billion dividend 6.4% 10 times price of free cash flow 3M would you do me a favor would you save your $3.5 billion dollar you pay out in dividends every year and buy back your shares please or pay down your debt either one or a combination of both guys this is an example and I was talking to somebody the or our community where they said gosh I wish 3M would just stop paying this dividend I was like I agree with you 100% they're like yeah the stock would probably fall I'm like I don't care the stock needs to fall they need to stop their dividend and start buying back shares and paying down their debt that's it be a long-term investor don't be short-term oriented let's look at the eight pillars here 4 X's four checks is what it is not great look at this net income down 11 and a half billion because that write off so let's pull up stock analyzer tool with margin of safety in here 12 and a half% margin of safety it's still green low price 75 to 85 high price of 120 to 130 middle price of 95 to 105 with margin of safety of 12 and a half perc not bad 12 and a half% annualized return versus nine,1.0,-0.2
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),PayPal,next company PayPal we just did a video on this the other day PayPal is a company look at this all-time high was 31016 on July 26 2021 52e low 50 bucks that's down over 75 over 80% down I don't think PayPal is going away the revenue keeps going up there is an issue with PayPal the number of users has started to decline but their overall number of transactions as well as the value that transactions continues to climb do I like the fact that users declining absolutely not is that an issue absolutely but these valuation metrics I can't ignore the company I look at this thinking to myself okay look at analysts they're calling for double digigit EPS growth this is not a popular stock the stock has been beaten down from 310 to 50 there's two wide ranges here PayPal's dead PayPal's a value one of them is going to be probably right which one's it going to be I will say if I had 30 like PayPal to buy I would buy them I'd love to own 30 companies that look like this Revenue growth again High single digits low double digits Revenue growth according to analysts again take it with the grain of salt but let's pull up PayPal and our stock analyzer tool and see what it looks like this assumes no margin of safety 9% return 35 and 7% Revenue growth which I think is conservative over the next 10 years decent profit margin Higher free cash flow in the last five and 10 years than net income which is great guys here are my prices 4 50 to 60 on the low side 120 to 160 on the high side 80 to 100 in the middle I think the juice is worth the squeeze here that's my opinion but again if you're not feeling it you don't understand that stay away from PayPal,1.0,0.3
Everything Money,d5ZLSSFSu00,2024-03-12T12:00:37Z,I Bought 13 Stocks (Portfolio update),Alibaba,final company last but not least my biggest holding Alibaba I am down on my Alibaba and I am quite okay with that I think the negativity surrounding China is insane are there issues with China absolutely but China is a growing economy fast growing economy fastest growing middle class in the world yes it has a declining population but this is the number one company in China all-time high of 320 a share back in October of 2020 now it's at $75 per share guys I don't know what to tell you besides I mean look at this free cash flow of 26 a half billion versus 14 billion of net income fiveyear average free cash flow of 20 billion versus 15 billion they're buying back shares they announced a dividend Al Baba why'd you why'd you do a dividend come on guys this is seven times price of free cash flow just buy back your shares please stop with this dividend nonsense it's like I feel like I got to teach everybody that Dividends are not the greatest thing in the world especially when you have such a cheap company like this so let's just look at the analyst estimates here look at this 920 a share not big growth on EPS not B but funny thing is I look at this and I'm not understanding how is the revenue growth made to high single digits and the EPS growth not as much I don't get that but let's see let's look at stock analyzer tool Alibaba we did on February 7th no margin of safety here 3 six and 9% Revenue growth 15 19 and 23 profit margin free cash flow of 17 22 and 27 PE 1618 to 20 yada yada yada hit the analyze button it's green all around low price of 120 to 140 high price of 340 to 400 middle price of 200 to 240 guys if you want to see the other stocks I want to own the other 30 stocks I want to own watch this next video,1.0,0.2
Everything Money,dV6SZrhBUSo,2024-02-08T13:00:47Z,"My Thoughts On BABA, DIS, & PYPL Stock Earnings",Alibaba,three stocks that I own have reported earnings we're going to go over that right now stock number one Alibaba they're expected to do $262 per share they did 2.67 so they beat there but Revenue depending on who you looked at by the way Mo because I saw some places said they beat but 36.7 billion expected Revenue they did 36.6 the big news they were up pre-market up like four or five percent and the big news came out that they were initiating a $25 billion doll stock buyback and they fell after that I don't know if that was a timing but guys this company last year look let's look at let's look at this company in the last year this is incorrect about their free cash flow because of the new the new one year 25 billion in free cash flow the market Cap's 190 billion that's 7.75 times free cash flow guys the market right now is like a 20 some sometimes free cash flow this is a discount so what's the reason fear right Mo we talking about Baba for a while I have a position again it doesn't mean you should go have a position cuz I do but they should be buying back stock it's a cheap company we shouldn't criticize this and for all you people saying you don't actually own the company okay just if you believe that just stop watching the video because this is the way it is for a lot of companies out there especially China I get it there's a lot of fear around China and I'm not trying to sit there and say you shouldn't have fear about China of course there's fear I've had fear on China right but you look at this company and it's generating tons of free cash flow and their free cash flows above their net income which I love even more so I sit there and say is the juice worth the squeeze what not only those metrics are growing but the revenue is growing they all of their all of their individual kind of sector businesses are growing the biggest thing stopping this like you just said five times fear of China yeah and I don't blame people there's a lot of fear of China but I will say there's a lot of good news about China too it is still one of the world's most potentially growing economies now India is doing great but China is losing population right now but they're per capita income keeps growing the world still relies on China for a lot of China for a lot of manufacturing and things like that so this is alibaba's actual press release they talked about 5% year-over-year Revenue growth not the greatest not the best so I I'm not like sitting there jumping for joy on that one but a couple great things that happened here Revenue like I said 5% increase income from operations was actually a decrease of 36% year-over-year that is not the greatest but it was also attributed to this impairment charge of intangible assets that was the income from operations um net income again for that reason let's go focus on the free cash flow so I'm going to search for free cash flow $7.96 3 billion which is still a decrease of 31% in the same quarter they had um in the same quarter of 2022 but it was was attributed they have it right here increas in capex capex means they're investing back in themselves $8 billion in one quarter if they replicate that over and over again that's over $30 billion in free cash flow in the year for a company that's market cap is $190 billion for the nine months ended December 31st free cash flow was1 19.8 billion dollar and again I would look at the first quarter the first quarter was around 4.2 billion so it was roughly 24.3 to 24 5 billion for all of 2023 for a company that's market cap is 190 billion I'm never keep repeating this over and over they already had a $50 billion share buyback they've initiated another $25 billion share buyback this is a great return for the investors it's Alibaba saying our Shares are cheap we're going to reward you by buying back shares giving you a higher a bigger piece of the company as we continue to grow okay guys at the end of this video when we're we're done covering the next two companies we're going to do stock analyzer so the question is what price do we pay for these three companies let's first start with Alibaba and I'm G pull up out last time we did Alibaba in our community January 22nd now here's what I'm doing with Alibaba I'm going to do 9% across the board for our desired return and I'll explain to you why in just two seconds but for our Revenue I did three six and 9% Revenue growth for profit margin I did 151 19 and 23 free cash flow I dropped it to 1722 and 27 guys look at this free cash flow number I love the fact that it's all much higher than their profit margin that is incredible PE current PE of 10 I put 16 18 and 20 same with price of free cash flow now desired return I put a 9% for the market I like having margin of safety and that's why if you have our software you can put these higher numbers in my recommendation to you is if you first off if you don't trust China don't even look at this company don't even waste your time but if you if you want to buy in China but are a little still a little scared put a higher desire return that's your higher margin of safety if you put 20% return in you're going to get a very low number but this is where it is based on if the market was normalized analyze look at this 18 120 to 135 on the low side 330 to 392 on the high side 200 to 240 in the middle if you bought at today's prices and the middle numbers occur you're looking at a 10-year return of 28% based on a discounted cash flow model so I did the exact same numbers as you but I changed the died return to 15 20 and 25% and these are my numbers 80 to 90 on the low 114 to 134 on the high middle Middle's about $100 $105 but that's with a huge margin of safety and guys we don't know what's going to happen in the future I personally believe the juice is worth a squeeze here with Alibaba but I'm comfortable with the risks involved if you're not comfortable with China you must avoid this company,1.0,0.7
Everything Money,dV6SZrhBUSo,2024-02-08T13:00:47Z,"My Thoughts On BABA, DIS, & PYPL Stock Earnings",Disney,company number two good old Disney Disney was expected to do a doll four per share in earnings per share they did A1 four per share in earnings per share they're expected 23.7 s billion in Revenue they did 23.5 so they missed there now two so it's up 8% right now after hours two big pieces of news one they took a $ 1.5 billion investment in epic games to makeer of fortnite and two we're going to get the exact percentage but I believe they increased their dividend by 50% now their dividend used to be big Co hit they cut it back but they're having amazing Revenue like if you sit there and look at this company let's look at the quarter to quarter so in last year's they did 23.5 one billion in the last quarter of 2022 they did 23 point oh the same actually they so they did the exact same Revenue right here but you extrapolate that out for the year that's almost $100 billion in Revenue look what they've been doing even before Co that's another record year here on Pace for another record year I mean this is incredible my plan on Disney is one thing and one thing only are you ready look at this Revenue look at this profit margin right here last year was 2.6% Last 5 Years is 4.2 historically before covid they were at 10 to 15% so I'm sitting there saying listen just get back to 10% if you just get back to 10% how much more valuable is this company how much more can you do now I'm looking at this thinking to myself okay Disney if I gave you this market cap right here is 182 billion lower than F alib Baba if I gave you $182 billion and said go replicate Disney how well would you do go compete with Disney it's be very very difficult for you to exoss Yes it very very difficult now it all-time high was actually after covid $22 per share um this is an eight pillar that just looks terrible we have one check mark look at this one check Mark here Revenue growth guys there's a lot of things going around with Disney as a value investor what you want to find is temporary problems now this temporary problem has been ongoing but I look at Disney saying they've had some issues lately do I think Disney's going away I do not I do not at all mo did you find anything about epic games in their fortnite investment yeah so I want to show you so the here's the epic games thing Disney to take 1.5 billion stake in epic games um work with fortnite maker on new content now a couple of other things you were correct it's a 50% increase in the dividend um 45 cents per share also a couple other things I wanted to hit Hulu subscribers increased by 1.2 million from the prior quarter Disney plus core subscribers net additions between five and a half and six million wow so they're adding to those spaces of their business one more thing yeah they also plan a $3 billion repurchase in 2024 3 billion that just shows you how how big the Alibaba repurchase is 3 billion we're on track to meet or exceed our $7.5 billion in annual saving iny savings Target by the end of fiscal 2024 guys if they do 100 billion in revenue and they're saving 7.5 billion that adds 7.5% to that bottom line before taxes so I think Disney is a kind of company they're doing a lot of investment they're they're you know the streaming services guys is a very actually tough business right now it's very saturated I don't think that saturation is going to stay for the the foreseeable future there will be a point when there's consolidation people shut down and I think look at Disney and they have such a good library and ownership of a bunch of different movies different characters it's going to be a hard one to get rid of right I look at that going go ahead Mo and they're a monetizing machine I mean they can monetize shows into products into shows into products into movie it's just insane that the churn that they can do that no body else can really do yeah and look at this Mo we expect Disney plus core subscriber net additions of between 5 and a half to six and a half 5 and a half to six million and ongoing positive momentum and arpu average revenue per user in the second quarter that's a big growth for the second quarter right there wow yeah I mean what's the and the thing is what's the gross margin on on a Disney plus User it's got to be huge numbers over 90% so guys again I think Disney my play on it is a long-term play and we will get into the stock analyzer tool shortly but it's a long-term play based on them turning things around getting better with their costs and driving back that it's similar to my Southwest Airlines play it's a lower margin than they exper a much lower margin than they had before Co hopefully getting back to that lower margin because their revenue has absolutely crushed covid times and now let's go check out Disney here real quick okay let's go to Disney when was the last time I did Disney and our stock analyzer to Mo I did it January 17th so I did 2 and 1/2 5 1/2 and 62% Revenue growth now here's what I did with profit margin guys I did low side of six middle of 12 high of 18 because I'm hoping that in the next 10 years this really starts to increase because of Disney plus PE now look at these PE numbers because the profits been so low the PE is very skewed it shows 77 that's not the real PE I did 17 20 and 23 and I could argue it's much higher than that I could argue a much higher PE than 20 I mean it's the moat of Moes right it's a huge Mo here yeah and I did 9% desire return no margin of safety yet I hit the analyze button okay I have a low price of 46 high price of 268 a middle price of 130 so I feel comfortable here like to me I look at this going okay is it likely to be 6% uh margin for the foreseeable future probably not so I feel comfortable with this investment Mo what about you now I put in margin of safety of 12 14 and 16% 3765 on the low $160 on the high $90 in the middle that's with margin of safety again great,1.0,0.75
Everything Money,dV6SZrhBUSo,2024-02-08T13:00:47Z,"My Thoughts On BABA, DIS, & PYPL Stock Earnings",PayPal,guys stock number three PayPal this is the one that's hilarious to me guys they were expected to do a136 per share in EPS they did a dollar 48 beating handily by 10 almost 10% they're expected to do 7.87 billion in Revenue they did 8 billion and look at this down 4% after hours now they did guide for 2024 an EPS a 510 per share from 549 that might be the reason why but I look at this saying okay let's say they make $5 a share at 61 bucks that's a PE of 12 is a PE of 12 appropriate for PayPal listen there's a lot of negativity on PayPal but I want to remind you I'm not saying that pay hell is meta remember the article and the stories on meta when it was sub $150 a share when it was going down it was these guys don't get it there has been even though revenue and profit were going up people were still saying they're dying Etc do you hear the same thing with PayPal I do now again right now sentiment on PayPal is not the best I get that but I look at this and I think to myself is it being exaggerated well let's go look at the income statement for the four quarters well for such a company that people are saying can't beat apple and won't be able to compete with apple this is a lot this is revenue growth right here yes has it slowed but guys they own venmo do me a favor cash app me you're not you know why because I don't have cash app venmo me that's the verb it helps I'm not saying it's the be all end all I'm not saying that that makes it awesome but PayPal is secure they're safe they're Pro customer when I'm buying something that I'm like from overseas what do I buy with PayPal PayPal when I'm sending many money locally my fiance everybody venmo wasn't a big jump but last year's fourth quarter was 7.38 billion they grew to 8 billion okay so it's high single digit growth it's not huge don't get me wrong I'm not trying to sit there and say it's awesome but when a company is being told to you that they are dying you don't see Revenue increasing I'm sorry you just don't revenues increase 9% when you look at full year Financial results net revenues increased 8 and 9% um to 29.8 billion that's the number you just showed transaction margin dollars decreased however 1% okay see what else we have here um Gap operating income increased 31% to 5 billion non-gaap increased 14% to 6.7 billion yeah so by the way stocks rebounding now Mo look at this it's only down at 1.8% that's a crazy thing about earnings you just never know things can fluctuate guys I mean they beat on both if you told me the the morning that they would crush on earnings crushed on um Revenue not crushed but did better I just said oh yeah the stocks up but you don't have that you look at Alibaba they beat on profit they were up that's the point that we're trying to make like we don't look at quarterly results as our way of saying this is our thesis is right or our thesis is wrong we just sit there and want to see okay has anything changed in the company fundamentally and all three companies so far we haven't heard anything that says this is changing fundamentally do I wish Disney was buying back shares like Alibaba was yes I do I do wish they were buying back shares I know people love their dividends that they're bringing back when you talk about the GU the financial guidance we I like I would look at that price reaction and say okay guidance is probably down everything that I'm seeing here in guidance is an increase increase in revenues now it's 6 and a half and 7% versus the 9% so maybe that's it maybe it's less but every single thing in here is an increase now people are asking is this a a melting Ice Cube like to me melting Ice Cube is the newspaper business like it just slowly and slowly gets worse and worse and worse yeah I don't my personal and guys everybody's going to have their different opinion but I look at it I look at these financials Going H how is this in melting Ice Cube when revenue is increasing profits increasing it could be they could be on a cuss that I don't see absolutely so obviously do your due diligence and now let's check out PayPal pay pizzle again I'm going to do the 9% across the board not including any margin of safety so guys those of you who are used to our Channel I used to always put my own margin of safeties in there and the thing I found was if you you have to sit here and use the software for putting your own margin of safety in because you might have an immens great knowledge of some company or some sector that I don't so why should I show my bias in there for it I want you to be able to do that so I'm just trying to display how you do it here in our software so Revenue growth I did 48 and 12 for PayPal you know what maybe I should go a little bit lower let's go 3 six and nine Mo because okay they're not projecting that much okay profit margin I did 12 and a half 15 and a half 18 and a half and free cash flow I did now besides this last year free cash flow was always larger than his profit margin in the last five and 10 years it was larger so I did 16 20 and 24 sorry I did 12 and 1 half 15 and 1/2 18 and2 free cash flow did 16 20 24 now for PE I did 13 16 and 19 if it starts to not do well it becomes this crappy company 13 is fine for me and the 9% desire return I hit the analyze button I have a low price of 47 to 60 high price of 140 to 180 middle price of 82 to 105 if the middle assumptions occur and I pay today's price I'm looking at 16% return Mo did you do

Everything Money,jzSNayPtiyM,2024-02-03T13:00:40Z,My Reaction To The FED's 2024 Plan,Fed,everyone I'm going to give you my reaction to the fed's interest rate decision as well as their plan for the rest of the Year this is their press release and right here in support of its goals the committee decided to maintain the target range for fed funds at 5 and a quarter to 5 a half widely expected today right Mo I think it was like 98 and a half% expected no change today but they had a lot of comments to make first one recent indicators suggest the economic activity has been expanding a solid pace is it possible we have this Infamous soft Landing that not many of us thought could actually happen including myself including myself too it's possible I guess who would have thought that inflation would be so high and they would raise rates so quick and so fast and it would actually still be okay you know what I know here's the thing they're talking about they seek to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2% over the long run these are the Fed mandates these are the two mandates they have guys I hate to break it to you the FED should not care about your stock account their job is maximum employment and inflation at 2% and that's core inflation that excludes food and energy because of how volatile they are let's go a little bit further now the committee judges at the risk to achieving its employment inflation goals are moving into better balance that's a very cliche statement it is very true employment rate is still low 3.7% and fed chairman Powell specifically said that there are far more demand for workers and workers available and that means inflation I think that's what he's really worried about which the FED actually does want I don't necessarily give pow credit for that he did a great job of the thing I think pal deserves the most credit for is in the face of the public saying don't raise rates he said I'm raising rates fed Powell said it on the committee somebody looked at him and said what are you going to tell the 2 million people are going to lose their jobs because of your policies his comment was the 100 million families out there they're going to have inflation it's going to hurt them a lot more than the 2 million people who are losing their jobs which still stinks but the 2 million job losses didn't happen but his job he really does want to get from what I remember from my economic classes in college 5.5% give or take is about where they want to be for unemployment I think for the rest of the Year guys I think it's going to be a a situation where Powell really needs to look at the data I don't like the fact that he said not till May or June because I feel like that puts him on people saying well you said May or June,1.0,-0.1

Everything Money,DP9BV6DWtdU,2023-11-06T15:12:50Z,3 VALUE STOCKS $ENPH $CAT $QCOM,Enphase,end phase is number one big Falls last week Qualcomm and caterpillar so let's get into it the first thing we're going to look is end phase and end phase has really even caught my eye because of the Fall that it had and I'm actually let's look at this on the one month chart this thing is down 32% in the last month 40% over the last 3 months 50% over the last 6 months and year-to date down 68% this is one of those companies that's in the Solar world and this couldn't miss in 2020 early 2021 let's go into a few things here and see hey is it something that I'm interested right now let's find out it's an 11 billion company they generate revenue of 2.7 billion net income of 571 million and free cash flow over the last 12 months of 844 million as you as you've noticed in other our in our other videos we like to see free cash flow higher than net income and that's exactly what we're seeing here something else that Peaks out to me the return on invested Capital 31% basically and over the and over the last 12 months the return on Equity is 60.5% this is actually very surprising to me because I in my mind I put en phase in that category of oh this is a hype stock but when you really start digging into their financials it's actually pretty good gross profit margins of 45% profit margins of 21% now they're they're higher they're growing their profit margins you can see that their 5year average of 175 and over the last 12 months it's 21 so I really like to see that um the Enterprise Value is right in line with market cap as you've seen in our other videos we love to see that companies that are really really close I mean if their market cap was higher than the Enterprise Value that would be great because with the Enterprise Value you're including all of the debt so this is very very little debt let's pull up the eight pillar just so I can get a quick glance here now the first thing that I didn't look at shares outstanding that is a very very big number I wouldn't be I'm not totally surprised by it it's a new company it's in a growth phase they're just diluting shareholders most shareholders don't understand that and I'll go into that in a second but everything else looks pretty good they can pay off their debt very quickly as we said the return on invested capital is really good everything is looking pretty decent here the question to me honestly becomes is this some company that can sustain going into the future I guess I would look at this well I don't like what I'm seeing right here I'm seeing declining revenue for over the last two quarters you had 726 million in q1 711 in Q2 and now 551 million I would have to go in and say what exactly is that what is the reason for that let's see if their profits suffered their profit net income did H it's not that I mean it's a big drop this quarter but previous quarter it did not drop as the revenue did and shares oh interesting can't s of this over the last three quarters they have bought back shares man this is a tough one for me why don't we look at what the analysts are saying real quick before I put this into stock analyzer tool I mean they see this is a lot smaller growth than I would expect I would look at this and say okay December of 2023 this you're going to do $514 I would expect this number in 2027 to be 156 $17 this is not that much growth for a company that is in truly a growth phase now let's look at their revenue I mean their revenue is significantly higher than their earnings per share well this is going to be something to take a look at I want to look at their earnings report to see if there was anything glaring that stood out to me did not like the decrease in Revenue let's see here and your decreased Revenue in Euro decreased approximately 34% okay our Revenue in the United States decreased 16% all right let's see what I would pay for this company and before I do this this doesn't mean that I'm going to buy it this I don't own it right now this doesn't mean that I'm going to buy it it just means maybe I'll get interested at some point so let's see with Revenue growth let's go with um let's go with 10 um you know I'm going to go 1015 and 20 because I was going to go 1020 and 30 I just don't I think that's too much profit margins they are increasing their profit margin so I'm going to put in here 20 25 and 30% because they have shown that they can consistently increase that profit over uh year over-ear free cash flow margin I'm going to put in the same numbers for the sake of ease PE Let's go with 17 20 and 23 17 20 and 23 on the 23 side on the high highest end if they're doing 20% Revenue growth with profit margins of 30% I'm going to say yeah they're a leader in this industry and for my return I'm going to go with 15 um 18 and 21% let's see what we have here current price is 8175 okay so if you believe these numbers that I put in my assumptions then yeah it could be falling into that range it's still not hitting my low range and that's where I would error as caution on this kind of company that's just my personal opinion if you

Paul guess who follows Us on YouTube I said who he goes Chris DeStefano. if you don't know who Chris Stefano is there are like literally two or three comedians I follow he is one of them I love this guy two I follow what was that there's two I follow he's one of them one of the two he came to Cleveland a few months ago he went and saw it I think he's hilarious. I saw this bit he did about 911 and his story about 9 11 back in the day he did it on 9 11 in New York in a comedy seller and I watch it I've literally watched there was like a time like three weeks I watched it every single day and I watch it at least once every week or two I love it. so of course I email them I I call as a manager because now he's talking about money he's talking about investing and he follows us I don't know listen he could be one of those things I don't think he's just randomly falling if he is okay but if anybody knows him we would love to have him on the show because I think he's absolutely the funniest guy in the I mean he's literally hilarious him and Bill Burr are like the bee's knees to me right. yeah so we're gonna we're gonna do a reaction video to Chris Christie chaos his podcast we talk about money and investing in finance and we're gonna check it out. I really hope I don't want to punch Chris after this because I think he's hilarious plus he could probably he's on steroids for it's funny I wrote the email I'm like listen every comedian every famous person in the world here is I'm a big fan I can't stand it when people say that to famous people like hey I'm a huge fan it's like no you're not but literally when Lisa and I ask each other we want hummus whoever asks the other person goes not today not to literally my fiance will say not today what was the head you gotta watch the 911 skit if you haven't so let's put the link of the 911 one well John we'll drop the link in there please watch our video first and then watch the 911 thing it starts out a little slow but his storytelling is incredible so guys we're gonna check out this Christa Stefano and his I love him Chrissy chaos let's check this out. we've been saying that we're gonna do Chris's Finance corner on patreon patreon.com Christy comedy and I just continuously do it for free on YouTube because I'm bad but you can't go to patreon.com Christy comedy for hours and hours and hours worth of footage that you can only see there and it's fun and we're going to think of new exciting ways to get that pumping although namesh Patel did say before the camera started rolling that why are we not okay with things not always getting better and things just being level why does that upset us you know what's funny about that I've noticed he so he has a thing on Instagram where he calls it like Christy Confucius when he talks about things like this like I used to be obsessed with grow now I'm like no I just want to grow the things I grow in a reasonable rate I want to enjoy the process so that's a really good question he's asking to start. I'm surprised by that I am too what would you have thought the number would be 50. yeah that's what I thought too I thought he has 10 million now yeah maybe he does maybe he does but I would think that it would be 50. I do think that once he hits 10 million the number will change maybe maybe that's what I think you might be right it all depends on where he is emotionally remember just because you you want to hit something does it is the question is do you feel like a complete utter failure if you don't hit that goal Warren Buffett seems very satisfied with his wife whether he has 100 billion or 50 billion or 10 billion or 3 billion right yeah he still wants to make more money though doesn't stop him from making more money and I think that's the big key here is like once Chrissy chaos what's Chris the Stefano hits his 10 million number that could all of a sudden stop he'll just be like listen now I don't have to now have to grind anymore the hustle look at me I stepped on a CEO and I started to really understand that I wanted to enjoy life and do the things I want to do and I had more money than I needed does that mean I stopped I still charge for our software here why because I still want to make money I still want to be worth my time but now I say no to more things now I say no to 98 of things when before it was probably I said no to 80 of things right so I think his thing is like I want to be able to take care of my family blah blah and because I'm quite sure if Netflix offered him a five-year a five show special for 100 million dollars he ain't saying no go no I just need 10. right he's still gonna say yes but the point is does he need does he think he needs that in order to be happier that's the question. hey Chris one percent a lot you're out there let's meet we'll do a show we'll do and I'll get you to fire that advisor and save your one percent a year it'll lead to millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars extra tens of millions of extra in your lifetime by doing that and we'll show you in retirement calculator yes what that equates to because one percent sounds like nothing right now it's a huge but when you have 10 million bucks it's gonna be a hundred thousand dollars especially when you have the earning potential you have and you're 38 years old yeah is inevitably it doesn't matter if you're a good or bad guy they're going to think about them first it's human wow what I've been trying to do is give right now as I don't know let them take their one percent commission and do what they do they aren't experts certainly no they're not they know a lot more knowledgeable than me and hold back a certain amount of money that I would have given to them to do see what I can do by myself and then try to learn as much as I can that's been my plan so far it has worked some of the largest I've seen happen is like athletes were to start like an investment Club yes Tiki Barber did that like my my finance my one of my closest one of my closest friends is big Finance guy like even when he like right after graduation like him and his like people of his IL cool had the money and like would get like Investment Banking bonuses they would put that money uh like the word five very smart guys we have networks we can look for opportunity yeah but intelligence doesn't matter it's emotional fortitude it matters that's the big thing I'm listening to him and I'm like yeah for a guy that says he doesn't really know a lot you're saying a lot of things that are like there's some potential there. all right guys so again if you happen to know Krista Stefano tell them this short guy wants to talk to you or Chris if you watch this come and join us yes thank you very much guys uh yeah we like what we see so far we'd love to be able to and I'm glad he's getting involved with that I hope he sticks with it even the market being down 50 at some point I hope he still sticks with that because it's very hard to do that thank you very much for your time,1.0,0.9

Warren Buffett seems very satisfied with his wife whether he has 100 billion or 50 billion or 10 billion or 3 billion right yeah he still wants to make more money though doesn't stop him from making more money and I think that's the big key here is like once Chrissy chaos what's Chris the Stefano hits his 10 million number that could all of a sudden stop he'll just be like listen now I don't have to now have to grind anymore the hustle look at me I stepped on a CEO and I started to really understand that I wanted to enjoy life and do the things I want to do and I had more money than I needed does that mean I stopped I still charge for our software here why because I still want to make money I still want to be worth my time but now I say no to more things now I say no to 98 of things when before it was probably I said no to 80 of things right so I think his thing is like I want to be able to take care of my family blah blah and because I'm quite sure if Netflix offered him a five-year a five show special for 100 million dollars he ain't saying no go no I just need 10. right he's still gonna say yes but the point is does he need does he think he needs that in order to be happier that's the question. Warren Buffett says Warren Buffett will not invest in advance unless he understands it inside and out surprised he said Warren Buffett these to say no to 350 000 yes and this is not the one percent like he said this is the I think it's something like 50 000 families in this country make over five million dollars a year maybe it's a hundred thousand so I look at that going if you're talking about billionaires you're talking about like literally you know I think there's only like 800 billionaires in this country yeah no maybe it's more no I think it's like 100 billionaires in the 700s I'll look it up by the way I was gonna say 700 I think it hurts like 740 but I think it's probably increased since that 735. there you go how long ago was that 2023 yeah okay let's keep going live within my means without having to do all this work do you have an advisor I do but I think that I don't give them all my money because they get one percent so and I get it and oh I trust them but anybody who gets the percentage of your money,1.0,0.9

Everything Money,TnK6mBq5B6E,2023-02-27T16:00:18Z,HOW Does Amazon Do It? | Amazon Stock Analysis 2023 | Stocks to Buy?,Amazon,Amazon alone would account for five percent of the US economy right now it accounts for two percent okay Amazon is in the news because employees I'm shocked to hear this are trying to encourage the new CEO to drop his return to office mandate so when I see this Amazon stuff I think to myself okay first off they have like a billion employees but then we talk about Amazon the company now Amazon is something that has just owned my brain for a long time I don't understand Amazon let's pull it up on our software and start taking a look at what we think about here's the reason why I'm confused by Amazon Amazon has AWS this very high margin high fat fast growing business right it's hard for me when company when they have this Amazon web services just driving everything and it's the only thing keeping them afloat at this point that's the hard thing for me so that's the thing guys of all their business ventures AWS right now for the for a few quarters now has been the only profitable part of the business which is fine but there has to be a path to profitability on the retail side right their advertising portion of the retail side is getting better and that's a very high margin business but when I look at Amazon and I look at this cash flow for the last 10 years you know it's been it's been growing two to seven ten six 17 21 26 and then he's and again these two years of negative cash flow I mean look at these astronomical Capital expenditures and I think that's another thing that puts it in a too hard category so let's go back to the previous decade when Amazon was still generating good free cash flow decent free cash flow I mean hit a few billion dollars a couple times their income statement didn't look as good because they're probably depreciating all that but is this a high Capital intensive business is my question is this a business that requires a lot of capital to stay really competitive to which I would say then this sucks feels like a car business to me now now there's a lot of Great Value investors who love Amazon have had it for a very very long time so I'm completely completely saying that they see something I don't see but it's very difficult for me to look at Amazon and say no brainer apart from the excitement of how big it is yeah and then you can get a package to your door in an hour yes and I love that and I'm so spoiled now that when I see something that deliver tomorrow I'm like tomorrow I know I gotta wait absolutely love that but again at some point I need to see a dollar start flowing in big time so one of the things I would do with Amazon is figure out what these 60 billion dollars in previous next decade in in capital expenditures have been like this is a big jump I mean Amazon has completely owned my brain completely absolutely owned my brain it's up two percent today that's interesting yeah and now the Market's back up today of course it is so when you look at this and look at analyst estimates about what were you looking at I was just trying to see if I could find their Capital expenditures so cash providing Capital expenditures including leases improvements let's see here cash used in investing 59.6 billion 58.2 billion in 2020 in 2021 with investments in additional capacity to support fulfillment operations and supportive continued business growth and Technology infrastructure which Investments were okay we made cash payments yeah I mean that's the same stuff they're gonna say at some point though at some point they've got to start making money on that like significant money because it comes hey Mo what's the market Capital oh I'll look it up hang on a second the market cap is a trillion dollars guys so a company that large if you apply a 20 multiple 20 you need 50 billion dollars in free cash flow and earnings we're nowhere close to that what do we do in free cash flow we had negative free cash flow were earnings last year it was a loss in their best year ever they did 33 billion dollars in in positive profit how much free cash flow Addition and that four and fourteen point six billion of it was other income expenses they negative free cash flow of course negative so they need to get the 50 billion dollars in free cash for their highest free cash flow is 25.93 billion and that was 2020. that was when the world shut down and everybody was using Amazon yeah best case scenario they could possibly have now let's go look at analyst estimates analysts expect 1.72 in profit this year per share like stocks currently in 96 divided by 1.72 what is that 55p something like that okay 2027 though eight dollars a share all right listen I hope that happens it still makes it a 12 times PE for four years from now what's the four-year PE on anything four years from now it should be much lower than that look at Revenue okay 575 billion estimated this year almost a trillion in 2027. man good growth here on Revenue yeah it is good growth on Revenue good growth and they have a decent roic over the last five years I'm surprised to see it was uh nine percent yeah nine percent on the nose I'm actually surprised by that I thought it'd be lower than that so let's do stock analyzer tool MO I'm gonna do a 20-year analysis you do the 10-year now guys it's especially important and if you like the software and you like the stock analyzer tool about ready to do we're running a special right now seven dollars for seven days come check out the software it's literally a dollar a day to test it out join the community of thousands of people you can have a this is literally justifiable if you just want to analyze one company and talk to people about one company that's it and this is the reason why this is going so well for people is it's a community of like-minded investors who can talk to each other about investing without getting egos involved and all that stuff so Moe you're gonna do a 10-year I'm gonna do a 20-year analysis and I'm gonna do rev we're going to do Revenue growth profit margin a new exclusive video um free cash flow margin assigning a PE and price of free cash flow and then a desired return okay I'm doing for the next 20 years okay all right so profit margin okay so guys I did it's hard to do when we're looking at these companies when I got 20 years I do a much lower um Revenue growth assumption and the reason being is it's 20 years out the company the company's expected hit a trillion dollars in Revenue in the next four or five years what's it going to do in 20 is it possible to go 10 a year for 20 years no but I put that in there but I'm going to show you how ridiculous this number is they're gonna do they did 500 billion last year right yeah so 20 10 a year for 20 years oops I love this 1.1 to the 20th power would take us to 3.4 trillion dollars in Revenue in the next in 20 years okay maybe what would the US GDP be by then if nominal GDP growth is four call it four and a half percent a year let's call it five percent a year for 20 years and we're currently at 26 trillion 69 trillion dollars and they're expecting to do 3.3 of that they would Amazon alone would account for five percent of the US economy right now it accounts for two percent yeah okay is that okay maybe I'm terribly off but it's but this is still a high number ideal situation for the for the almost the largest revenue company in the country to grow 10 a year for the next 20 years that seems difficult but it could yeah so I did four seven and ten Mo what'd you do I did six nine and twelve okay for ten years yeah profit margin I did three four and a half and six percent I did two and a half three and a half and four and a half okay free cash flow margin I did the same three four and a half six percent I went lower I went two three and four okay PE I did 15 17 19. I did the same thing same with price of free cash flow and for the return I did 10 12 and 14 okay the stocks go in 97 bucks I have a low price of 25 a high price of 70. middle price of 45. I have it on my watch list at 60. I should probably change that to 50. what's yours Mo I'm 18 to 24 uh 50 to 57 in Middle about 35 watch list of 60. again I'll probably so guys the point here is to us this is overpriced I don't care which metric you're looking at we could have the range B and the range has always changed depending on how far out we look the assumptions we make it's always going to change in every video but the key here is the correct stocks 2096 and assuming the best case scenario that I view it's a 70 stock I'm out so thanks very much guys again seven dollars for seven days check it out,1.0,-0.6

Everything Money,-6IDogFToMc,2023-02-20T21:00:00Z,This Peloton Stock Analysis Will SHOCK You! | pton stock price |  pton stock analysis,Peloton,oh how I love Peloton stock guys enjoy our new videos if you notice there are no YouTube ads on this video and the vast majority of our videos coming out the reason being we want to focus on the content and our software so enjoy Peloton now for those of you who are new please go back and watch our past Peloton videos when we were saying at these levels that that Peloton was not making any sense to us and we said listen this is a temporary jump it came off of covid covet was a nice jump but they still weren't able to make money and we said we just don't get it people looked at us and said you don't get it that idiot from Russia slash Israel I don't know I don't remember the guy who went to Michigan he said we didn't understand he at 180 a share said Peloton was an absolute buy maybe it wasn't 180 because the all-time high says here 171 so either way it was up there and now the stock what was that semantics semantics now this talks at 15.62 which is up a lot year to date it's up 92 percent year-to-date Mo and it's still 15 bucks it's still 15 I don't think a lot of people realize when a stock Falls from 170 to 7 how much it has to go up to get back to 170. here is the profit and free cash flow of Peloton over the last five years loss loss yippee covidere they made 166 million loss and loss it's okay it took a global pandemic shutting down every gym in the country for them to make money yep guys let's go look at our eight pillars for Peloton whoops I mean this is ridiculous this is absolutely Insanity let's look at analyst estimates they're not even projecting them to be profitable in 2027 and I think analysts are overly optimistic yeah this is what I don't get let's look at Revenue where's the revenue growth this major amazing company is only going to grow by 20 or 25 in the next four years guys by the way we both have pelotons we love our pelotons we don't subscribe to the software anymore because I just use it purely for treadmill and I could have bought a lot cheaper treadmill than the four thousand dollar one I have that I just walk on but I love it it's wonderful separate the stock from the company and I don't see apart from this company math and by the way the new CEO is saying they're making major headways towards profitability but the issue is guys when you buy a company at 180 a share it was 10 times greater the company was a 45 billion dollar company essentially 45 billion dollar company with three billion dollars in Revenue that's 15 times that's more than soft than Microsoft and other software companies and look at this gross margin guys Microsoft has a 68 gross margin Peloton is 19. that means for every extra sale they do 19 goes to pay for overhead in taxes while Microsoft is 68 it goes to overhead in taxes and which one should sell for a premium what does Peloton have to do what does Pelton have to make in order to justify this price well let's see 4.2 billion dollar market cap but it's got growth potential but it can't make money I'm gonna be official with this this isn't a too hard pile for me this is not even in the realm of trying to figure out which direction this is going to go I have no idea how to understand this business I've said it for I think we both said it for about a year as a great company to be acquired by somebody yeah I thought Amazon would be a great acquirer or Google or Apple or Nike look at the number of shares outstanding 233 280 293 317 342. guys what this means is if you own the stock back here you brought on how many more Partners along the way yeah yeah these are all people that you didn't get to choose to be your partners and now Peloton is going to split now you could argue the losses along with them so you're getting less of a loss along the way but come on this is insanity this is what makes it very very difficult to make money for every Apple there's probably 200 other ones and I'm guessing that did not turn it around so if your goal is to play the lottery and eventually win it and hopefully make your entire that's what you're doing here when you buy companies like Peloton even at 15 a share I can't look at you and say this is a good deal even when it was 6.68 I had no idea yeah that's the hard part I did and that's why I say it's a too hard pile if you told me a dollar a share or a hundred I don't know the difference you might sit there and say come on that's extreme no it's just understanding that when you buy a stock you're buying a piece of a business if I cannot value the business because I don't understand how they're going to make money no price makes sense to me Warren Buffett says offer me all the Bitcoin in the world for 25 bucks I ain't taking it because he doesn't know what it's worth same thing here I don't know what peloton's worth let's go even look at their debt what does their debt look like Mo I actually stopped looking I was going to look at they have 3.3 billion dollars in total liabilities okay 3.3 the revenue is 3.3 total current assets of 2.06 billion the revenue is 3.3 yeah her revenue is 3.3 they have as much revenue as they have debt wow but look at a company like Microsoft it's not the same thing I look at these things guys saying come on at least Microsoft even if it does Microsoft might have it but they have spit off tens of billions of dollars of cash flow every single year Peloton is not so if you're out here and this makes sense to you subscribe to the channel this is something that really makes a lot of sense for us and it might not make sense to you because you're probably trying to chase something and it'll take a bear market and you'll probably go wait a second those a-holes on everything money they said this but I didn't want to listen to them go back to 12 18 months ago when I don't know when this was when was this at 180 share Paul January of 2021 so go back and watch videos around January of 2021 and see what we were saying about it when it was around 180 a share and compare it to now and see how it's all come about and we we stood by ourselves back then saying this doesn't make any sense that's the difference between us and other YouTubers we have multiple businesses we don't need to say what you want to hear in order to sell you ad space do we sell software absolutely but this software solves major problems for people that they have when they invest the emotional the numbers everything like that so I will stand by that all day long but when you look at this and you look at this long-term chart overall since it went public it's down 40 percent yeah since it went public and guys this is a prime example great product crappy stock crappy stock why what's behind the stock I have no idea I have no idea how this company makes money and that idiot in Russia wherever he is kept saying I'm a value investor that he's a value investor I'm like how does a value investor value this you can't they don't have free cash their own net income it's all hype it was selling for 15 times Revenue that made no sense for a company with these kinds these are car company margins car companies sell for between 0.5 and 1 times Revenue this was selling for 15 times Revenue that's 15 to 30 times more I'd rather give you buy Ferrari and overpay for Ferrari even buy this crap and any assumption that you would make in Stockton 100 I guess I could put in their negative five Revenue growth I could put in plus 15 plus 30. I have no idea no clue all of them are viable now what am I saying I'm not gonna buy Peloton ever no as the information changes my view will change if the CEO is able to turn things around big time and get to cash flow profitability and some sort of way of getting to ongoing growth different story altogether and if that means Peloton goes from 15 to 45 until it realizes that but at 45 I can determine a value and it's much higher than 45 I will buy it but in the meantime I can't make heads or tails of it so for that reason I'm out,1.0,-0.8
Everything Money,-6IDogFToMc,2023-02-20T21:00:00Z,This Peloton Stock Analysis Will SHOCK You! | pton stock price |  pton stock analysis,Microsoft,the company was a 45 billion dollar company essentially 45 billion dollar company with three billion dollars in Revenue that's 15 times that's more than soft than Microsoft and other software companies and look at this gross margin guys Microsoft has a 68 gross margin Peloton is 19. that means for every extra sale they do 19 goes to pay for overhead in taxes while Microsoft is 68 it goes to overhead in taxes and which one should sell for a premium what does Peloton have to do what does Pelton have to make in order to justify this price well let's see 4.2 billion dollar market cap but it's got growth potential but it can't make money I'm gonna be official with this this isn't a too hard pile for me this is not even in the realm of trying to figure out which direction this is going to go I have no idea how to understand this business but look at a company like Microsoft it's not the same thing I look at these things guys saying come on at least Microsoft even if it does Microsoft might have it but they have spit off tens of billions of dollars of cash flow every single year Peloton is not,1.0,0.8
