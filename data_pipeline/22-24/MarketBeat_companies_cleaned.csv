MarketBeat,vjwOCgikLwM,2024-12-30T23:10:54Z,3 Stocks that Wall Street Insiders Can't Stop Buying,Vesus,vesus is the most bought by insiders for the last year vesus is a spin-off from Aramark it's their uniform business um now it's a standalone company it's competing with UniFirst and Centos it's about the same size as UniFirst it's about a sixth size of Centos um one of the opportunities here is that it's a potential takeover candidate so what does that mean for the growth of the stock price some the chatter is that the stock is about 15 to 25% undervalued relative to a potential takeover price not counting that potential for takeover uh this company this industry is well positioned for cash and cash flow if you look at Centos it's been producing really awesome cash flow for about three decades uses that money to pay dividends buy back shares that stock price has been going just pretty much straight up as as straight up as it possibly can be invest is in that that that group it's been improving its balance sheet and preparing itself for Capital returns it already pays a nice dividend but what I see here is the potential for share BuyBacks to begin sometime soon if it's not taken over or taken private and what kind of Insider buys are we seeing with vesus so vesus has nine insiders that have been buying for the last year they've made more than a dozen purchases they've been pretty regular throughout the year and they're pretty widespread it shows a pretty good amount of conviction within this group that the stock is worth buying I think you have put vesus as a pretty solid buy for investors right now,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,vjwOCgikLwM,2024-12-30T23:10:54Z,3 Stocks that Wall Street Insiders Can't Stop Buying,opco Health,your second pick of a stock that insiders are buying is a little bit more of a wild card yeah it is opco Health it has quite a few potential catalysts coming up one of them is potential for takeover it's also got a couple of candidates or um drug therapies that have been gaining traction they're making some Revenue uh but the real problem with this stock is that it's not making money and even with these new positive developments it's going to be a while before it's profitable its balance sheet is not in the greatest Condition it's had to sell a lot of shares over the last year to raise Capital so ution is a real threat so in this case the Insiders buying is a vote of confidence but it could also just be them trying to support the stock price in the interim until one of these other catalysts can start taking control of the market well like with vest it's it's a wide range of insiders we're tracking seven insiders whove made 24 purchases in the last year so they've all made more than one buy they are certainly showing a high amount of conviction in the stock but there are some significant risks that investors need to keep in mind the analysts see um quite a bit of upside potential the stock could rise 30 to 40% if we get one of those catalysts uh but as I said it just depends on if it gains enough traction to start making money soon enough for the market to stay interested,1.0,0.2
MarketBeat,vjwOCgikLwM,2024-12-30T23:10:54Z,3 Stocks that Wall Street Insiders Can't Stop Buying,gri,let's move on to your third pick of Insider buys this is a company we haven't covered before no this is gri uh they're an Industrial Packaging company so they make things like Jerry cans and plastic barrels and oil cans and other services involved with storing Industrial Products a wide variety of insiders making numerous purchases over the past year um they are certainly helping to support the stock price um if you look at the chart you can see it's been range Bound for about two years but it's got a pretty solid floor and that floor is put in place by the Insiders but also by the institutions and the analyst who can be considered insiders uh they've both been buying the stock the analysts are pretty bullish on it and they see it Rising about 30% uh that aligns with the trading range so it looks like this stock could hit a bottom fairly soon and start rebounding how can investors time this kind of a stock buy well you're going to want to watch the charts you're going to want to pick out some pretty good technical entry points and then wait for the market to reach those points and to start showing a signal that signal will be shown in the price action and the indicators and it should align with a bottom and a bit of a rebound you're going to want to see some volume also in this move to help solidify the the bottom and to help add some strength to the market and provide some more upside momentum once the the price starts to move higher,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,ccEoBKL8LN8,2024-12-27T02:29:27Z,3 Underrated AI Stocks Set to Surge in 2025,SoundHound,you know we've seen that in the market this week with SoundHound an AI application that's been incredibly popular for different businesses joining in on this application um and that is really taking off so uipath is probably closest to SoundHound for people that want to put it in a bucket although it's not it doesn't do exactly what soundtown does.,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,ccEoBKL8LN8,2024-12-27T02:29:27Z,3 Underrated AI Stocks Set to Surge in 2025,UiPath,so the first one is uip path uh this is a midcap stock market cap somewhere around I think 7 billion as I'm as as you and I are talking here Bridget so uipath is probably closest to SoundHound for people that want to put it in a bucket although it's not it doesn't do exactly what soundtown does but what it does it's a software company and it specializes is in what's known as robotic process automation technology RPA and what they do is they work with Enterprise level customers to do your chatbots and other sorts of automated tasks some of the bigger Nam clients that they have would be mongodb and flutter entertainment but one of the key things for investors to know is they work throughout a variety of sectors you're talking about banking you're talking about Healthcare you're talking about Manufacturing I mean they cover the gamut and right now the stock is down 44% for the year so there does look like there's room for some upside yeah that's the upside that a lot of investors are interested in what are analysts saying about how far this stock could grow in the next year the consensus uh price for the stock is about $17.50 that's from the analyst covered by market beat some of that is um from a couple of different analysts JP Morgan Chase being one of that gave it a price target of $18 um I'm seeing a lot of analysts looking at that $16 range but still when you look at a stock that's trading for around $13.86 as you and I are talking right now that's significant upside for a stock like this and what I've noticed is in the last month the Stock's up about 11% short interest is up about 8% so I don't know how much of the price movement up is some short sellers trying to cover their positions or if this is organic interest in the stock but either either way now might be a really interesting time for investors to get in on the stock yeah any other factors that this company could see some more growth in the next year are there more businesses buying into what they offer I think that's that's what we're going to have to watch out for but certainly that's what analysts would seem to be dictating again this is not a this isn't a company that's that's super Niche their their products uh the software that they have is useful for a variety of Industries a variety of applications you're going to want to watch for strong growth in not only Revenue but also in earnings the company now looks like there's um consistently turning a profit that's good that needs to continue a and you also want to be seeing that year-over-year Revenue growth.,1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,ccEoBKL8LN8,2024-12-27T02:29:27Z,3 Underrated AI Stocks Set to Surge in 2025,Intuitive Surgical,all right let's move on to your second pick and this is a stock we've talked about before on this channel yeah it's intuitive surgical the U ticker symbol is isrg this is a this is a large cap company that a lot of investors are familiar with in the area of robotics specifically the company's known for their Da Vinci system which is a robotic surgical assistant it's a variety of products that are make that that are used to make up this da Vinci system the stock has not been a poor performer this year whatsoever the Stock's up about 61.6% and the stock trades for over $500 a share so some people might say boy there's very little room for the stock to go up but that doesn't seem to be the case yeah so what can make this company see even more growth in in 2025 and what are the analysts expecting for this one the Catalyst uh for growth is just simply the fact that the company is always expanding on the da Vinci system so they're always fine-tuning it making it better it's sort of like a flywheel type of thing the more hospitals and and Physicians start to use it the more there's other hospitals and Physicians that want to use it so it becomes sort of that one of the other things that might help is the fact that interest rates are going down so it may be something that might fit into more budgets uh that maybe it didn't fit into when interest rates were going up and isrg at that time actually the stock suffered a little bit in 2022 and 2023 as interest rates were going up but that's pivoting a little bit sounds good well you can watch our other video if you want to learn a little bit more about this company what's behind it and why isrg continues to be a strong pick here on this channel.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,tUIUbLJGy8k,2024-12-19T22:01:17Z,The Real Reason Tesla Stock Is Soaring – and Why Tech Expert Says It Won’t Stop,Tesla,Tesla stock is taking off yet again here to talk about what's behind this recent runup is a special guest this week we have Jeff Brown with Brownstone research with us today so glad that you could be here you have been a big supporter and fan of Tesla for quite a few years now that's right I uh you know I first uh formerly recommended Tesla back in April of 2018 and if you think back to that time it was a very very contentious stock some people were claiming it was a fraud that the accounting was off that they were uh losing money on every car that they sold that it was destined to go bankrupt I mean it was there was so much negativity about Tesla back at that time and the reason was the the framework that they were looking at Tesla the the general thought was this is a car company and so they were trying to measure the performance of Tesla in the same way that they were looking at you know Ford or General Motors it it was just the wrong framework and to you know to me Tesla at that time had some material advantages over the rest of the industry you know they completely designed new manufacturing processes their efficiencies were very different than the traditional automotive industry but the architecture of their cars their vehicles was different you know they they designed a software system around which which they built essentially a robot actually it was a car or you know now it's actually a truck but you know it was a computer architecture and it was one that could be updated just like we update our PCS or laptops today with with regular software updates you didn't have to bring them into the dealer anymore Tesla also had um some real breakthroughs in terms of their lithium ion uh battery chemistries in particular which gave them also another advantage over the rest of the electric vehicle makers so not just the automotive the rest of the automotive industry but EV makers but really the center at the very center of my investment thesis around Tesla was all about artificial intelligence and the point I made back in 2018 which no one was talking about was that Tesla was at that time one of the world's most successful artificial intelligence companies and that AI development was going to be the secret to its future growth and that was April 2018 well it's certainly paying off today they are like you said a major AI leader and their stock price is absolutely going through the roof right now ever since the election Tesla has seen incredible growth yeah uh what's behind some of this recent growth and this Resurgence in their stock price well you you know it's really interesting because up until I would say six weeks ago uh generally speaking the industry Wall Street was really looking at Tesla as still an EV manufacturer and they actually quite negative because on as a whole uh electric vehicle sales were declining so not not Tesla in particular but there was this sentiment in the market that the electric vehicle industry was kind of suffering and slowing down a bit and and they were kind of projecting that would continue over the next few years and then um we really turned a corner I think a lot of people are suggesting that it was because of what the outcome of the elections and because of mus role in uh the Trump Administration that's why the Stock's running but that's not really what's happening what's happening is this series of announcements that Tesla's had regarding its artificial intelligence so specifically it's autonomous driving technology which is an artificial neural netor nwor that they've been developing over a number of years and what's been extraordinary is what's uh happened in the next or in the last I would say three or four months so uh Tesla had been releasing a series of new uh full self-driving they call it full self-driving it's uh autonomous driving technology FSD new versions of its FSD software on his Teslas and I have a Tesla which I uh have just to test every new software release so I can track these things very closely anyway what happened was um there were very uh rapid improvements in the self-driving software over these three or four months and in fact on November 30th it released its latest version which is uh version 13.2 and 13 was the version that um uh had been spoken of as the solution to essentially fully autonomous software so level five which has the capability of what we would refer to as unsupervised self-driving so what does unsupervised mean it means literally you can get into the car sit back take a nap and basically be transported to your destination without having to do a thing and so you know what's happened since version 13 came out is it is is phenomenal its performance is really unbelievable I mean it was fabulous 3 months ago but where version 13 is is truly remarkable it's it's incredibly human in terms of the way that it drives you know it's just aggressive enough it's can get through very complex situations very naturally it's extremely smooth and anyone any analyst who has actually experienced it can know when they experience what that looks like that something very special is happening and so the the kind of importance the importance of this particular event is that um you know Tesla is planning on getting approval for unsupervised self-driving technology in at least two states next year and the Front Runners are Texas and California and once that happens he's planning on announcing his Robo tax Network and so any Tesla unit any Tesla owner or even someone that's leads to Tesla can opt in their car into Tesla's future Robo taxi Network so when you're not using your car you hit your smartphone you tell your Tesla to go out and work for you and it generates income every day if your Tesla is generating enough income for you on a monthly basis to pay for your monthly car loan or monthly lease do you think more Teslas will be sold it it's pretty simple it pays for itself and so that's what's happening with this stock right now they've recognized more broadly what the implications of this technology are for Tesla as a company not only will this increase sales of its own EVS by the way not other companies EVS but Tesla EVS right because they have both the hardware and software to enable this level five unsupervised driving but it's also the foundation for what it recently announced I'm sure you saw the Cyber cab announcement right pretty futuristic absolutely looking car self-driving car no brake no accelerator no steering wheel just a screen two seats that's it phenomenal right but now that you see how version 13 is working you can see that those cars will in fact work people are starting to really see what the long-term strategy is for Tesla and now that they can see that technology is very real the rest the future revenues that are forecasted from things like the Cyber cab you can also believe are coming as well and that's why the stock is running so high yeah this seems like just the beginning of the move for Tesla with all of this future growth on the horizon I think this is such an interesting point about AI in general where the first versions of AI were not good on on any part whether it was image Generation video generation the first versions everyone almost laughed at is this is never going to be good and now we're seeing it's phenomenal and I think that's the same thing with this Tesla's version of AI and using it to make these self-driving Vehicles you have really found some other companies that are really going to start taking off thanks to the self-driving technology correct yes so you know one of the things that I specialize in my own research and Analysis is identifying these large technological Trends and then of course uh the companies that will benefit from it um you know the Tailwind here in this case is the ability to enable fully autonomous driving so you know where I spend my time researching is first understanding the technology like I said that's why I have a Tesla uh and what was really interesting in um with with that technology is it it it wasn't a state of the technology at any given point in time it was the rate of improvement and that's what I think most people missed over the last few years you know yes it wasn't perfect to the point that you made but how rapidly was it improving so if you're watching that you could see that the rate of improvements was accelerating which is why I knew this was happening this year and so understanding the impact that um Tesla is going to have on the industry and then understanding those other companies that contribute to this trend that might even enable Tesla for example companies that provide specialized components into Tesla vehicles and potentially future Tesla products like the Cyber cab or like Optimus their humanoid robot which has uh generated so much excitement as well.,1.0,0.9

Thomas you talk about AI stocks and AI investing all the time we talk about it quite a bit on this channel and broadcom is no exception this is a company that we are going to continue to see a lot of growth but I want to know just how much growth are analysts expecting for broadcom well we're looking at a sustained High double digigit growth rate for the next couple years I think the forecast for next year is for another 50% growth and one of the things that's really got the market excited with this long-term outlook for custom chip growth is that right now broadcom only sells to like two or three of the five or six major hyperscalers so that's about half the hyperscale half the data center market and they could acquire the others over the next couple years and if they did that that would significantly increase what is already a very robust Market Outlook yeah absolutely and you just wrote an article talking about could The Magnificent Seven really become a magnificent eight do you think broadcom has the capacity to potentially get to that major level yeah I think it did that on Monday I think it gained another five or six% just that day and has now reached the trillion dollar Mark I think that uh the acquisition of VMware and the lean into the software side of AI along with the semiconductors kind of establishes it along the lines of Nvidia which is also a full stack AI company I think that broadcom has established itself as Central to AI important to AI infrastructure and a major player that will be significant for the next 5 10 15 years yeah well broadcom might already already be trading at a new premium just how high are analysts expecting this stock to go well the analyst response has been pretty robust since the report came out we've tracked at least a dozen revisions on Market beats website uh the consensus price Target right now is lagging the market but the revisions lifted the consensus by 15% overnight and the high-end range is pointed to 250 255 which is another 10 to 15% upside and I think that the way that momentum is building with the business and the expectation for future results we should expect the revision Trend to remain positive through next year and continue lifting the stock uh because one of the things that I've taken from the analyst chatter is that they're expecting more of the good news to come out in the second half of next year which just sets us up for a really long and sustained analyst upgrade cycle that could last well into 2026 and when we're talking about so much excitement over future outlook and future growth for this company does that mean a lot of the moves behind the stock price surge right now are really those long-term investors jumping in or is there still some short-term gains coming in on this stock right now I would say it's some of both it's there's definitely an uptrend in play that short-term Traders were able to capture they're probably going to start taking profits pretty soon um the long-term investors are also in this stock I would assume that the long-term investors would wait for the stock price to pull back a little bit from these new highs before they start putting in more money do you think that pullback is really just inevitable when we see a surge this big well well yeah it's part of Market mechanics um when it happens where it happens how deep it gets is the question in in that regard but a pullback will happen it's just a matter of uh when it happens what causes it and if you're ready for it when it happens.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,9fORXPcT6uc,2024-12-16T23:39:02Z,SoundHound Stock Explodes Again – Is a Major Breakout Coming?,SoundHound,"Soundhound surging yet again, but could this stock be at a turning point? Thomas, we were talking about this stock just one week ago, but then it started surging yet again on Friday. It did. This market is is really um almost out of control. It's really surging to to new high levels. And I see it right now on Monday. It's opened up. It gapped open to trade just below the previous all-time high. And I see the market at a pretty important turning point. And when you say turning point, where do you think this stock could go? Well, that's kind of the question right now. Um, if we can get above the previous all-time high and set a new all-time high, I see the stock moving up to $36, doubling from 18. That's very possible. However, there's a chance that it could be Cath at $18 and remain rangebound for the next few weeks, months, or quarters. Let's talk about some of those factors that could keep this stock rangebound. I know one of them is all that short interest the stock has seen over the past few months, right? Uh we just got the short report for the end of November and short interest at the end of November was 25%. So that's more than doubled the previous month. Short interest ramped higher over the course of the last few months to a new high. So part of the uh the stock surge is short covering and the question right now is if the shorts are going to stay out of the market or if they're going to reposition now that the stock is back at those all-time highs. Yeah, that is very high short interest for this stock right now. Do you think there's real value behind the big growth in this stock price right now? Or is it really a lot of that short interest? I think a lot of it is a short interest. That's why the stock price got up so high so quickly. You can see in the analyst sentiment they've been upgrading the stock and lifting their price targets, but their prices had this stock pegged around eight or nine $10. Yeah, I think that really is the question, Thomas. the stock up 80% in the past month, up almost 200% just in the last quarter. That attracts a lot of traders looking to to make a profit off of such a big surge that it's hard to know if the surge is really going to be sustainable. Do you think there's enough long-term fans of this stock to keep this stock rising? I think that the long-term fans are growing. You can also see that in the stock price action. If you look on the chart, especially the weekly bars, you can see that over the course of the last year, 18 months, we've had two major stock price upswings. Both of them marked by wickedly high volume. That high volume is in part short covering, but it's also new interest, new investors getting into the market. Uh, and one of the things you kind of alluded to this that might also cap the gains. People have made a lot of money the last few weeks in the last few months. And so, it's possible that profit taking will also cap gains. And again, the question is, what is the long-term outlook and if it can continue to lift the stock price? And I think that answer is yes. Yeah, we heard that from some of our viewers this last week when you and I were talking about Soundtown again just one week ago when the stock had surged and now it's doing it again. But we had a few people, a few viewers thinking this stock would easily hit 36 in the next year. Do you think that's a reasonable price target? I think it is because right now the stock is in a hyperrowth phase. It's a revenues about a hundred million a year I think. Um hyper growth growth phase where it's supposed to grow by 100% next year. Um it is one of the leading implementers of AI services. It's been gaining traction. Its voice recognition and automation services are really helping businesses. So I think that it's really going to start uh to build on its on its traction and to gain momentum with the business over the next year. All right. So is there any chance in a week we're going to be talking about another surge with this stock? Oh, I think it's totally possible. Yeah, I think plenty of our viewers would love to see that happen. Thanks, Thomas, again for breaking down this stock for us this week. We'd love to hear what you think. Are you in Sound for the long term, and how high do you think it could go? Or are you more of those short-term investors looking to make some profit off of Sound's big surge right now? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. And if you're wondering more about this company, we've talked about it plenty on this channel. Check out some of our previous videos on Sound Hound and why this company is growing so much right now and some of the reasons behind this current stock surge.",1.0,0.65

MarketBeat,RojBmeUxo3U,2024-12-13T20:30:03Z,How Fintech Strategy at FinWise Bancorp and CEO Vision Are Driving 78% Gains,FinWise Bancorp,a financial technology company up 78% in the last 6 months let's dive into this week's CEO [Music] series today we are excited to have Kent landvatter the CEO of finwise borp with us today thank you so much for coming on our channel it's great to be here Bridget. Let's talk about what is finwise and how long have you guys been around well the company actually started in 2000 I came in 2010 and I have always been interested in the Nexus between technology and Banking and I thought there would be a real interesting play for this company to move in more of a fintech side of the business and that's what we did standing it up fully in 2016 and been doing it for eight years now yeah that's great and you went public just a couple of years ago is that right three years ago uh last month actually your stock has seen quite a lot of success in the last year we're going to get to that in just a little bit but first let's talk more about uh what your company does so who are some of the customers that you serve one of our primary focuses as I mentioned is fintech business where we provide fintechs with banking solutions they could be lending payments deposits what have you and uh we also have traditional lines of business SBA we have a National SBA 7A program we have National Commercial leasing point of sell but our main focus right now is on the fintech side there seems to be a lot of uh growing competitors in this space too uh talk about that a little bit like what's the market like for fintech financing that's a really good question there have been a few banks in the space that have fallen out lately because of regulatory oversight uh concerns that they may have seen uh it's quite difficult to stand up a bank in this environment uh to appropriately manage the fintech uh in a way that's safe for the customers and compliant with all the regulations and so forth so we started in 2016 building out a real strong system and a scalable apid driven infrastructure that collects all the data that we need to properly oversee these partners and we have a significant staff in fact about 40% of our staff is devoted Focus completely focused on the management of these relation ship when I think of the competitor space out there I really think of those banks that are really doing a significant focus and dedicating the appropriate resources the exciting thing for us is there isn't a lot of competition right now because this is a difficult uh product to stand up so competition for us um we actually almost look more at some of the other banks in the space as collegial uh participants in the space because we're trying to all do it right and make certain um we're providing the right services in the right way yeah let's talk about that a little bit more what about finwise uh makes you really proud to be the CEO of this company what kind of sets your business practices apart from others in this field from a strategic positioning I think it was our early focus on let's make certain if we're getting into space to invest appropriately and make certain that the tools are in um in place and working to oversee these fintech Partnerships in a way that makes the banking Regulators happy and serves the customer well for us that's been a strategic thing that's uh contributed to this success that I'm very proud of but I think what I'm most proud of is the team that we've been able to assemble we've got I would say hundreds of years of experience in this space from people all over the country who are part of the finwise team and it's their success really that has stood up these strategies and visions of the company and uh done so in a very very profitable way for us yeah absolutely and it's been profitable for your investors too especially this past year your stock price went from trading around $8 earlier in the year to now up around $18 uh really good payoffs again a good investment for investors out there what's behind the success in your stock price there are a few things and I I can't pretend to guess them all but I think what it is is we've been telling the same story for uh since we've been public and uh we continue to execute on that story so we do what we say uh we're going to do and I think um because of some of the uncertainty around the regulatory oversights of the the some of the banks that have not um been able to navigate the waters uh as well you know there there's been some uncertainty but as you know we've been in the space for eight years now and uh we we kind of know we're doing and we're very very focused and on on Regulatory Compliance I think that message is getting out to stockholders another thing too that we're very excited about so over the last couple years we have been building out infrastructure to uh further expand our fintech offerings you know offering basically a payment we've developed a payments Hub which uh we call Money rails but it basically will move money on all the different platforms AC fed now RTP and so forth it will move money for our fintech partners and it's apid driven so that they can customize things on their side to optimize it so we think that's going to be uh an exciting ad for 2025 we've also added card sponsorships where we do debit cards credit cards and so forth for our fintech partners and finally we're expanding our balance sheet by adding what we call Credit enhanced balance sheet but it's basically a way for us to provide some of our balance sheet or more of our balance sheet to some of our fintech partners that want to put loans or deposits here in a safe way Let's talk about the books just a little bit more still considered I guess a small cap company but doing well in Revenue let's talk about some of those Logistics that our investors care about so much since we've gone public the tangible Book value has grown significantly every year and um when compared to our bank peers and when compared to fintech Brands we've uh done really well and so our tangible Book value continues to grow even over the last year or two where we've been focused on building out these additional products and and the people to support those products we've been uh very profitable we have very respectable return on assets compared to other Banks and and uh net interest margins so those key factors I think are really building some excitement around the the stock I think we've had a really good conversation about your company but I do want to end today by just talking about what are you most excited about in the next year ahead and the future of your company even beyond the next year uh do you see the growth trajectory still continuing for finwise I am so excited about it you know these new products that we're adding are going to um add different profit drivers that diversify the C revenue streams we have and uh build our balance sheet out so we can grow more effectively on the balance sheet but once again just writing the wave of this Innovative uh space to me right now is is very exciting and when you consider going back to our your earlier question about the competitive landscape it's hard to get in this barrier there's a big moat around our business and other Banks like ours and so there's a huge addressable market and I think being able to be first in line for those markets is very exciting plus it's just fun to see the way products evolve and and create more access and convenience for people,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,MvLIJDKk2wY,2024-12-12T23:15:25Z,5 REITs Poised for Growth in 2025 – Top Real Estate Investments to Watch,Reality Income,there's one company that I'm very very bullish about today and I do on the shares full disclosure uh this company's called reality income and their ticker symbol is O uh just one one letter. they're based in in California they're they're net lease landlord and net lease means they own Pro individual properties freestanding properties lease to companies like Dollar General or Walgreens are 711. they've got a massive portfolio they are the largest net lease landlord in the world. so they have you know uh thousands and thousands of properties scattered across all 50 states as well as Europe they've expanded over the last few years into Europe. their their exposure to one tenant is about three and a half% of the portfolio. Give an example how that how that's effective during covid they had uh they have exposure to theaters and gyms and of course those two categories were really hurt hard during Co people wouldn't go to couldn't go to the gym uh and obviously people didn't go to the theaters during Co but but this still continue to deliver uh not only um U you know consistent earnings but they were able to grow their earnings during even during Co and they were grow they grew their dividend uh during Co so that demonstrates that they have a very broad diversification which uh when some companies don't pay rent or they do have you know problems within their portfolio they're able to continue to deliver on Pro their promises to investors which is to pay dividends. by the way this company they're they're actually trademarked the monthly div div company so they pay monthly dividends and they also increase very consistently their are dividend Aristocrat they they've increased dividends every year as a public company for 30 years in a row. their cost of capital they work very hard to to achieve an a-rated balance sheet um so they have a very low uh cost of of debt they're also able to utilize currency in Europe which is actually lower cost debt than they have in the US. in terms of valuation which is arguably the most important part of our research at wide moot research is to study and really understand you know what is the margin of safety in the words of Benjamin Graham and so we looked at the company's valuation what they're trading at currently based on multiple valuation metrics and then we look at you know kind of how they've been traded historically how they've traded with a peer group uh and and we find them extremely extremely cheap right now a lot of that is just simp it's overhang due to um you know Rising rates it's it's it's it's an over overhang due to the fact we've seen a lot of these headlines with with um loans that are becoming due again real estate income has no problem with with debt maturities hence the you know a rated balance sheet I mentioned. I think that in terms of a value perspective we think there's a really good op Total return set up in place right now for real income to generate not only consistent dividends uh and growing dividends but a really nice and attractive Total return uh setup going forward so that's kind of my probably one of my number one picks right now and I'm happy to touch on some more if You'd like. reala income is only projected to grow by around 4% per year. the dividend is not going to be as high as it is with with real income so I like I think those companies are really attractive.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,MvLIJDKk2wY,2024-12-12T23:15:25Z,5 REITs Poised for Growth in 2025 – Top Real Estate Investments to Watch,Prologis,The other one I like a lot is pagis pagis again looking at kind of the compet pagis plld is the ticker there pagis is one of the largest warehous or Logistics landlords in in the world they own properties all over us and and many other other countries. again look at citing some of those same competitive advantages that I just spoke about realage income they also have an a-rated balance sheet they have massive scale and they're also trading at a discount. One of the things I like about pris as well as the other industrial companies is their growth prospects are are much higher real income is only projected to grow by around 4% per year and and peris is going to grow by U smaller double digits so maybe 10 11 12% per year so you've got more growth opportunity but you don't have that the dividend is not going to be as high as it is with with real income so I like I think those companies are really attractive.,1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,Alt2rfsuCEk,2024-12-11T21:36:43Z,GameStop’s Cash Pile Grows: Will This Be Enough to Save the Company?,GameStop,GameStop stock is rising again after last night's earnings report what's behind these numbers let's break it down with our Market beat analyst Thomas Hughes and Chris marut guys great to have you both back on the channel today let's start off with what's happening with gamestock stock price today you're right the stock is moving up it's about you know 5 and a half percent right now I think it was up about 7% a little while ago um on this earnings report it's showing some support at a fairly critical level in on the charts and it could be setting up for a bigger move. yeah Chris let's give a little context we've been following GameStop really since 2020 where does the price today compared to that all-time high that stock hit a few years ago so I mean if you're looking at the all-time high back in I think it was 2021 it was all the way up to around $80 a share so the the price at around $28 this morning is still well below that all-time high but GameStop's had a good year it's up 50% in 2024 so it's been having a strong year. this is a stock we really been following on this channel uh for a while that this really the whole stock market's been following since 2020 so let's break down a little bit about did we think we'd still be covering this stock in 2024 the way we are today I really didn't think so I mean you can go back and look at the history of my articles I've not been very fond of the company not because it's a bad company per se but just because it's losing money and it's it's in contraction it's burning its cash it's eating itself to death there's just not a lot of reasons to expect it's value to go up. yeah I kind of suspected we might still be talking about it it's it's one of these stocks that's become um you're going to get out of the report whatever you want to get out of the report if you are if you're bullish on the company there's reasons why you're going to still be bullish on the company after the report and if you're bearish on the company there's nothing that the report gave you that would change your opinion one way or the other. yeah let's dive into the report a little bit uh what came out of the earnings report this week well so the good news is that it produced a surprising profit all right it hasn't been able to produce much profits for a while so profit is good and profit is helping to support the stock price it also increased its cash balance by 500% so it's pretty well capitalized right now and that's part of why um the Bulls are still so encouraged because they believe this cash pile will lead to some business transformation that we really haven't seen any glimmers of yet. one of the problems in the report is that revenue is declining in every category of the business so Hardware is down software is down uh their their Collectibles businesses down I think that's something that should be more concerning if you're um if you're a retail investor that's actually thinking about getting involved in the stock is the company's business is in the gaming sector which is exploding at this time and GameStops losing money in that sector right. and kind of in between those two opinions you know they made this surprising profit the business is Contracting the profit is only because of the cash balance it's because interest income the operating results are negative it burned money and its operations and the business is Contracting there's really no expectations for that to change so right now the company's kind of in a holding pattern. so given all those details why do you think the stock price is still Rising this morning people want to believe you know and and the 4.5 billion in cash is a big number you know people think that even if the stock were to you know go out of business or whatever there's still going to be some value there and there's also hope for the turnaround but there's just there's no evidence of it yet and right now what we're looking at is just a persistent continual burning of cash eventually that cash balance will get Whitted down and then where will the market be left. The retail investors love the CEO they believe that there's a plan everybody seems to have an opinion about what that plan might be but the company itself hasn't really outlined a plan and that's what makes me very dubious I mean you don't even have an earnings call after your report that doesn't give me a lot of confidence as investor that there's a bigger plan going forward it tells me that there's no plan I mean if they had a plan they hey we've got a plan they should be beating the the drunk we have a plan you know right but there there's no plan so that leads me to wonder how long will we be talking about GameStop what do you think will take to kind of get those uh hopeful people to finally get out of this stock or is this something that we're going to be talking about for years to come yet. I think that we could be talking about this stock for years to come yet um one of the takeaways from this report is that with the interest income and producing profits they really have entered a holding pattern so technically speaking they can sustain operations indefinitely while the business slowly turns into nothing they'll be left over with some money but there'll be no business left and then what do they do. so gamestock stock is still Rising which means people are buying it who are the people buying the stock right now I mean I think for the most part it's it's retail investors but there is a that's got me scratching my head and that's the institutional activity the institutions have been buying this stock on balance all year um the Holdings are still pretty low they don't own more than 50% it's like 25 or 30% I think not very much but they're buying on balance and that provides a Tailwind for the market you can see it in the stock price and I'm just wondering what it is that they're buying into are they speculating on this cash balance or a turnaround um are they just buying some shares so they can have them lend them out for being shorted um it's just it's a question I want to have answered do you feel that the movement in this stock is a true investment in this company or is it just an investment in a hope to make some money off of a short squeeze again GameStop's certainly a trade more than it is an investment and you can look at that in the options chain um I mean there's just a ton of option contracts out on the stock this is an option Traders dream right now I'm not so sure though that it's a short play because the short interest on the stock is really down something else I'm concerned about is the the the valuation and you my math could be wrong reported balance sheet shareholder equity and the number of shares outstanding puts the book value at like $11 so that's more than 50% lower than where it's trading right now to me that means sooner or later there will be a detail that comes out that just causes the bottom to fall right out of the market. this stock certainly has a strong following so I know there's got to be some viewers out there that strongly disagree with this point what do you say to the the Believers on GameStop you could be right I could wrong good luck. yeah I mean it's it's a trade it's it's to me it's not a it's not a long-term investment but there's probably money to be made guys thank you so much for the time today and breaking down this stock that again we're still talking about four years later and will still be talking about for a few years to come. thank you for watching Market beat we hope that you can check out some of our other videos on other content including some past videos we've done on GameStop stock as well have a great day everyone and as always happy investing.,1.0,-0.6

MarketBeat,PV0P4nvGnzM,2024-12-10T22:00:14Z,3 High Short Interest Stocks You Need to Watch,SoundHound,so the first one um I have on my list is SoundHound and I know we've covered that extensively on this channel it popped up on the screener and I was interested because this is a stock that's shot higher over the last couple of months and and one of the reasons for that is what we just talked about Bridget it's been a short squeeze stock trades about maybe a 38 million share average volume that's not a whole lot and what investors saw especially those mem stock investors is high short interest possibility of a short squeeze that's exactly what they've gotten I like SoundHound I'd expect the stock to pull back a little bit and that's when buyers might want to be looking to jump in absolutely yeah talk about longterm for this stock do you think there some growth potential here taking that short interest out this is a company that's on sort of the Forefront of where AI is pushing things especially in terms of sound recognition has contracts already with a lot of major companies and a lot of Major Brands it's just right now the Stock's been squeezed a little bit it's trading again at a at a very high premium I would expect the stock to pull back a little bit and that's what investors should look to get in all right so let's talk about the cycle of this short squeeze what this really start going up you know you'd probably say right after the election when a lot of this bare Market rally started that's when you started seeing the the significant movement here on on SoundHound as far as the when it might fizzle out my guess would be it might happen sometime this month as investors look to take profit before the end of the year and that might be a good time for investors to maybe go looking to shop during the Santa Claus rally between Christmas and New Year's or even after the New Year itself,1.0,0.4
MarketBeat,PV0P4nvGnzM,2024-12-10T22:00:14Z,3 High Short Interest Stocks You Need to Watch,Rocket Lab,so let's move on to your second pick and again this is a stock a lot of people been talking about especially recently yeah that would be rocket lab and we talked about it on the channel just a couple weeks ago it's got even lower average daily volume than SoundHound which surprised me a little bit but good news about rocket lab this is a company that has a billion dollar backlog in total business that's not just their launch business but it's also their space Services business it's been in the middle of this short squeeze over the last month or so I would expect investors to see a pullback on this stock and again that would be a good entry point for for investors if you're already holding on to Rocket lab uh is this a time where you could takes some profit share you know nobody ever got broke taking a profit and right now again rocket Labs just shot up so much higher in the past few months it might be a very good opportunity to sell some of your stock take a little bit of profit for the holidays and then buy back in when the Stock's a little bit lower yeah with the stock like this one that's seen such a backlog of orders and that's seeing this kind of growth how much of a pullback do you think a rocket lab could see you could easily see it it pulling back about 10% from where it is right now it's it's not hard to see that at all again this is just a stock that's it's again it's it's not a bad stock it and it's got a lot of growth ahead of it but the Market's just gotten a little ahead of itself we're in a very uh bullish Market in general right now the Market's moving higher you've got a big name stock like this one is it possible that the bull market could just prevent any future pullbacks the Market's just in one of those Cycles right now where it wants to run higher there's no question about that that's why it's difficult to be a person that's trying to short a stock especially a stock like rocket lab right now because there could be just a lot of bulls that just keep jumping in and pushing the stock higher and so if you're looking at Rocket lab as a trade that's something you want to consider if you're looking at it as a long-term investment I would still strongly recommend you look for just a little bit of a pullback on the stock for a better entry point some good advice for investors there Chris,1.0,0.5
MarketBeat,PV0P4nvGnzM,2024-12-10T22:00:14Z,3 High Short Interest Stocks You Need to Watch,SoFi Technologies,all right let's get on to your third and final pick of high short interest stocks right now that would be Sofi Technologies this is a stock brid just that I boy it's been on my watch list for a long time um I just haven't been able to pull the trigger on it but I'm really I I'm interested in this company this is a company that uh most investors may know it as the company that started out as they did student loans they were the student loan company and they've become so much more especially over the past couple of years they got their banking license the company was basically starting at zero in terms of an asset base for being a bank two years ago and they've grown significantly since then but there's always been a high short interest on the stock a lot of investors who just don't believe that this company is um is going to deliver on their promises there is reason to believe that the stock maybe a little bit expensive right now um expensive doesn't necessarily mean it's overvalued but it is expensive right now this is another one I think the company's got a bright future I also think the Stock's a little bit overextended,1.0,0.4
MarketBeat,PV0P4nvGnzM,2024-12-10T22:00:14Z,3 High Short Interest Stocks You Need to Watch,MarketBeat,Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris first let's show people how you take a look at which stocks are having some of the highest short interest right now Market beat has a free tool I'm going to share my screen with you right now Bridget so under the um Market data tab you can see this column that says short interest and just click on that and it'll take you to a screen that looks like this and this is updated every day and you can see which stocks have um a high percentage of short interest in terms of percent of total shares shorted or the percent of the float or days to cover however people might want to look at that now I know you've picked three stocks off of that list first let's take a look at why investors would want to look at the short interest of a stock if you were interested in shorting a stock those stocks would be good candidates the ones that have high short interest but you would also might want to be looking at stocks that might be a candidate for a short squeeze that means you might want to be buying a stock that a lot of people are shorting you've got three picks where Traders are doing just that with and these are some pretty popular names start with your first pick so the first one um I have on my list is SoundHound and I know we've covered that extensively on this channel it popped up on the screener and I was interested because this is a stock that's shot higher over the last couple of months and and one of the reasons for that is what we just talked about Bridget it's been a short squeeze stock trades about maybe a 38 million share average volume that's not a whole lot and what investors saw especially those mem stock investors is high short interest possibility of a short squeeze that's exactly what they've gotten I like SoundHound I'd expect the stock to pull back a little bit and that's when buyers might want to be looking to jump in absolutely yeah talk about longterm for this stock do you think there some growth potential here taking that short interest out this is a company that's on sort of the Forefront of where AI is pushing things especially in terms of sound recognition has contracts already with a lot of major companies and a lot of Major Brands it's just right now the Stock's been squeezed a little bit it's trading again at a at a very high premium I would expect the stock to pull back a little bit and that's what investors should look to get in all right so let's talk about the cycle of this short squeeze what this really start going up you know you'd probably say right after the election when a lot of this bare Market rally started that's when you started seeing the the significant movement here on on SoundHound as far as the when it might fizzle out my guess would be it might happen sometime this month as investors look to take profit before the end of the year and that might be a good time for investors to maybe go looking to shop during the Santa Claus rally between Christmas and New Year's or even after the New Year itself if you are looking looking to start trading with some high short interest stocks Market bead has a free premium report out there right now that can help walk you through stepbystep how to get into these kinds of stocks,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,PJcCLfh-L9Q,2024-12-09T23:27:13Z,SoundHound: The AI Stock That’s Up 100% – Could It Double Again Soon?,SoundHound,"soundtown up 100% since last month's earnings reports but now the volatility is already underway here to break it all down for us is Market beat analyst Thomas Hughes Thomas this has been a great month for SoundHound yeah it really has been and what we have here is kind of a perfect storm of factors driving the stock price it starts with the results the company's uh growing and it's accelerating it's gaining traction the forecasts for next year are for this hyper growth to accelerate and continue again so another 100 % growth in the in the revenue next year uh the forecast may be cautious because of the investor day conference the investor day conference left the market feeling very confident about the future also revealed some new deals in a deal pipeline that kind of reinforces all this outlook for how good the next year is going to be and on top of that there's the short interest the short interest was nearly 30% at the beginning of the month and so a lot of this upward movement in the stock price is short covering let's talk about that movement in the stock price what have we seen this stock to since earnings last month well like you said it's it's up more than 100% but technically speaking what we're looking at is a break above um a significant resistance point so it suggests the upward momentum can continue uh the last week's big surge was also on pretty high volume Again part of that was short covering but the high volume kind of shows a lot of Market support for the stock at the price level that it's at now so uh we're looking at higher prices to come over over the next year now we've talked about SoundHound on this channel before what came out during earnings report and that investor call this month that has investors even more excited about the future of sound hounds well it just shows that the company is gaining traction it technology really is good it works the investor day conference you know the market walked away thinking wow this stuff really does work it sounds good it's kind of seamless providing a good service for businesses uh this new deal that they announc is with torches tacos that's for 130 stores it's not a lot of stores they've got about 10,000 restaurants using the software but they're talking about for torches the software is handling 100% of their calls it's taking orders it can take more than one order at a time it's answering questions so it's really helping the the the business uh become more efficient and that just plays into the outlook for not only for Revenue growth but for earnings potential yeah it's really one of the great usage of AI is to really take away something that's timeconsuming that takes a lot of human power and make it faster and I think that's why the idea behind SoundHound is taking off so quickly well right broadly speaking the services and automation is what um the current you know evolution of AI is best for handling data writing the data where it needs to go and then responding to queries and requests let's talk about uh what are analysts saying about sound Hound's future well so the analysts are pretty bullish but I would say the stock price has uh kind of front run their sentiment they're lifting their price targets but I think right now the stock price is about 40% overvalued relative to consensus uh so that plus the short covering element leads me to think that there could be some volatility we might expect a pretty sharp price pullback before we see new high set but ultimately the trend is positive and I would expect the analyst to catch up with the market given time and sometimes it can be hard to play these short interest stocks but if you want to learn more about how to play high short interest stocks check out this free market Bait Report it'll break down everything you need to know about playing stocks just like this one that have a lot of high short interest right now so Thomas what would be a really good trading play on a stock like SoundHound that's seen such a big runup so quickly well right so looking at this from the bull case and you know assuming that this this bull fundamental situation scenario really is playing out the way that I've described um you would want to wait for some price pullbacks and the price pullbacks will probably result in pretty clear U demarcations of support levels and then use those for entry points um if you have an opposite Viewpoint you're probably going to want to look for some of these um recognizable resistance points and use those as possible places to short the stock with rapid growth stocks like this one you always wonder about what kind of factors could potentially slow down all of these really quick gains is it competition are there competitors out there that might come take away some of sound Hound's market share um are there other economic factors are just things that could impact this growth trajectory for this company well right now SoundHound is is the leader in its field but I would say that most other AI companies are working towards similar ends um Salesforce in particular is a company that's going to want to use AI to automate its its workflows for businesses um and it is a potential you know buyer for SoundHound but again we got to remember that SoundHound is being backed by Nvidia so it's a good chance that SoundHound will remain a standalone company for a very long time that was a question question for the Bears that might be out there but for the Bulls what could lead to even more growth for SoundHound I'm sure there's plenty of companies that are really just starting to explore how AI applications like this one could help their business well I think that the growth trajectory for this company is is pretty robust businesses in general need to be efficient they need automation um so the the more businesses within one industry take on software like this the more the competition will need to follow suit so I think that this story is one that could continue to gain traction over the next couple of years um and right now sound hounds revenue is it's less than 100 million a year this company is going to be worth billions pretty soon so I would expect to see it grow by 100% or more over the next few years like each year annually um AI services are going to be the largest and fastest growing segment of the AI market so right now if you think that the Nvidia bubble is a is a big bubble wait until the services bubble gets inflated and we'll see how how big the market gets then yeah the rapid growth we're seeing in the whole AI sector is really incredible and SoundHound is absolutely a part of that story thank you so much Thomas for the breakdown on what's happening with SoundHound right now and thank you for joining us check out some of our other videos we've done on SoundHound in the past if you want to learn a little bit more about this company as always thank you so much for joining us and happy investing",1.0,0.9

Nvidia news today is Market beat analyst Thomas Hughes Thomas it's the news everyone is talking about today right uh we've got some unconfirmed reports coming from Reuters that Nvidia is talking to Taiwan semiconductors to bring blackw production to the Arizona facility that Taiwan semiconductor was building and that's really good news kind of for a couple of reasons on Shoring uh semiconductor production aligns with national interest um it's expanding production for NVIDIA uh to help them meet um unmet demand so it's really a good news but there are still some hurdles for them to to cross yeah let's talk about some of those hurdles again like you said bringing semiconductor production back to the US has been a goal of the country for quite a while but it's not quite the fix that everyone's looking for well well right so it's potentially a fix but right now Taiwan semiconductor is not able to do 100% of the manufacturing process in Arizona so right now the Outlook is that they would be able to begin production of the front end early next year right but it could be up to three years or longer before they start doing the full the full production process which means that until then they're going to have to start they'll have to ship the chips back to Taiwan which brings that risk back into the picture so yes this move can reduce the risk but right now it's it's not really doing it yeah I feel like the motivation for this we've been talking about Blackwell for months now is just to really speed up that production so there's so much demand for this new chip out there this should at least help with that and that should help Nvidia share prices as well right I I would think so if they can get that production to start going early next year they can improve the production outlook for next year and thereby meet the the unmet demand like you said the news today unconfirmed reports from Reuters um let's talk about how the stock price is reacting for NVIDIA but also Taiwan semiconductors well really both stocks are moving higher today um if you look at the charts they're kind of tied together I mean nvidia's growth is equal to Taiwan semiconductor's growth because Taiwan semiconductor makes most of the chips right now they're both moving higher they're both looking good showing support and it looks like their uptrends are intact yeah analysts have been excited about Nvidia all this year and have really good reports and good trajectory for this stock for next year but this news uh and some other news that you have in an article for us today uh could also help move Nvidia even even higher than what analysts are predicting next year well right uh some comments from CEO Jensen Wang has sparked some speculation in the market that the next iteration of the AI chips called Ruben could come out six months or more earlier than anticipated uh so I think based on the comments the market was expecting it to be a late second half uh 2026 event but uh Jensen Wang's comments make it seem like it could be early 2026 or maybe even late 2025 uh which would just uh really boost the demand Outlook and the outlook for revenue and bring forward the outlook for Revenue growth based on those chips yeah I think this is a testament to just how quickly AI technology is advancing Nvidia of course at the Forefront of that but announcing the next generation of chips even before Blackwell hits the market fully is just how fast this AI industry is advancing oh right I wouldn't be surprised at all if we don't hear about maybe two or three other new next Generations of chips even before Reuben's released that's still like at least 12 15 months away so yeah this there's a good amount of time for them to make some advances I think that you're you're exactly right this industry is moving by Leaps and Bounds really fast there's going to be some major advances over the next year and that's good news not only for NVIDIA but really a lot of different AI stocks check out the free market beat report on seven AI stocks to invest in it's an introduction to AI Investing For self-direct investors there's a lot of potential in this market and you can check out which seven stocks are set to take off in the AI industry by checking out the free report just scan the QR code or look for the link in the comments right now Nvidia stock is kind of consolidating near New highs and above this critical support level so it is a pretty decent time to get into the market if you think it's going higher um like you said this news is more of of a long-term kind of a news it aligns with the Outlook it helps to Boler the Outlook it doesn't really move the needle so much today or this coming quarter but it will over time and I think that Nvidia stock price will continue to Trend higher because of it all right thanks for the information Thomas and thank you for joining us here on Market beat check out our other Nvidia coverage right here on

MarketBeat,_tEp4PvxBNc,2024-12-05T23:32:15Z,NVIDIA & TSMC: What U.S. Blackwell Chips Could Mean for Their Stocks,Taiwan semiconductors,uh we've got some unconfirmed reports coming from Reuters that Nvidia is talking to Taiwan semiconductors to bring blackw production to the Arizona facility that Taiwan semiconductor was building and that's really good news kind of for a couple of reasons on Shoring uh semiconductor production aligns with national interest um it's expanding production for NVIDIA uh to help them meet um unmet demand so it's really a good news but there are still some hurdles for them to to cross yeah let's talk about some of those hurdles again like you said bringing semiconductor production back to the US has been a goal of the country for quite a while but it's not quite the fix that everyone's looking for well well right so it's potentially a fix but right now Taiwan semiconductor is not able to do 100% of the manufacturing process in Arizona so right now the Outlook is that they would be able to begin production of the front end early next year right but it could be up to three years or longer before they start doing the full the full production process which means that until then they're going to have to start they'll have to ship the chips back to Taiwan which brings that risk back into the picture so yes this move can reduce the risk but right now it's it's not really doing it yeah I feel like the motivation for this we've been talking about Blackwell for months now is just to really speed up that production so there's so much demand for this new chip out there this should at least help with that and that should help Nvidia share prices as well right I I would think so if they can get that production to start going early next year they can improve the production outlook for next year and thereby meet the the unmet demand like you said the news today unconfirmed reports from Reuters um let's talk about how the stock price is reacting for NVIDIA but also Taiwan semiconductors well really both stocks are moving higher today um if you look at the charts they're kind of tied together I mean nvidia's growth is equal to Taiwan semiconductor's growth because Taiwan semiconductor makes most of the chips right now they're both moving higher they're both looking good showing support and it looks like their uptrends are intact absolutely one more time you've mentioned it a little bit talking about the timeline of when that Arizona plant for Taiwan semiconductors could be ready to go right so Taiwan semiconductors plant will be able to start making blackb chips early next year uh so it'll be I mean maybe five or 10 years for them to have their own plants available for doing the final packaging but there's another company called amcore who has made a deal with Taiwan semiconductors to build um what's called it's coas C WS chip on wafer on substrate facility in Arizona alongside these other facilities so that should be available with about three three years so we got about a threeyear window until this plan would bear fruit regarding you know fully nationalizing um blackw production into the us,1.0,0.6

MarketBeat,v8-5hKvFpTQ,2024-12-02T22:22:12Z,Super Micro's Rebound: Can SMCI Stock Rally Another 100%?,"Super Micro Computer, Inc.",how long will the Super Micro rebound continue here to break it down for us is Market beat analyst Thomas Hughes Thomas it has been a wild two weeks for smci yes it has been a wild two weeks the stock is up more than 100% since hitting its bottom a few weeks ago I think this rebound could continue because they're kind of rebuilding some confidence um in the stock price right now there are some risks still ahead but I think provided they're able to finalize their reports in a satisfactory manner this rebound will not only continue but it could turn into a sustained rally for next year yes we'll break down some of those delayed reports in a minute but first let's kind of back up and talk about where this stock has been even though it might be trading over 30 right now it's still a far cry from where this stock peaked earlier this year so last year there was a quite a bubble formed with AI that bubble Peak well above $120 earlier this year now we're down around 40 um that big implosion is the AI bubble bursting but also compounded by those filing issues the market really lost its confidence in the stock uh right now what I see is the stock price is really disconnected from reality because trading in the mid-30s it's really in alignment to where it was at the end of last year before the bubble formed but we know that the business is more than 150% bigger so the stock certainly deserves more premium that the market is giving it right now yeah let's talk about some of that loss of trust and and distrust in the stock uh break down a little bit about what happened with earnings reports and financials for this company well it just started with some whistle blower testimony um earlier this year just kind of raising some questions about their practices and highlighting a problem they had in the past that was compounded by a short sale report kind of hit on the same the same subjects uh the company has since been unable to finalize its last year's fiscal year year-end report it lost its auditor because there was some misunderstanding in the numbers they couldn't get they couldn't get P um there has been a risk of delisting uh but the recent news is that they got a new auditor a trusted auditor BDO with the top five accounting firm globally um it's kind of restored some confidence in the market um the risk is that they won't be able to finalize their results but uh the general opinion right now is that boo will be able to do this in an expedited manner um and so whether it's good or bad we should know pretty soon I'm sure the new auditing firm is a part of the reason for the Boost in stock price but why do you think the stock is starting to rise again after are voling so low partially it's the rebuilding of confidence but also over the holiday week they announced that they've uh prepaid some debt they closed out two different lines of credit they had which is really a big deal because they're reducing uh debt risk they're freeing up cash flow they're improving the balance sheet and again they're just instilling some more confidence in the company's ability to uh to progress as a going concern yeah and I think that's what a lot of uh investors are wondering right now is how far can this company progress the stock price has certainly seen a lot of movement but let's talk about the company itself how successful is this business well the business is pretty successful they're one of the leaders with uh direct liquid cooled servers which is really important for AI the AI microchips uh use so much power they create so much heat um that cooling them and keeping the data centers functioning is a big cost for the data center operators so these liquid cooled server racks are really important for not only the efficiency of the chips but for the efficiency of the operation the forecasts for next year are still pretty good the company's 150% bigger this year than last year the forecast for next year are for another 20% growth uh those maybe cautious estimates just given um the way things have gone this year the analysts certainly have not a lot of reasons to be really aggressive with those targets absolutely so there's demand for their services uh they expect to see growth for that continue they're also working with Nvidia which has some consumer confidence as well correct indeed indeed one of the things that helped build the confidence over the last couple of weeks is that during nvidia's earnings report and conference call they gave super micro a shout out which just kind of um affirms the fact that Nvidia is still working with them and that it's still important to the AI infrastructure great well let's move on to the stock price itself this is what investors are really wondering how far do we think this rebound could possibly go well I think the stock could gain a good 50 to 100% from these current levels just based on the way that the revenue and earnings are GR um but where it goes soon and how long it stays there really depends on the new cycle and and how quickly they're able to get these these results finalized now let's dive into the analyst uh predictions a little bit more uh where are the most recent analyst targets at for this stock right so the most recent targets have it fairly valued near its current levels in the mid-30s the consensus is down significantly from its peak and we expect the stock to trade below the consensus because the new the new revision trend is is low but even at consensus we're looking at more than 100% upside so I think that uh we're looking at a floor for the market and the low3s with a potential for a 50 to 100% upside over the next 12 months oh let's talk about any trading plays for this stock with all of the volatility happening with smci right now the best trading plays would be to wait for a price dip because we know it's going to happen there's still a lot of uncertainty and is a volatile market so price dips would be a good time to get in in a small speculative Manner and anytime that it would rip or move higher would be a good time to get out well as we close out this video today Thomas the final question for investors out there is do you think that the stock is fairly valued of where it's at right now I really don't I mean and there is a lot of um concern with the reports so we could be I could be proven wrong this stock could go to zero but I think that trading at 11 times earnings is fairly undervalued compared to its peers which are trading at you know 20 30 and 40 times their earnings so I think that provided a positive outcome this stock will rocket higher and could easily see a 50 to 100% upside that's some good news if people are looking for a stock with some big potential growth,1.0,0.7

MarketBeat,oQFCHIH-5kw,2024-11-29T23:58:34Z,Why Amazon’s AI Power and Holiday Boost Make This Stock a 2025 Winner,Amazon,yeah let's get into the two stocks that you've picked that have had a really good 2024 and could have an even better 2025 what's your first company that's Amazon. Amazon is performing well it's in my opinion it's um it's a perfect play on the consumer and AI. Its two business segments are you know it's Amazon platform and selling to the consumer but then there's AWS which is the number one the largest hyperscaler in the world they have the most data centers they're the most influential in the data center industry as far as AI goes and all that AI power is just really going to be funneled into their their consumer business so the two things go hand inand all that data analytics and all the services that could be rendered um right now it's growing at double digits it's outperforming on top and bottom line the outlook for next year is for this to be sustained uh cash flow is good they're buying back shares. The share BuyBacks are pretty Central to the entire S&amp;P 500 story helping to lift the entire Market BuyBacks are supposed to accelerate over the next year so I see these Trends just supporting a general uptrend in this stock not to mention a great holiday season for Amazon that's always good for the company's bottom line. Um let's talk about where their stock price is right now and what it's done in 2024 well right now it's sitting at an all-time high it's pulled back over the last couple of weeks but it's still above the critical support Target which was the previous all-time high so long as that support Target holds I would expect to see this um stock regain its footing very quickly and resume its uptrend before the end of the year as far as getting into Amazon many people already own this stock if you want to add more or trade more of this stock any advice about getting in when a stock is so close to an all-time high right now well that is a concern there's always a risk of the stock market correcting but the thing about a stock that's trending higher you can buy it high and continue selling it higher and higher as it goes right now the fundamental story is pointing to higher prices for this stock there's really no expectation for it to Peak out or reverse verse now um that may change over the coming quarters but for now the uptrend is is intact and what do analysts say as far as price targets for this next year it looks like they're pointing to about a 15% upside at the consensus right now but the consensus is rising so the highend range is more likely um again with the trends intact I would expect to see these price targets continue to rise as the company continues to grow analysts are raising their target on this stock. What are some reasons that analysts are expecting Amazon to continue to grow it's already a giant what could take this company higher well first there's just Global digitization the world's population has not yet been fully penetrated by digitization so that's just an expanding addressable Market within that Amazon is continuing to expand its own territories and also deepen penetration so there are several factors driving the growth in this core segment but then again there's also AWS which is the um Amazon web services it's the data center segment and that segment is growing um it's not expected to slow down anytime soon uh data center growth is accelerating in 2024 because of AI and should remain strong over the next couple of years.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,3Z3sy4PAA98,2024-11-25T19:37:43Z,How Abacus Life is Transforming Life Insurance into Assets | MarketBeat CEO Series,Abacus Life,"do you know the value of your life insurance policy a new public company is helping millions of people look at life insurance as an asset let's dive in today we are excited to have Jay Jackson the CEO of advocus life with us at Market beat thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today Jay absolutely excited to be here well we're excited to hear your company's story in really a unique space share a little bit about what Abacus life does sure Abacus life is an alternative asset manager a global alternative asset manager that focuses primarily on purchasing assets that are predictable and consistent that might be traditionally uncorrelated through the market using our Actuarial data and our lifespan data to help set the value and that makes us a really unique business that investors today are really looking for how can they invest in assets that don't have the types of correlation that you see related to interest rate sensitivity and Market volatility and we're the company that originates those assets we're the market maker in those assets and we're also the asset manager in those assets you had a lot of big financial terms there so breaking it down to what what Amicus life provides it's really about life insurance talk about who your customers are and kind of your target group sure so what's really interesting is that in our name you see it's Abacus life which we thought we were being clever early on in the sense that Abacus being the first cou calculator and really the Life part was the idea of calculating your life knowing the value of your life and so we purchase life insurance policies we don't issue them and that is a really unique kind of twist because what happens is is that life insurance is used for a purpose a specific amount of time but then very rarely actually passed on to the airs and what I mean by that is life insurance is about a 13 trillion industry of the 13 trillion which by the way is two and a half times the US residential real estate market of that 90% of those policies or N9 out of 10 never pay a claim to the beneficiaries and it's not because the life insurance company has done something wrong it's because we don't treat it like an actual asset the Supreme Court ruled life insurance as personal property but we don't treat it like personal property we don't treat it like our home instead we just stop making payments on it because we think oh it's it served its purpose and what we do is educate all of our policy holders and clients to say hold on a minute you have an actual value just like your home and you have a choice to recognize what that value is in today's dollar and we're licensed all across the state it's very regulated and provide this service to those millions of policy holders that bought a life insurance policy and didn't know they had a liquidity on it yeah it's been around for a long time your company I believe 19 years old how has it grown and developed over that time and gained success in that time too it's done very very well so you know although many time for many people this is a newer idea or concept to them however we've been in in business for nearly well actually over 20 years now we've purchased over5 billion dollars of life insurance policies over that time period and here's what's really interesting we went public about 18 months ago that introduced us to a whole another set of not just investors but asset managers and lots of different investors who would look at this asset today much differently than they would have then and that's really broadened the audience to hear what's what's really happening in the underlying asset again you said your goal is educating people and you do that a lot through commercials if you watch CNBC or any other large Network out there you've probably seen an aboca's life commercial what's the goal of all of those commercials you're running right now Jay sure and you've probably seen me on them um and so we run we even ran on Monday Night Football um a few times last week and the goal is very simple we designed and built an easy to use calculator that somebody can quickly assess the value of that life insurance policy without having to speak to anyone they can just simply put in the size of their policy their age and gender and the policy type and and literally in just a few seconds it helps assess for them what the actual value of that policy might be based upon how they assess their own health that alone has driven tens of thousands of policy holders to us just searching for information and that then provides them a baseline to get an idea that says wow maybe I shouldn't laugh policy maybe I should keep it enforced for a little while longer because it might be worth 100,000 or 400,000 or even half a million dollars where they were just going to stop paying on it and think it was worth nothing and now with just 30 seconds they can actually find out so we've had a huge success with those with those commercials and and the response has been tremendous so part of your company is educating consumers out there about the value of their actual life insurance policies but there's another aspect to your company that's very interesting to people and that's how your calcul relating lifespan talk about that so we aggregate data related to lifespan and here's how we do it and and the reason why we do it is for someone to know what the current value of their life insurance policy is they need to know first how much longer you might continue to pay on it and and so what we do is help people solve and understand what's the today value if you're 75 years old and ideally you want to you know you're probably going to live to let's say to age 90 in 15 years if you have a million dollar life insurance policy assuming you keep paying on it then it will be worth to your estate a million dollars but what's it worth today and you have to deduct out those insurance premiums and you have to understand well okay what's my probability of living for the next 15 years what is my lifespan and the first thing we do with clients is that we get their updated medical files we reer write them in today's terms and help them have a better understanding of what their probabilistic lifespan is on a go forward basis that data is really really valuable and in in addition to just their life insurance policy we are also applying that data to their financial and estate plan so many times people are worried about gosh I'm going to run out of money in retirement we can help solve that by having people understand first and foremost how long are you going to be in retirement I think that should be the first question anyone asks themselves before they do a retirement or estate plan is okay well how long do I think I'm going to be here and we can provide that accurate data I think that's an concept A lot of our retail investors are interested in for themselves but I think they also want to hear about a lot of your company financials too before making an investment in a new stock our our viewers really care about the financials of your company so let's talk about kind of this steady Revenue growth that you've seen especially since going public it's interesting again we've been doing this for 20 years and these numbers have been relatively consistent um it's just that the investment public is just learning about us as a company that that so when they start to look at this analysis they're like wow where Where Have You Been there's three key things and we trade on the NASDAQ and we we ran this statistic and what we looked for were saying how many other companies have mid- teen year-over-year growth rates top and bottom line that have return on Equity greater than 18% and have an eida margin or profitability margin a profit margin of greater than 50% and I'll pause just so your your your audience can try to think about how many companies would meet that criteria consider all the companies that trade on the mag NASDAQ which include Microsoft it's just us we're the only company on all of NASDAQ that can state that so here you have a business that's been in existence for 20 years that is highly profitable with great margins and has been doing it consistently for the last two decades that's what's rare about our business and so so many times people today are looking for Investments or individual stocks that they invest in and they're concerned about oh hey is this just a gross stock or is this is do they actually make money should be the first and foremost question particularly you ask in today's kind of volatile Market absolutely and it sounds like you've got a good answer with your company for that question um let's move on to talking a little bit about growth where is your company going as far as expanding maybe adding additional assets or programs to what Amicus life provides what we're really starting to capitalize and monetize on is all of the data that we've aggregated over the last 20 years keep in mind understanding um lifespan and it's a very important and kind of a Hot Topic right several of the last New York Times Best Sellers are based on longevity lifespan and health span we have the data and we're actually providing that data starting to work with government agencies as well as informing people on how this lifespan can truly help monetize some of your other assets that you may have particularly your financial plan so some of the things we're very excited about we started rolling out our lifespan tracking to Pension funds so that they have a better understanding of of how they can best manage their pension and their unfunded liabilities and what their underlying pension needs actually look like we're also taking that data and applying it to Target dat funds Target date funds have raised nearly a trillion dollars in the United States where effectively you pick a Target date meaning 2035 some point in the future but you pick it without knowing what the actual Target date is those should be customized to each individual and when you start to think about how we apply our lifespan data it can be fundamentally applied to a lot of different Industries but specifically in financial planning all of a sudden now you will have the tools to be able to make really informed decisions as to whether you should be investing more heavily in equity or debt or depending on what your asset allocation may be based upon actually what the time is that you need to use it for let's talk about competition in this field are there other companies out there providing a similar service and how much of this space is amaka's Life currently occupying so we maintain a very large market share uh and part of that's due because we've earned that market share through 20 years of of of business support and relationships we partner with over 30,000 financial advisers across the United States we work with tens of thousands of consumers directly not just educating them on what the actual value of their life insurance or market value of the life insurance policy might be but also educating them on how this could potentially apply to their estate plan uh we are the only publicly traded uh company in our entire industry there are other companies in our business that that focus in different areas of of the origination piece but we're the only company that's taken gone the step further and said let's make this available and transparent uh and and validate what everybody can now look at our assets and our balance sheet and potentially invest in it so you know we're in a very fortunate position where we maintain over a quarter of the market share in our business and in addition to that we're the only publicly traded option for any investor to really get involved with and so we're thrilled uh and when you look at the growth prospects of everything we're doing think about the addressable Market we have in front of us we have an addressable Market that Google would blush over think about it it it effectively impacts nearly every American there's 13 trillion dollar of just the life insurance piece but when you start to roll that into other sides of financial planning it shouldn't be any surprise that we're having conversations with the largest in financial institutions in the country looking to apply and use some of these data sets that kind of leads to my next question which is investors are always curious about the risk and the future potential growth for this company are there any economic factors or changes in policy or things that could impact the future growth of your company or like you said is this a product that really truly will continue to impact everyone I think we're at the very early stages here which means that you're you're mitigating a lot of that what we would call compressed yield growth and in our case because you look at the overall size of the market is so large there are so many people that are just learning that this is a financial option to them and then applying this longevity piece to financial planning we have a lot of run room still left to go uh and frankly this is a proc consumer transaction so The Regulators it's heavily regulated already The Regulators really like this transaction right think about it we paid out just in 2023 $220 million to Consumers that $220 million on average went to people over the age of 70 think about how they're applying that maybe they're not having to go on Medicare or Medicaid even sooner right like we're putting a lot of liquidity into what might be deemed as a as a market that you know wants to maintain their dignity and integrity and now they have the resources to do so so where we sit today we are in a terrific position from both a regulatory as well as a market position to continue to maintain these growth well the last question I like to ask is as the CEO of this company what excites you most about abacus's life the way this company is run the products you offer what about running this company makes you most excited every day when people think of advocus what I really hope their takeaway is is that we are improving the quality of life for seniors for their families for their caregivers just on the insurance side and when you can change someone's quality of life uh and you can truly put wealth in a place that they didn't think that they have it that's what gets me up in the morning it's our purpose is about education and truly having an impact when you look at the underlying tagline of our company it's know the value of your life people don't place a value on their most important asset which is their lifespan and what we think we can do is help people better understand it and if they better understand it they can place a value on it and if they do that now they're going to be able to expand this into several other areas of their life so purpose and quality of life is super important that I think Abacus is providing",1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,XP1amGkNQn8,2024-11-22T23:19:21Z,NVIDIA Earnings: Can Blackwell Propel the Stock to $200+ in 2025?,NVIDIA,"no surprise it's been a very high volume week for NVIDIA as earnings came out on Wednesday to talk about where the stock is now and where it's headed is Market beat analyst Thomas Hughes Thomas there's been a lot of movement on Nvidia ever since that report came out yeah it's been a pretty volatile reaction I would say the Market's having a hard time deciding if it's a good or a bad report I think it was a very very good report given the growth and the cash flow and the outlook for sales so right now we're down a little bit from uh the highs on Wednesday when they reported earnings still above critical support levels that's the previous all-time highs the volume is rising on a day-to-day basis and for the last few weeks um we are still also below a critical resistance point so we might see a little bit more sidewinding over the next few weeks but um the Outlook is positive the analyst trend is positive so I would expect to see all-time highs again pretty soon yeah I know you said before that this is the best report you've seen in two years from Nvidia and that if there is a dip which is kind what we're seeing right now at least sideways movement um it would be pretty short-lived why do you think this is going to be such a short-lived pullback the last few years have shown that nvidia's um position and technology has changed it's not just a stock for video games anymore it is now Central to the technology infrastructure because technology is now based on AI and when it comes to AI Nvidia is the first mover it's the the industry leader uh not only with its chips but with its Cuda infrastructure structure because without Cuda you can't really use those chips to do anything and now with Blackwell coming out those gpus are really being made to be AI specific so it's really going to improve the technology I expect to see more improvements over the next few years there's going to be really big major advances coming fairly regularly I would believe and Nvidia is Central to all of that absolutely the big part of this report is talking about how much demand there is for Blackwell and that Blackwell will be actually hitting the market in 2025 so let's talk about what that means for this stock moving forward and why Blackwell is in such high demand so Blackwell is in demand because it's better it's better than the previous iterations and it's better than a lot of the competition so it provides improved performance for AI specifically with training and inference now inference is critical because that's the leap from just reading data to making decisions that's where the AI really comes into play and you mentioned some features about black well that are so much better again this next generation is something people are excited for what are some features that have companies already investing in upgrading their AI Tech well a lot of it centered on the high bandwidth memory it's a new architecture for memory where um Micron Technology is a leader but what it does is allow for faster Computing um higher performance Computing while also helping to control temperatures temperatures are really important because of the power usage and the cost for the data centers to operate them and it seems like every Big AI giant out there is investing in those data centers right now let's talk about customers who are some of the biggest customers for these Blackwell chips all right so there's a number of customers that kind of fit into two or three different categories the number one are the cloud hyperscalers you've got Microsoft AWS and Google including Oracle to a lesser degree who command 95% of the cloud Market all of these companies already have Blackwell in use and the word on the street is that they're using them to build their most advanced super clusters met is using them to build a super Advanced cluster and Oracle is using it to build the oci super cluster which is going to be the first Zeta scale super cluster it's going to use 130,000 gpus in one cluster that's a large amount of gpus and quite a bit of revenue for NVIDIA especially considering over the next few years the upgrade cycle that's going to come about with the next iterations of these chips so that's a lot of positive outlook for NVIDIA but let's talk about any potential risks for this stock so there is some concern that the revenue will contract or compress in in the future we're not sure when that's going to happen but eventually there'll be some market normalization right now there's a rush to kind of get ahead of the curve once the industry normalizes Revenue might pull back a little bit but even so we're going to be looking at a company that's 8 n 10 times bigger than it was before the AI Revolution kicked off so the big question right now though is the cash this company is generating so much cash it's ridiculous its cash balance doubled over the last year it's net cash versus total liability it's in such a strong position to provide Capital Returns the only question is when so right now what I'm thinking is that this company is probably going to ride its momentum on its Revenue momentum until the stock price really begins to top out and then I would expect to see some pretty aggressive Capital returns including special dividend dividend increases and aggressive share repurchases what are analysts saying about the returns the stock could have just in the next year right so the analyst response to the news was pretty good I mean there's a lot of Market pundits kind of poo pooing it and calling it a bad report and kind of uh clouding the the future but the analysts are across the board raising their price targets they're leading to the high-end range of their target range which puts the stock at 200 or higher which is a $50 or about a 35% increase over the next 12 months based on the business Trends I would expect the analyst Trends to continue so that high-end will continue to rise over the next 12 months and a move to 200 may just be the tip of the next Iceberg so there's still plenty of room for this stock to grow but a lot of people are questioning when will nvidia's competitors start to catch up right so the competitors are working really hard right now and the closest competitor is AMD they're still the ways behind because Nvidia has so many years of of advanced work on their their infrastructure but AMD is really catching up now the opportunity right now is that demand for NVIDIA chips outpaces their ability to produce them so if AMD is able to get their production going there's an opportunity for them to start selling chips to people that just can't wait long enough to get the Nvidia chips.",1.0,0.8

string of very highly impressive reports uh we need to understand just how high the bar was set analysts have been raising their forecast and their estimates up until just minutes before the Rel it's been a steady stream of revisions so the consensus was a little bit more than 82% Revenue growth they produced almost 95% Revenue growth they widen their margins um earnings are up 111% and on top of that the guidance is also hot so this really is just an all the way around excellent report much better than expected better than expected is a thing any investor likes to hear but last earnings report Nvidia was also better than expected and it still wasn't quite enough do you think it's enough to satisfy investors well you can never tell what the market the Market's a pickle Beast um if the market does pull back right now it would be absolutely a buying opportunity uh this company is still firing on all cylinders I mean it's so strong as having to borrow cylinders from other people to fire on them it's doing so well so yeah I would expect this stock to continue trending higher I will be looking out for quite a few um analyst revisions tomorrow I would expect to see them coming out pretty strongly over the next couple days and just see what they say I think that they're going to leave this stock much much higher let's dive into the details of this report a little bit more what are some of the really exciting things that we saw for the future of Nvidia come out in this report well so all the strength is still in the data center so it's all about AI the company says that demand is incredible for Hopper which is the current um iteration of its products but also for Blackwell which is the next Generation they say Blackwell is a full production right now so we should expect to see that hitting the uh end users really soon and start seeing some some benefit from that in their results but as far as data center goes it grew by 112% 177% sequentially we're looking for another big impressive uh growth in the current quarter the guidance for the current quarter is pretty awesome as well just one more factor that will help lead this stock to new highs this stock does just keep getting higher reaching all alltime highs just within the last couple of weeks I feel like we see this every time before an Nvidia earings report where the market gets really excited for the news that's going to come out and then we do sometimes see that pullback I know you talked about it a little bit already but what are your thoughts on whether we see a pullback in a stock and if we do see a pullback how shortlived will that be well the last pullback didn't last very long I think that this one if it were to happen would not last very long either um just as you were saying the market did run up quite a bit ahead of their results people were fully expecting the strength we broke to new highs just a week or so ago so a little pullback would be a natural a natural market movement and I think that it would absolutely lead to the next buying opportunity where are analysts expecting the stock to go it's been on quite a rip already well there is a little bit of a range to the consensus estim or to the estimates but the consensus is rising it's looking for about a 15% increase but the high-end range where most of the targets are uh caps out at $200 which is about 33% upside for the stock I would expect to see that number increase over the coming weeks because of these results yeah and there's no really stopping the growth of this company in fact some are saying the growth for NVIDIA is really just beginning that once Blackwell comes out we're going to see even more growth down the road is that what you're seeing in this report uh yeah I think I would concur with that assessment um as the CEO has said before there is a multi-trillion dollar um upgrade cycle going on right now in data centers so all the data centers that are existing are trying to upgrade and then that all the new data centers are relying on all this nextg technology the way that AI is advancing technology will advance again in the next year or two so all of these data centers will need to upgrade again so we're in a persistent upgrade cycle I would say because I would expect to see AI technology Advance rapidly and significantly enlarged steps over the next few years so just wrapping up your thoughts on this report did Nvidia satisfy with its Q3 report I would say that it did awesome well thank you so much for the analysis Thomas and thank you for joining us I know we have a lot

MarketBeat,OsmoDEs-fNM,2024-11-19T22:23:31Z,Palantir and the NASDAQ 100: What’s the Next Big Stock Swing for This AI Giant?,Palantir,It's been a wild week for Palantir with the stock shooting up and then back down again. This feels like a week for the record books for Palantir. I know you've been a fan of the stock for a while what's going on right now? Well the stock really just shot higher on news that the company's not going to be trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of Friday it'll be trading on the NASDAQ but what really got the stock moving was the company believes it's going to be able to fulfill the listing requirements to be a part of the NASDAQ 100 index. And if that happens it means that funds such as the Invesco QQQ which are Benchmark to the NASDAQ 100 index are going to start to have to add Palantir stock that's why that was the reason for the movement up in the stock. Let's talk about just how far the stock moved up. 5 day is really crazy to see how much the stock went up and then come Monday it went down almost just as much as it went up the week before. Absolutely. So it bounced up and then it came all the way back down here to about where it started the week and then this was the price action late week and it got all the way up to over $65 a share when it closed on Friday night so that was a 10% gain from the start of the week to here was about a 10% gain lost that this isn't was in pre-market on Monday morning it lost that and you'll notice though that where it bottomed here is about the same as where it started so that's kind of telling me that Palantir is forming a fairly good base of support right there around that $5859 level. So you're looking at support around $5859 but I feel like just a couple of months ago you and I were on here doing a video about will Palantir reach $50 so this stock has seen quite a bit of movement that now $58 is that support level and not a will it reach that level. Right. And so if we can just take a look here Bridget we can see that three months ago and we were doing the video for could Palantir hit 50 when the stock was trading down around here and that's right around the $35 level and since then look at all the gains that it's made so clearly Palantir answered that question and then even if you look here I mean it's bounced off that level of what looked like support at around $40 and it's just been shooting higher so yeah this has been a big winner for the year and it just keeps on setting new levels of support as it goes higher. I think that's so right it's been a big winner for the year and is that why there's so many Traders getting in on this stock right now kind of moving those 10% swings into each Direction. Palantir is a fairly heavily shorted stock but that hasn't necessarily worked out really well if you're a short seller because there's a lot of retail investors that are still committed to holding the stock for the long term they're not selling their shares and so when you see a price movement like that it there's really not a lot of opportunity. Now some of the price action that you saw on Monday morning that may have been just people taking profits on the stock and if that's the case that's fine. The stock is overvalued by any fundamental measure right. Let's get into that value what are analysts predicting and how often are those price targets changing because the stock is growing and moving so quickly. Price targets haven't changed a whole bunch since their last earnings report. Goldman Sachs came out and they raised it to like $41 they were at like $31 so analysts are still believing that Palantir is overvalued and I'm not going to sit here and argue with anybody by any objective measure Palantir stock is overvalued. The question is if you're a long investor you're long and so you would probably love to see Palantir pull back even more than it's pulled back right now and you could continue to accumulate shares at a much lower price but that as we're showing in the chart that doesn't look like it's really likely to happen. So really the question you just have to ask yourself is are you going to get in are you not going to get in options trading actually I put in my article options trading might have been a really good strategy but now the Stock's already dipped on Monday morning I don't know if there's probably an option trade in there somewhere but I'd have to go back and look at the charts to see where I would want to be putting my price targets for that. Absolutely. Now this is such an interesting stock we've done a lot of different stories about what Palantir is what this company provides it's one big player in AI. There are so many AI stocks like this one that are really gaining tremendous success so where exactly does Palantir fit in on the AI story. Here's the thing about AI is I was just hearing last week something that's really interesting is that there's as the earning season has gone through there's some analysts that are becoming a little bit how should we say a little bit skeptical about AI and that's because companies are reporting that they're making this investment in AI but they're not necessarily seeing the return on that investment in what AI is delivering for them. That's the key thing with Palantir and their ontology. What Palantir is being able to provide their customers with is usable data that the companies have never been able to figure out how to make any use of it before and Palantir delivering meaningful insights to those customers and that's the difference is Palantir's being able to show the customers a return on their investment with meaningful insights using AI and that's where Palantir has a significant lead and it's which is why it Palantir not just a one of many but right now it's the one of one. You can find a lot of Chris's other videos where he's talked about Palantir and why this company is so unique part of the reason we're seeing so much movement in their stock right now. Chris thank you so much for breaking down what's been going on with Palantir this week we will stay tuned to all the moves in this stock and many others in the AI space.

MarketBeat,Wd_A7hitnX4,2024-11-19T01:18:48Z,Rocket Lab Stock Explodes Higher—What’s Next for This Space Pioneer?,Rocket Lab,rocket lab stock is taking off ever since some exciting news was announced for the company during last week's earnings report here to break it all down for us is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris really some exciting news about some big launches for this company in their earnings report they said that they had a record number of launches of their electron Rockets during the last quarter and I believe they said it was over 1 billion in backlogs in terms of launches for the company so very good news for the long-term shareholders uh sets very well for the company as far as the path to profitability which is important going forward I think there was also some earnings beat uh excitement in the report that or the earnings report that came out too you know the company is um they're not profitable yet but they're getting closer you can see the path to profitability and the revenue just keeps getting higher year-over-year that's what investors like to see let's talk about all of the trading interest in this stock there is a lot of people looking at Rocket lab right now yeah and some of them are not looking at it in terms of going long and investing for the future some are looking to short it this is a fairly High short interest stock yeah Chris a lot of Traders are really interested in this stock right now there's some pretty high short interest numbers right now in addition to having investors who are looking to buy the stock and hold it for the long term you've also got a lot of Traders looking to short the stock it short interest in rocket lab right now is up about 19% I think you and I were looking at that before we came on so it's down a little bit in the last month but it's still 19% short interest is still considered very high for a stock if you are new to trading in these high short interest stocks we've talked about short interest for Rocket lab let's talk about the price and what analysts are expecting right now this stock is trading way higher than what anyone really thought if you go on the market beat page for the analyst forecast the consensus price has it at about $14.72 so that's almost $5 higher than where the stocks trading right now but since I wrote my article um both caner Fitzgerald and Bank of America raised their price targets significantly for Rocket lab stock Bank of America went from $10 all the way up to $30 caner Fitz gerro went from $7 all the way up to $24 so you you're starting to see sentiment where analysts are raising their price targets above where the price is now which then suggests that the stock could go higher and getting back to that short interest point we were just talking about that means this may not be a good time to be shorting the stock because you could get caught in a squeeze absolutely with it being this high already do we see a risk of it coming down or are some of those new analyst predictions maybe something to look towards could this go even higher yet it could go higher it wouldn't surprise me if there was a little bit of a pullback when a stock goes up this high this fast uh it's right for people that are for shortterm Traders who are looking to just take some profit get some money off the table so it wouldn't surprise me if it goes down and keep in mind those price targets are probably you know for 12 months out so it wouldn't be surprising to see the stock come down a little bit then see a lot of institutional interest in buying the stock at a little bit lower price and then see it go back up again and of course if you're long on the stock you're just you're long and you just believe that the price is going to go up and so you're going to probably stay the course and you might even want to see a little bit of a dip now we've talked about rocket lab a few times on this channel and the people who are investing in this company are excited about the space race and everything that rocket lab take brings to the the table for that talk about some exciting advancements happening in this industry and specifically for this company we're in the middle of I guess a new space race is what I would call it and instead of it being I think in the' 60s it was the United States and the Soviet Union this is more of the United States and China in terms of we're trying to get that next lunar Landing with human beings on the moon and then ultimately to get to Mars rocket lab's a part of that but right now that's in the future right now the next step for Rocket lab is their Neutron Rockets which which have the ability to take on a slightly larger payload than their electron Rockets and the good news that came out of the company's report is that they are still on schedule to have those launches execute starting in 2025 that's just again more revenue for the company pushes it closer to the path of profitability and that's good news that's what investors want to see the company is about more than just launches but right now launches is where they're generating a tremendous amount of their business oh let's talk about the the current econ and kind of some different factors that might impact the investment into the Space Race moving forward I think the space sector is going to be okay um obviously you know we're just not really sure how all of the government efficiency efforts that the Trump Administration is going to undertake is going to affect that where are some of the cuts going to come where are they not going to be I think we're going to be okay here as long as you don't see the economy jump into a massive recession which doesn't look like it's going to happen let's talk about those people who might be new to Rocket lab just hearing about the stock because of this big takeoff is now a time to buy um when it's taken off this much and let's back up a little bit and just talk about how unique a runup this fast and or this big this fast is for stocks like this you always have to be careful um when you look at Price action like this when you have short interest that's as high as Rocket Labs because you have to wonder is this new money coming in on the Sidelines or is this money short investors who are now covering their short positions now that the stocks gone higher that's going to take a little bit of time to play out um if I were interested in buying the stock I I think the question you have to ask yourself is are you looking at this as a short-term trade or as a longer term investment I think the answer might be a little bit of the same which is if you're investing in it as a Trader I think you're going to want to wait to see it try to come back a little bit and then you try to get in if you're a investor that's interested in taking a longer position on the stock and you believe that the Stock's going to have a lot of growth coming in the next five 10 15 years I think it's okay to get in now and just you don't maybe have to go all in but maybe take a smaller position and then just add to that position over time some good information Chris thank you so much for your time today talking about this stock that has really caught a lot of people's attention right now if you want to learn more about rocket lab we've got several other videos we've done on this company check

MarketBeat,sQiv23Lu0p8,2024-11-13T23:46:13Z,Why SoundHound Stock Dip Could Mean Big Gains for 2025 Investors,SoundHound,"SoundHound is starting Wednesday down 15% after its earnings report, but it's really just a reaction to news that didn't make the market quite happy enough, despite outperforming expectations and raising guidance. The company is still growing by nearly 90%, with accelerating growth in the very earliest stages of an industry expected to grow more than 500% in the next six years. This pullback is absolutely a time to buy the stock. SoundHound is still a very tiny micro cap with revenue this quarter of just $25 million, but its industry is AI voice assistance, which is seen as the killer app for AI. This is the leading voice AI product, improving daily, expanding into new verticals, and increasing the breadth of its offerings. It's growing at a hyper-growth pace above 80%, continuously and persistently raising its guidance, a 'quadruple win' for the business. Despite the dip, a big 2025 is expected due to new contracts and an expanding, diversified client base. The 6.50 level looks like a pretty good trigger point for buying, and early indications are that the market is buying this dip. SoundHound is a good candidate for short-term and long-term options plays due to its volatility and clear technical levels. Short interest will likely provide fuel for higher prices as the company continues to grow and outperform estimates. Analysts' sentiment has been firming this year to a moderate buy, with price targets expecting a low double-digit advance, but an analyst upgrade cycle is expected to lead this stock to new highs. This is a good, albeit speculative, stock to get into, with a smart position expected to perform very well for investors.",1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,ApIgde_JS8M,2024-11-12T20:29:49Z,Nintendo Stock: Buy Before the 2025 Switch Platform Hits!,Nintendo,"This next company also an OTC stock but definitely a company many people have heard of before. It's Nintendo, and so many investors are familiar with it because they are consumers as well, and many are Gamers as well. You know Nintendo for the Nintendo Universe, the fun characters Super Mario, Zelda, all that. So here's the thesis for owning the stock right now. Nintendo introduced the Switch about 7 years ago. They're due to launch a new version of the platform. The company has said that's going to start in March of 2025. If you're thinking like an investor, you want to get in on the stock before that gets launched because that's when the biggest gains in the stock are already going to be gone. If you believe that the company's going to hit that deadline, now would be a great time to be invested in the stock. It's got a current price of about $13. The analysts are saying it could go as high as $63, so this is a strong buy stock because people are believing that once that Switch platform is released, you're going to start seeing a lot of these people start upgrading the original Switch platform that they have. One more thing about Nintendo is they're kind of doing what Marvel's doing, they're taking their characters and they're moving them into the Cinematic Universe. You already saw Super Mario's movie, there's going to be a sequel to that, and there's also going to be other plans to do movies for other of the Nintendo characters. My kids love that movie, I've seen it many times, and then they want all of the characters that come with it, they want to dress up as Bowser for Halloween, so I see the profitability in that plan for sure. The risk for Nintendo I think is not so much that the Switch platform is not going to be accepted by consumers. I think the risk might be that the launch gets delayed. I believe it's already been delayed by about three months. Their original plan was to have it out for the holiday season this year and they had to push that back, so there's always that risk that comes with it. But I think in the case of Nintendo, I don't think analysts have to be that worried about the platform not being accepted by consumers. From what I've been hearing, the Gaming Community is very very interested in the new Switch platform coming out. Getting in on this stock at around that $13 mark it sounds like a pretty good entry point for sure.",1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,8EquXmVKC2w,2024-11-11T23:21:29Z,How to Profit from NVIDIA’s Earnings: Short-Term Trading Guide,NVIDIA,"Nvidia soarses to new highs just ahead of earnings. Just how high could it go in the next week? Thomas, let's start with just how high Nvidia's stock went just last week. Well, uh, last week it broke above a critical resistance target. That was the previous all-time high right around 141. And then it continued to move higher. So, it gained about 6 or 7% by the end of the week. Uh, but the critical detail is that it broke above a trading range. It broke above a previous high as a significant resistance point which indicates that the trend is still up. I would expect to see the stock continue to rise over the next week going into the earnings report. The earnings report very well could be a strong catalyst for bigger gains over the next two to three quarters. Yeah, there's a lot of movement and a lot of talk around Nvidia that happens every time their earnings report comes up. Now, one thing I want to point out is last time we were talking about Nvidia's earnings report, the everyone was waiting for that report to come and then the stock price fell immediately after earnings report. Are we expecting or anticipating anything like that surrounding this earnings? I think it would be safe bet to assume that there will be a price pullback after that. There's a lot of sentiment and um euphoria driven or embedded in the Nvidia price. So, even with a good report, there's probably going to be some profit taking. Uh, but any dip that forms would be a likely buying or entry point for new money, for new investors, both for short-term trades and for long-term investments. So, let's talk about getting in for those traders who are looking to make a profit off of some of the swings that are going to be happening with Nvidia this week and next week. Uh, where is a good entry point? Well, right now the 141 level looks like a pretty solid entry point. That is our resistance target, the previous high that was broken last week. Uh the market is moving up from that level. But uh technical theory says that the market is likely to pull back and retest for support. It could pull back as far as that 141 level. If it were to touch to that level, I would expect to see a pretty strong confirmation from the market that that is a a buying opportunity as far as wanting to get out and make that short-term profit. What price target would you be looking for in the near term? a 10 to 20% gain would be pretty easy. That aligns with um the general trend of analyst revisions. But over the long term, I would say there's a good 30% upside from that previous high because of the revision trends and because I would expect to see the revision trend continue to be positive over the coming quarters. Now, if you're looking to stay in Nvidia or to get in on more Nvidia, maybe when it has one of those dips coming up in the stock, what are some indicators and some talk right now about positive signs for long-term NVIDIA growth? There's been a lot of discussion around Blackwell and just on their really solid revenue happening right now. Well, right now it's coming down to the uh the hyperscalers. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are all investing big dollars into their into their data center infrastructure, and most of that money is flowing to Nvidia. Um, we can see some of that flow going through Taiwan Semiconductors, who posted a pretty significant revenue increase. They make the bulk of Nvidia chips. So, right now, this is a systemic issue that we're watching. Um, the system is focused on Nvidia's chips, but it's being driven by all of the big major mega tech companies. Even uh Meta, Oracle, all the big guys that are building their data centers are all relying real heavily on Nvidia chips. So, what's the longer term target for Nvidia's stock price moving forward? Well, right now we have the analyst and the technical indicators um kind of confirming or agreeing together uh for the 190 to 200 range. So that that's right in line with the 30 to 35% gain I was talking about before. So a good long-term future, but in the short term, it feels like there could be some risk with that earnings report still coming out. What's the risk for people looking at this as as a short-term trade right now? Well, the risk is that the report will be underwhelming. So there is a lot of expectation baked into the report. Analysts have been raising their estimates. The bar has been set pretty high. Um, but with such demand, there's possible that the pipeline of chips isn't able to support how much demand there is. So, the report really could be underwhelming and that is a big risk for the stock price. That's definitely what we saw at last earnings report. We'll see if this one could be any different.

MarketBeat,m2mEdl113VA,2024-11-08T17:00:52Z,Revolutionizing Logistics: Dot Ai Corporation CEO Ed Nabrotzky Talks IPO and Innovations,Dot Ai Corporation,using AI to help companies keep track of their things let's dive into this new company about to go public today we are excited to have Ed NE brosky the CEO ofai Corporation with us to share more about his company Ed thank you so much for your time today thanks for inviting us we're excited to tell our story let's start out with what isai we started about three years ago and we developed a new way of collecting data at the edge of the enterprise we um we kind of invented that in the basement as most startups do and we started working on that actually in the autonomous vehicle Market we were looking at ways of using Cooperative markers to interact with um traffic signs Urban canyons and cities and things like that but the technology we developed there really became more applicable to uh Logistics and Manufacturing and and um asset tracking type technology and so we started transition into that space um the software we were veloping at the time also we realized the advantage of AI was much more powerful in these kind of multi-layered complex systems and so about two years ago we migrated the company much more towards Logistics and asset management and and that's really where we found a home and found great traction so uh that's what we are today wonderful so let's start with who are your customers who who uses your product well that's the problem with assets uh we all have things right I like to talk about the the internet of things but let's talk about the things customers are everything from consumers who have things all the way up to large Enterprises that have things we all want to know where our things are how many things we have are our things getting to the right place at the right time so anyone that has that kind of concern is one of our customers now we target Enterprise class customers that have multiple locations that are really concerned about their things and so uh large customers that are in the retail sector uh manufacturing is one of our biggest sectors that are moving a lot of things a lot of times through processes uh Logistics uh shipping companies the military has been a big deal for us they have a lot of things moving all the time um anyone who's got to manage their things is is our customer it sounds like that would take a team of software developers who are some of the people you have working for your team and and talk a little bit about where you are located around the world oh yeah we've uh We've assembled an amazing team I've done a number of startups in the past but I'm really proud of the team that we have our CTO is VJ nambiar he came to us from Verizon we recruited him specifically he was leading their 5G team to veling 5G routers in fact if you're using a Verizon 5G router that was probably vian's work when he was there at at Verizon um so he's an expert in that area uh V Jan has got our embedded team here in Shirley Massachusetts that's where I'm broadcasting from today I'm here in the lab with our launch party getting our our dfm group ready to launch our new product here for the fourth quarter we've got a brand new revolutionary patent pending bridge that we're launching and that's I'm here doing so Shirley Massachusetts just outs side of Boston is our technical headquarters where the R&amp;D really happens um a lot of our software is programmed here from the embedded and device driver side but then we also have our web services and Cloud operations over in India in Bangalore and we have a large team there uh the hardware that we design for our Edge systems is actually manufactured in Puerto Rico we have our own Hardware manufacturing facility there just outside of San Juan and actually the Puerto Rican team is up here with me this week as we prepare for this launch uh so that's a fantastic facility I work mostly out of the Bethesda office we have a Washington DC Administrative Office office that's where all of our accounting and legal and uh compliance work happens um the sales department would call that the overhead group and then of course we have our our headquarters over in Las Vegas in our headquarters we're actually co-located with one of our large Distributors and we call it our Western experience Center that's where our customers can come and see our technology working in a warehouse environment where we move things around where we we change things um we use that as our training center for all of our distribution partners and channel Partners as well as our salespeople so our go to market headquarters is collocated there with our admin Center in Vegas where it's very easy to get people to fly to Vegas and come for training that's a big wide footprint kind of all over the place let's talk about the growth that you're experiencing as a company right now and the recent announcement that just came out too yes so we're we're taking our company public which is really exciting um we'll be on the NASDAQ we hope by the end of the year we're working our way through that we've been going through the various filings and compliance uh but we're on schedule for you know an endof year transition to that public company we need that cash to really Finance the growth that we're seeing we've already started with some Lighthouse customers that are very large multinational billion dollar corporations multi-billion dollar corporations that want to base their systems on our technology and so we've done initial Pilots we've started working through initial sites but uh this explosive growth needs to be funded as we go International uh we'll be founding more locations in Europe in particular as well as southeast Asia and um we'll be advancing a lot of our Channel programs through that that funding the technology we do needs a lot of work as well I mean we've got our base system working but there's so much to be done with AI and with uh image processing that we're working with some of our chip developments we've done with our patented passive microwave technology that this go public move is a chance to give us the rocket fuel we need to really take the system into a new generation of of performance as well as support uh for our customers around the world there's so much conversation around the world about Ai and so many new companies like yours popping up because of the new developments in AI let's talk about competition in this field a little bit are there other competitors out there who are doing something similar to what you're doing or are you really unique in this space well everyone's going to tell you they think they're unique but I've got a a long history I've worked for decades in the RFID and Auto ID business um and so I understand the systems that are there now and I guess I can boil this downbridge into two problems so applying AI to Logistics is relatively easy because AI engines are now available and the technology become more and more refined but the difficulty in applying I Logistics is the data isn't there it's very difficult and expensive to get data from all these things that move today we hire a lot of operators do barcode scanning where you put very expensive portals or infrastructured antennas up and that doesn't give us the richness of data you really need to drive an intelligent AI implementation what's unique about us is that we're not just an RFID company supplying the RFID we're we're marrying it with the vision systems and the AI backend that allows that data to be useful in the workflow so the combination of having the AI software as well as a really Unique Edge data collection system is what lets us develop value or deliver value that other companies really can't we find a lot of our competitors are kind of one trick ponies that are focused either on the software or on the data collection system but they struggle to get the both married together into a way that adds the value and maybe I can elaborate on one part of that so when you think about Edge collection uh Edge data collection um we think often about either a manual process like barcode scanning or we think about a very expensive of infrastructure like portals you know antennas that are scanning through pinch points um what we've developed is is something that you could think of like an Apple Air tag where an iPhone that's traveling through an Enterprise can pick up your air tag and report its location we've developed mobile readers that are battery powered that can go on your pallets on your forklifts on your totes and as it goes through your Enterprise it picks up these other tags and these other items um very seamlessly very inexpensively without having an engineer on site that has to put that together that's what's kind of unique about our data collection system uh and then on the software side having people that are experienced in this industry I've spent a career in this industry um many of my my sea- Lev team are from that side we've done an implementation I think that is really unique in the AI uh using not just the RF uh data capture capability but also the the vision systems that we overlay with it so um it's really kind of a an exciting and unique way that we've created a way to dynamically gather this data and then make it meaningful to an operator to get my things to the right place the right time I think that's what investors want to hear is what kind of demand is out there and what kind of success are you seeing with your clients clearly you're seeing some growth already but what's the benefit to the customers that you're serving and what kind of demand are you seeing from that pool of customers I've never had a company like this that has such a u a high hit rate normally when you're calling out you're in single-digit percentages about demand generation activities and number of contacts we've been ping in the percentages and I I don't want to over quote it here and get in trouble but so many people are looking for a way to do this better and that's a combination of two things one is they they understand the inefficiencies in their process they're losing things they're having unreliability in the things but I think the other part is they're being driven by fear that the big retailers like Amazon Walmart have shown that tying their demand triggers from the front end to their backend operation is tremendously efficient and delivers value that we've never believed before I mean I I don't you're not as old as I am but I I would never have thought that I could order something online and have it show up on my doorstep the next day right that's like a miracle but we now expect that but so many Enterprises in the world today they have two we lead times to fulfill an order within their own internal operations their Logistics programs are still Antiquated and they and they don't have a way to upgrade them to that kind of modern expectation so the cios I talk to the CEOs I talk to at our customers are desperate to get those demand triggers in real time to the edge and get data from The Edge to to their customers of where their things are and how they're going to be delivered and they just haven't found a good solution that rolls in a cost- effective way that has the intelligence that they want that we're seeing in the commercial world and so we hope to be the one to bring it to them uh we know there's others of course trying to get there but we think we have a unique ability to get there first another important thing for our investors is always about the financials and how the company is run to um are you finding success already at this early stage of your company I believe you said you're about three years into development yes that's right so that the financials are always difficult I mean we are basically pre-revenue as a SAS company so although we've had some Revenue uh we've had a lot of seed funding um having gathered more than $7 million in seed as we've gone them to the stage and then also gone off of um various grants and research programs we've done that's been the primary source of our funding but um as we build our our SAS model and we're a bit of a hybrid where we have SAS and and Hardware what's wonderful coming to this stage is we have a backlog for our Hardware orders coming in from our transactional side and on the SAS side we have a base of Lighthouse customers that are now growing exponentially as they add more sites and add more applications and so the foundation for growth is there and the customer pickup is there uh but our funding so far has been more pre-revenue type activities that you'd see in a typical Tech startup well and you do have a new partnership with shoulder up tell us what that means for your company yeah shoulder up is our sponsor as we work through this go public uh exercise uh shoulder up is a fantastic uh group that we've enjoyed working with they have deep ties in the military um I probably should have explained earlier that in our our initial start some of our early customers were military uh projects we uh were awarded several SB programs we demonstrated Logistics applications within military and they continue to be an important sector um so schrop has really helped us open more doors there and there's a huge part of our business that's that's focused there um our Factory in Puerto Rico allows us to do made in America development of our Hardware in a way that most of our competitors are sourcing from China and from countries that are not going to allow them to be in those government areas so shoulder up helps us uh open that important door shoulder up is already a a spack company that can help us also take us public and that's been helpful um so U they're not just a transactional partner they're a partner go forward that's going to help us develop our markets that we're targeting they have really good contacts in the areas that we're we're moving forward on so if it's a retail investor who's watching this right now you can't quite find your company right now to invest in but when and how will they be able to find you if they're interest in being an early investor all right so the first thing I would say is look for us on our public disclosures we have filed our initial S4s and those are available if you search for us uh you should know that our current name we're listed under is CID Inc that's uh we we're transitioning the corporation as part of this uh company transition so if you search on the the SEC disclosures under CID Inc you'll see our current S4 which is all of our financial filings as well as the company um go forward plans in terms of being a investor um as we're in this stage um we're we're working with our sponsors with through institutionalsales will be funneled into that group so you would contact me or my CFO Charlie Maddox and we would uh bring you into our our institutional pipeline Group Well thank you so much for your time today is there anything else about your company that you'd like to share you've said a few different times um about what makes you so excited about this company compared to others you've been at and that's a question I love to ask is just Why as the CEO of this company are you excited about what you are offering atai oh goodness there's so many reasons um it always starts with the people I have an exceptional management team and it's been such a joy to work with them and to have them so confident in each of their areas the Departments we set up the people we've started to attract it's been wonderful to build a team and and that's always the Great Joy but the second part that we're seeing the adoption we are um I think we've hit the timing really really well uh it's a time where AI is is emerging and it needs to be applied to more use cases we're seeing it being applied in our our normal lives but Logistics and supply chain and and asset management generally is pretty old school there's a lot of paper and clipboard out there still there's a lot of manual barcode scanning and labeling and um it's a rich field for this technology to be applied um it's a complex field no one person can manage a multi-layered supply chain and get everything to the right place at the right time uh AI is a tremendous aid for that and and I think everyone's seeing that because they're more comfortable with AI in their private life so it's a combination of the timing our technology hitting the market at the right time it's solving a real problem that's a multi-trillion dollar problem and I've got the best team I've ever had in a in a company to tackle it so I'm excited about that that is something to be excited about thank you again Ed so much for your time today and for sharing a little bit more about your company with our

MarketBeat,qxy6L1JFX1M,2024-11-06T00:11:43Z,Top 3 Stocks Under $20 with Strong Buy Ratings and Growth Potential,Prosus,let's get right to your list and start with the first one and this is a company really all about investing right uh process is the company the the thing that I found interesting about this company and that that's kind of exciting if you're an investor is every investor wants to invest in the next new thing well that's exactly what this company does they look for the hottest Trends in Tech and then they either invest in the companies in some cases they actually manage the companies so you're not just getting a company that invests in emerging Tech trends like e-commerce and fintech but you're also getting a company that doesn't just invest in US companies but they invest in Emerging Markets so we're talking about India we're talking about China in fact one of the stories about process is they just sold off or in the process of selling off some of their stake in tensent which is a which is a major Chinese e-commerce Giant and that's helping to propel uh what a lot of analysts see are going to be the growth for the company in the coming years well that's the thing about this company they're investing in other companies that they see potential for growth those upand cominging companies that can grow so that means upside and I think that's what every investor is looking at what kind of upside does this stock have I think it's currently trading around $8.50 and the analysts have a consensus price target of around $10.60 high price of $142 so there's significant upside at least that's what the analysts believe,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,qxy6L1JFX1M,2024-11-06T00:11:43Z,Top 3 Stocks Under $20 with Strong Buy Ratings and Growth Potential,Nintendo,this next company also uh an OTC stock but definitely a company many people have heard of before yeah this is actually one I've been watching for about a year now uh it's Nintendo and so many investors are familiar with it because they are consumers as well and many are Gamers as well and so you know Nintendo for the Nintendo Universe the fun characters Super Mario Zelda all that so here's the thesis for owning the stock right now Nintendo introduced the switch about seven years ago I think it was 2018 2019 in that time frame they're due to uh launch a new version of the platform the company has said that's going to start in March of 2025 so if you're thinking like an investor you want to say you want to get in on the stock before that gets launched because that's when the biggest gains in the stock are already going to be gone so if you believe that the company's going to hit that deadline now would be a great time to be investing in the stock it's got a current price of about $13 the analysts are saying it could go as high as $63 so this is a strong by stock because people are believing that once that switch platform is released you're going to start seeing a lot of these people start upgrading the plat the original switch platform that they have yeah and one more thing about Nintendo that I didn't that I put my article on I didn't want to forget to say here is it's it's kind of interesting because they're kind of doing what Marvel's doing they're taking their characters and they're moving them into the Cinematic universe so you already saw Super Mario's movie there's going to be a sequel to that and there's also going to be other plans to do movies for other of the Nintendo characters yeah my kids love that movie I've seen it many times and then they want all of the characters that come with it they want to dress up as Bowser for Halloween so yeah I see the profitability in that plan for sure um let's talk a little bit more about other stocks maybe some case studies that we've seen when there's so many companies that are dependent on a product launch people get excited for it they want to try it out do we ever see product launches flop and maybe not do quite as well as investors or analysts might be expecting you see them I I can't think of one just right off the top of my head but yes that's always the risk in stocks like this the risk for Nintendo I think is not so much that the switch platform is not going to be accepted by consumers I think the risk might be that the launch gets delayed I believe it's already been delayed uh uh by about three months I think their original plan was to have it out for the holiday season this year and they had to push that back so there's always that risk that comes with it but I think in the case of Nintendo I don't think analysts have to be that or investors have to be that worried about the platform not being accepted by consumers the from what I've been hearing the Gaming Community is very very interested in in the new Switch platform coming out well and getting in on this stock at around that $13 mark it sounds like a pretty good entry point for sure,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,qxy6L1JFX1M,2024-11-06T00:11:43Z,Top 3 Stocks Under $20 with Strong Buy Ratings and Growth Potential,Barrick Gold,"let's move on to your final pick in the series and this is a topic that everyone's been talking about recently and that's gold it seems like you can't even turn on any financial news anymore without hearing about gold and in many cases it's about gold making new highs almost every day it's I think over 2700 it's near a record high as we're talking today A lot of people are forecasting that it's going to go to 3,000 by the end of the year and then even higher into 2025 and there's reasons for that I don't want to get into all of them right now but basically we're getting into the idea of as long as Government continues to spend there's going to be inflationary pressures on the economy which makes gold more attractive to investors but a lot of investors don't want to invest in physical gold and there are reasons for that don't need to go into those here Barrett gold is my last pick and honestly it surprised me to see the stock was still trading under under $20 but it is it's just a shade under $20 and it's a really good investment for uh for investors who are looking to get exposure to gold gold miners tend to do well as the price of gold goes up because it makes it more profitable for them to mine that's what barra's discovering they have one of the world's oldest mines they have one of the world's most productive mines uh this is a company sometimes you can get into mining companies that offer a lot of speculative risk you don't have any of that with baric they're a rock solid company very good financials what about the upside for this stock Chris just how high are analysts expecting this could go yeah analysts are forecasting a price target of uh a consensus price of 2467 and that's already about a 29% increase over what the Stock's closing price is and of course there are some analysts that are projecting that stock could go even higher than that so now would be a really good time if you're thinking about getting in or you're thinking boy I really should have some exposure to Gold Barrack's a good way of doing that any risk with this stock when it's so dependent on the commodity price of gold will the price of gold and whatever happens with that in the next year really impact success of baric yeah I think so and and obviously Bridget you're hitting on it there's the downside risk if gold prices were to drop especially if they were drop significantly then obviously the gold mining stocks become a become a lot less attractive as an investment but that's not what the forecast is right now as M most people are projecting that Gold's going to enjoy a Very Good Year in 2025 and therefore I think baric is is a very safe investment for investors yeah very good information Chris and interesting picks out there that won't cost investors much to get into and worth a try for sure thanks for your time today Chris and thank you for joining us for this video you can find other unique stock picks right here on our Channel Market beat media thanks for watching and as always happy investing",1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,FNr0X9mpOBk,2024-11-03T18:00:15Z,ISRG Stock Surges: AI and Healthcare Innovation at the Core,Intuitive Surgical,well let's talk about analyst sentiment for a little bit I think that's why many investors are excited about this stock talk about what analysts are saying well the analysts really like the report uh the trend before the report was positive with upgrades and price Target revisions that trend has continued following the report they are definitely leading the market to new highs uh the high end of their target range is in alignment with some of the technical targets so I would really be surprised that this that this stock didn't continue higher for 20 to 30% now you've mentioned this a little bit Thomas just about part of the the boost for this business is how much there's a need for health care across the globe um is there any other factors that could impact this company one way or another or is it just one of those companies and a product that everybody's going to need um I think it's one of those things that everybody's going to end up using uh because it's getting new approvals and and new territories on a regular basis but also within existing territories new approvals for expanded uses um people people are leaning more and more into Health Care this company is certainly um servicing needs and it's got the AI the AI Factor so I think those are all just real positive Tailwinds for the business over time any advice for investors looking to get in on this stock maybe for the first time when when to get in well I'd wait for a price pullback they're they're sure to come uh you don't want to tra chase a market higher but as I said this stock has got a pretty bullish uh trajectory got a pretty bullish story got some clear moment momentum so those pullbacks might not be too frequent and they might not be that deep when they come so it sounds like their Innovations in healthcare are really paying off in a field that has so much Demand right now are there any other companies that are getting close to what intuitive surgical is doing right now well there is quite a bit of competition I would say that most of the large Medtech companies are trying to get into the robotic surgical um segment but they're all playing catchup none of them are pure plays so that's two advantages that intuitive surgical has it's that that first player advantage and Market leadership,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,ls4K-lIY-8Y,2024-11-01T16:45:03Z,Energy Vault Stock Soars 100%: CEO Shares Why in MarketBeat Exclusive,Energy Vault,today we are very excited to have Robert Picone the CEO of energy Vault with us to talk about their exciting innovation in the renewable energy field and like most companies Robert your company really started off by kind of solving a problem the industry was facing and that's storage share a little bit more about what energy Vault does sure thank you virgin pleasure to make some time here and pleasure to meet you we focus on energy storage and we're founded with a mission around broadly decarbonization but very specific to solving a problem around the intermittency of wind and solar uh and enabling essentially what's intermittent power resources uh solar when the Sun shining wind when the wind is blowing and storing that energy um to be discharged uh at times when there's high demand so we look at providing uh economic and sustainable energy storage solutions uh and we can provide them uh in a mechanism and through a software platform to integrate various terms of Technology uh because there is no let's say Silver Bullet there's different applications and use cases and different technologies have different econ e omic profiles to solve those so we um utilize a very sophisticated energy management system and software platform to be able to deliver our own proprietary energy storage solutions as well as integrate other energy storage Solutions in the market yeah you are a company that's also built on AI or at least utilizing it talk about what sets energy vaults Storage Solutions apart from maybe some other competitors in this field I think one thing that's very unique about us versus any other provider is is we do support multiple durations and multiple Technologies so most energy storage companies will focus on for example lithium ion and the short duration Market of two to four hours others uh have developed long duration Technologies like like we have that's focused on eight hours to 12 hours um and even others are looking at developing much longer term even 100h hour batteries for example for longer or Ultra long duration so what's unique about energy vault is that we um develop solutions to serve all of those markets through the development of our Innovative software platform so um that's something that is unique to us and and something that also allows us to be a stronger partner of various customer sets whether that be Public Utilities uh that can be independent power providers or even um can be large industrial energy users um because we can sit with them understand what problem they're trying to solve and match the appropriate technology to it and deliver it and deliver that uh availability of power and we guarantee that through our software platform um so I'd say that's a primary differentiator um and I I think another secondary differentiator for us is we've been in the market now across many regions of the world in in deploying projects so in the US market in the China Market with our gravity solution which is long duration we've gotten started in Australia and just announced a full gigawatt Hour project for example uh just uh one week ago it's a very interesting for us because we have a definitely a global view on what's Happening and have even announced um licensed deals with our long duration gravity technology in 16 uh states in South Africa um for example uh and just to complete the circle we just announced with petross in Brazil at our last earnings a first gravity system for long duration there so I think this second area of both being Global um and and actually implementing projects and delivering projects as a young company is uh also sets us apart absolutely definitely finding success across the globe that announcement with Australia partnership last week help to boost your stock price a little bit but I think our investors are definitely interested in hearing about the long-term commercialization plans what is it going to take to get these products in more countries what's your plan as a company for that it's it's the right question question Bridget especially for investors uh because we uh in our first year of Revenue at 148 million so delivered pretty much right on what we said in our plan we had a a a nice second year where we more than double that growth um so we did almost almost 4 170 million in our first two years and have guided this next two years meaning this year and the next year at 500 to 700 million another large growth but I think investors really want to see that backlog fill up of projects hence to your point of the one gwatt hour in Australia which we bounced at $350 million us plus uh as a as a single project um I think investors want to see that show up in the backlog formally now as we progress so they can get visibility into just the execution of those projects which will generate that revenue and also deliver on what we've also formally guided we did this at our first analyst and investor day uh in May earlier this year but we also guided on being ful year cash flow neida positive uh in what would be our third full calendar year having revenue and and as a public company so that's a a nice growth profile I think for us to have and and to get and Achieve that uh here in our third um third year which will be next year in 2025 uh and and just seeing these announcements now come is what's driving some of that recent uptick in the in the stock because there's that confidence now that uh investors to enter when it becomes now just a matter of just execution of projects and that's one thing we've been very good at and and also done them very quickly and with quality across the board we delivered over a gigawatt hour in in 2023 and have um more projects now that we'll be delivering and uh and those have gone very well yeah you're just a couple weeks ahead of your next earnings reports will there be more project announcements coming or anything you can give a sneak peek to some of our investors yeah we're in a blackout period right now here before our earnings which which are coming up on uh on the 12th of November it's about a week later this year due to the due to the election but you know generally we'll be giving updates on uh on projects as well as on our guidance for the remaining part of the year now that we're going to be approaching almost mid November so we've got pretty good visibility into where we're going to be and um and we'll see also what we're going to be saying about the next year typically we do our Q4 earnings in February later later in February where we would then give our formal guidance on a on an annual basis uh but uh I think we'll be able to talk about what these recent deals that we're announcing um will mean in terms of our plan for next year so we're looking looking forward to that now Rob I wanted to ask this question you've been a part of a lot of Fortune 5 or Fortune 100 companies out there what makes you excited specifically about helping to lead energy vault in this season where there's all kinds of developments in the world of energy yeah well I think anytime you work and have worked for a larger company uh by n just by definition of its size typically they're Global uh so I would say say uh you know that experience that I had in working early on in my career which I started actually in oil and gas and then in the later 90s uh as this little thing called the internet took off got into networking and and software and security and in various companies along the way and seeing how that technology how it evolved and the impact it had in um how businesses were run and how fundamental economics were achieved and how efficiencies were gained and to see that manifest itself in different regions of the world that that absolutely those experiences have supported what we're doing here at energy Vault from the very beginning and this has been a this has been such a um you know such an amazing experience for me having started being one of a few people to start this company is a Founder uh with Bill gross from IDE lab so out of Pasadena based IDE lab and then to build it through the rounds of funding and taking it public and just the Dynamics of the last you know three to four years having something like Co that that sort of brought the world to its knees at one point uh and then coming out of that with a a focus again on on Renewables and and getting those deployed and and the Dynamics we have today it's uh been a fascinating experience but for sure I'm I'm most excited about the potential impact that we can have as a company uh on on the world and the global Dynamics and around renewable storage um and supporting um you know supporting sustainable ways to make the clean energy transition good I think there's plenty of investors out there who care about the renewable energy sources and want to invest in that now we do have other investors who are all about the dollars and the numbers and that balance sheet um what are some facts about the company and the way it's being run financially that you're proud of that you think investors would be interested to hear yeah I think right off the bat I I'd say that we've um managed our investors cash well meaning uh we've built the company and have taken actions to also have a very efficient cost structure proactively um we've not put any debt on the company so we're debt-free uh which makes it um you know uh I think from a management perspective you can uh have that cash to plan for growth as we've been and that's shown up in the fact that we're investing in projects and owning them so we aren't building things and then just flipping them um to to have a some immediate payback which is um you know might be a little smaller from a pure percentage or or margin perspective we're holding attractive assets on our balance sheet investing in them because the returns are much higher over the long term and investors will like that because we're going to have predictable much more predictable cash flows and streams uh versus relying on um a Project based business that can be sort of lumpy quarter to quarter so typically especially is a public company um you know that that lumpiness and those Dynamics quarter to quarter can be difficult for some investors um you know predictability reliability of those cash fls becomes very important so I say the fact that we've managed the cash well uh no debt in the company have not done any dilutive financings um so a lot of companies were sort of forced to do that given just the capital Dynamics uh and um and these are all things I think as we've evolved the company that that investors um app appreciate and will appreciate uh and finally just the aspect of we've able to develop a solution that can adapt to the changes in the market very quickly with software meaning uh if we would have developed just a single product for example and the market shifts like in long duration things moved out a little bit um if we didn't have a platform that could adapt and allow us to deliver what customers wanted in short duration um you know we had a we would have had a much different type of growth path so I think that that Innovation and flexibility and what we've built into our software um means there's more diversification for investors that invest in our company because of our unique ability to meet different technology and durations in energy storage that flexibility and Innovation is already capturing attention of some big companies including that big $350 million deal you got in Australia we saw lots of news coverage of that this October what does that mean and for your future as energy belt yeah I just spent a great week there and was in Melbourne um where they had their all energy conference which is their largest one there and what a amazing opportunity there is there and amazing Investments being there and supported by the local governments um given that the demand and the renewable buildout that's taking place so uh we were very excited to participate not only in the conference but we met with our local teams and brought a lot of our Global Executives there to look at um all the growth that that we see and we just announced our first project last May in Australia a 400 megawatt hour with a um a group called Ain uh and then just announced this second project a full gigawatt hour and just you know so much opportunity there and working in that case with an earlier stage developer and you get those insights into a set of assets and and platform builds uh and to get involved early gives you that insight and ability to I think plan and and meet those customer needs and and make the announcements like we did so we see a tremendous opportunity there and will be um spending more time in building and and growing are actually going to be tripling the size of our team there um over the next 12 months given all the opportunity so so very excited about um participating in that market which is going to be um our most important Market in particular in terms of growth over the next few years,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,O_yAdRy7Rr0,2024-10-24T19:01:37Z,Tesla Stock Rockets 15% Post-Earnings,Tesla,"Tesla fans are celebrating a big boost in the stock after yesterday's earnings report. That stock really went up yesterday after this report, yeah it did shoot up quite remarkably, I think about 15%, that was uh pretty unexpected, but I think the move is a lot of optimism and enthusiasm um over the margin which is you know was really good but I think that ultimately the gains will be capped for 2024 at the top of a trading range so uh investors should really be careful about chasing this Market higher. The company was able to widen its margin significantly um on lower cost and cost controls but also on a boom in selling tax credits um and in strengthen their other businesses. They're growing by double digits but they're about 15% of the total so they're not going to be a significant growth driver over the next year. The Core Business only grew by 2%, that's like 80% slower than the rest of the industry so this is a sign of loss of market share and a serious headwind for the business that will continue to blow over the next year. Investors seem to be really excited about a couple of products specifically that Tesla has plans for coming out in the next two years, so they're expecting to launch the uh the code name model 2 the lower price models um early next year and then the Cyber cab is supposed to be real viable uh by early 2026. But it is questionable that either of those things will happen according to the timeline and that's just a factor that will help support the price over time but also make cap gains um in the near term as we wait to see what happens. The company's move towards automation seemed like investors were excited to hear about that too, hoping to kind of broaden their potential for Revenue growth in the future. In the words of Elon Musk himself this automation, the Cyber cab, is the company's future. The Market's been expecting a model to come out in the $25,000 range and he says that's going to be unlikely because the Cyber cab is expected to cost $25,000. He doubled down saying that automation is the company's future growth trajectory. So eventually once um the FSD technology becomes real viable um he expects all cars to be automated and in that World um only cyber cabs will exist because we won't need to have our own cars we can just say hey Cybercat come pick me up and they'll be one ready for you. Let's talk about what's currently happening with Tesla and that's not the Cyber cab that's the Cyber Truck. The profitability of that line is improving uh but it's still one of the drags on the margin but ultimately the margin news was real good. They achieved their lowest cost per vehicle on on record so across the system they're doing a very good job to reduce their cost and that is really critical for the long-term uh trajectory of the stock price and the company's profitability. This 15% run up could go a little bit higher but the stock is trading within a well-established range it probably has about another 10% to go to hit the top of the range but I would expect to see the gains capped there. The analysts are pretty optimistic about the news, they're looking towards the future as well and they have been increasing their price Target since the news was released but they didn't upgrade the stock it's still pegged at a hold and the price Target increase were pretty minimal, they're still um within a pretty tight range and the consensus is still below the critical resistance point so I think that that is another factor that will limit the upside potential this year. I think that there'll be some pretty big uh price swings in Tesla but uh the thing with this company they're very successful they're on a good trajectory, the only question is timing so I would uh I would be prepared to buy it when it dips and to sell it when it rips. We have more on Tesla on this channel, we've covered this company lots of times so go ahead and dig into some of those other videos that we've done talking about Tesla.",1.0,0.3

MarketBeat,fGIZ-jV-zLY,2024-10-15T21:40:02Z,NVIDIA Nears All-Time Highs: How High Can This AI Leader Climb?,NVIDIA,Nvidia is back to near alltime highs with some predicting a breakout that could go even higher let's dive in hello and thanks for joining us here at Market beat media I'm Bridget Bennett it's a stock you've heard us talk about lots of times here on this channel but we couldn't ignore another chance to talk about the tech giant with this recent rally after some volatility over the last two months Nvidia is back on the rise and remains a Top Choice for most investors we're going to get into why this stock is rallying right now and how far analysts think this Nvidia breakout could go but first here's a few things about this Innovative company that have led to its nearly 200% gain in just the last year so first Nvidia dominates the AI industry what really makes Nvidia stand out against competitors is it's Auda technology Auda allows developers to use nvidia's gpus for high volume Computing not just Graphics this capability is essential for AI and data intensive applications and that really gives Nvidia a Competitive Edge that others simply don't have and that's why they're no longer just a Semiconductor Company they're a key player in AI cloud computing and data centers now all of those advancements and Innovations are paying off in in nvidia's financials with Revenue growth topping 200% in late 2023 and in early 2024 now even though that pace has slowed to about 80% in late 24 the numbers are still incredibly strong and the outlook for 2025 well many analysts expect another 40% to even 50% growth though some believe they might be underestimating nvidia's potential Nvidia does have a record outperforming expectations beating consensus estimates in every quarter since 2022 they've also consistently rais their guidance Often by more than 500 basis points above what analysts were forecasting this trend of beating expectations is likely to continue supported by strong demand for their Ai and GPU products there are a few other things that have retail investors excited that are helping to fuel this climb nvidia's stock split made its shares more accessible to smaller investors which often helps to boost share prices another split may be on the horizon raising the possibility of Nvidia being included in the Dow Jones Industrial index if that happens demand for the stock could surge due to increased buying from index funds and ETFs now when it comes to dividends this is a growth opportunity for NVIDIA the company's dividend might be small now but it is steady and there's room for growth with strong cash flow the company could increase its dividend payouts and continue its share repurchase program which already reduced the share count by an average of 6% last quarter let's get into the stock and its potential for growth analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia with 43 ratings at a consensus Buy price Target it suggests the stock could see another 10% upside with the highend of estimates reaching near $175 about 40% above its current level now if Nvidia breaks through the critical resistance level of $135 it could pave the way to even higher gains by the time Q3 results are released in November nvidia's role in Ai and its strong growth metrics have cemented its place as a favor among investors with analysts backing it up and the potential for more growth on the horizon it is easy to see why Nvidia remains at the top of many watch lists and it's a stock we talk about here on this channel all the time so let us know what you think of nvidia's run and if it will continue or if you're waiting to see how the market reacts to their next earnings report in November we have lots of Nvidia content on our Channel with some of our own analysts Wayne in here at marketbeat please stay on the channel check those out for more Nvidia coverage and a lot of other marketbeat news right here on marketbeat media as always happy investing,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,1pBTkx4C9Is,2024-10-08T16:30:01Z,Star Bulk Carriers Stock 28% Upside: Can This Small Cap Deliver?,Star Bulk Carriers,my first pick is star bulk carriers now this is a dry bulk shipping company so the Port strike is fresh on every Investor's mind uh you know the importance of these companies in terms of getting uh goods and services into our ports and therefore into the broader economy what I found interesting about starbo is not only are they the biggest US listed carrier in terms of Fleet size they have like 160 vessels but one of their primary markets is China and that got me looking at them a little bit closer and one of the things that they said in their most recent earnings report is that they were noticing a 7.6 increase in shipments into China through July of 2024 the significance of that for me at least was that was before China announced these massive stimulus measures that they just announced so I would expect that you're going to start seeing more Imports into China especially in the areas of iron iron ore because China is one of the leading providers of Steel still regardless of any tariff situation so I would expect that to go up then you have to look at valuation at 6.9 times forward earnings analysts give the stock about a 28% upside and that goes along with a 12.2% dividend yield again the valuation itself may not mean much but when you combine it with positive analyst sentiment and a great dividend yield star buul is one that investors may want to take a close look at that's very interesting as you said this company definitely got hit the last couple of years with the stock going down a little bit when there was less of you know just the interest rate situation and things like that any concern that it's not yet back to those uh historic highs The biggest concern I would have with star buul at this point would be Energy prices we're already starting to see an uptick in oil prices and ironically there were some people that said well you don't have to worry about oil prices going higher because China demand is down well now China demand is up and so that means oil prices are likely to keep going up that would be maybe my one concern here with the stock but otherwise I still think this is a good play right now because I think there's going to be increased demand that'll make up for that any for any upside in oil prices,1.0,0.65

MarketBeat,3XOCPa__NYo,2024-10-07T23:22:08Z,These 3 Small-Cap Stocks Could be the Hidden Gems of 2025,Central Garden and Pet,so this is a company that quite honestly Bridget it was new to me it's called Central Garden and Pet and the uh the ticker symbol is senta c n ta very simple company business model in terms terms of if you just look at the name they have two business verticals one is garden supplies one is pet supplies um they interestingly I noticed they don't really it from what I saw on their website they don't really get into the pet food area a lot it's more of the the treats and the toys and other peripheral items that pet owners might have but what I did notice is they've noticed that the pet their pet business is very strong because of the um the willingness of consumers to pay a premium to keep their pets happy and healthy and the Garden business is doing well and so it seems to me that you've got two business verticals that consumers are willing to spend money on so I looked at the stock a little bit closer and I said okay well okay what's the opportunity here and the stock is up 7 and a half% in 2024 which okay that might not be that much but it's not bad for a for a quote unquote retail stock absolutely and you know I just adopted a new dog I we've had him about three weeks and I'm like yes pet owners are willing to spend all kinds of money to keep their pets happy right right exactly U but there are a lot of pet companies out there there's lots of these kinds of products what sets this company apart you know I think one of the things that sets this company apart is just the fact that it's really focused on its back balance sheet it really seems to kind of know where its Niche is and staying in its Lane uh it's got a strong e-commerce business which is good for it and I think that's really what you're looking at you're looking for a company that's that's fundamentally sound has a solid balance sheet and just it has a niche in this market and it's playing in that Niche very well as far as growth potential why would this industry this very consumer discretionary stock have so much growth potential in the next 12 months well I think it's again you're seeing interest rates go down and eventually that's going to trickle into the consumer who has already shown even with higher interest rates they were willing to spend in these categories so you'd have to imagine that that spending is just going to increase as the discretionary dollars become more available and analysts seem to agree with that on Market beat the price target for the stock is $43 and that's an increase of about 40 40 to 45% above where it's at now again a stock like this is kind of speculative but if you're looking for something in a retail space that's that's a hard upside to ignore oh yeah I had definitely not heard of that company before may have been new to some of our listeners as well so thank you for bringing that one out to our attention and kind of giving us a deep dive into three small cap stocks that have some great potential right now,1.0,0.8

United health group is one of the largest companies by market capitalization they're just also just a huge Healthcare Network almost anybody that has a healthare policy in some way or another United Health Group touches it. They've been growing their dividend by 14.7% uh on an annualized rate in the last three years. One of the Tailwinds for this company is they just recently acquired LHC group and the significance of that is that it's moving United Health Group more into the Home healthc Care Arena and this is an area where um there's been a lot of Buzz about this because we're seeing obviously the the baby boomer generation is now well into the retirement years they're getting to that point where you might be looking at you need Extended Care you need a little bit more of assisted living areas and that's something that we don't have the infrastructure in as a as a country yet but we're building it and companies like LHC group were on the Forefront of that now UA now United Health Group is getting in on that as well so I think that's going to be a big Tailwind for their business. This is again a stock that um it's it's not necessarily A flashy stock but it's one that it just it hits in an area where all Americans need to be in and it's a it's just a solid stock for investors. Yeah absolutely as you said it's one of those largest healthcare companies in the country everyone's heard of it um do you think there's any other environmental economic factors that could impact the future success of this stock or is this just an essential item that's going to continue to grow right now I can't foresee anything happening that would prevent this company from growing I mean I think you'd have to have some sort of radical shift um in public policy that would be unfavorable to private insurers and I just can't see that happening so right now I I think again if you're an investor you want to take what the market gives you and right now the market has been giving you Health Care especially for the last you know 10 to 15 years.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,RaUtaJRWpls,2024-09-27T19:49:13Z,AST SpaceMobile Takes Major Leap in Global Connectivity with Satellite Launch,AST SpaceMobile,here with an update on as space mobile is Market beat analyst jayu Jay it's been a really busy September for this company yes uh after seven years and a billion dollars later they finally launched their first five Bluebird satellites into low earth orbit um this is their black one bluebirds and they're finally finally up in space so anyone who had doubts that they would be able to get up in space well those doubts are proven wrong yeah we did a video on this one just a month or so ago kind of going through what this company is and really their idea is to make sure that the whole world is connected right talk a little bit more for those who missed that last video sure so as space mobile is trying to make the uh make drop calls a thing of the past normally you have to be within a cell tower range in order for your cell phone service to to to stay steady uh and to not have drop calls uh what a space mobile is doing is they are creating a space-based Broadband cellular network that is going to be there to basically fill in all the gaps in between cell towers in fact it's like they're putting up 168 cell towers in space and theoretically you should be able to complete calls anywhere on the planet and unlike satellite phones you're not going to need any special equipment basically any off-the-shelf smartphone will enable you to place a call anywhere in the world I think the other interesting thing that you wrote in your article about this is that right now you know as Americans you might think most of the world is covered with cell phone coverage but really this company is opening up an opportunity to reach more customers right absolutely uh basically according to a they believe that there's 67 billion out there waiting for them by 2032 uh the reality is 42% of the global population uh doesn't have access to cellular service uh they want to cash in on some of that and they are teaming up with uh over 40 uh Telecom mobile network providers to go ahead and basically have them provide this Fillin service who knows they may even actually provide you know full service so the other thing to keep in mind is that now they are past the concept stage they actually have the satellites the first satellites in space so a lot of these other memorandum of understanding uh for potential contracts Partners they can move forward because now it's no longer a concept but they're actually getting closer to commercialization and so I expect to see a lot of Theseus actually turn into Partnerships uh in real conscious tracks I think those Partnerships are a huge part about this company's cash flow let's talk about that a little bit because they've spent a lot investing to get this infrastructure up but now with these contracts uh where do they stand with cash flow they have about $440 million in cash now each satellite costs about $30 million uh the first block one five satellites cost $150 million to basically manufacture and put up in the space block two satellites they probably cost less but we're looking at 17 block two satellites which are actually 10 times more powerful than the block one satellites and those are looking to go up uh in 2025 with the first batch going up in first quarter 2025 now the company made a major move right after launching its first five satellites they announced a second stock option uh talk about what that's done right so actually about five or six days before the September 12th launch uh as had put out an announcement basically stating that they were going to be doing a $400 million secondary offering this is what's known as an at the market offering which means that they can sell shares at the market up to $400 million now that threw off a lot of investors uh and the stock did Take a Tumble because they basically stated that they we're not looking to raise any more cash through offerings uh in 2024 now the at the money offering uh actually has a three-year time limit so they have up to three years to be able to raise the $400 million in cash by selling stock um so they could start doing that 2025 but the notice basically says they can do it at any time living yeah let's talk about all of the movement this stock has seen this month you'd expect with the major launch that they be a lot of positive reaction in the stock to that news but that paired with the new offering there's been a lot of volatility for ests this month so the offering basically took the air kind of out of the stock uh it fell down to the 25 area and when they did launch on September 12th the stock actually pulled back some and then the day after is when the stock rallied back up into the 30s but it has been slow pulling back now and that's mostly because you know they don't produce revenues yet and you almost have a sell the news reaction that tends to happen when a significant event actually happens so now uh we have to look forward to uh potential catalysts down the road well with all the movement we've seen in the stock this month is this a buy for investors right now or is it still a pretty big risk oh yeah this is a definite speculative stock like I said they don't generate any revenues yet but they're getting closer now to that commercialization stage and according to a there's a potentially 67 billion doll out there by up to 2032 by filling in these connectivity gaps with the telephone carriers well we will continue to watch all of the moves and where this stock goes right here at Market Beach thanks for the Deep dive into the latest news for this company,1.0,0.4

MarketBeat,KaeJL1UGaeo,2024-09-25T21:57:08Z,What the Bulls and Bears Are Saying About NVIDIA Stock,NVIDIA,the Bulls or the Bears who will prevail when it comes to Nvidia Chris Nvidia has been the hot topic for years now uh recently there's been a lot of movement on this stock let's talk about what we're seeing right now so right now uh Nvidia jumped about 4% yesterday had been Tuesday the 24th and that actually led the S&amp;P 500 higher uh at at start of the day kind of weak and then because of Nvidia Nvidia kind of led the way and the reason why it jumped 4% yesterday was because um Jensen Wong the CEO announced that he was done with this round of selling that had taken place that he had been doing since the company's earnings report in late August so a lot of people thinking that Jensen Wong was selling cuz he knew something bad was going to happen to Nvidia that's really not the case here moving on to another point that you brought up in your article uh the Bears are arguing this Blackwell delay um as a reason to not go for this stock give us both sides of the argument on Blackwell well this is another one that I would say among the arguments that I would have this one's kind of a not very strong the the reasoning that some investors have is that you have companies like meta and Microsoft who have already expressed an interest in getting their hands on other high performance AI chips they don't want to be just beholden to Nvidia that's all well and good and certainly there are some competitors along the way Advanced Micro devices being the most prominent one but none of these competitors at this particular moment are ready to capture market share at scale and keep in mind Nvidia has 85% of the market and so I mean it's it's going to be really really hard for these other companies to to start chipping away that market share unless they have ai chips that they can start delivering at scale before Blackwell comes out and Blackwell is going to be available by the end of this year or early next year according to Nvidia which is not that far off at this point exactly exactly another Point argument that you pointed out in your article is talking about kind of what's going on in the economy we know we just saw these rate Cuts it's all anyone is talking about right now what's the argument from the Bears and the Bulls on how those rate Cuts might impact Nvidia stock the concern is that if the economy goes into a recession that the companies that need nvidia's chips are going to slow down on AI spending this would be the one concern that I would have if I was an Nvidia shareholder would be would companies be starting to pull back on that AI spend if the economy goes into a broader recession it's too early to tell and to be honest we just don't really know right now another argument you pointed out for or against Nvidia is the value ation of this company let's talk about what the Bears and bulls have to say about that so this is one that you hear about almost every day um and that's just that Nvidia is a very expensive stock by almost any measure Nvidia is an expensive stock to buy you're paying a premium to buy the company's future earnings which many investors feel already priced into the stock my Counterpoint to that is that you're it's really kind of feudal to argue against math and that's really what you're doing if you're taking the other side of this I don't like to argue against math but I would also point out that Nvidia has margins of over 75% and that's using generally accepted accounting principles its profit margin was 55% I mean that means that they're just generating a lot of profit on what they do and that doesn't show any signs of slowing down earnings are what Drive stock price growth and so you have a reason to believe that even though the Stock's expensive it's going to continue to go up because earnings are going to continue to go up and unless that changes it doesn't really matter what the math says it just seems like the Stock's going to go up so I'm sounding like you are with the bulls on this one is that right I really am with with again with the one caveat being the broader economy but there's so many question marks around that right now I think investors can safely dollar cost average into Nvidia which means just putting a regular amount aside and putting it into Nvidia at a reg at different intervals you don't have to worry necessarily about what the prices of the stock on any given day if it does drop a little bit woohoo you're getting stock on sale and if it goes up a little bit okay then you've bought the stock at where it is now and that might be the new floor so you're okay but you know to S to Simply sit there and say you should ignore Nvidia I just don't think the other arguments really hold that much weight for me well thank you for the rundown Chris going over the Bulls versus the Bears in Nvidia,1.0,0.75

MarketBeat,ZfGdnbgXnaM,2024-09-24T17:47:48Z,Nvidia Tops Congressional Buy List,Nvidia,let's get to some of the three hot stocks that Congress members are buying right now Thomas your first one uh really no surprise really it's not a surprise it is the hottest stock in the market today Nvidia but in regards to Congress five members have made Seven purchases in the last 90 days uh that includes Nancy Pelosi we have members of both sides of the aisle so it's by partisan buying in addition to the Congressional buying there's also a tremendous amount of Market support so this is more than just a congressional play Nvidia is the most followed stock a most upgraded stock it's got a top rated stock on marketbeat websit so there are many factors going into the Nvidia trade yeah I think one of the things that's uh interesting to me about Nvidia being one of the most uh traded Stocks by Congress especially it's being heavily bought is the idea that you're starting to see the US Congress now actively look at AI they understand that this is not something that's a bubble it's not something that's going away and now they're looking to find out how Congress should or might be able to regulate it that's why I think it's really interesting that now you're starting to that's coinciding with activity in Nvidia all right and speaking to our our conspiracy theory before coincidentally Nvidia is now up to potentially sell its ships to Saudi AR Arabia and who would have that knowledge first but the members of Congress correct that's a very interesting point anything about Nvidia being down the volatility this stock has seen in the last month or so are members of Congress still all in on this stock despite the recent volatility yeah I haven't seen any selling and there have been some recent purchases so like the most recent purchases were made after the stock dipped I think that the members of Congress are and generally speaking are buying Nvidia in alignment with the up trend,1.0,0.6
MarketBeat,ZfGdnbgXnaM,2024-09-24T17:47:48Z,Nvidia Tops Congressional Buy List,MarketBeat,Nvidia is the most followed stock a most upgraded stock it's got a top rated stock on marketbeat websit so there are many factors going into the Nvidia trade,0.9,0.6
MarketBeat,f4K4KTjALaI,2024-09-23T21:37:14Z,Top 3 Stocks Members of Congress are Buying Ahead of the Election,Nvidia,Nvidia but in regards to Congress five members have made Seven purchases in the last 90 days that includes Nancy Pelosi we have members of both sides of the aisle so it's bipartisan buying in addition to the Congressional buying there's also a tremendous amount of Market support so this is more than just a congressional play Nvidia is a most followed stock a most upgraded stock it's got a top rated stock on marketbeat website so there are many factors going into the Nvidia trade. I think one of the things that's interesting to me about Nvidia being one of the most uh traded stocks by Congress especially it's being heavily bought is the idea that you're starting to see the US Congress now actively look at AI they understand that this is not something that's a bubble it's not something that's going away and now they're looking to find out how Congress should or might be able to regulate it that's why I think it's really interesting that now you're starting to that's coinciding with activity in Nvidia. All right and speaking to our our conspiracy theory before coincidentally Nvidia is now up to potentially sell its ships to Saudi Arabia and who would have that knowledge first but the members of Congress correct that's a very interesting point. Anything about Nvidia being down the volatility the stock has seen in the last month or so are members of Congress still all in on this stock despite the recent volatility? Yeah I haven't seen any selling and there have been some recent purchases so like the most recent purchases were made after the stock dipped I think that the members of Congress are and generally speaking are buying Nvidia in alignment with the uptrend.,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,f4K4KTjALaI,2024-09-23T21:37:14Z,Top 3 Stocks Members of Congress are Buying Ahead of the Election,Broadcom,yeah that's broadcom it's another chip stock uh in 2024 it's uh growth is accelerating in high double digits I think last quarter it was close to 50% growth that's supposed to or is expected to continue to be strong um it's being driven by Rebound in its end markets but also there's an upcoming Apple upgrade cycle Apple's getting ready to release their latest phones that's supposed to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle in that business Apple's a huge customer of broadcom and then again members of Congress are buying it we've got four members on both sides of the aisle including Nancy Pelosi um we have representatives and um Senators uh four members made five purchases. Now broadcom also has something else in common with Nvidia and that's a recent stock split uh what is that mean Chris? Well as we've talked about on this channel numerous times the stock split doesn't really do anything to change the fundamental valuation of a stock but it's interesting that you're seeing Congressional buying of both Nvidia and broadcom after the split because that does suggest that there's going to be momentum in both of those stocks going forward. Both of these stocks are in the chip or the AI industry are there more regulations happening at that Federal level that Congress might just know more more information about than the rest of us?,1.0,0.7

MarketBeat,f4K4KTjALaI,2024-09-23T21:37:14Z,Top 3 Stocks Members of Congress are Buying Ahead of the Election,Chubb,yeah this is an insurance stock this is chub it's one of the world's largest insurers it's uh well regarded as a highquality blue chip gross stock and dividend grower um it's grow gr it's growing its margin it's paying its dividend it provides some value um regarding Congress it was purchased to a smaller degree than the other two but still enough to be the third most purchased stock over the last 90 days um Miss Pelosi did not buy this one but again we have bipartisan representation um and the stock is in an uptrend it's got a very good uh support from the analyst as well with an expectation for earnings growth to continue in 2025. I found particularly interesting about chub being on the list is the fact that um there's been a lot of talk about inflation and where inflation's happening and a lot of people are ignoring the fact that insurance cost is one of the highest examples of inflation that a lot of people are experiencing not only in their home and car and other things but this is also when you talk about a chub you're talking about this is a lot of the commercial insurance that's being impacted and so I just think it's interesting that at a time when kind of nobody wants to talk about it Congress is investing in a company in an insurance company. Yeah I see chub as a as a high quality stock for dividend portfolio for sure it's definitely um could be a core holding and one thing I've noticed with chub is that in the last two quarters year over-year revenue and earnings have are both well above the prior year and I think that's reflected in the stock price but maybe not fully reflected in the stock price especially if investors and members of Congress are expecting that that type of Revenue growth is going to continue.,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,MvMMmT0qldM,2024-09-22T13:00:33Z,Fed Walking a Tightrope with Rate Cuts,The FED,well the the FED has indicated that they've indicated that they want to cut another 50 basis points by the end of the year and another 100 points next year uh and if they do that it just plays right into what I've been saying they're either going to usher in that economic shift sooner than we expected or they're trying to front run a recession and again we're just waiting for the next few months of data to understand are they actually going to cut more or do they need to keep rates where they are now or possibly even raise them back up again if inflation starts to rise again because you have to remember there's still a lot of demand in the economy consumers are still spending even though the housing market is pretty crappy um people want to buy houses so if the price of houses starts to fall inflation or interest rates start to fall it's going to Spur demand in that sector we can already see oil prices starting to move back up again all of those things play into inflation um I think that ultimately we're still walking that tight rope the FED still has plenty of risks we're still data dependent and the next few months are going to be very telling well we will continue to watch how well they balance on that tight RPP they're walking right here on Market beach in the days and weeks and months to come,1.0,-0.1

MarketBeat,ad4picnNqic,2024-09-19T16:29:08Z,Rate Cuts Fuel Volatility: How Long Could it Last?,FED,let's let's backtrack a little bit and talk about why do you think the FED went with that 50 basis point cut. the aggressive 50 basis point cut could mean that inflation is cooling the economy is solid there's no risk of recession soft Landing will happen sooner and the FED will usher in that economic shift that we've been talking about more quickly than we've been expecting. however they might be trying to front run a recession which is bad news for the market and that case no amount of cutting will stab off the recession or an ensuing market decline it's just a matter of wait and see right now. Thomas about walking that tight rope and the FED is trying to avoid the recession but also try to keep inflation in check is that what they're trying to do here and do you think it's going to have an impact on inflation down the road. I think the FED may be um exacerbating that situation. well the the FED has indicated that they've indicated that they want to cut another 50 basis points by the end of the year and another 100 points next year. uh and if they do that it just plays right into what I've been saying they're either going to usher in that economic shift sooner than we expected or they're trying to front run a recession and again we're just waiting for the next few months of data to understand are they actually going to cut more or do they need to keep rates where they are now or possibly even raise them back up again if inflation starts to rise again because you have to remember there's still a lot of demand in the economy consumers are still spending even though the housing market is pretty crappy um people want to buy houses so if the price of houses starts to fall inflation or interest rates start to fall it's going to Spur demand in that sector we can already see oil prices starting to move back up again all of those things play into inflation um I think that ultimately we're still walking that tight rope the FED still has plenty of risks we're still data dependent and the next few months are going to be very telling. well we will continue to watch how well they balance on that tight rope they're walking.,1.0,-0.3
MarketBeat,C_dMCyALz1Y,2024-09-18T11:43:51Z,Has SMCI Already Hit Bottom?,Super Micro Computer,a delayed annual report has had super microcomputers stock in a lot of volatility this month but has it reached its bottom yet here to dive into where this stock is at right now our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes Thomas you had an article this week about where smci stock stands right now and whether or not we're close to that bottom what do you think we are at right now Thomas well I think that there are still some risks but I think that the stock is at or very near its bottom if you look at the chart uh the selloff since the peak earlier this year it shaved 65% off of the stock price but it's retraced almost 100% of the rally that occurred this year which to me is a bubble it was an aid driven bubble the market got ahead of itself started to sell off as some expectations were reset that sell off was accelerated by a short report over the summer but now we're back at these levels where the stock was very attractive last year it's in a hot Market it's still growing so it should still be an attractive stock today and Chris I think we're seeing a little bit of that in the market right now what has the stock done most recently in the last few days well what we've been seeing since about um a little bit after Labor Day let's just say is the stock is starting to go up a little bit like Thomas said I think there's some buyers that are starting to look at this and saying it's overdone I think Thomas made a really good point in saying there was probably going to be a selloff in the stock when you saw how high it had gone in such a short time 65% drop is not just because of a short selling report I mean that especially when we don't really know what the details of that report are well right and the selloff Really began before the short report came out the short report really just accelerated pushed it down to the bottom it was a resetting of expectations and then their earnings over the summer margin was a little bit weaker than expected and that gave the market some reasons to fear so it is kind of a combination of factors but again the stock has retraced back to these levels where it was attractive before the market created a bubble so we have to ask ourselves has anything really fundamentally changed for the business because if it has it could go lower but if it's still in a strong industry it's at a good price it should begin to rebound and next year should be a solid year for the market I think that question is what has a lot of investors having some caution right now there is some uncertainty and some people questioning that report that both of you just mentioned uh Thomas let's dive into what's the issue with this delayed report and what are some people speculating well right so the report was delayed it's the end of the year filing um and it was delayed we don't really know why but I assume given uh the benefit of the doubt that it is just an overabundance of caution uh the Hindenberg short report certainly raised some doubts about the company's financial reporting um there has been some history in the past of some misrepresented numbers but that was years ago we have to assume the company has moved on from that and that uh once the new the finalized report comes out a lot of those um fears will be alleviated Chris do you have any concerns about the report delay I I don't um what I would be more interested in going forward is going to be hearing about one concern that was brought up in the Hindenberg report that was outside of the financials is potentially that uh super micro is understating the competitive pressures that there are some super micro customers that are looking aggressively looking for lower cost Alternatives that they feel might have better quality if I'm an investor looking to buy the stock that's something that might concern me a little bit more than accounting rate irregularities which I agree with Thomas I think this delay is probably being done out of an abundance of caution to make sure that they've got the numbers right and I don't necessarily think that's going to be the reason why you should stay out of the stock right now and Thomas you already alluded to this that there's just as much of a risk the stock could go down as it could go up um it just depends on the solidness of the industry but Chris you just brought up an interesting point the competition is that part of what we're seeing with with the stock price is that there's just more competitors and more saturation of the AI market and what super micro is providing I don't know if that's the reason yet but I I would say that could be an issue going forward I mean when super micro reported earnings they also said that they're not seeing any slowdown in demand from Nvidia which is one of their biggest customers in terms of the data center market so that would seem to be good however that's also the type of thing that the Hindenburg report is is trying to question the answer that I have for You Bridget is I just don't know and that would make me a little bit hesitant to get in right at this moment on super micro but it doesn't necessarily mean it's not a good stock to own over time it's just maybe I don't want to jump in right now right right what Chris is saying plays into the idea that there may be volatility over the next few weeks or months um like the proof and the pudding will probably come out with the next earnings report when they deliver or don't deliver on what the expectations are right now the market is expecting about 200% Revenue growth in the next quarter which is substantial it's huge however it does align with nvidia's own ramp in Revenue over the last couple years and you had to think there's some correlation between the two and also the analysts have been lowering their targets so it's a low bar the company could very easily outperform and even if it just reports in alignment with the consensus The Whisper numbers are low consensus so that would still be a strong report all that said I think that the Q2 report could be a catalyst for higher share prices let's move on to short interest a little bit you talk about that in your article too Thomas uh what's the concern there right so the short interest is a big factor in the stock price right now I mean the the short report from Hindenberg was matched by another short selling firm uh short interest is up at 15% they certainly took advantage of the report to help Drive the stock back to these lower lows but again at 15% there's ample fuel for short covering rally and a short squeeze so all we need is some good news to come out and the stock could not only just move higher but rocket higher all right so again pulling it back to the near-term in volatility High short interest fighting against a bullish Outlook is going to provide volatility so I would certainly expect to see the market make some whipsaw moves uh throughout September and possibly into October and maybe through the end of the year I'm hearing a lot of volatility expect a lot of changes quickly especially in the short term um let's talk about what this stock could look like for investors long term well long term you have to assume that the peak set earlier this year is the market pricing in the best case scenario so if we get a best case scenario in the results we can see the stock climb back up to retest those highs um otherwise I see the stock advancing possibly even um where are we at possibly even doubling or more in price over the next 12 months to 24 months but setting a new high uh could be difficult without some other Catalyst for the Outlook that's some great information for our viewers to consider when they are looking at buying smci thank you both for diving into this company and this stock a little bit more today we'll continue to follow this stock and many others

MarketBeat,mdIFbG7iu5k,2024-09-16T12:30:42Z,Beyond Meat Stock: Not Beyond Hope?,Beyond Meat,okay so the third one I'm not necessarily going to say is my is a good short squeeze candidate in terms of a stock that I would like to own but it's one that I think investors might want to take a look at and it's beyond meat now beyond meat has had a terrible year I think the stock is down 30% this year it's down about 45% in the last 12 months short interest on this stock is a whopping 42% that's a lot of people betting that the stock is going to go lower and they could be right the one of the reasons for that this isn't a critique of the plant-based meat industry plant-based foods are here to stay plant-based products are here to stay and it's and in fact that's the actual issue that's going on with beyond meat was when they came into the market they didn't have a lot of competition now unfortunately even as plant-based products are getting more popularity there's also a lot more competition in the space for Beyond me and it's hard for them to Stand Out Among that competition however the reason why I think it might be a short squeeze candidate is again you've got 42% short interest so you got a lot of people that are betting the Stock's going to go down however what is what it's looking like is in the next four quarters the company's going to have a lot easier comparisons on the top line they just went through a year where they were having very difficult comparisons where it was going to be very tough for them to beat Revenue expectations from the prior year this year should be a lot easier that being said the company's not profitable I don't expect it to turn a profit this year but just the fact that it could beat those Topline estimates could be enough to convince people to jump in on the stock and again with that High a short interest there could be a squeeze here with Beyond me how big of a squeeze would you think with the short interest you're talking about well I wouldn't if I were an investor in beyond meat right now it's it's trading around $6 a share so it's just over penny stock territory actually the analyst forecasts on Market beat are actually suggesting that stock could still go lower I don't think investors should be looking at this as being like a a $15 $20 stock here but I think if you were looking at the stock and said you could get it to7 $8 $9 you're still looking at a very nice profit on that stock and that's what I might be looking at if I were an investor.,1.0,-0.3
MarketBeat,r4l2j-EEFfk,2024-09-13T12:30:50Z,RH Stock: A Hidden Opportunity Among Short Sellers?,RH,now your in second pick for a stock that could be a good short squeeze candidate is not in the AI realm but it's a brand many people are familiar with right it's RH now the company the the stock ticker is Rh and the name of the company is Rh but many investors may know it better as Restoration Hardware it's a um premium supplier and manufacturer of Home Furnishings so obviously as you would expect uh in 2020 and 2021 the company was doing very well the stock was doing very well as people were buying houses they were relocating they were renovating the houses they did have in fact at one point RH stock went up over $700 a share well yeah it's at 241 right now so it's gone down significantly since then and you would expect that for all of the reasons that we talked about so now might be an interesting time to get in on RH and if that stock does if the company does happen to improve their earnings Outlook because right now revenue is about it 2019 levels so it's not too bad and it's about where investors might expect to see it the problem is that right now the company their earnings have been negative because the as a company they're facing the pricing pressures that are coming from Supply chains and inflation and all that if that turns around you could see the stock start moving up higher and again it might be an interesting short squeeze candidate,1.0,0.6
MarketBeat,r4l2j-EEFfk,2024-09-13T12:30:50Z,RH Stock: A Hidden Opportunity Among Short Sellers?,GameStop,now does every short squeeze have to happen with that fan following like we saw in gain stop or can it happen by the kind of economic factors you just talked about yeah I think it can be it can be either one in fact I think what made GameStop so unique was the fact that the short squeeze happened in absence of any real fundamental reason for it happening it was sort of a Mania and again that's that's not to judge it one way or the other it's just to say it did happen without any fundamentals many short squeez happened because of some fundamental Catalyst and it's also important to note that many short squeezes never get to the level where GameStop as which is again what made GameStop so unique,1.0,0.0
MarketBeat,PdizVhndB2U,2024-09-12T19:15:00Z,Massive Gains Ahead? C3.ai's Short Squeeze Potential,C3 AI,all right Chris let's get to your first pick of a stock that you think could potentially see a short squeeze so the first one I had in my article was C3 AI this is a name that's familiar to a lot of investors in the AI space um it's going through a similar issue to Nvidia and I'm not comparing it to Nvidia but I'm saying it's going through a similar issue in that it has delivered good quarterly earnings but not as good as some analysts would like and they've been cautious on their Guidance the issue with C3 AI is they're moving from a subscription based Revenue model which analysts have tended to love over the past few years because it guarantees that predictable Revenue stream that everybody loves to more of a consumption-based approach and right now that's still in the early innings it's still very tough to gauge how that's going to play out however the company is also taking some some efficiency efforts to try to to make themselves a profitable company because they're not a profitable company yet but all of this is which to say if you have a few profitable quarters coming or if they continue to beat Revenue estimates analysts still have a price Target on the stock that's about 29% higher than where it's at right now and this could be one that has the potential to go much higher and could be something where you don't want to be caught short on it is there enough of a following for this AI stock there's so many out there yeah is there kind of that fan following for this one um I I don't know right now it seems right now that there's more bearish sentiment on it than there's bullish sentiment there seems to be some sort of I would call it maybe an AI fatigue going on right now and some investors are choosing their one or two stocks that they're going to invest in AI Circle C3 AI may may be on the outside of that right now but for all the reasons I just said it's one that investors may want to be looking at very carefully especially since analysts have about a 29% upside on the stock,1.0,0.4
MarketBeat,PdizVhndB2U,2024-09-12T19:15:00Z,Massive Gains Ahead? C3.ai's Short Squeeze Potential,Nvidia,it's going through a similar issue to Nvidia and I'm not comparing it to Nvidia but I'm saying it's going through a similar issue in that it has delivered good quarterly earnings but not as good as some analysts would like and they've been cautious on their Guidance,0.8,-0.2

MarketBeat,nshWZC7EpFw,2024-09-12T19:07:24Z,The Quiet Rise of Biotech Stocks,FDA,what's been going on behind the scenes and I think not that many investors really realized what's going on but the FDA has a program let me use a metaphor you know what a first class passenger is at an airport right they get front of the line they get the good seats they get the good drinks they get the best food they get the best service the FDA is doing something similar because it wants us the the Americans to have to be healthier and a lot of these drugs uh uh they want to get them faster to Market so what they do is they give you they give these companies what amounts to a first class ticket they give them special treatment they do what they can to encourage them and what's really fascinating from an investment standpoint is I actually couldn't believe this I had a team go through this we spent quite a bit of time going through all of the data 97% of the time it's almost like pretty close to 100% the stock goes up when they get this and the FDA doesn't say anything it's just a very quiet signal FDA doesn't put out a press release the companies typically put out a press release and then when they do that their their their stocks can go up pretty dramatically uh one was up 845 per in the first six months after it got this first class ticket and another one I'm just of I want I want to give you the accurate data here one of them was up 119% two days wow what is that 15 years the S&P return or something like that in two days that's pretty amazing it's incredible I want to talk about that a little bit about the Biotech Industry for investors if you are getting in on any biotech stock I feel like it is all a reaction to FDA approval advancements or announcements in a in a new breakthrough or even just a news event I feel like this industry and the sector specifically are really impacted by these potentially volatile announcements yeah um it is true you don't want to be on the receiving end of a FDA say no that that hurts the stock so what we're always looking for as investors is where that we want the Dex act in our favor so that's why we're looking at companies that have a really good relationship with the FDA and have a good track record uh of getting of getting these things approved and in fact um I've just prepared a special report on this very topic uh and it looks at the signal that we've been talking about where 97% of the time the stocks go up that's there's no such thing as a sure thing in investing but with a 97% win rate that that's as close as you're going to get uh to doing that so that's one of the things we want that we monitor,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,nshWZC7EpFw,2024-09-12T19:07:24Z,The Quiet Rise of Biotech Stocks,Microsoft,one of the things I I really like about these these guys is that they have we talked about Ai and the marriage of AI and biotech they actually have a joint venture going on with Microsoft they're using Microsoft's AI model or their AI platform to help accelerate drug Discovery and they've also moved into some interesting areas of cutting egg science,1.0,0.5
MarketBeat,nshWZC7EpFw,2024-09-12T19:07:24Z,The Quiet Rise of Biotech Stocks,Voyager Therapeutics,they recently struck a deal with a company called Voyager Therapeutics and this thing covers this this pack covers Huntington's disease and muscular distrophy spinal muscular distrophy yet I want either one of these diseases they're they're bad news all right um but this could be worth 1.2 billion dollars in the next few years in in extra sales so again what we have is an established player that's that's joining forces with somebody a little bit more on The Cutting Edge and we we as investors get access to The Cutting Edge science but without we're not betting the farm on that like a lot of these smaller biotech companies do,1.0,0.6
MarketBeat,nshWZC7EpFw,2024-09-12T19:07:24Z,The Quiet Rise of Biotech Stocks,Biogen,but these guys have a CEO who used to be at Biogen Biogen is a major player in the industry and has been for quite some time now and what's interesting about that is he was there when they were building out their franchise he was involved in another a number of uh drugs that made it to Market so that so he's got to track where you're getting drugs to Market and then what's also interesting just from a just from a almost an intuitive standpoint the company when he was at Biogen it's it's now a $33 billion market cap company so it's a it's at the upper end of the of the midcap his cap right now is $460 million but if he just got to 10% of Biogen market cap you'd go from let's call it 450 to make the math easy 450 billion 450 million to about 3.3 so let's just say 450 to 3.5 billion that's a pretty substantial increase and that's why I think it's just a it defines a moonshot stock If he if he lives up to just 10% of the potential that he that he that he helped bring to Biogen we can see some pretty uh pretty big move in the market cap which the stock has to follow the market cap right the two are are closely interrelated so just getting that up there is going to push the stock price up,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,k6rdeAFkXPw,2024-09-11T19:00:32Z,Investing in Shopify Stock: Growth and Future Returns,Shopify,let's go on to your final pck this company may be a little less known than others Shopify. I wouldn't put it quite in the same category as centas and and Casey's. it is a must need must-have service for small business and even large businesses because it provides a digital footprint it helps them with their e-commerce and with crossb sales. um Shopify right now is growing at a high double-digit Pace it's not yet returning Capital but its balance sheet is a fortress so I would expect to see Capital Returns come in time. so right now what we're looking at is an outperforming growth story that's got it stock price in a reversal with an expectation for some Capital return to come in time which will be a very great Catalyst for its share price and this stock seems like a little bit a lower point of entry than the other picks that you mentioned right. Shopify really got a boost during the pandemic because of the whole e-commerce craze its valuation has come down since then but the real takeaway is that it has continued to outperform consensus even while its price targets were coming down so now it's set up to have a pretty nice rebound and that's being fueled by recent results which show it outperforming and growing and raising Guidance. Do you see this company and their business plan really lasting long term much like the gas or the needs for businesses like Cintas has does this company have a a business plan that is really a long-term plan yes it does and you have to think about the internet and e-commerce the internet's not going anywhere it's only becoming more entrenched in our lives e-commerce is the same way businesses that want to compete and stay relevant today have to have e-commerce and their go-to sources Shopify.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,W6SjHKofBUE,2024-09-11T13:37:48Z,3 Potential Short Squeezes: Stocks to Watch Now,GameStop,that historic GameStop short squeeze I'll walk people through exactly what happened in that situation so you had many people that were shorting GameStop which means they were making a bet that GameStop was going to go lower but instead of going lower through a Confluence of a lot of circumstances which don't have to be talked about here the stock shot up and it shot up high and then what happened was the short sellers had to start chasing the stock higher and more people kept buying it which meant more short sellers had to keep buying it and it just just took on a life of its own and the momentum Bill and it was again it was yeah it was an epic short squeeze right there for some people a very profitable one too very much talk about what these short squeezes can mean for investors if you are on the the buy side of the trade these can be enormously profitable because again um if you bought GameStop let's say when it was at I don't I don't even know I think it started when it was like at $18 and if you bought it and it was at 20 $25 and you just let it ride and it rode all the way up to wherever it got up to yeah you could you could stand to make a lot of money as long as you could get out of the stock before the stock price came back down and that was the issue with GameStop is some people didn't get out of the stock early enough and then they wound up losing all of the gains that they had that's where the risk comes in with the short squeeze so what makes a stock like GameStop poised to do this kind of short squeeze again in the future well you would like to say that there's something that you can pinpoint and say this is why a short squeeze is going to happen ultimately we're in an age where there's a lot of high-speed trading so really it becomes almost a trading event and if Traders decide as happens a lot of times in some of these investing communities like Reddit and Wall Street Bank that's if you get a lot of people who are actively trading in a stock at one period of time it can cause a short squeeze but sometimes it can happen because of events that happened for example a stock could get an unexpected upgrade or you could see a stock that um beats on earnings when it wasn't expected to or they might have had um a settlement of a lawsuit that went in their favor that wasn't supposed to happen and all of those could have been creating interest on the short side but now because the because the outcome was positive it can cause people to jump in and buy the stock instead which can then Force those short sellers to buy the stock. does every short squeeze have to happen with that fan following like we saw in gain stop or can it happen by the kind of economic factors you just talked about yeah I think it can be it can be either one in fact I think what made GameStop so unique was the fact that the short squeeze happened in absence of any real fundamental reason for it happening it was sort of a Mania and again that's that's not to judge it one way or the other it's just to say it did happen without any fundamentals many short squeeze happen because of some fundamental Catalyst and it's also important to note that many short squeezes never get to the level where GameStop as which is again what made GameStop so unique,1.0,0.3

MarketBeat,sCn-ardJ2_A,2024-09-10T12:30:53Z,Casey's Stock: Strong Growth and Solid Dividends,Casey's,let's move on to your second stock pick it's one that my children love Casey's uh known for pizza in the Midwest for sure but what about this company makes it a no-brainer hold well right it's not a lot of the same qualities as Centos starting with this business model it sells gas and snacks everybody needs gas for their cars and when you get the gas you got to have some snacks today uh Casey's is also benefiting from a a downward shift and consumer habits um it sells some some pretty good values in food and prepared foods and that's been seen in their results but we have a fundamentally strong company it's growing organically and through Acquisitions it's got a fortress balance sheet it's able to self fund its growth cash flow is robust and sustains Capital return which includes dividends and share BuyBacks which is part of the whole investment thesis look at the chart it's very similar to Centos the stock prices up triple digits and trending upward over the very long term any dips in the price action have turned out to be very good buying opportunities gas and snacks aren't going anywhere anytime soon so we're going to need this company for a while but there are a lot of gas and snack providers out there a lot of competitors what about Casey's business model really sets this stock apart well Casey is doing the same thing that Centos has done in his is doing and that is consolidating a highly fractured Market there's lots of gas stations but there are very few large gas station chains cases is buying gas stations in critical corridors or critical locations which is fueling its growth and widening its margin,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,9b_KP4lWpNU,2024-09-06T19:21:17Z,3 No-Brainer Stock Picks For The Long-Haul,Cintas,well that's Centos I've been covering Centos for over 12 years it hasn't been much of an exciting company and yet its stock price has increased by quadruple digits while it increases the dividend and buys back shares The dividend increases have the payment up high triple digits in that time um it really is a no-brainer stock it's a stock that you could buy when it's moving up or when it's moving down because you know over time it's going to pay you back so as cintos has been around for quite a while but what exactly does this company do and is their business model something that seems like it's going to hold long term likewise Centos provides uniform servic is for a wide range of businesses these businesses which include a lot of restaurants and other service Industries don't have the time or the capability to wash their towels and wash their uniforms so they really require Centos and their business and Centos is adding value by acquiring ancillary businesses uh one of the more recent ones that happened a few years ago was zedal Z medal provides first aid supplies to the very same businesses that Centos was serving so that acquisition not only provided Cintas um an added growth opportunity but there was a lot of cross- selling opportunities Z clients that weren't using Centos are now using Centos Centos clients that weren't using Z are now using Z good Partnerships always make for good business for sure If you look at the chart it's very similar to Centos the stock pric is up triple digits and trending upward over the very long term cases is doing the same thing that cintos has done and is doing and that is consolidating a highly fractured Market much like the gas or the needs for businesses like cintos has,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,9b_KP4lWpNU,2024-09-06T19:21:17Z,3 No-Brainer Stock Picks For The Long-Haul,Casey's General Stores,let's move on to your second stock pick it's one that my children love Casey's uh known for pizza in the Midwest for sure but what about this company makes a no-brainer hold well right it's got a lot of the same qualities as Centos starting with its business model it sells gas and snacks everybody needs gas for their cars and when you get the gas you got to have some snacks today uh Casey is also benefiting from a a downward Shi and consumer habits um it sells some some pretty good values in food and prepared foods and that's been seen in their results but we have a fundamentally strong company it's growing organically and through Acquisitions it's got Fortress balance sheet it's able to self fund its growth cash flow is robust and sustains Capital return which includes dividends and share BuyBacks which is part of the whole investment thesis if you look at the chart it's very similar to Centos the stock pric is up triple digits and trending upward over the very long term any dips in the price action have turned out to be very good buying opportunities gas and snacks aren't going anywhere anytime soon so we're going to need this company for a while but there are a lot of of gas and snack providers out there a lot of competitors what about Casey's business model really sets this stock apart well cases is doing the same thing that cintos has done and is doing and that is consolidating a highly fractured Market there's lots of gas stations but there are very few large gas station chains case's is buying gas stations in critical corridors or critical locations which is fueling its growth and widening its margin that's a solid second no-brainer pick to buy and hold forever,1.0,0.95
MarketBeat,9b_KP4lWpNU,2024-09-06T19:21:17Z,3 No-Brainer Stock Picks For The Long-Haul,Shopify,but let's go on to your final pick this company may be a little less known than others Shopify I wouldn't put it quite in the same category as Centos and and Casey's it is a must need must have service for small business and even large businesses because it provides a digital footprint it helps them with their e-commerce and with crossb sales um Shopify right now is growing at a high double-digit Pace it's not yet returning Capital but it's Balan she is a fortress so I would expect to see Capital Returns come in time so right now what we're looking at is an outperforming grow story that's got its stock price in a reversal with an expectation for some Capital return to come in time which will be a very great cist for its share price and this stock seems like a little bit a lower point of entry than the other picks that you mentioned right Shopify really got a boost during the pandemic because of the whole e-commerce craze its valuation has come down since then but the real takeaway is that it has continued to outperform consensus even while its price targets were coming down so now it's set up to have a pretty nice rebound and that's being fueled by recent results which show it outperforming and growing and raising Guidance Do you see this company and their business plan really lasting long term much like the gas or the needs for businesses like cintos has does this company have a a business plan that is really a long term plan yes it does and you have to think about the internet and e-commerce the internet's not going anywhere it's only becoming more entrenched in our lives e-commerce is the same way businesses that want to compete and stay relevant today have to have e-commerce and their go-to sources Shopify,1.0,0.85
MarketBeat,TEBTikXVHoA,2024-09-05T13:50:58Z,Racing to the Skies: Joby Aviation’s Air Taxi Future,Joby Aviation,"yes job Aviation uh actually has a first mover Advantage they've been testing their prototype a lot longer uh they've already put in 33,000 miles uh they are in stage four of their five-stage certification process with the FAA they are looking to launch their Air Taxi Network in 2025 they want to start off with New York LA and Dubai that is not far off either that's next year already but I'm sure the certification process is really one of the things still up in the air about whether this program will take off on the timeline they're hoping absolutely the FAA certification is the wild card now they are in stage four right now of the five-stage certification process they're about 37% through uh the FAA is about 14% through uh it's takes both the uh eeve M maker and the FAA they both are uh involved in the process in stage five they're only about 2% through but once they get through the five stage certification then it's on to commercialization in fact Joby is actually partnering with Uber for this project right in 2020 Joby actually acquired Uber Elevate which was uh Uber's own air taxi Division and by bringing on the Uber Elevate team they helped to program its software program called Elevate OS and this uh software uh infrastructure also has a rider app just like the Uber app and a pilot app and the engine will go ahead and match the riders with the pilots with the uh evall uh destination flights the only difference with this Air Taxi program it would be a lot faster for consumers absolutely there uh as 4 prototype can go up to about 200 milph uh it's operated by One Pilot and it can accommodate up to four passengers and their goal is to get your travel time down quite a bit talk about that Jay sure they want to basically shrink maybe a 45 minute car ride down to a 7 minute air taxi ride that would be a big time save for a lot of people especially in those metropolitan areas but I think to make this program successful they really need to have a lot of air taxis available let's move into manufacturing what is Joby doing to get enough of these to start this program successfully so job's been uh partnered with Toyota who also happens to be their largest largest outside shareholder Toyota's already invested about $400 million um they will be providing a lot of the components the power Trin uh and also advising them on their whole manufacturing process joob wants to be a completely vertically integrated manufacturer of EV TOS now their current model that they're manufacturing right now this is the one that's for those shorter commutes you know getting you across New York to JFK Airport in a really quick time frame but talk about the future plans this company has for air taxis maybe going a little bit further than just those you know in City commutes well Electric aircraft EV ts are ideal for uh congested City traffic and uh the suburbs but job is actually looking to go even further than that and provide Regional flights Regional Air taxis uh so they've actually created a first of its kind a hydrogen EV tall uh which is outfitted with um a whole hydrogen fuel system and 40 kg of liquid hydrogen and they put it on a flight and they uh ran it for 523 miles which is a world record um just to prove that it is possible to be able to handle Regional flights uh when you have a hydrogen fuel system um and it's something that they're looking looking to uh to launch down the road so that you can take uh you know a an air taxi actually from um Boston to New York or from New York to Washington DC um Detroit to Nashville this is their long-term plan it's all exciting plans to hear but right now it's still just an idea this program hasn't taken off yet so talk about what that means for investors who might be looking into joby's stock as an investment opportunity what should they expect for this kind of a speculative buy as you call it yes this stock is absolutely speculative you should only be using risk Capital really money you could burn you can burn because this is a pre Revenue company so if you are interested uh you can keep take a look at the Candlestick chart and be aware of the descending triangle pattern which is comprised of lower highs after Joby made its recent swing high at 769 all the bounces have been smaller and smaller and smaller um so that's known as a descending trend line it's a descending upper trend line uh up meeting a flat bottom support it's a horizontal trend line so when you connect those lines it forms what's known as a descending triangle pattern uh Jo has found support pretty much around five area so uh if it breaks down under five then there's potential pullback support areas that are in the article that uh investors can look at to consider taking a position if they know that it is it is a high-risk speculation um they could also consider using an option strategy uh that will basically force them to wait for a pullback um a cash secured put can be used um if you want to limit your the amount of your investment you can always consider taking uh long calls uh for a fraction of the price of the stock um but the strategies are available some great tools for investors as always Jay and a really interesting dive into this speculative stock that I think everyone is excited to to see if they can actually pull it off it'll be a game changer for sure thanks again for this deep dive into Joby Aviation stick with Market be as we continue to follow this stock and many others as always happy investing",1.0,0.6

MarketBeat,Lhoexbx2HEw,2024-09-04T21:39:31Z,September Sell-Off: Market Panic or Opportunity?,Nvidia,most S&P 500 companies including the leaders like Nvidia fell much more than 2% let's talk about Nvidia they've had a really rough week since their earnings report which was actually pretty good right the report was great it was what the market wanted but the market was expecting it one thing the market pricing in the peak of AI growth but it's being compounded by sector rotation which is ultimately why the market sold off yesterday so how far has Nvidia Fallen since earnings yeah so Nvidia is down 25 to 30% since the earnings report and it could possibly move lower right now uh Nvidia is still amongst the most crowded trades on the market everybody's been buying that stock for the last two years and with seor rotation and play it's possible that the selloff could continue for many weeks until the last person has been able to get out of their shares people need to sell out of the winners that have been winning for the last two years which includes Nvidia and most of the big AI names in order to prepare to buy small cap stocks,1.0,-0.8
MarketBeat,Lhoexbx2HEw,2024-09-04T21:39:31Z,September Sell-Off: Market Panic or Opportunity?,S&P 500,well the S&P 500 fell 2% so as an average so most S&P 500 companies including the leaders like Nvidia fell much more than 2% in this environment the S&P 500 could fall seven and a half to 10% easily and up to 20% before it's all said and done,1.0,-0.7
MarketBeat,Lhoexbx2HEw,2024-09-04T21:39:31Z,September Sell-Off: Market Panic or Opportunity?,Federal Reserve,it aligned with the idea of the fomc cutting rates and since then the fomc has indicated that rate cuts are very likely they may not cut them this month but they are expected to cut rates before the end of the year which signals a shift in economic policy and fundamental quality for the market and what that means is easing headwinds which is expected to lead to growth in the small cap sector we are just about 10 days away from that Fed rate cut at least the one that's expected will whatever comes out of that announcement really impact the market again or is what we're seeing just a lead up to that decision I think it's just a lead up to the decision um the CPI report suggested that the shift and fomc policy was really a sell the news event the sell off yesterday kind of confirms that idea what we're going to want to see the fomc do uh this month is to cut rates more than the market expects which is probably not going to happen because there are still signs of fundamental strength in the market including the labor data the labor data has been very resilient gives the fomc really no reason to need to cut rates so with inflation still above their target rate and only falling ever so slowly it's possible they'll hold off for another month and they may not cut rates at all,1.0,-0.3
MarketBeat,nTP4NOTMB2Y,2024-09-02T14:00:51Z,Why Monday.com Is A Top AI-Powered Stock to Buy,monday.com,"monday.com is monetizing AI today. All right. It is a good example of what we've been expecting for the second wave of AI. My buy pick is monday.com. monday.com is a workflow automation platform. Um it's resonating with clients because it's easy to use and it scales well. It's got this plug-and-play quality where you can just kind of pick which segments of it you want to use. You build them together to create your own workflow. So, this past quarter was a beat and raise quarter. Revenue was up 35%. 300 basis points better than expected. That revenue strength was driven on new clients and penetration. Their net retention rate is 110% which means that existing clients are spending 10% more this year than last year with the addition of new clients which will also increase their spending over the next year provides some leverage for growth. Uh margins are widening with that leverage and the efficiency that the company is working towards. Um adjusted operating income was up 130%. That's a real good example of how that leverage can affect your investment quality. um adjusted earnings of 94 cents were 6 6,700 basis points better than expected 67%. That's huge. That's a huge outperformance. Um the company also raised guidance. This has raised guidance again. This is like the third time this year. Momentum is clearly building. Also the balance sheet is a super fortress. It's net cash. Total liability is less than 0.5 the cash position less compared to assets. Shareholder equity is rising. I think it's only a matter of time before capital returns come into play. And then there's the analyst response. All those things are great, but without the analyst, the upside potential is really limited. The analyst response is overwhelmingly bullish. They're leading the stock higher. It's got about 20% upside at consensus. We're going to expect it to go above consensus because of the revision trends. And what I see in the stock price right now is a retest of the all-time highs that may come as soon as this year. And that's a 35% upside at least. And where is the entry point right now if you are just looking at getting into monday.com? So right now, Monday.com stock is trending higher and it moved up to set a new multi-year high on this past this past report. So, not to chase the price higher, but you're going to want to get in probably pretty soon. Wait for any kind of pullback in the action as your entry point and then just start to slowly build a position with time. I would certainly expect to see this stock retest the all-time highs and within the next year or two, you set a new all-time high and then continue this trend um upward. Chris, have you followed monday.com? What do you think of that pick? I haven't followed it quite as closely as Thomas has, but it's a stock that's very intriguing to me. And I think one of the reasons why, and I'll just keep my answer a little bit shorter, Bridget, is just, you know, you're talk when you talk about looking for buy stocks, you're talking about, as the saying goes, you try to skate where the puck is moving. And Monday is certainly right in that sweet spot. You know, remote work is not something that's going away. uh it may not exist in the same form and fashion that it exists today over the next 10 years, but it's not going away. And that's exactly the type of business that monday.com is going to work for very well in terms of you need the tools that to make it easy for teams to collaborate with with each other no matter where they are. Yeah. One of the points that I forgot to hit on is that monday.com is monetizing AI today. Monday is actually using AI and they're monetizing it for themselves and for their clients which is huge because the monetization of services is going to be the largest fastest growing segment of AI which is saying something considering Nvidia's you know rapid rise over the last two years.",1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,dKtACsCSNYk,2024-08-30T15:30:11Z,Palantir’s Growth Surge: Why This Stock Is A Top Buy,Palantir,it seems like every week the company just keeps announcing new Partnerships New Deals it just suggests that there's a lot more growth coming for this company Chris I'm excited to hear which stock you have for us as your top fivey pick right now well I'm going to stay consistent with what I've been saying for the last several weeks Bridget my pick is palente here uh Thomas actually gave me a nice place to jump off in terms of the monetization of AI because one of the things that paler really does well is it's helping other companies monetize Ai and in the process they're becoming the go-to provider for um not just the company's own proprietary llm but there are other platforms such as Foundry and Gotham that are allowing companies to actually make AI give them useful insights and that's you'll hear that from the CEO Alex karp a lot is the fact that paler is about making AI useful for other companies uh stock cracked the $30 Mark uh after it reported earnings in early August it's up about 81% year-to date it's got a high priced earnings ratio there are all kinds of reasons to believe the stock is over revalued it seems like every week the company just keeps announcing new Partnerships New Deals it just suggests that there's a lot more growth coming for this company and not only are other companies starting to get wind of this but it seems like the analyst Community is starting to align as well on Market be the consensus is still reduced for Palante here but the price targets have gone up so you know a year ago the price targets were still around $10 then they went up to around $516 now they're up around 21 $23 so analysts are grudgingly coming along with the stock we talked about this a couple of weeks ago on the channel there is the possibility that paler is going to get included into the S&amp;P 500 this time around if so we'll find out about that in early September that would be another Catalyst for the stock because as we said at that point many institutions would have no choice but to include paler part of their ETF and that's just going to drive the stock price higher and Thomas what do you think about trying to get into paler right now yeah I'm on board with paner I think they've got a great growth trajectory I think they're doing a great job um implementing their services and growing their business um they certainly make money I do have some concerns with the valuation I I think right now with the current Outlook uh the valuation has pretty much priced in the next few years of growth so I'm really going to want to see um some strong outperformance and some accelerated momentum with with New Deals and with uh new clients as these new clients come on Chris how high do you think paler can go in its stock price especially well if we're talking about in the next in the next 12 months we we were um we were talking about this a little while ago the most most bullish estimate I think is for the stock to get up somewhere around 38 in the next 12 months I'm not quite that bullish on it I think 33 34 is a really good uh is a good price Target in that time frame for some investors they if they're not in paler right now that may not excite them too much uh we're talking about 10% gain they can probably find that in other stocks but again I'm looking at this and saying if I'm looking at paler as a long-term hold where where might the stock be in 5 years in 10 years and I just think that right now it's okay to go ahead and buy at $30 if you believe that in five or 10 years it might be at $5 $50 or even higher,1.0,0.75
MarketBeat,2oWN2unROS4,2024-08-29T21:05:50Z,Tech Expert Weighs In: Why NVIDIA's Stock Dropped After Earnings,NVIDIA,all eyeses of the market are on Nvidia this week as the earnings came out strong but the stock is still dropping here to talk a little bit more about what's behind all the market movements on Nvidia is Weiss ratings technology editor Michael a Robinson thank you so much for joining us here today to break this stock down a little bit again everyone's talking about it today why is this earnings report such a big deal that's causing kind of that dip in the market everyone's as you just said it yourself I thought really well which is everybody if I have a concern about the stock market right now it has to do with like people who I know don't know that much about investing going ah Nvidia Nvidia it's like oh my God you know if if if my barber ever says buy Nvidia I'm like yeah maybe not right now but no it's this is H this is a stock that owns owns the AI processing space they can't build these things fast enough there's this story going on in Silicon Val that Cisco has these uh gpus coming in from Nvidia like being delivered in an armored car I don't know if it's true or not I just love the story I mean that's that kind of is a sign of the time so it's had an outsize impact on the market so no question everyone's watching it because 30% of the S&P gains in the first six months of this year came uh on Nvidia. Nvidia is now a three plus trillion uh a little less than three trillion as of today with a dip but let's just call it a three trillion doll uh market and people I think are putting too much emphasis is on like where AA is going to go based strictly on Nvidia it's not the right way to look at it but you can't control how people look at the world. I've been saying for some time now that if I have a concern about the market at all right now even though we're I'm pretty bullish and the market is really bearing that out it's that there's too much emphasis on one on on a single player and the thing we have to understand with Nvidia is that at some point it cannot continue to grow its earnings like this quarter the most recent quarter reporting uh 152% let's call it 150% growth in EPs and what do you that's like you're growing your you're growing your per share profits every doubling them every six months that's pretty phenomenal but I think what's going on with Wall Street is they like there are these whisper earnings that they really oh 152 I thought you know they didn't project 152 maybe they thought in their brain it was going to be 200 so you're dealing with a lot of expectations game I'll take 152% uh growth in earnings U per share any day of the week exactly it's still a really strong earnings report that would be celebrated just about every other company so the question is will investors will Wall Street ever really be satisfied with any future earnings reports because like you said it's not really sustainable to continue to grow at a rate of almost 300% every quarter uh what will it take for Wall Street to be satisfied with this more steady growth that Nvidia will no doubt continue to have uh that I can't answer uh they that that the Wall Street mentality is one that I don't actually fully understand it's a whole there's a whole weirdness about that stuff uh you know I I I tend to try to come up on my own conclusions but we can't we can't get around the fact that Wall Street has an outside's impact on the market in terms of the ratings and you know they play this game they gave it a new price Target too and you look at the new price Target it's like 3x extra dollars a share or something like that to put out a release like it's a big deal but nevertheless they are looking at AI I don't know that you can fully please Wall Street and I think what might actually happen would be if if earnings kind of earnings growth stays at like 150 or 150% or quarter that's pretty amazing at some point they it's just not going to grow as fast as that but they're I mean they're selling all they can build they're they're they don't have enough capacity to they could sell more if they could build more so that's going to continue for a while they have a lot like I said they own 90% more than 90% of the market in this area they're just killing it so for you it sounds like Nvidia is still a strong buy do you expect this stock to continue to be a leader and and continue to reach new all-time highs in the market well I do think it has the potential to reach alltime uh reach new highs in the market I'd like to see I'd like to see a few more days of trading I don't have enough data right now we're just reacting uh not quite in real time but you know because the earning came out yesterday but it's early in the as you and I are talking today it's still still early in the trading session we haven't gotten to the close yet I was just going to look if you don't mind yeah it's popping around um one thing I think is that's healthy about it today Bridget is the volume is substantially below it's its 50-day moving average so that tells me maybe some people are taking profits but I don't see any Panic selling uh some people may who got in a little bit late maybe they're up only 25 or 30% and they just want to they just want to take those and they're worried but it doesn't look like a particularly terrible just bu they had they've had worse days in the market and bounce back from those I'm just going to look here on my chart there was a day where volume was like 30% higher than average and the stock was down like 6% it's popped back since that time but as of right now when we're talking I don't know how the session will end but as of right now the average uh the number of shares trading hands around 255 million and it has been around 339 million dollars trading hand I'm sorry shares trading hands every day so I like to see a stock Retreat on lower volume that tells me that the U Bears aren't even close to getting control of this stock doesn't mean we won't have a couple of more tough sessions ahead but as of right now the Bears are not moving out with conviction we'll continue to follow Nvidia and everything that happens from now and on right here at Market beat thanks for joining us and happy investing,1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,wJnYpIdcQ3U,2024-08-29T16:54:13Z,"Buy the Dip In NVIDIA, Be Prepared for Volatility",NVIDIA,last night the world was watching for nvidia's earnings report and today the world is reacting here to break down the market movement after nvidia's earning report is Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys there has been a lot of movement on Nvidia Thomas break down what the market is doing this morning well the initial reaction was to move lower I think at the low of the post session move yesterday it was down about 10% when I was going to bed I think what I saw was down about 7% right now it's down about 32% but this is a a negative move considering how strong that report was yeah and it's not just Nvidia that's doing a lot of movement this morning it's kind of the whole industry right Chris right uh there was some news that came across uh I don't know if it was I it was probably like right around the time the market closed last night I noticed there was a broader Tech sell-off going on last night that wasn't just Nvidia Nvidia was just one of the ones that was the most obvious of that an obvious decline in a lot of volatility but it's coming at a time when Nvidia really had a stellar earnings report 122% growth year-over-year Thomas why is that growth not transl in to a runup in the stock right now well because with the trends and the forecast and the revision Trend and the expectations the report was really nothing but what the market wanted and the market is a front running forward-looking machine what we're seeing right now is a peak in Market sentiment which is going to be a pretty substantial headwind for the the price of the stock I think over the next month or two now last night in our video reacting to just the earnings report Chris you mentioned that they had a home run but the market was really expecting a grand slam and I do think that that's the case last earnings report Nvidia saw over 260% growth and even though 122% growth is still impressive it's not you know what they had last quarter right and so um the the fundamental argument against Nvidia is fundamentals it's the valuation people are just saying the stock is just unreasonably overvalued one of the uh principles I guess that's being used to justify that is something called The Law of large numbers uh this is a statistical concept that's based on probabilities and such this is a table that shows the last several years of nvidia's earnings reports and this is where we were last night the 30.4 billion 30.4 billion in Revenue that they generated in the last quarter and that compares as you can see very favorably 122% higher than the 13 .51 billion that they generated in the same quarter in the previous year now look at all of these numbers down here and those are significantly lower than that and now look at next quarter where it was 18.12 billion what would Nvidia have to hit to generate even 122% growth above and beyond that and I think that's where the so the law of large numbers is basically saying Nvidia is going to eventually they're going to regress to a mean now that mean is not necessarily going to be down at those six and seven billion dollar numbers that they once were but what they're saying is it's unrealistic to expect Nvidia to continue growing at the rate they're growing even at the 122% and so therefore it doesn't justify the price to earnings that they currently have or the price to sales that they have Bridget you and I were talking right before we came on I said it's like a batting average in baseball if you have a player who's never hit 350 before hitting 350 for an extended period of time eventually people are going to say well no eventually they're going to start hitting back to whatever their statistical average was that's what's going on here with Nvidia is people are just saying it's not necessarily that the stock had that the company had a bad report it's just that statistically it's almost impossible for them to keep doing what they're doing right like the run up in stock price over the last two years is because the earnings were growing they were outperform forming in a way that was above the market expectation and continued to accelerate this goes along with what I was saying with the peak in Market sentiment nvidia's business hasn't stopped growing but the market has stopped expecting it to grow at a wicked out pace and what we're looking forward to now is the industry normalization eventually all of these new data centers will be built out and all the orders to replace the old chips will have have been made in that scenario what will happen to Nvidia is that its business will normalize and the question is at what level will it normalize it's going to come back from the Peaks that it is now how far will it fall back and where will it stabilize investors still have to remember that Nvidia has 85% market share their profit margins are still over 70% and no there's no competitor that's immediately positioned to take over the premium Market that they have so even if companies are looking to Pivot away from Nvidia they're still going to be likely to pay the premium price for nvidia's premium products let's Shi to the earnings call that happened there was some pretty big news about Blackwell in that report yeah they announced that they shipped out the first of the sample models and they're planning to start ramping production in Q4 they didn't really say specifically when or how much production will ramp uh and there is still some concern about delays that will certainly impact the outlook for all of these stocks including Nvidia so all of that considered and all this growth on the horizon what will it take for investors to be impressed with nvidia's growth in the future if 122% growth isn't enough to to satisfy what can Nvidia do to satisfy the what the market would like to see I mean right now what it looks like is they'll need to make another revolutionary advance in technology to to reignite a new Revolution in technology uh because right now what's happened is that Revolution is underway and what we've seen over the last two years is just the ramp in the expectations and now what we're seeing is those expectations are kind of topping out and that's going to impact the price action I think earlier Chris mentioned the valuation of the stock NOW Nvidia is not exactly comparable to names like apple and Amazon and Microsoft because it's still younger has not quite matured the way that they have but looking forward its 2026 price multiple is about 33 or 34 times earnings which puts it right in alignment with the valuation for Blue Chip tech stocks today which means that all of its growth is probably priced in it will need to come up with something new in order to reinvigorate Market sentiment so unless they have another major Tech announcement coming I think we can expect what Chris had said which is that a little bit more normalized growth as they evolve as a company uh so is this a company that you want to get into if they're reaching that Peak and point in their lifespan investors kind of have to look at this like don't fight the trend and in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report we don't know what that trend is going to be I still tend to think that it's going to it's going to rise above where it closed yesterday um but right now the trend still seems to be that investors want to move it higher that's what analysts are saying so I I don't think I would fight that Trend right now it doesn't mean that the the Bears have a bad argument it's just that the trend isn't going in their Direction right now um as far as what this means for the broader Market I think there are other issues that are going on uh certainly the the FED potentially cutting rates next month and what that might mean for sector rotation that are to affect the market much more than nvidia's results right now though in terms of if I were an investor yes I would be looking to buy any dip in Nvidia I don't think I would be chasing it too much higher but I'd be looking to buy on dips right the analysts are responding favorably they're raising their price targets I do expect to see Nvidia move above 150 over the next 12 months but as Chris says there's lots of macroeconomic headwinds September's typically A bad month for for stocks and Chip stocks in particular and was slowing growth and growth priced into the market there's a lot of reasons to believe that Nvidia stock price will experience volatility if not a significant dip between now and the next new high yeah uh Thomas your article has exactly that headline Bu The Dip but expect the volatility you can click

Here's What's Ahead For The Stock,Disney,well I'm going to be holding Disney I'm holding Disney the stock price is down obviously it's been struggling for the last couple years but we're looking at a CEO that turnaround uh the return of Iger was huge news for this business that's been gaining traction ever since he got back on board uh they brought back the capital return turn that was a huge move um right now the parks are struggling but they're still growing entertainment is growing and streaming is turning profitable which is really the big story this year we're kind of in wait and SE mode to see how the next couple of quarters unfold because consumers are under pressure and there's certainly some pressure on the company's ability to grow and to profit but uh they've got some some big catalysts I think in the works that are going to help with results in the near term and set it up for some big leverage gains in the long term now among those uh The Wolverine and Deadpool movie did very very well so that's certainly going to show up in the next quarter's results um they've been opening a lot of new attractions and Parks send it around Avatar and Indiana Jones and some of the other hotter franchises that should help sustain activity if not growth in the Parks until the consumer rebound takes traction again and then there are also some new films in the work they've got Avatar and The Incredibles and Moana which are all going to be driving results for this company later on in the year now interest rates are supposed to fall soon and that will be a Tailwind I think for the business it may be a year or more before that impact starts to show up in Disney's results but again with prices where they are right now they're kind of at Rock Bottom we have Capital returns back in play I think it's a good stock to hold if you've been to Disney recently especially one of the theme parks it looks like they're doing quite well those lines are never short I do want to hear your opinion on that Chris do you have a different take on Disney well I price fund a little bit Bridget because Bri Disney was the stock that I put as my cell and I think that's where we're going next but I'll I'll just say I'm a little bit more bearish than Thomas's I I was excited or I should say I was optimistic about the return of Bob Iger as the CEO I even thought that maybe the earnings report we saw a couple of quarters ago was a signed that the company was turning the corner they may still be but right now I'm just I'm struggling to figure out what the company's long-term strategy really seems to be right now it just feels like a lot of it is they're relying on Iger and the idea of we're Disney and we've done it before and we'll do it again and I'm hearing a lot of things like well we think this is going to happen we hope this is going to happen the company struggling to get all the parts of the business firing on all cylinders and I think the theme park is a really good place to start profits right now are being used to help get that streaming business up to a level of profitability but there is concern and the company stated it in their last earnings report that demand for the theme parks is starting to show some cracks revenue from the division was only up about 2% and that was at about 8.3 billion and the operating income fell to about 2.2 billion this income that they drive from the park is about 53% of Disney's total revenue and Disney management reported that the next few quarters would be challenging for that division so I don't know it the stock sound slightly for the year it's trading down near fiveyear lows I understand that generally speaking that means that the stock doesn't have anywhere to go but up but it's more than likely that the company's going to figure it out but right now it looks like there's just a lot of faith trust and pixie dust going on and it's just a pass for me so Thomas why do you think Disney has a chance to come back this is the House of Mouse I mean they're struggling right now because there are some consumer pressures even with that warning they still reiterated their guidance they're still looking for growth it's going to be tepid you know so I think in a couple of quarters we'll start to see the company begin gaining Traction in all of its segments at once which will really help leverage its growth in its earnings we'll see if they can bring back that Disney Magic,1.0,0.0
MarketBeat,XOTm77W8PtM,2024-08-28T21:38:07Z,"NVIDIA’s Impressive Earnings: Stock Dips, What’s Ahead?",NVIDIA,"it's the moment the world has been waiting for NVIDIA earnings report is in and the results are pretty good here to break it all down for us are our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys let's get to it right away Thomas what are these results looking like right now well I would say from the initial glance that it was everything that market was hoping for and a little bit more I mean they grew by 122% year-over-year that outpaced the consensus by 1,000 basis points gross margin widened by 500 basis points operating income is up 175% EPS is up almost 170% it outperformed as well the guidance is strong calling for another quarter of 100% growth I think that's about 2500 basis points better than expected within all of this the cash flow is robust the cash on the balance sheet nearly doubled and they did a surprise $7.2 billion share by back which is going to be highly supportive of the stock over time because now we're going to expect that to happen from on a quarter to quarter basis they've got the cash flow they should be able to continue repurchasing shares and paying dividends at this same Pace yeah tellas that's exactly what you said Nvidia needed to do is really outperform everyone's expectations and it looks like they have in a pretty big way let's talk about Revenue first Chris it looks really impressive yeah I mean they everybody was looking to see if Nvidia was was going to not only beat but if they were going to beat by a large margin and they did um $30 billion in Revenue like Thomas said that's 122% higher than higher year-over-year earnings came in even better because at 67 cents per share they were estimated to come in at on on the market beat site we're saying the consensus estimate was 59 cents a share and year-over-year last year in the same quarter they were at 27 cents this year so they're just crushing it that way they were predicting um margins I see at 70 % uh they're projecting for the full year so they're not going to slow down as far as earnings growth goes and I also noticed that they're talking now that blackwall ship chips are going to ship in the fourth quarter so investors can look forward to that in the next quarter yeah right I would say that the results really are strong all the way through yeah all segments produce growth now obviously the computer and or the Computing and network segment did the best that's where the data center uh segment is data center is up 154% but even Automotive is up 37% and OEM is up 33% they've got double digit gains in the graphic section uh so yeah this is just a strong report all the way around I think everyone's breathing a little sigh of relief because this is what they were looking for but what happened at the or the end of the close today why did nvidia's stock drop right before this Stellar report came out well even saying that the results are all that the market wanted them more the market was kind of wanting that it was expecting that because that is the trend so this is turning into a little bit of a sell the news event but the question is are people selling the news because it's time to get out of the stock which I think is probably not the right thing to do but it's probably just this little near-term knee-jerk reaction to okay it wasn't like so mind-bendingly good right we're going to sell off a little bit the market will regroup a little bit but then I believe the rally will continue High I would be very surprised if this thing doesn't uh pop much higher in the pre-market tomorrow I think this is a this is a great place and then the highspeed algorithms are going to come in in the morning and clean up whatever dip this is I think they're going to eat that right up this is this this report was too good to ignore I mean this was like Thomas said this was everything the market was expecting and that may not have been enough to satisfy some investors but there's absolutely no reason for people to be selling Nvidia right now right some of this postmarket dip could be because Traders are waiting for the conference call the conference call will have lots of more details and insight than what the the initial release is going to give and SO waiting for that probably a good idea too right yeah we'll break that all down here on Market beat as well after that earnings call tomorrow um but what do we expect the market to do over the next few weeks I think we talked about we expected some kind of volatility with this earnings report just because everyone is watching it but with a solid report like this can they satisfy people enough to help lift the whole Market I think that Nvidia stock will be well supported there may be some volatility over the next month just because it is the end of the summer we're going into September um if you think about you know this idea of sell in May and go away September is when people come back and that's when they start getting back into the market so we may see some profit taking and some repositioning September is typically a bad month for stocks in general but especially so for the chip sector all that aside the underlying fundamentals with with Nvidia are more than robust so this stock really should continue to move higher once we get past what could be a little bit of volatility I think like Thomas said I think investors are waiting to hear what Jensen Wong has to say on the conference call I think one of the things that they want to hear is they want to hear the words come out of his mouth that demand for AI is strong because there's been some sentiment coming into this report that maybe companies were going to start um slowing down on their AI spend as as the economy might be getting weaker but I'm not sure that that is supported by nvidia's results but I think investors still want to hear the words they want to hear AI spending is strong and they expect that to be strong for their customers right also when the in the um the conference call we'll probably hear some more news at about deals and Partnerships the company has been making New Deals and Partnerships I mean seems like on a week- toe basis for the last two years soon it's going to have a deal with every important major company on the market today and just further cement its position as uh Central to the AI infrastructure y well thank you both for breaking down the earnings report from Nvidia good news for the company today but still more to come in the call that's happening this evening.",1.0,0.85

MarketBeat,ZTMnT3lRZws,2024-08-27T21:00:21Z,McDonald's Stock on the Verge of a Major Growth Comeback,McDonald's,"for my pick on stocks to hold I'm choosing McDonald's. Stock's up about 9% since it reported earnings in July and the report wasn't that good. Same store sales were down for the first time since 2020 and you'd have to go back a lot further than 2020 to find the last time that did it before then so this wasn't a great report and the stocks up 9% kind of feels to me like most of the growth has been priced in. I like McDonald's, I like the company, it pays an attractive and growing dividend that I don't see being in any danger. It was investing in digital well before 2020 and that's paying off today. I think the next few quarters are going to be challenging for the company in terms of stock price growth. It's trading at about 23 times forward earnings, it was around 21 times forward earnings before the runup. The analyst forecast on Market beat are a little bit more bullish about McDonald's than I am, they have it as a moderate buy but the 9% runup on a challenging earnings report lends me to think that most of the growth at least in the short term is already priced into the stock. Thomas where do you sit on McDonald's are you a McDonald's fan and especially a fan of what the company is doing right now? Uh well according to McDonald's internal data I'm a super heavy user, I I do like McDonald's, um I'm probably part of why the stock price keeps going up but right now uh the earnings report was a bit of a concern, we don't want to see this company Contracting, we certainly don't want to see a negative comp. But what I think the results really show is the Diversified nature of the business because us was weak Latin America was banging Latin America is crushing it for a lot of different companies so I would definitely look in that direction for some Investments but as far as McDonald's goes it's on the cusp of pivoting back to growth very soon the forecasts for next year are very bullish. The analysts have trimmed their targets since the last report but they're still looking at about 10 to 15% upside which puts the market back at the alltime High. Any kind of good news will push it to a new all-time high.",1.0,0.5
MarketBeat,ivHC7kGpH9s,2024-08-27T16:47:40Z,CAVA Surges After Q2: Could It Be the Next Big Player in Fast-Casual Dining?,Cava,fast casual restaurants have seen tremendous growth in recent years but a newly public player is already blowing competitors away here to talk about the rising success of the Cava restaurant groups is marketbeat analyst juay Jay Cava is finishing out August incredibly strong oh yeah absolutely uh basically after earnings their shares shot up about 23% in the following days uh they really they really surprised everybody with their results because in the last quarter they only did 2.4% year-over-year same store sales growth this time around they pretty much blew away all their competitors um doing 14.4% year-over-year same store growth and then Cava came in and blew them away with 14.4% year-over-year comp comparable restaurant sales grow so they knocked it right out of the park. Tav is they call it the Chipotle of Mediterranean because it's one of those Garden style uh build it yourself assembly line um formats uh instead of uh like Mexican food these guys serve Mediterranean food um it's pretty much the same concept you pick your proteins your carbs um they've got 38 different toppings and uh dressings uh which basically you can have 17 billion com ations um and they're very colorful very colorful salades and they're very healthy they're locally sourced. What about kava's you know business plan really helps to set this restaurant apart and maybe lends to some of the success they're seeing well you know the thing about Cava especially being local to me is I've I've also noticed that they're uh they they tend to have the most upbeat happy employees. For Cava uh they locally Source their talent meaning that they hire from inside and they have this thing called The Academy GM program where basically they will go ahead and train their top employees to eventually become uh GMS general managers and by harnessing this talent pool from within it keeps employees uh loyal and happy and upbeat because once you graduate that program you Cava wants to Source 75% of their General Managers from this program. On top of that last year they bumped up their wages 8% and beefed up their health care uh all that basically sets the tone for the employees like I said they're like the most upbeat happy uh fast casual employees that I've ever come to engage with. Cava is actually early in its growth stage they only have 341 restaurants. There's a lot of upside as far as the growth story is concerned. This 14.4% year-over-year comp sales growth is it's top of the industry at this point it's they're outd doing Chipotle that's impressive alone. If you're an investor looking to get in what advice do you have Jay well obviously you shouldn't really be chasing stocks you should wait for some pullbacks. Cava had formed a what's known as a bull flag breakout uh when it broke through 79 then it gapped up to the 110 area and then proceeded to go higher from there um eventually kava will pull back I think if you can get a pull back back to that 110 Gap fill area it's a good entry to to step back into the stock like I said there there's a they have a long uh Runway when it comes to growth very early in the story. We will continue to follow kava's growth story right here on Market beat as always happy investing.,1.0,0.9

I like McDonald's I like the company it pays an attractive and a growing dividend that I don't see being in any danger there's been a lot of talk about issues about demand and pricing and I don't think any of those issues are issues that a healthier economy and a healthier consumer won't fix it was investing in digital well before 2020 and that's paying off today all of that being said and going back to the rubric that you asked us to talk about at the beginning of how do we determine whether a Stock's a buy sell and a hold I think the next few quarters are going to be challenging for the company in terms of stock price growth it's trading at about 23 times forward earnings it was around 21 times forward earnings before the runup the analyst forecasts on Market beat are a little bit more bullish about McDonald's than I am they have it as a moderate buy but the 9% runup on a challenging earnings report ends me to think that most of the growth at least in the short term is already priced into the stock.

MarketBeat,hSni1xEavt0,2024-08-26T20:24:41Z,"Top Stocks to Buy, Sell, and Hold Right Now",Disney,well I'm going to be holding Disney I'm holding Disney the stock price is down obviously it's been struggling for the last couple years but we're looking at a CEO that turnaround uh the return of Iger was huge news for this business that's been gaining traction ever since he got back on board uh they brought back the capital return that was a huge move. right now the parks are struggling but they're still growing entertainment is growing streaming is turning profitable which is really the big story this year we're kind of in wait and C mode to see how the next couple of quarters unfold because consumers are under pressure and there's certainly some pressure on the company's ability to grow and to profit but uh they've got some some big catalysts I think in the works that are going to help with results in the near- term and set it up for some big leverage gains in the long term. now among those uh The Wolverine and Deadpool movie did very very well so that's certainly going to show up in the next quarter's results um they've been opening a lot of new attractions and Parks s it around Avatar and Indiana Jones and some of the other hotter franchises that should help sustain activity if not growth in the Parks until the consumer rebound takes traction again and then there are also some new films in the work they've got Avatar and The Incredibles and Moana which are all going to be driving results for this company later on in the year. now interest rates are supposed to fall soon and that will be a Tailwind I think for the business it may be a year or more before that impact starts to show up in Disney's results but again with prices where they are right now they're kind of at Rock Bottom we have Capital returns back in play I think it's a good stock to hold. if you've been to Disney recently especially one of the theme parks it looks like they're doing quite well those lines are never short I do want to hear your opinion on that Chris do you have a different take on Disney. well I probably steal your funder a little bit Bridget because Bri Disney was the stock that I put as my cell and I think that's where we're going next but I'll I'll just say I'm a little bit more bearish than Thomas is I I was excited or I should say I was optimistic about the return of Bob Iger as the CEO I even thought that maybe the earnings report we saw a couple of quarters ago was a signed that the company was turning the corner they may still be but right now I'm just I'm struggling to figure out what the company's long-term strategy really seems to be right now it just feels like a lot of it is they're relying on Iger and the idea of we're Disney and we've done it before and we'll do it again and I'm hearing a lot of things like well we think this is going to happen we hope this is going to happen the company's struggling to get all the parts of the business firing on all cylinders and I think the theme park is a really good place to start profits right now are being used to help get that streaming business up to a level of profitability but there is concern and the company stated it in their last earnings report that demand for the theme parks is starting to show some cracks revenue from the division was only up about 2% and that was at about 8.3 billion and the operating income fell to about 2.2 billion this income that they drive from the park is about 53% of Disney's total revenue and Disney management reported that the next few quarters would be challenging for that division so I don't know it the stock's down slightly for the year it's trading down near fiveyear lows I understand that generally speaking that means that the stock doesn't have anywhere to go but up but it's more than likely that the company's going to figure it out but right now it looks like there's just a lot of faith trust and pixie dust going on and it's just a pass for me. so Thomas why do you think Disney has a chance to come back this is the House of Mouse I mean they're struggling right now because there are some consumer pressures even with that warning they still reiterated their guidance they're still looking for growth it's going to be tepid you know so I think in a couple quarters we'll start to see the company begin gaining Traction in all of its segments at once which will really help leverage its growth in its earnings we'll see if they can bring back that Disney magic.,1.0,-0.1
MarketBeat,hSni1xEavt0,2024-08-26T20:24:41Z,"Top Stocks to Buy, Sell, and Hold Right Now",Tesla,well this might be one that Chris won't agree with but I'm looking to sell Tesla all right it's still the leading evem it makes profits the balance sheet is healthy but the core business is Contracting the still deep in the price Wars margins are Contracting earnings are suffering the valuation is still very high I personally am a fan of Elon Musk but the Elon Musk factor is pricey it's expensive to buy the stock and right now the market is waiting and hoping for the next phase of growth that may come soon but I don't really expect to see any good news out of the EV segment without a groundbreaking development anytime soon because demand is just so poor and the price Wars are having a big impact on the revenue also they're spending more trying to invest in that next phase of growth it will likely pay off but again we're looking at two or three quarters probably before we start seeing it able to generate money from those advances if even then there's still no consensus among the analysts the analyst sentiment is very mixed there's a very wide range of sentiment targets from sell to buy and the price targets are equally wide so even if the stock doesn't move lower from here and stay lower I expect to see significant volatility and not much upward Trend in the in the action. Chris do you think Tesla is a sell right now too. you know I find it hard to to say it's a sell and I think there's I'll admit there's the Elon Musk Factor there for me he's been counted out so many times and he tends to come back from the dead all these times I think in the short term it's hard for me to get behind Tesla stock in the long term I think a lot of the growth that investors are counting on is going to come from autonomous driving and Tesla is Leaps and Bounds ahead of other companies in terms of getting that to Market but there's still a big if attached to that can they get that done it's a stock that's just it's always going to be very noisy it's always going to be very polarizing um I I can't say I disagree with Thomas asell but I would say to me it's probably one that you want to hold on to just in case right fear of never know.,1.0,-0.4

Chris have you followed monday.com what do you think of that pick I haven't followed it quite as closely as Thomas has but it's a stock that's very intriguing to me and I think one of the reasons why and I'll just keep my answer a little bit shorter Bridget is just you know you're talk when you talk about looking for buy stocks you're talking about as the saying goes you try to skate where the puck is moving and Monday is certainly right in that sweet spot you know remote work is not something that's going away uh it may not exist in the same form and fashion that it exists today over the next 10 years but it's not going away and that's exactly the type of business that monday.com is going to work for very well in terms of you need the tools that to make it easy for teams to collaborate with with each other no matter where they are. one of the point that I forgot to hit on is that monday.com is monetizing AI today all right it is a good example of what we've been expecting for the second wave of AI where Nvidia and the chipmakers are the the Leading Edge the first wave with infrastructure Monday is actually using Ai and they're monetizing it for themselves and for their clients which is huge because the monetization of services is going to be the largest fastest growing segment of AI which is saying something considering nvidia's you know rapid rise over the last two years.",1.0,0.9

Chris how high do you think paler can go in its stock price especially well if we're talking about in the next in the next 12 months we we were um we were talking about this a little while ago the most bullish estimate I think is force the stock to get up somewhere around 38 in the next 12 months I'm not quite that bullish on it I think 33 34 is a really good uh is a good price Target in that time frame for some investors they if they're not in paler right now that may not excite them too much uh we're talking about 10% gain they can probably find that in other stocks but again I'm looking at this and saying if I'm looking at paler as a long-term hold where where might the stock be in five years in 10 years and I just think that right now it's okay to go ahead and buy at $30 if you believe that in five or 10 years it might be at $45 $50 or even higher.,1.0,0.7

They are basically looking to launch in 2025, their key Flagship product is an air taxi called the Midnight, technically called an eVTOL electronic vertical takeoff and Landing aircraft. It can carry four passengers and a pilot, can go 100 miles, top speeds of 150 miles an hour, and they are actually setting up their networks as well, setting up the LA Network and the San Francisco Network so they'll be ready to launch in 2025 and 2026. In their last quarter they spent just over $92 million, they have about $360 million left in cash, but they also have commitments from their partners like Stellantis who have already put up about $300 million and committed another $390 to $400 million. Archer actually pulled back about 40% from last month, so it offers a pretty decent opportunity to get in, but this is a speculative stock, they could run out of money even before they launch their network. The $3 level is a very strong support. It's hard to put an exact price target on it right now, it's just running on sentiment, so this could hit double digits as we get closer to the launch. There's going to be catalysts, once they have their FAA certification to actually start taking passengers, that's going to make a big difference and boost the stock up, and once they start having commercial flights that's going to pump the stock up as well. For consumers, they want to shrink your commute time from 60 to 90 minutes by a car down to about 10 minutes. With air taxis they're trying to cut the cost down to $6 a mile by 2028, $2 a mile, and then by 2030 and after they want to actually cut that price down to a dollar a mile, which is a real benefit for consumers. They've already collaborated with Southwest Airlines and United Airlines in putting together the Air Taxi Network. United has already committed conditional commitment to basically purchase a billion dollars of the Midnight aircraft. Future Flight Global has conditionally committed to buying about $580 Million worth. The US Air Force has just taken delivery of their first aircraft for testing. We will no doubt continue to hear about this stock making headlines over the next few months and years as these new products are launched.",1.0,0.7

Thomas do you have those specifics real quick what kind of price targets are we looking at from analysts well right now we've got 44 analysts rating the stock at a moderate buy they're showing a pretty firm conviction that rating hasn't changed very much over the last year um right now the consensus Target is about $132 that's 15% above the 150-day moving average that's a pretty good Target for firm for Firm support and a nice trigger point for buying and selling if it were to be crossed um the consensus Target is rising most of the fresh um fresh targets are above consensus leading to a new a new all-time high so that is certainly a possibility but once again it's just going to come down to does the company perform as expected consensus is for 110% growth but the high end of the range is above that the whisper numbers are above that so the market is secretly expecting to have a strong result stronger than expected stronger than consensus has a pretty high bar to beat and Chris let's get into a little bit of what that high performance would look like for NVIDIA uh what are some things that investors are watching closely right now well one of the things that they're going to be looking for is an announcement or some clarity from Nvidia as far as when the launch of their Blackwell chip is coming out this is a chip that's going to be used more for um industrial slata center applications and the launch has been delayed and there is talk that it might get delayed from coming sometime in the last quarter of this year into 2025 investors are want to hear about that because that is something that could weigh in on the stocks performance not only for next quarter but in a couple of quarters after that also it introduces the idea that it gives other chip makers a chance to catch up now whether or not that's going to be a serious threat to Nvidia in the short term I don't know but it's something that you know it's something that investors are going to be listening for very carefully,1.0,0.15

MarketBeat,l5sGSiZQ3qk,2024-08-21T12:21:45Z,NVIDIA Faces High Expectations: is a Pullback Possible?,NVIDIA,the the biggest risk is just that the market is expecting significant strength so Nvidia is really going to have to outperform by a wide margin to please the market now with that in play there is some concern that September is the weakest month of the year for stocks in general and for the Philadelphia semiconductor index specifically yes so even with a good report there's a high likelihood that Nvidia and the entire chip sector could enter a consolidation or correct to lower prices again in September simply because of natural market dynamics the the key here is going to be investors are waiting on on pins and needles for the FED decision on interest rates that's coming up in September as if there wasn't another potential um pressure on Nvidia a stock you have to introduce that into play and that's just part of a larger the sector rotation that Thomas brought up earlier it's the fact that you've got consumers or investors excuse me who are trying to rotate out of perhaps some of the technology stocks some the chip stocks and they're looking for what sectors might be better options when those interest rates start to come down so all that being considered and everything we've discussed here are you guys a buy before the earnings report comes out on Nvidia yeah I think I'm in that camp but I'm not going to be chasing prices I do want to point out though that uh over the last month there was a tremendous spike in institutional activity so when the market sold off a wide range of Institutions both public and private from small to large including retirement funds for teachers and for other large institutions made very large triple and quadruple digit increases to their position so that's a very clear signal from the institutional Market that they were buying this dip that this stock is buyable um they expect to see higher prices so with the outlook for volatility right now what I would really be doing is waiting for the next pullback because that would be my trigger to buy um I think Nvidia is a long-term buy I wouldn't be chasing the stock right now heading into earnings but I I don't think that even if they really outperform earnings it wouldn't discourage me then from starting to chase the stock higher,1.0,0.4
MarketBeat,e4HHlKzJovM,2024-08-20T21:46:31Z,Top 3 Growth ETFs to Add to Your Portfolio,Noble ETF (NOBL),well one of the ETFs that I really like especially from the Buy and Hold perspective is the noble no o the dividend Aristocrat tracking stock NOW the dividend Aristocrats are a member group of the s&p500 but these are the stocks that have increased their dividend for at least 25 years now among the differences between the noble and the Spy is that you're going to get a higher yield you're going to get more aggressive dividend growth enough to offset inflation you're going to get reduced volatility I think it trades with a 0 65 beta compared to the S&P 500 which is going to protect you on the down swings and set you up for bigger total returns over time um over time the ETF itself tends to match the S&P 500 but the total returns are much bigger because of the yield and reinvestment and the distribution growth,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,e4HHlKzJovM,2024-08-20T21:46:31Z,Top 3 Growth ETFs to Add to Your Portfolio,Global X U.S. Infrastructure ETF (PAVE),well one that I've been following for a little while now is the uh it's called the global xus infrastructure development ETF and that's how mouthful and the stock tickers actually pave PA which makes a lot of sense because this is dealing with infrastructure stocks we're talking about this the the companies that do the things that help us with the roads and the bridges and all of the infrastructure that the United States needs to build this has been taken off since 2020 got even further lift from the infrastructure act that passed in Congress in 2021 it's only been actively trading for about 7 years but the chart just looks phenomenal since 2020 now some people would say uh that all of the growth in this ETF is priced in because the infrastructure spending has already kind of made its way into the economy and that this stock maybe starting to stumble a little bit however I think with the likelihood that the fed's going to cut interest rates coming in September I think that can act as a catalyst for this ETF uh and as com because the companies that are in this ETF are going to be the companies that are going to benefit a lot from rate Cuts Thomas any thoughts on global X I think Global X has a great choice for a Buy and Hold portfolio as far as ETF goes it will add great amounts of diversity ification because infrastructure is what's known as a real asset real assets are things like roads and bridges and dams and sea ports things that you can get a hold of a lot of those businesses and operations and the building projects are protected by government contracts their payments are tied to inflation so it's a great way to reduce risk offset inflation and get portfolio diversification away from just straight stock equities,1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,k6wM0Q0JD6Q,2024-08-16T11:45:03Z,Set It and Forget It: Top ETFs for Stress-Free Investing,Vanguard,one name you might look at it's one of the more popular ETFs is the Vanguard vo and it's vanguard's version of the spy for lack of a better phrase It covers almost all of the companies that are in the Spy it has probably very similar waiting to the Spy the difference here is that you're getting a slightly lower dividend yield in the vo but you're also getting a really low expense ratio at about .3% and that's attractive for a lot of investors who are concerned about what fees might do for their overall gains over time so that's something that Vanguard has that they can track some Traders believe that there's a little bit less liquidity in the vo uh which is probably true because there's not as much volume uh with it but if you're a long-term Buy and Hold investor it's a solid Choice Thomas what are your thoughts on the Vanguard I mean I love the S&P 500 it's what I follow mostly in all of my day-to-day Market watching and and writing and investing research but if you're going to go with an S&P 500 ETF index tracking stock I would go for the Spy um the reasons that Chris has pointed out uh lower liquidity and lower dividend yield are part of that reason if you want to trade the S&P 500 go for the best one with the most liquidity and the best dividend all right so Thomas is not a fan of the Vanguard,1.0,0.0
MarketBeat,k6wM0Q0JD6Q,2024-08-16T11:45:03Z,Set It and Forget It: Top ETFs for Stress-Free Investing,Invesco QQQ,well so if you're if you're looking for something that's more sector focused right now you couldn't do a lot better than going with the Invesco QQQ um investors hear about this a lot even if you're not really a heavily into the stock market you've probably seen commercials advertised for the Invesco QQQ it's a very technology focused ETF I would kind of call it the Technology stock version of the Spy because that's the only Holdings in the in the fund are going to be the technology stocks so you're going to see all of the mag s in there you're going to see uh big names these aren't going to be heavy dividend stocks they might be some stocks that happen to pay a dividend but that's not why you're in the stock it's for growth oriented investors who are looking to benefit from technology stocks without trying to pick individual names yeah we talk a lot about those individual Ai and tech stocks out there Thomas do you see a benefit in going with the ETF instead of trying to pick just one popular AI stock out there well stock picking is incredibly difficult uh I think statistics show that stock Pickers tend to not really do better than the broad Market um individual investors can beat the broad Market but stock picking in general is not a great strategy um I think that investing in the cues is a great way to get exposure to the tech sector and also to a broader range of stocks and what you're going to find in the S&P 500 is there more risk involved Thomas it is a riskier ETF it's got a higher beta and with that Tech Factor there is certainly opportunities for some stock price implosions um volatility will certainly be the biggest difference for an example if you buy the Spy the QQQ and the Diamonds you're going to get a triple shot of Microsoft Amazon Google Nvidia all of the biggest most Market moving names and so you're going to think that you're Diversified but you're really not going to be this is part of why i'likeed uh the um Chris's choice of pave so much because that's going to be an ETF that will not have most the same names as are in the S&P 500 or the QQQ,1.0,0.2
MarketBeat,k6wM0Q0JD6Q,2024-08-16T11:45:03Z,Set It and Forget It: Top ETFs for Stress-Free Investing,Noble (NOBL),well one of the ETFs that I really like especially from the Buy and Hold perspective is the noble no o the dividend Aristocrat tracking stock NOW the divid Aristocrats are a member group of the S&P 500 but these are the stocks that have increased their dividend for at least 25 years now among the differences between the noble and the Spy is that you're going to get a higher yield you're going to get more aggressive dividend growth enough to offset inflation you're going to get reduced volatility I think it trades with a0 65 beta compared to the S&P 500 which is going to protect you on the down swings and set you up for bigger total returns over time um overtime the ETF itself tends to match the S&P 500 but the total returns are much bigger because of the yield and reinvestment and the distribution growth,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,k6wM0Q0JD6Q,2024-08-16T11:45:03Z,Set It and Forget It: Top ETFs for Stress-Free Investing,Global X,well one that I've been following for a little while now is the uh it's called the global xus infrastructure development ETF and that's how mouthful and the stock tickers actually pave PA which makes a lot ofense sense because this is dealing with infrastructure stocks we're talking about this the companies that do the things that help us with the roads and the bridges and all of the infrastructure that the United States needs to build this has been taken off since 2020 gotten even further lift from the infrastructure act that passed in Congress in 2021 it's only been actively trading for about 7 years but the chart just looks phenomenal since 2020 now some people would say uh that all the growth in this ETF is priced in because the infrastructure spending has already kind of made its way into the economy and that this stock may be starting to stumble a little bit however I think with the likelihood that the fed's going to cut interest rates coming in September I think that can act as a catalyst for this ETF uh and as com because the companies that are in this ETF are going to be the companies that are going to benefit a lot from rate Cuts Thomas any thoughts on Global X I think Global X is a great choice for a Buy and Hold portfolio as far as ETF goes it will add great amounts of diversification because infrastructure is what's known as a real asset real assets are things like roads and bridges and dams and sea ports things that you can get a hold of a lot of those businesses and operations and the building projects are protected by government contracts their payments are tied to inflation so it's a great way to reduce risk offset inflation and get portfolio diversification away from just straight stock equities this is part of why i'likeed uh the um Chris's choice of pave so much because that's going to be an ETF that will not have most the same names as are in the S&P 500 or the QQQ,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,k6wM0Q0JD6Q,2024-08-16T11:45:03Z,Set It and Forget It: Top ETFs for Stress-Free Investing,Russell 2000,I'm surprised Thomas I haven't heard you talk about the Russell yet I know we've talked about it before uh tell us a little bit about that ETF right so right now I think the Russell 2K um the iwm is a great choice it's experiencing volatility along with the broad Market we're in into some some riskof atmosphere a little bit of sector rotation uh just some some fear because of fomc and the outlook for interest rates but the fomc is expected to cut interest rates lowerer rates are known to be um good for smaller cap stocks uh the Russell 2K should outperform the broad Market over the next few years and within that small cap arena there is a much larger opportunity for growth now the Russell 2K is not going to produce quadruple digit growth but many of the stocks within it will and that'll result in high double digit to triple-digit growth for the Russell the one exception I would make is if you were going to look at different ETFs there are so many sector specific ETFs so if you wanted to do for example Thomas was just talking about the Russell 2000 if you wanted to have a little bit of exposure to the Russell 2000 that's great because you're getting exposed to some stocks that you might not get in the Spy,1.0,0.7

MarketBeat,8RuSR08FEwg,2024-08-14T10:00:07Z,Instacart’s Smart Moves: Why Now Might Be the Time to Buy the Stock,Instacart,"this obviously gives a good opportunity to step into the stock on the pullbacks uh before it will actually break out to the upside it's the bill that just keeps getting bigger but one company is using the rising cost of groceries to actually grow its business here to talk about instacart is Market beat analyst jayu Jay first off are you a regular instacart user um actually know but I probably will in the near future yeah for those who aren't like myself too I I I prefer going into the store and doing the the grocery shopping in the aisles what does instacart actually provide well people think that instart is a delivery service and they'll be the first ones to tell you they're not they're actually the world's largest grocery Marketplace um meaning that they have 880,000 stores you can access 25 million people have used them you can order groceries you can order supplies you can order from Home Depot set Sally Beauty Supply and also you can order uh from restaurants because they've just done a deal with door Dash and Uber Eats so they're more than just a delivery app and with their future plans um they are actually going to expand into the grocery store yeah I'm excited about that we're going to get to that in just a minute but first let's talk about even though you and I don't use the service as much lots of people are in fact there's instacart fan favorites all over the world this company has seen some pretty impressive growth absolutely these guys are still growing the revenues grew 15% year of a year uh transaction Revenue grew 177% year of a year their advertising actually grew 11% year of a year that makes up a third of their revenues to begin with and the other thing to keep in mind about instacart um they're profitable they're not only profitable but they're Gap profitable all right door Dash can't say that Uber reads can't say that um these guys are really I mean they were profitable even before they went public so when they did the IPO um they ipoed as a profitable company yeah that's really impressive especially in the kind of economic environment we're in right now when the price of groceries is all anybody talks about anymore especially those of us with kids everybody talks about how hard it is to go grocery shopping these days how has instacart managed to not only be or maintain its profitability but also grow in this kind of economic climate so instacart is trying to uh take some of the sting uh off of the consumers um they started uh implementing Flyers uh which is basically what they do is they take the weekly flyers for up 90% of the users of uh instart get access to three weekly Flyers circulars uh directly in the app on a weekly basis so they include the Flyers which will have your local discounts and promotions um they also include the Loyalty plans right so you can still continue to rack up points um uh they have a Super Saver periods where you can actually order uh the groceries with the zero delivery fees so uh they're doing everything they can to kind of take some of the stting off they're actually working with uh Grocery Stores um to determine basically pricing um you know what price points uh are more favorable for uh certain items and stuff like that so there's a whole science behind this and they're really getting uh immersive when it comes to taking a stance against uh inflation and plus they also have U snap EBT access for uh 15,000 Walgreens stores uh Right Aid and so forth sounds like some really useful tools for consumers and I let's get back to what you mentioned earlier they're actually going to be getting into the stores for consumers like me who prefer walking the aisles what are they doing to reach those customers all right so this is really exciting because uh you know instacart is known as well a delivery service um but the even the CEO said that you know even if they double triple their business uh the reality is two-thirds of all grocery shopping is going to be done in the store how are you going to get a delivery company to be able to benefit from inore inore grocery shopping so they are rolling out this thing called Caper carts uh these are AI powered uh smart carts uh basically it will identify it will weigh and it will add whatever products you put into your cart directly onto your grocery list at the end of your shopping trip uh you can simply just pay the cart avoid the check out lines um and it keeps a running total of your groceries so if by some chance you know one day you decide you know I don't feel like going to the grocery store you can actually pull that up one click and you have you can have the groceries delivered to you so this is how they're going to convert people well like myself who've never used instacart to actually consider the delivery option because all that information is really just you know right on the app yeah that sounds incredibly useful and skip the line with a screaming toddler I think that's a that's a winner just with that um so let's get to the stock price itself what is instacart's stock looking like right now okay well instacart is actually been pulling back they had a great earnings the stock has been in what's known as a desending triangle path which means that there's a solid support but all the balances continue to get sold off at lower levels lower levels and lower levels um this obviously gives a good opportunity to step into the stock on the pullbacks uh before it will actually break out to the upside well some good information for investors out there and a great background on the company too thanks for your time today Jay and thanks for joining us here at Market beat stay with us as we track instaart and all the other stocks right here on Market be happy investing",1.0,0.85

MarketBeat,xdlSCV56nJI,2024-08-13T17:33:31Z,Starbucks Stock Rises as Chipotle Falls: CEO Transition,Starbucks,"this is a huge Spike this morning I like I said I think it was 25% already just this morning and that's what what the first hour of trading some big news from Starbucks this morning as the stock is surging as the company announced its fourth CEO in just two years but this announcement is a pretty popular name here to break it all down for us is our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys really big news this morning great news for Starbucks not so great for Chipotle right right this is um a shocking surprise to everybody um Starbucks like you said has had several new CEOs in the last few years the CEO that was just ousted Mr Nar simhan I think that's correct naris man was from PepsiCo um there was quite a big transition him coming on board and Schultz leaving again it was supposed to be a really really good move the company has floundered ever since then I mean I saw Starbucks is up like 25% already this morning yeah I mean Starbucks is trying to see what they can do to to take some of what Nichol was doing it CH P if he can bring that culture over to Starbucks Starbucks has been kind of a mess I mean it's they've had activist investors are now actively uh trying to get the company to change their policies and I guess this is phase one of that let's talk about why Starbucks has been a mess what's been going on with this stock over the last couple of years and this company kind of from the 10,000 foot view um the culture is really based on CEO tots he is the one that really catalyzed the business and grew it to where it is today we've seen over the last 10 years when he leaves Starbucks has problems right and like I said before this transition to this now outed CEO was really a big deal they took a long time he had a lot a big vote of confidence from Schultz himself it was supposed to be a much better transition than it was if you look at the numbers for Starbucks it hasn't been that bad but right now they're they're suffering with some real big demand issues in China um and then they're also getting weaker consumer demand here in the United States so it's kind of a mess all the way around um just in terms of the the company just doesn't seem to have a lot of traction they seem to be a company that's just they're kind of running in place this certainly is giving the stock traction so I saw it Starbucks stock was really down quite a bit this year but today it's already kind of making up a lot of those losses and Starbucks wants to see that happen for their own business the problem with Starbucks is that it's a huge company and it's going to be hard to get those kinds of changes the significance that uh Brian Nichol has brought to Chipotle in such a large business now Chris do you think a CEO has the power to make those kinds of big changes that investors are hoping well I think Nicholls certainly does because you know Starbucks we we don't know at least right now we don't know the details of the compensation package but certainly Starbucks is giving him the keys I mean this is similar to a professional sports team going out and they're they're hiring the bigname coach and they're turning over the entire franchise to that person and hoping that he can make a big change and that I think is really what I think needs to be emphasized here is I think ultimately this is a Starbucks story Brian niichel is not just the new CEO he's also the new chairman of the board that means he does really have ultimate control of the entire business and that is really a big big huge move for Starbucks I look and see Bridget what happens with their China business because that's been an area that Starbucks has been struggling with it's an area that the activists investors have been have been chirping about I think there's probably going to be some move there in terms of how do they divest themselves from that business The question is the same as it is with Starbucks Starbucks does great with Schultz not so great with anybody else how about Starbucks stock what does this mean for investors who might be looking at this news today do they want to get in right now talk about your thoughts on when to get in on Starbucks Welly I I I would probably unfortunately if you're looking to get in Starbucks I'm probably looking for a little bit of a pullback I mean this is Hu this is a huge Spike this morning I like I said I think it was 5% already just this morning and that's what what the first hour of trading so I'm going to look for a little bit of a pullback coming off so this is sort of the Bridget what I said is selling the rumor on Chipotle this is the you're buying the news on Starbucks and I think in the coming hours and days you're going to start seeing a okay let's bring it down a little bit let's tape our expectations I'd be looking to buy Starbucks but I would want a better price point than I'm getting right now right I would expect to see the price pull back and it may not begin to rebound really and reverse into an uptrend until again we see some some evidence that that the change is working all of it means a lot of action today and we will of course continue to follow everything that happens with both Starbucks and chipotle and more right here on Market

MarketBeat,QhEkAb-glDA,2024-08-08T14:32:24Z,Is Palantir Stock Worth the Hype After Earnings Jump?,Palantir,"The great Palantir debate continues: is this stock overpriced or is this week's earnings report further proved that the stock is surging for good reason? It was a good Tuesday for Palantir stock after the company's strong earnings report sent the stock up more than 11% even before the market opened. It was a great earnings report for Palantir by almost any measure. Revenue came in at $678 million, beating analyst expectations by about 4%, and was 27% higher year-over-year. Revenue is coming from both government contracts (up 24%) and the commercial side of the business (up 55%). The company closed 27 deals valued at over $10 million, increased customer count by 41%, and delivered another profitable quarter of 9 cents per share, showing tremendous earnings growth. They also raised guidance for both revenue and earnings for the coming quarter and the rest of the year. The company is building momentum; revenue and profitability growth accelerated sequentially and year-over-year, and guidance and other internal metrics suggest that will continue. Palantir has seen significant year-over-year growth. The Chief Financial Officer for Palantir said it's in the S&P's hands regarding inclusion. Analysts are still mixed on the stock, with some poo-pooing it and others having good targets. The stock is still pegged at 'reduce,' and the price target assumes downside, yet the analysts are incredibly mixed, with ratings from sell to strong buy. I'm bullish on Palantir and have a position in Palantir. The company announced they had a free cash flow of between $800 million and a billion, with a free cash flow margin of 29% to 36%, which would suggest the company's market cap is undervalued by about 20%, maybe suggesting a realistic price target around $32. Thomas is also bullish but thinks the rally will be a slow grind higher, noting valuation is a concern, but it's offset by momentum and acceleration.",1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,QhEkAb-glDA,2024-08-08T14:32:24Z,Is Palantir Stock Worth the Hype After Earnings Jump?,S&P 500,"Institutions have been staying away from Palantir; if they got included in the S&P 500, it would force a lot of those institutions to buy shares of the stock. Is that growth enough to help Palantir make it into the S&P 500 though? The Chief Financial Officer for Palantir said it does push the ball into the S&P's court. The concern people had when Palantir became eligible for the S&P 500 was whether they could continue to grow profitability at a significant rate. The company has been rejected by the S&P 500 twice. One reason might be that there is already a lot of tech in the S&P 500 (about 42%), and they would probably not put Palantir in because they're going to increase the concentration into Tech. If Palantir did make it into the S&P 500, it would absolutely be a catalyst because Palantir currently only has about 45% of its stock float owned by institutional investors. The S&P 500 is a very widely followed index, and many other indexes and funds are based on it, so when Palantir is included, they'll all be forced to buy it.",1.0,-0.1

MarketBeat,ME_Ozbk_258,2024-08-07T19:50:53Z,SMCI: Higher Revenue Ahead Despite Selloff,Super Micro Computers,"smci is guiding to higher revenue and higher earnings in the next year which may indicate that this selloff is perhaps a little bit overdone. It's a day of a lot of market movement for super micro computers here to talk about what's behind all of the big moves today. A lot going on with super micro today. There's a couple of things going on with super micro; they reported earnings last night, a slight Miss on Revenue, a little bit larger Miss on earnings, but the stock went up about 10% in the after hours because the company announced a 10 for one stock split which will take place sometime in September. However as analysts dove into the report, they're not liking what they're seeing in terms of the company's margins and the stock is down right now we're almost sitting around 11:00 or so on Wednesday morning and the stock's down about 15% so up 10 down 15 that's a lot of movement in one day trading it. Let's talk about that stock split first, that was a little bit of a surprise for investors because it's the first time that super micro's done it. There had been some Whispers that super micro might consider doing a stock split because the company's seen a really tremendous increase in the share price in the last year. Revenues grown significantly, earnings have grown significantly and that's because of demand for the company servers and such in data centers that everybody's using for AI. When a stock moves up that quickly to the level that it was, it's trading now at over $520 a share even with this pullback this morning, it's a stock that people look at and say okay maybe it's time for the company to split its stock and give shareholders at least a psychological reward. The reason why the stock is going down this morning isn't due to the stock split, it's due to the fact that people are looking at the company's profit. Super micro is growing revenue and they're continuing to grow Revenue at a very strong rate, that means they're getting more customers that want their products, that's generally a good thing. The problem that super micro might be having is that they don't have a high profit margin on their product. These are relatively low margin products, even though servers are quite expensive as you know, they're not necessarily a high margin product. So the company isn't growing Revenue at the same rate that it's growing earnings and they missed on where analysts thought they should be with profit and I think that's causing some pressure on the stock price this morning as people are trying to figure out okay what's the actual fair price for SMC stock which it's also important to note it's still up about 119% for the year and not bad earnings for a year and growth in a year, it's still generating quite a bit of stock price growth for investors. The interesting thing to me is when I looked at their guidance, smci is guiding to higher revenue and higher earnings in the next year which may indicate that this selloff is perhaps a little bit overdone and that would be the reason why investors would want to get in before the split because if that's true then the stock is going to probably go up a little bit before that split happens in September. We're going to continue to follow everything this stock does now and into the future.",1.0,0.4

Beauty,this company is taking share from established Legacy cosmetic retailers. why do you think this budget friendly beauty company elf is worth investing in right now. Thomas tell us what you have to say about elf. so why buy Elf now because the stock price is down 20% from the recent highs and new Highs are likely. this company is taking share from established Legacy cosmetic retailers. this recent selloff is partially due to cautious guidance they're still expecting they're expecting Revenue growth to slow but still strong at 20%. the company also tends to outperform so the guidance is really being viewed as cautious. analyst sentiment is also very very positive. analysts are raising their targets and their sentiment ratings despite the weak guidance. the price Target is up more than 100% in the last 12 months. the consensus implies a 20% gain that aligns with the new all-time high and most of the fresh targets put the stock at a new all-time high so so again it's just a matter of time. I think that the uh the recipe is there the the the I wanted to say the uh the factors are in place to drive this stock to a new high right.

MarketBeat,Zg6YfLbYrdU,2024-08-05T21:46:14Z,Texas Roadhouse: The Restaurant Stock Defying the Market Slump,Texas Roadhouse,here to talk about Texas Roadhouse and why this stock is doing so well right now is our Market beat analyst Jay U Jay what about Texas Roadhouse has the stock performing fairly well especially compared to other restaurants oh Texas Roadhouse is one of those very rare situations where they are not only growing same store sales or comparable sales uh year over your comparable sales but they're literally doing more than double the uh the segment average uh they just reported uh their numbers and they're doing 99.3% year every year same store sales which is incredible so how is Texas Roadhouse what are they specifically doing um that's getting them above other competitors like Longhorn or other steakhouses that might be seeing a drop in spending right now now right Texas Roadhouse is one of those situations where they have premium products uh they make their sides from scratch every day the meats never Frozen when you walk into one of their restaurants you can actually pick the meat from the C from from the window I think it's all about those buns right the Texas Roadhouse buns and that cinnamon butter is why people go to that restaurant do you think it's details like that that are really putting this company Above the Rest what is Texas Roadhouse trading at today on a day when the whole Market is really kind of crashed right so Texas Road house actually bounced off its lows it fell to a low of 15756 uh and it's it's bounced over six points from the lows because Texas Roadhouse is so unique and they're Cut Above the Rest uh the smart money knows when you get a discount opportunity when everyone is s selling and panicking that's when you actually want to buy the dip so this is a good opportunity opportunity to get in on Texas Roadhouse it has a a rare pattern called a bullish Mega phone uh where it's going to make larger ranges higher highs lower lows and eventually if the pattern plays out it's going to explode to the upside yeah and I think what also stands out about Texas Roadhouse doing well right now is not every restaurant industry or stock is doing well right now once again there are those exceptions like a Texas Roadhouse where even if you're feeling pinched it's pric at a value but it's a premium profit so when you have that rare combination of the two it's going to keep you floating a lot higher than the competitors,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,azGP7JLFjNM,2024-08-02T18:30:04Z,Top 3 Bargain Stocks to Buy at Their 52-Week Lows,Vale,so the first stock pick I have is Veil um it's one of the leading producers of iron ore and iron ore pellets and those are an essential component of Steel making now investing in stocks that are linked to Commodities is always a little bit tricky you really have because the price of the stock is always going to be dependent on the price of the underlying commodity um however this does look like a really good time to be investing in steel and one of the reasons for that is infrastructure um demand for data centers is exploding I just read an article this morning actually that talked about how um there's a there's um growing demand for data centers in Asia it's expected to be a 72 billion dollar market by 2032 and to put that in perspective that's up from 23 billion in 2023 so that's a lot of growth that's coming just from one region in the country and that's not to say what's happening right here in the United States Veil is also one of the leading producers of copper and um copper demands expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.4% through the rest of the decade that hasn't necessarily shown up this year although it was supposed to but going forward that's going to be a key growth driver for Vil as well yeah I know the steel Market has had a lot of ups and downs over the past few years especially uh Building Materials in general since Co have kind of been very volatile Thomas what kind of risk should investors be ready to take on if they buy into the veil sale going on right now well I think the biggest risk is that demand may not pick up as much as the forecasts are implying um a lot of that demand forecast is based on interest rates and there is an expectation for interest rate cuts the risk I see in that is uh that they FC may not cut as quickly or as as soon as the market is expecting it may take longer for the economic rebound to gain traction and support those prices so it just could take longer for this Rebound in the stock price to to gain traction,1.0,0.6
MarketBeat,azGP7JLFjNM,2024-08-02T18:30:04Z,Top 3 Bargain Stocks to Buy at Their 52-Week Lows,Halliburton,all right well let's move on to your next pick Chris from steel to oil you're looking at another industry that comes with a lot of ups and downs right yeah I'm looking at Halton now halberton is an oil services company they're they're not a driller uh but what they do is they provide the products and services that drilling companies need and one of the things that may surprise some viewers of this video is that the United States is currently drilling at record levels um you kind of hear a lot of talk about the fact that we're not drilling but we're actually drilling at at record levels that's not showing up in the price of oil there's a couple of reasons for that one of which is the fact that um the the Biden Administration has been tapping the Strategic petroleum Reserve pretty hard there's also evidence of waning consumer demand as the prices at the pump are significantly higher than they were just a few years ago however the future price of oil I don't think investors should look at that as a binary decision based on the outcome of this Fall's election oil demand's going to be strong for the next decade or more um there's just huge demand for oil in every sector of the economy in fact if the economy is going to grow it's going to be because of oil yeah halberton is an interesting pick I know they're looking at a $45 price price target for this stock do you think Thomas that that includes a little speculation about the election or is there other economic factors going on right now that could really help boost that stock in the future well I'm sure that there is some election cycle volatility priced into the stock but what I'm seeing in the oil field is a super cycle uh it's ongoing it started with a decade of underinvestment in the energy patch leading into the pandemic today it's about efficiency and new technologies we're trying to get the most out of the wells that exist we're trying to reduce emissions and impact we're trying to take new wells to the next level so what I'm seeing is some volatility now maybe some lower prices in the stock it is up 100% in the last two years um the latest results were a little bit tepid um strength in other parts of the world but there was some weakness in the Gulf of Mexico that could be tied to high interest rates and again that electric cycle uncertainty um we might be in wait and see mode for the stock price but I do expect a rebound to happen um analysts right now have been cutting their targets and they've added some downward pressure to the stock price but the target range is narrowing around the $45 level like you said that's about 30% upside the narrowing range to me shows a growing conviction so I would expect to see the stock price return to that level uh given time,1.0,0.5
MarketBeat,azGP7JLFjNM,2024-08-02T18:30:04Z,Top 3 Bargain Stocks to Buy at Their 52-Week Lows,Lululemon,all right Chris let's move on to the final must buy bargain stock you shared in your article this week it may be a barain in stock but their products uh they don't come at such a great price point uh I may be familiar with this stock in this company but I can honestly say I've never owned a pair we're talking about Lululemon today Chris yeah Bridget you and me both um you and I are probably the kind of Shoppers that are contributing to the fact that um Lululemon's been struggling recently at least the stock has it sound about 49% for the year that's that's a significant dip and the question is really are should investors be buying it now this is one of those cases where many investors buy stocks of companies that they're that they do business with that they identify with so therefore if you're a frequent consumer at Starbucks you might want to buy Starbucks stock it's a it's a company that you're always going to kind of be keeping in tabs on because you shop there frequently um it may surprise you Bridget to know that I am not the target audience for Lululemon but I can understand the consumer that they're trying to go after and these are brand loyal consumers and they believe that there's a certain cach a to owning that label that being said my bigger concern with lul lemon is not necessarily anything that has to do with revenue and earnings I think that's going to be fairly uh I think that's a symptom of the broader economy that will probably wash out in time I'm concerned about that they're saying there's a lack of innovation some believe that Lululemon isn't the most Innovative brand anymore that would concern me a little bit more they just um they just postponed the launch of their Breeze through leggings uh because there was consumer complaints about the brand the Lululemon says they're going to plan on relaunching the brand by taking that feedback into into you know into consideration and relaunching a better product it's kind of an interesting crowdsourcing approach and it may work for the company that's the one thing that would concern me however I did mention in my article I noticed that there's been a spike in institutional buying recently and so that tells me that maybe not you need to be paying more attention to what the institutions are doing than maybe what the institutions are saying interesting you know Chris you mentioned it a little bit about the economic Factor Thomas I know you follow CPI really closely it's no secret consumer confidence has really been down many Shoppers are focusing on those Essentials like groceries and not spending so much money on these luxury type Brands like Lululemon do you think that that is really going to have a shift in what this stock does is really based more on the economy well I think that uh there is probably some economic impact inflation related there are some other premium retailers like William Sonoma who are experiencing similar headwinds however the difference is that Lululemon is still growing the biggest headwind for it is that growth is slowing but the latest guidance is still good um I think the selloff is overextended that's ready for a rebound um it's definitely a value at 16 times next year's earnings um but again analysts have been lowering their price Target so that kind of presents a bit of a headwind for the share the share price action um I think maybe we could get a 10 to 20% upside from current levels the upside certainly isn't what it used to be but I do think there is some upside in this stock yeah it's hard to get into a stock when you see it's down 49% in a year uh is there a risk here that it could just keep going lower oh there's always that risk it just depends on the subsequent earnings reports um the company could continue to underperform and that would uh lead the analyst to continue adding pressure but like Chris said you know the um institutions are buying at this level so that shows a pretty good amount of support for the market if it were to dip any further I would expect to to see it rebound pretty quickly good to know well I love a good sale and so maybe I could shop Lululemon if they've got a good sale going on,1.0,0.3

MarketBeat,p6F8AwXUMmE,2024-07-31T14:53:01Z,Top Small-Cap Picks as Russell 2000 Nears All-Time High,Carvana,now Thomas your next small cap pick here has struggled for more than a year what is going on with carvana that made you add this struggling stock to your list to rotate right now well there are really two things driving my opinion for this stock one it returned to growth and two the analyst sen sentiment so over the last year or so the company has restructured and repositioned for the times and it's now well positioned to sustain long-term growth it's got a digital first footprint is seen as a as a major advantage um compounded by the Aging car Fleet so right now all of our cars on average are as old as they've ever been at record Age on cars that means that demand for new used cars is is building that's going to drive an upgrade cycle in in the car market which carvana is well positioned to take uh take advantage of not to mention the fact that carvana's digital first footprint adapts very well to AI which is going to improve its own efficiency and profit margin as well as driving customer satisfaction and growth now as far as the analyst cinic goes the price Target is still lagging but they've been making some aggressive revisions this year consensus Target is up 150% in the last year mostly in the last six months the freshest targets imply 20 to 25% upside and fresh multi-year highs and again the chatter among the analysts is that we're in the early stages of an upgrade cycle in the sentiment which means that we should expect to see not only carvana's results improve but analyst sentiment continue to improve which is a powerful Tailwind for the stock price sounds like some powerful upside coming for carvana Chris do you see carvana making gains for investors quickly or do you really think it's going to take some time to build up equity for those who choose to rotate to that stock today I'm not I'm not as confident as the analysts are what I'm seeing is a company that revenue is down from its peak and when the revenue was at its peak it wasn't profitable and so it's still not profitable I agree with Thomas AI could give this company a boost especially in margins that might turn it into a path to profitability here but without seeing that I'm a little bit skeptical plus I'm not really sure if the consumer is healthy enough right now even though we are in a cycle where if they if interest rates come down a little bit it should spur demand for used cars but right now I'm I'm not as high on carvana as Thomas is,1.0,0.2

MarketBeat,p6F8AwXUMmE,2024-07-31T14:53:01Z,Top Small-Cap Picks as Russell 2000 Nears All-Time High,Joby Aviation,I'm looking at Joby Aviation um this is a company in the uh evall which is electric vertical takeoff and Landing vehicles uh it's in that space it's a it's a growing sector and it's an emerging sector uh I know we've talked about Job b a little bit on this channel from time to time this is the kind of company and Industry that would really benefit from a rate cut and perhaps a more favorable regulatory environment which might be coming in 2025 um all the numbers are falling into place the company should start commercial flights in 2025 that doesn't mean it's going to be generating a lot of significant Revenue but it's going to have it's going to have product in the market it's building cash on its balance sheet had around 920 million as of the end of the first quarter profitability is going to take some time but this is a sector to watch and to me this is the kind of small cap that you really kind of want to get into because this is the type of stock that has the potential to be the really the multibagger in the future Thomas what are your thoughts on this sector for small cap stocks I like Joby I know that our our director producer doesn't like us to agree on things but I I really like JY it's it's a good it's a good company it's a good stock I like the Evo Market uh one of joby's most recent news releases and I don't remember the specific miles that the vehicle flew but they flew a hydrogen fuel cell Evo electric vehicle like 350 MI and still had 15 or 20% charge left so that opens up a a whole new market Joi supposed to be air taxis for inner city use this sets them up for regional Regional traffic say from like Raleigh to Atlanta with absolutely no emissions just water um and it's proven they did it already it's just a matter of time um like Chris said they're on track to start commercial operations next year um they're targeting a couple of major cities in America um I believe Dubai and in India also uh so I really expect to see some some some big things from Joby over the next year,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,p6F8AwXUMmE,2024-07-31T14:53:01Z,Top Small-Cap Picks as Russell 2000 Nears All-Time High,ELF,why do you think this budget friendly beauty company elf is worth investing in right now before you answer this leave a comment Down Below guys if you want to discuss some makeup products no I'm just kidding this is a stock market channel uh Thomas tell us what you have to say about elf so why buy Elf now because the stock price is down 20% from the recent highs and new Highs are likely this company is taking share from a stablished legacy cosmetic retailers um this recent selloff is partially due to cautious guidance they're still expecting they're expecting Revenue growth to slow but still strong at 20% the company also tends outperform so the guidance is really being viewed as cautious um there is also a catalyst in lower interest rates lower interest rate should help increase consumer spending power um as I was saying before I don't think that the sell up in the broad market and the signal in the r2k is a oneandone thing I think that the big rally may not start until really until early next year because it will take some time for the fomc to make that first cut and for those cuts to impact the consumer but what I'm saying is that this Tailwind is in place that should help spur better than expected results and even accelerated results compared to the guidance anal cinnamon is also very very positive analysts are raising their targets and their sentiment ratings despite the weak guidance uh the price Target is up more than 100% in the last 12 months the consensus implies a 20% gain that aligns with the new all-time high and most of the fresh targets put the stock at a new all-time high so so again it's just a matter of time I think think that the uh the recipe is there the the I wanted to say the uh the factors are in place to drive this stock to a new high right Chris I know that you have two daughters have they had any elf products taking over some counter space that maybe used to be occupied by other brands you know what I really would not be able to answer that pay more attention Chris I I will have to pay more attention there there's a lot of cosmetic and skincare products taking over the countertop in their bathroom,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,8m09UFPvzOw,2024-07-30T18:55:21Z,Invest in the Dip: 2 Down Stocks with the Most Potential,Amazon,I'm going to say Amazon and it's a stock that um I haven't been paying a lot of attention to until this year but I'm really intrigued to see what Amazon's going to do and how they're going to report I think they report on August 1st that's going to be just really interesting to me this is a convergence of not only e-commerce but it's also Ai and what they're doing there with their uh AWS the stock is up for the year so some investors might say it's not a stock that's down but it's down about 5 and a half% in the last month and I think if they report a strong earnings report this stock could really take off it's one I'm really intrigued at as we're heading into earnings Thomas what are your thoughts on this stock do you think it's likely to see some growth in the near future or you think differently um I think that Amazon has Amazon has some Tailwinds blowing for it I mean it's got AWS it's got the growth of the cloud it's got the growth of AI it's got all these new Partnerships that are helping it establish its position as an AI leader it's also got the consumer angle I think those two parts of the business play together very well uh we may not see like robust growth or out performance right away but I think over the next year and the coming years Amazon will perform very well ultimately I think if you were looking to buy maybe like just one stock Amazon's a good pick because it has that diversification between the tech side and the consumer side and this those two sides they they really blend together very well they can use all of their Cloud uh infrastructure to support the consumer business and all the AI infrastructure and AI work will help them uh build efficiency and provide better services so I think Amazon really is going to be a good winner,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,Qv9Eyw5gz1k,2024-07-29T19:24:23Z,Top Stock Picks Amid Tech Market Meltdown,Nvidia,"So, what I see is this is the first of many potential bubbles in the AI market. And what's supposed to happen now is that this AI bubble with Nvidia and Microsoft and all the big players has burst. We're supposed to see some of that strength spread into other parts of the economy. So hopefully we'll see uh some more followthrough and we'll see the the AI rally start to broaden. Um, are we already seeing a lot of the traders picking up on some of these big tech giants like Nvidia or even Micron Technology? So, what I'm seeing in Nvidia specifically and with their volume trends is that uh the volume spiked with the sell-off. So that kind of leads me to believe that it could still be in play and we might see some lower prices, but ultimately the average daily volume and the peaks of all the volume spikes have been trending lower since March. So this market is beginning cooler and cooler and cooler since March. This shows some signs of underlying weakness. Microsoft has emerged as the number two player in the AI world, right behind Nvidia. They run both AMD and NVIDIA processors and accelerators. I've got Super Micro, I've got Nvidia, and I've got Broadcom or Micron, excuse me. And so Super Micro, it's all about the buildout of data centers. It's about the fact that Super Micro is providing the servers that these data centers need, which are going to house Nvidia chips, and that's where Nvidia is coming in. Uh there's still a huge market here for Nvidia. Other companies are starting to catch up, but they're catching up because Nvidia just can't keep up with the demand. I'm not sure if that's a disadvantage to Nvidia or if that's just something they're going to work through in the short term. I just think each one of these companies, again, Super Micro, Nvidia, and Micron Technologies, they're all right now where the AI bubble, if that's what we want to call it. It's right where they are right now, and there's still room for those stocks to run before that bubble is burst. Oracle is right at the top of the list. It's positioned with the cloud database services. Again, it offers choice uh between for consumers with AMD and and Nvidia um accelerators.",1.0,0.2

And what's supposed to happen now is that this AI bubble with Nvidia and Microsoft and all the big players has burst. I think I would pick Microsoft. Uh Microsoft has emerged as the number two player in the AI world, right behind Nvidia. They're not making chips, but that's the only thing they're not doing. um they make the cloud, they make the cloud work, they make AI work by extension. It's become a preferred vendor for crosscloud services and for choice. They run both AMD and NVIDIA processors and accelerators. They've got new partnerships like with Oracle and with OpenAI that helps establish them as really the leader in today's current, you know, AI offerings. Um they're full stack. So basically, it's like you can use our stuff to make AI or let us make your AI for you. um they got a steady stable business without the AI angle, cash flow, healthy balance sheet, capital returns, and the analysts are leading it higher. I think that uh the consensus is an all-time high. So, if we hit an all-time high, that that opens the door to even more highs. So, yeah, Microsoft is my pick. I mean, if you're talking about buying a Microsoft, I think you can you can be go ahead and continue on with whatever your investment plan is with Microsoft at any time. That's that's going to be a solid performer no matter what. Oracle is right at the top of the list. It's positioned with the cloud database services. It's also got that Microsoft partnership that helps establish it as a leader.",1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,Qv9Eyw5gz1k,2024-07-29T19:24:23Z,Top Stock Picks Amid Tech Market Meltdown,Amazon,"Well, I'm going to go outside of the article that I just wrote for now because one stock that I think I'm really curious about for this week with earnings, um, I'm going to say Amazon. And it's a stock that um I haven't been paying a lot of attention to until this year, but I'm really intrigued to see what Amazon's going to do and how they're going to report. I think they report on August 1st. That's going to be just really interesting to me. This is a convergence of not only e-commerce, but it's also AI and what they're doing there with their uh AWS. The stock is up for the year. So, some investors might say it's not a stock that's down, but it's down about 5 and a half% in the last month. And I think if they report a strong earnings report, this stock could really take off. It's one I'm really intrigued at as we're heading into earnings. Thomas, what are your thoughts on this stock? Do you think it's likely to see some growth in the near future, or you think differently? Um, I think that Amazon has Amazon has some tailwinds blowing for it. I mean, it's got AWS, it's got the growth of the cloud, it's got the growth of AI, it's got all these new partnerships that are helping it establish its position as an AI leader. It's also got the consumer angle. I think those two parts of the business play together very well. Uh we may not see like robust growth or outperformance right away, but I think over the next year and the coming years, Amazon will perform very well. Ultimately, I think if you were looking to buy maybe like just one stock, Amazon's a good pick because it has that diversification between the tech side and the consumer side. And this those two sides, they they really blend together very well. They can use all of their cloud uh infrastructure to support the consumer business and all the AI infrastructure and AI work will help them uh build efficiency and provide better services. So, I think Amazon really is going to be a good winner.",1.0,0.8

It's part of the R2K. Right now at that rotation, we're looking at um investors rotating out of big caps into small caps. So, I think out of those three, SMCI might be the best play.",1.0,0.7

I mean, Micron dropped 23% over the past month. So, what do we see with that one? I've got Super Micro, I've got Nvidia, and I've got Broadcom or Micron, excuse me. And then there's Micron, which is the memory component of all of this.

But I think in his uh coverage of the the semiconductor market, he's left one out, a very important one, and that's advanced micro devices. Um so it's cloud data center and accelerator business is booming way better than expected. It's got return to growth in legacy markets with a multi-year multi-year upcycle forecasted. Um analysts are expecting 7% revenue growth in this next quarter. I think that's a very low bar. Um the company tends to outperform. It's set up to rebound. um the stock is if we have a good report and the analysts are still leading the market higher. So with uh AMD, we're just looking at a good catalyst. We need a good catalyst and that's probably going to come in in the earnings report. Oracle is right at the top of the list. It's positioned with the cloud database services.

MarketBeat,EkTegCjNa_M,2024-07-25T20:04:10Z,Tesla Stock Dip: A Buyer's Alert,Tesla,yeah I think this is a buying opportunity but it comes with a pretty big butt Tesla's quarterly earnings report is out and the stock is dropping as investors react to this news join us as we break down the earnings report and what it means for investors in their portfolios let's dive in Tesla's stock price is tumbling after Tuesday's earnings report Thomas Chris let's talk about this slide that's underway what is going on here well right now the stock is down from its recent highs it's near the middle of a long-term trading range but it's below the midpoint of that range which I think is a significant sign for the market um I expect that level to cap gains for the foreseeable future yeah Tesla stock I mean this is Tesla it it it's not immune to seeing big price swings um it's one of the more heavily traded stocks on the market but it's clear if you look at the long-term chart on this that the stocks been in a general downtrend since the beginning of 2022 um it may have hit some sort of a bottom in January of last year 20123 but the Bulls like Thomas was saying the Bulls are having a really hard time getting any sort of traction here and it's it's finding resistance at key points and it looks like it might be trying to find resistance again so um yeah not not a great week for Tesla shareholders now you mentioned that it's kind of been a general downtrend here for a while now but this further downslide has began right after the earnings report was released Thomas what is the main news in the report that has investors backing down even more right so with this report uh the company returned to growth and that's good but the growth was weaker than expected and the weakness was in the EV segment which is the company's main segment this is 78 78% of the business so it's pretty significant that the revenue decline outpaced the volume decline which shows the impact of pricing that go into the margins the company has been cutting its prices in a price War trying to Spur sales that's hitting its margins spending also increased um there is the musk factor in play the future should be good but right now this is a car company that's Contracting and that's real bad for the stock price you've got Rivals like GM and lucid and rivan that are taking market share from Tesla now Thomas you wrote an article for Market be earli this week and I'm going to go ahead and get that linked down below for anyone that wants to read into that but you had mentioned uh margins in this article walk us through this what are Tesla's margins looking like right now and why might the that be a problem going forward for this stock well so the company still has a positive margin it's still making money however the price Wars and the price Cuts cut significantly into that margin was compounded by increased AI spending which resulted in like a 40 45% contraction in their earnings power now that's huge stock prices are based on the power of earnings and if the earnings are contracting the stock price is going to contract now the AI spending is good because one day it will pay off but when and how much right so right now that's just a headwin for the for the stock price the company's struggling to make money and it's spending a lot of money trying to get it s set up for the next phase of growth which also may not come around sound as quick as they as they had originally said uh because in this report elon's already pushing back plans for the robo taxi expect that to happen again Chris what do these types of margins mean for investors and their confidence in this type of stock oh it has so much to do um as Thomas was saying earnings are everything I mean when their margins are Contracting that means they're making less profit and the stock price flows right away from how much earnings growth there is and right now Tesla's it's right for investors to wonder where that growth is coming from some people believe it's going to happen in the energy storage area especially as data centers need to be built out but there's no indication that right now that that's happening so we've already seen some major moves to the downside on Tesla stock this week but what are the analysts saying about this Outlook in the forecast of Tesla's share price right now well well this is pretty typical after Tesla reports earnings analysts have been really quick to uh register their opinions there's a ton of uh of ratings already that come out on that you can find on Market beat in general the report is mixed but I did see a couple of notable downgrades yesterday to go along with some lower price targets so I would say overall the sentiment is neutral at best and slightly bearish right I would agree with agree with that um right right after the report most of the revisions were negative but there have been quite a few more to come out since then very much mixed action uh they're still rating a hold but what I'm seeing is uh the price targets are narrowing they're narrowing to a range around the previous consensus which still implies some some downside for the stock um if nothing else it plays into that idea of gains being capped now with everything going on with Tesla does this represent a buying opportunity for those who might be seeing Tesla stock decline right now or what what's your take on this well yeah I think this is a buying opportunity but it comes with a pretty big butt we're talking about Tesla this is a volatile Market um we didn't really get good news this was bad news to me uh we've had Fairly bad price action since then since the report was released um I think this stock could move lower I mean today showing some support a little bit of rebound from the the the big selloff but I still think it could move lower um you know the analyst response is mixed they're kind of firming up their sentiment but they're not really expecting a big move anywhere um unless proven Wrong by the price action I would say that waiting is the best thing to do right now um it's a waiting game to see if and when Tesla will be able to follow through on its next big win when we start getting some some news about that we may see a bottom come into play um but like I said I think right now we're just waiting to see what happens over the next few weeks or months is probably the best thing to do all right so we're in the waiting game right now but Thomas you're typically one that's pretty good at calling a bottom can you call a bottom to this decline how soon could we see this happen well I don't know if I can call the bottom but there are some pretty firm targets for support and I'll show you those on the chart right this is the chart of weekly prices um what you can see here is the big run up in 220 this was driven by the EV Boom the spack boom all the EV oems all also driven by Tesla's lean into profitability up here at the peak this is when Tesla was producing the biggest profits had the best outlook for profitability but since then the entire EV Market has been selling off because demand has slowed and in the case of Tesla its profitability has been pinched so right now you can see there's pretty clear resistance right here about the midpoint of the range I think that'll cap our gains for the next couple of quarters probably as far as the bottom goes I think that the Bott bottom is going to be somewhere down here in the 150 to 200 region um we showing some signs of support right here above these moving averages I don't really count it to hold I would expect to see the market retest 175 if not move lower so my advice would be to wait and to try and Target an entry around this level but I still wouldn't be too quick to get in because more bad news could come out they could sustain um decline in car salale um other hiccups could emerge we could possibly see it set a new low well thank you both for diving into Tesla today we're going to continue to follow Tesla in this news right here at marketbeat but for now happy investing,1.0,-0.8

MarketBeat,mv-8X1kYUVc,2024-07-24T12:48:17Z,Meta's Growth and the Case for a Stock Split,Meta Platforms,so I think meta platforms is another good choice to watch. this is a leading tech company that's evolving into a more mature technology company. it's evolving from its its Legacy business which was Facebook into more advanced and expanded territories. the story really starts about a year and a half ago go when Zuckerberg leaned into efficiency. they refocused on the Facebook platform. they've increased use and engagement ads and revenue and margins. they've been able to sustain this performance because of AI. they really had a game-changing year in 2023. growth is accelerating this year. this is seen in the cash flow and the profits that led to the first dividend ever which is a huge a huge buying point for investors. and right now analysts are leading it higher. they're leading it up into the5 to $600 dollar range. I expect their High into their range to continue to increase this year which definitely puts the stock in a Range where I would expect to see a split not to say that it's guaranteed but it certainly um a stock to watch. right now I'm not so sure about whether or not MediCal split I agree with Thomas I was noticing the analysts have been bidding bidding meta up higher. one thing that I'll I think investors really should be watching is Thomas mentioned that like about a year ago meta got a lot of traction because they leaned into efficiency and then all of a sudden last quarter they made announcement that they were going to be increasing their capex spending in the metaverse again and that sort of has made the stock get a little bit choppy in the last three months. I'll be curious to hear what they say when they report earnings this time if they get more push back if they continue to have this type of spending I wonder if that may be more fuel for a stocks but to try to get more volume into the stock. yeah I think the the increase in capex is certainly playing into the long game for this stock um they're going to be focusing on AI and their virtual reality which is really the the next phase the next evolution of the AI and the internet that's coming plays into the metaverse. so I would certainly expect to see analyst continue to to bid the stock up of course that is assuming that they continue to perform well.,1.0,0.75

MarketBeat,RvajxAbl45I,2024-07-22T04:00:35Z,Cintas: Massive Growth and Upcoming Stock Split,Cintas,this company to me is the poster child of the best investment that you could ever buy campaign now Thomas here's what we want to know which stock tops your watch list for a potential stock split that's on the horizon well the top of my list is Centos but Centos has already announced a 4 for one split it won't come out until September or October I think but cintos is a great example of what I've been talking about this company to me is the poster child of the best investment that you could ever buy campaign all right it's started small they've got good management they're foresightful and have the long game in mind they're consolidating a fractured Market that is still ongoing they've got a fortress balance sheet they're self-funding their growth they've got super low leverage and ample free cash flow uh share repurchases support the value and the share price you've got dividends dividend health and distribution growth to help support the share price distribution growth is in the high triple digits over the last 30 years we're talking like a 6 or 700% increase in the average dividend payment in this stock the share price oh my gosh it's up 80% in two years 350% since 2020 and over 800% since I started covering it that's the kind of gains that you see in these stocks now Centos has had bad times surely but for sightful management the commitment to Quality and sharehold holder value has carried them through the bad times and you can clearly see that in the share price so we've got a 4 for one stock split coming up that puts the market in alignment with the 2020 lows to me that's a great number psychologically I'm sure it's a number that they considered when they were deciding what to do um if you look at this chart it is going parabolic even with all the splits I think that this split is just going to extend that parabolic move and continue to see the share price move higher yeah an interesting thing with cintos is they report earnings on the 18th of July and that's going to be I think a really critical um inflection point if you're a Trader and you're looking to get in on the stock whether you get on in on it before the split or after because right now you've got I think it was Royal Bank of Canada came out with a fairly bullish price Target increase from their current price and if they deliver on solid earnings you could start seeing analysts start bidding up this stock and then the question comes in it might be more advantageous for Traders to get in prior to the split as opposed to waiting to get in at that lower price because that lower price may be moving up um right by the time they split in September yeah Centos result should be solid all right labor market data is solid the labor market is still growing Centos is still deepening penetration of clients um they're growing at high single low double digit Pace I think this year they've been widening margins they've got ample cash flow so and unless that there's some deterioration in the labor market which is not seen in the data this stock should produce a very good report,1.0,1.0

MarketBeat,x62sIQGRGjc,2024-07-18T19:28:32Z,3 Top Market Leaders Splitting Their Stocks,Cintas,well the top of my list is Centos but Centos has already announced a 4 for one split it won't come out until September or October I think but Centos is a great example of what I've been talking about this company to me is the poster child of the best investment that you could ever buy campaign all right it's started small they've got good management they're foresightful and have the long game in mind they're consolidating a fractured Market that is still ongoing they've got a fortress balance sheet they're self-funding their growth they've got super low leverage and ample free cash flow uh share repurchases support the value and the share price you've got dividends dividend health and distribution growth to help support the share price distribution growth is in the high triple digits over the last 30 years we're talking like a six or 700% increase in the average dividend payment in this stock the share price oh my gosh it's up 80% in two years 350% since 20 20 and over 800% since I started covering it that's the kind of gains that you see in these stocks now Centos has had bad times surely but foresightful management the commitment to Quality and shareholder value has carried them through the bad times and you can clearly see that in the share price so we've got a 4- for one stock split coming up that puts the market in alignment with the 20120 lows to me that's a great number psychologically I'm sure it's a number that they considered when they were deciding what to do um if you look at this chart it is going parabolic even with all the splits I think that this split is just going to extend that parabolic move and continue to see the share price move higher yeah interesting thing with cintos is they report earnings on the 18th of July and that's going to be I think a really critical um inflection point if you're a Trader and you're looking to get in on the stock whether you get on in on it before the split or after because right now you've got I think it was Royal Bank of Canada came out with a fairly bullish price Target increase from their current price and if they deliver on solid earnings you could start seeing analysts start bidding up this stock and then the question comes in it might be more advantageous for Traders to get in prior to the split as opposed to waiting to get in at that lower price because that lower price may be moving up um by the time they split in September yeah Centos result should be solid all right labor market data is solid the labor market is still growing Centos is still deepening penetration of clients um they're growing at high single low double digit Pace I think this year they've been widening margins they've got ample cash flow so unless that there's some deterioration in the labor market which is not seen in the data this stock should produce a very good report,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,x62sIQGRGjc,2024-07-18T19:28:32Z,3 Top Market Leaders Splitting Their Stocks,Microsoft,one of the stocks that I noticed that Tom Thomas had in his article was Microsoft and I think they're an interesting choice right now um when you're talking about technology stocks which had been all the rage this year or continued to be all the r this year Microsoft's playing all the hits I mean they've got software they've got gaming they've got the cloud uh there's going to be there might be some rotation happening out of the tech sector but people aren't going to go very far away from Microsoft heavily owned by the institutions um that may be one reason why the stock may be approaching that level where they may want to split they have a history of doing that uh they've split nine times in their history but the last time they did it was 203 so that's been over 20 years ago and in 20 years the um the stocks averaged a total return of about 17 a half% so that's that's impressive it also means that they may be long overdue for a split I don't know it it's one that I think investors should certainly be watching for right to me Microsoft is a phoenix it's risen from the grave so many times it made the Shi from gates to nadela was a software company then internet company then a cloud company the internet infrastructure company now it's an AI company so it's just growing and growing and growing with the times it cemented its position as as a critical leading Blue Chip tech company um so yeah I see the the the analysts are leading the market higher right now up into that range where a stock split is definitely possible,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,x62sIQGRGjc,2024-07-18T19:28:32Z,3 Top Market Leaders Splitting Their Stocks,Meta Platforms,so I think meta platforms is another good choice to watch this is a leading tech company that's evolving into a more mature technology company it's evolving from its its Legacy business which was Facebook into more advanced an expanded territory the story really starts about a year and a half ago when Zuckerberg leaned into efficiency they refocused on the Facebook platform they've increased use and engagement ads and revenue and margins they've been able to sustain this performance because of AI they really had a game changing year in 2023 growth is accelerating this year this is seen in the cash flow and the profits that led to the first dividend ever which is a huge a huge buying point for investors and right now an are leading it higher they're leading it up into the $5 to $600 range I expect their High into their range to continue to increase this year which definitely puts the stock in a Range where I would expect to see a split not to say that it's guaranteed but it certainly um a stock to watch right now I'm not so sure about whether or not meta will split I agree with Thomas I was noticing the analysts have been bidding bidding meta up higher one thing that I'll I think investors really should be watching is Thomas mentioned that like about a year ago meta got a lot of traction because they leaned into efficiency and then all of a sudden last quarter they made announcement that they were going to be increasing their capex spending in the metaverse again and that sort of has made the stock get a little bit choppy in the last three months I'll be curious to hear what they say when they report earnings this time if they get more push back if they continue to have this type of spending I wonder if that may be more fuel for a stock split to try to get more volume into the stock yeah I think the the increase in capex is certainly playing into the long game for this stock um they're going to be focusing on AI and their virtual reality which is really the the next phase the next evolution of the AI and the internet that's coming plays into the metaverse so I would certainly expect to see analysts continue to to bid the stock up of course that is assuming that they continue to perform well,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,w3rpFen8ifc,2024-07-17T14:22:46Z,CPI Impact: Why Costco & Walmart Are Winning,Costco,uh two names that I would be looking at right now are Costco and Walmart. in the case of Costco uh there was just the announcement they were going to be increasing their membership fee this has been something that's been kind of an Open Secret for a long time the CEO kind of even said we're going to do it but I'm not telling you when well now they are uh the thing is that they have over a 90% retention with their subscribers so most likely people are not going to bulk at paying the extra for the membership fee and that goes right to the company's bottom line so that's a good reason to be looking at Costco right now. I like that Costco pick for the membership fees going straight to the bottom line it will help them build their cast position and help usher in that next special dividend a little bit quicker,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,w3rpFen8ifc,2024-07-17T14:22:46Z,CPI Impact: Why Costco & Walmart Are Winning,Walmart,uh two names that I would be looking at right now are Costco and Walmart. with Walmart the announce they recently made an announcement where they're going to be opening up five automated distributions centers now everybody hears about Automation and it's really cool with AI and stuff but Walmart's not just doing this because it's the cool thing to do they're doing it because there's Rising labor costs right now this is a way for Walmart to do that that's not necessarily good news for the labor force but it's really good news if you're a Walmart shareholder because again this is something that's going to be um something that's going to be benefiting the company on the bottom line,1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,7-Mjm7GPsEs,2024-07-15T13:38:11Z,Meta Stock's AI Strategy: Investor Insights,Meta,just when investors were kind of finally getting really bullish on meta they made an announcement that they were increasing their spend on the AI business. Okay so we've talked about Amazon we've talked about Apple then there's meta that has been one of the mag seven picks since the very start does the social media giant still have some upside potential for the rest of the year here I think it does. um one of the issues that I brought up in my article was you know just when investors were kind of finally getting really bullish on meta they made an announcement that they were increasing their spend on the AI business. I don't think that's necessarily a problem but I think that fa that meta has had problems before with costs getting out of control a lot of money they spent on the metaverse investors didn't see a lot of return on that investment. I think that's kind of a pro it thing for them plus there is that um there is those regul lators in the UK that are now not liking uh meta's pay forplay idea with Instagram. It's a little I'm a little hesitant on chasing this one Higher right now but certainly if they if they make these if they prove it to investors it's going to go higher. all right Thomas Chris is hesitant to chase this one Higher what about you I think that uh meta investors may be climbing a wall of worry there are certainly some headwinds here but I think that uh Zuckerberg made a clear statement last year when they shipped it to the year of efficiency they've significantly cut cost they've kind of trimmed back where they're burning cash so they can focus it on where the money is really producing results uh they are spending more money this year but they're also still expected to grow the analysts are leading the market higher it's on the verge of a break breakout right now I think that the upcoming report could spur that breakout it could also cause a little bit of a pullback if it's not really a blowout I don't expect any amount of weakness may not have any outperformance but if we get a pullback on the results that would certainly be a time to get into this stock.,1.0,0.2

MarketBeat,XgthyYemPDI,2024-07-15T01:54:18Z,Pelosi’s Major June Stock Moves: Broadcom & Beyond,Broadcom,Pelosi's other major stock purchases in June one of those is broadcom uh Chris Thomas just how significant of a purchase did she make in this company she purchased options on broadcom with an exercise price of $800 and an expiration date of June 20th of 2025 again it doesn't say how many uh how many options they purchased or what the total amount of the purchase was but that was what the that's the general gist of the trade yeah that's another one in the one to five million ranges so it's it's it's another big trade um I think it's interesting because it's another chip stock she's certainly playing the chip sector she's playing Ai and with broadcom she's also playing Apple which is also an AI play so I see broadcom is kind of this conglomeration of simis Ai and apple all wrapped up into one little bundle yep now one thing I was a little bit curious about is that broadcom also recently announced a quarterly dividend that was paid out late last month uh do you think that has any role in Pelosi's decision to invest I mean I'm sure it does but it's it's not a huge dividend and it's not anything that's Gna make somebody say oh I've got to have broadcom versus some other dividend stock but in the scheme of investing in in these tech stocks it may have that may have played a role for them yeah I I kind of I kind of think it's more along the lines of you know you I look back on the Nvidia purchase they made and they did that before the split was announced now they do this with broadcom before the splits announced um we can talk about what that might mean and that kind of smells a little bit but that seems to be where they're going here they're playing the idea of getting into the stock before it splits right let's not forget that I think it was Bank of America has done some research and shown that over time stocks that split or companies that split their stock more than double the annual performance of the S&P 500 and you got to think that companies that are splitting their stock are doing it because of their's demand for their stock the prices are being pushed higher and that's because it's they're good companies you don't split the stock on a Bad Company those companies are doing reverse splits to support their price they're not trying to bring their price down make it more accessible like you know broadcom is done,1.0,0.6

MarketBeat,LW202wcfXmo,2024-07-11T22:55:19Z,CPI News Breakdown: Key Market Moves to Follow,Costco,two names that I would be looking at right now are Costco and Walmart uh one reason is the same for both of them and the other reason is a little bit different the the reason that's the same is because right now consumers have to be putting their money somewhere and that's going to be likely to be in feeding their families that they've got to eat and these are places that clearly the revenue and the earnings have been showing that consumers are still willing to spend their money at these locations so that's the common reason between the two where where I see a little bit of a unique case for each one is in the case of Costco uh there was just the announcement they were going to be increasing their membership fee this has been something that's been kind of an Open Secret for a long long time the CEO kind of even said we're going to do it but I'm not telling you when well now they are uh the thing is that they have over a 90% retention with their subscribers so most likely people are not going to bulk at paying the extra for the membership fee and that goes right to the company's bottom line so that's a good reason to be looking at Costco right now. I like that Costco pick for the membership fees going straight to the bottom line it will help them build their cast position and help usher in that next special dividend a little bit quicker yep.,1.0,0.95
MarketBeat,LW202wcfXmo,2024-07-11T22:55:19Z,CPI News Breakdown: Key Market Moves to Follow,Walmart,two names that I would be looking at right now are Costco and Walmart uh one reason is the same for both of them and the other reason is a little bit different the the reason that's the same is because right now consumers have to be putting their money somewhere and that's going to be likely to be in feeding their families that they've got to eat and these are places that clearly the revenue and the earnings have been showing that consumers are still willing to spend their money at these locations so that's the common reason between the two where where I see a little bit of a unique case for each one is in the case of Costco ... with Walmart the announce they recently made an announcement where they're going to be opening up five automated distribution centers now everybody hears about Automation and it's really cool with AI and such but Walmart is not just doing this because it's the cool thing to do they're doing it because there's Rising labor costs right now this is a way for Walmart to do that that's not necessarily good news for the labor force but it's really good news if you're a Walmart shareholder because again this is something that's going to be um something that's going to be benefiting the company on the bottom line.,1.0,0.95

MarketBeat,R8zoj4JDzAA,2024-07-10T14:13:08Z,Inside Pelosi's Latest Stock Moves,Palo Alto Networks,well I think one of her biggest most recent Investments was her purchase of Palo Alto networks back in February she made two purchases one right before the company release earnings and one right after and I believe it was like a 25 or a 30% stock price implosion so that second purchase she bought on the dip so that's her doubling down on a position she's already losing money on I think that's pretty telling uh that they're expecting her and her husband are expecting Palo Alto networks to continue to improve over the coming years and I think that's what we see in the paloalto networks news they've been uh leaning real hard into platformization and trying to solidify their leading position in cyber security and I think that we've already seen some results as far as as those efforts go,1.0,0.6

MarketBeat,R8zoj4JDzAA,2024-07-10T14:13:08Z,Inside Pelosi's Latest Stock Moves,Nvidia,"Well there's no surprise that we're going to talk about Nvidia quickly in this video but uh Nancy Pelosi is sticking by her bet on Nvidia buying even more shares of the company this past month right yeah she did and it's not a small trade I wouldn't say that she's a Super Active Trader but she is certainly a whale when it comes to the Senate she's making trades in the range of 1 million to5 million when a lot of other Congressional members are making trades in the $10,000 $15,000 range this is definitely a big deal coming from her yeah and let's keep in mind that this trade that she made in late June is is not the first big uh big trade that they've made on Nvidia back in November of last year um they bought deep call options on Nvidia before the uh before the stock split happened so they've been they've been uh capitalizing on this stock for quite a while oh yeah yeah the options they bought last year I think the stock price went up a th% yeah that's a pretty good amount of Leverage that they've gotten on that position now a lot of investors have made a purchase Nvidia this past summer do you think Pelosi's share purchase of the stock is surprising or does it provide some other insights for investors at all I don't know that it's surprising but it's kind of telling you can see that when she bought in late June they bought on the dip that dip established a higher level of support not just for her but for the market in general analysts are still leading Nvidia higher I think that the Pelosi and the market in general are expecting Nvidia stock to continue Rising this year right",1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,R8zoj4JDzAA,2024-07-10T14:13:08Z,Inside Pelosi's Latest Stock Moves,Broadcom,Pelosi's other major stock purchase in June one of those is broadcom uh Chris Thomas just how significant of a purchase did she make in this company she purchased options on broadcom with an exercise price of $800 and an expiration date of June 20th of 2025 again it doesn't say how many uh how many options they purchased or what the total amount of the purchase was but that was what the that's the general gist of the trade yeah that's another one in the one to five million range of so it's it's it's another big trade um I think it's interesting because it's another chip stock she's certainly playing the chip sector she's playing Ai and with broadcom she's also playing Apple which is also an AI play so I see broadcom is kind of this conglomeration of Sims Ai and apple all wrapped up into one little bundle yep now one thing I was a little bit curious about is that broadcom also recently announced a quarterly dividend that was paid out late last month uh do you think that has any role in 's decision to invest I mean I'm sure it does but it's it's not a huge dividend and it's not anything that's going to make somebody say oh I've got to have broadcom versus some other dividend stock but in the scheme of investing in um in these tech stocks it may have that may have played a role for them yeah I I kind of I kind of think it's more along the lines of you know you I look back on the Nvidia purchase they made and they did that before the was announced now they do this with broadcom before the split's announced um we can talk about what that might mean and that kind of smells a little bit but that seems to be where they're going here they're playing the idea of getting into the stock before it splits right let's not forget that I think it was Bank of America has done some research and shown that over time stocks that split or companies that split their stock more than double the annual performance of the S&P 500 Y and you got to think that companies that are splitting their stock are doing it because of their's demand for their stock the prices are being pushed higher and that's because it's they're good companies you don't split the stock on a Bad Company those companies are doing reverse splits to support their price they're not trying to bring their price down to make it more accessible like right you know broadcom has done,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,R8zoj4JDzAA,2024-07-10T14:13:08Z,Inside Pelosi's Latest Stock Moves,Tesla,all right guys let's get into pel's two big stock offloads this last month the first we're going to discuss is a big name in the EV world what information do you have for us on that yeah she's selling Tesla I think that uh from what Chris and I were talking about before it looks like they're they're trimming a position that they bought years ago and as we've been saying the Pelosi like to use a lot of options so they bought some Tesla options years ago they've exercised them they're sitting on this position now they're triming some profits it looks like now now does uh her Tesla selloff does this do this mean it's an indicator about the EV industry as a whole or is it specifically a reaction to Tesla's recent moves I think it's mostly a reaction to Tesla's recent moves they're certainly have been having a a struggle this year with sales but uh they're turning a corner um they're teasing about having a cheaper Model come out right and they've got some new technologies they're working on so uh this recent Rebound in the Tesla stock is more of a on Elon Musk I think more than Tesla but we'll see how it goes,1.0,-0.1
MarketBeat,R8zoj4JDzAA,2024-07-10T14:13:08Z,Inside Pelosi's Latest Stock Moves,Visa,"all right well let's get to Pelosi's final Market move in June she's sold off uh 2,000 Visa shares what are your thoughts on this move just looking at the chart I mean it looks like she may have sold at the bottom the right time if you're going to say to sell would have been in March when it was at an all-time high or even in May but um there's they've had a couple of other sales back in 2022 that didn't really correlate to any significant price movement I'm not I'm not sure if there's any really big thing here other than they they may have just been trimming a position and it's a good reminder of why sometimes Insider buying is more telling than Insider selling but that that's what I could see all right so this is the space where Chris and I are going to diverge in our opinions okay I'm looking at the chart and I'm seeing a top I'm seeing a significant selloff just the last two or three weeks that took the market below the 30-day and the 150-day moving averages what I'm looking at right now is a market top with a move below critical support compounded by a death cross I think that I think Visa might be selling off I think this might have been a very smart move on their part I think if we consider the economic conditions right now and high inflation and high interest rates and the idea of higher for longer consumer spending is getting pinched and Visa is the king of consumer transactions your consumer transactions are going to start fall fall in off Visa's results are going to start falling off and that would be a very great reason to sell the stock so you're saying they instead of it being a bottom where I was saying it looked kind of like a bottom you're saying they're selling it before it goes even further down I mean I'm not saying it's not the bottom but what I'm seeing in the chart is a bearish setup that could lead to a much deeper selloff okay good to know and then the speculation part being you know consumers are being squeezed we have inflation we have high interest rates uh consumer spending has hasn't really been robust it's still expanding but it's not really leading the retail sector I mean we have volume declines are being offset by inflation right now still uh so that's what I'm seeing",1.0,-0.7

MarketBeat,N4tEt6CpzDQ,2024-07-03T12:30:24Z,Trump Media Stock: Key Insights for Investors,Trump Media & Technology Group,knowing what I do about Trump I have to say that I think he is involved with the decisions whether or not the execs want him to be but I think generally speaking he's like a figurehead he's the face of the company. Trump media and Technology Group saw major changes all last week we're here to talk about it Chris Thomas let's start with a quick look back at what's behind all the recent activity for the stock fill us in here well there's a there's a lot of news to drive this stock this is definitely a meme quality stock um but for the past week there's really three things that had been driving the market and that was the exercise of warrants uh allowed the company to raise some money and impacted some delusion. now what exactly does djt do can you share a little bit of a background on this company for as a whole maybe for some of us that aren't as familiar with this sure that that's a good place to to start Lacy so Trump media and Technology Group which trades under the symbol djt it's the parent company for the social media platform truth social and that's the simplest way for investors to understand that and the reason why I say that is because I think if you're looking at the stock from the perspective of an of an investor that's what you're investing in you're investing in a social media platform there's really not a lot of information that investors have to go off of it's only some had um one earnings report since going public company doesn't make that much revenue it's not profitable um and there were some concerns if you look at it again as an investor in their last earnings report it's saying that they're having trouble um solidifying their base of users and that they're not really sure um if how that trend is going to go if uh if Donald Trump decides that true social is not going to be the exclusive platform that he's you know posting content on right he's a pretty important for the business he's pretty Central to everything that they do. Thomas that's actually what I wanted to ask what kind of role does Trump play in it he's essential as you're saying but is he leading it is he involved in the business decisions or how does that kind of play out well knowing what I do about Trump I have to say that I think he is involved with the decisions whether or not the execs want him to be but I think generally speaking he's like a figurehead he's the face of the company he's not really involved with the operations he might come up with some ideas that he wants people to follow but there's a team of other people who job it is to actually make this company work.,1.0,-0.25

MarketBeat,21musRrZFdc,2024-07-02T14:20:56Z,Why DJT Stock is So Unpredictable,DJT (Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.),so we've got a meme quality stock with a low float and a high short interest with a reactionary volatile news environment so what you're going to get is a lot of volatility so we know a lot of stocks tend to react to the news of the day but djt really is unique in just how reactionary it can be on a given day uh tell us more about that well right the the market volatility has a lot to do with the ownership and in this case uh Donald Trump owns most of the company like I think at least 50% Chris said I think maybe close to 60% but quite a bit amount of the of the company yeah was really a low float stock only a small amount of the stock has been floated on the market and when you look at the short interest the short interest compared to the number of shares allowed is like one or two% but the short interest compared to the float is like 10 or 12% so it's also a highly shorted stock so we've got a mean quality stock with a low float and a high short interest with a reactionary volatile news environment so what you're going to get is a lot of volatility up and down movements y so there is a lot of volatility as we know kind of with any mem stock but are we going to be seeing any positive swings for DJ djt or is there more just of that back and forth as you mentioned depending on the headline of the day yeah I think you're going to see a lot of back and forth with this stock I mean that's that's the that's kind of the um that's kind of where the stock kind of gives itself up as far as who's really Trading in it right now. what's happening with it is clearly happening because of the events of the day uh when the uh ruling in the New York trial came out um stock went down since then it's been ticking back up um and it tick back up sharply last week after the after the debate it's it's really being driven by how investors what investors perceive about Donald Trump. yeah right it's a very good point the stock market is not tied to fundamentals it's tied to a news cycle and an image of Donald Trump there's a lot of Market mechanics involved with it not so much fundamentals y um I wouldn't expect to see too much difference other than volatility within this range until the company starts to exhibit at least Revenue growth if not some better profitability so we can maybe agree that there's not any actual business moves here it's just that kind of reaction to the news. and so again as an investor it's it's hard to get a grip on what the company is right and they're trying to get involved in U I think streaming TV content as well.,1.0,-0.3
MarketBeat,21musRrZFdc,2024-07-02T14:20:56Z,Why DJT Stock is So Unpredictable,Truth Social,if you are trading if you investing in the stock because of Truth social there's really no reason to explain a lot of the price movement that's happening with it right now. not necessarily what it perceives about true social. absolutely yeah I think it's too early to tell what TR social is going to be.,1.0,-0.2

MarketBeat,ztCETG_Ox_4,2024-07-01T18:47:44Z,Trump Media Stock Surges on Debate & Legal Drama,Trump Media and Technology Group,the market volatility has a lot to do with the ownership and in this case uh Donald Trump owns most of the company it was another wild week for Trump media and Technology as the stock once again reacts to a busy news cycle for the former president and current candidate but it's likely just the beginning let's dive in from a cash exercise announcement to a presidential debate Trump media and Technology Group saw major changes all last week we're here to talk about it Chris Thomas let's start with a quick look back at what's behind all the recent activity for the stock fill us in here well there's a there's a lot of news to drive this stock this is definitely a meme quality stock um but for the past week there's really three things that had been driving the market and that was the exercise of warrants uh allowed the company to raise some money and impacted some delusion there was the presidential debate which certainly gave people a reason to believe one candidate or the other was more likely to win and then there was a a scotus decision whether or not Donald Trump could be held liable for some things that he's done and said but he got some partial partial immunity to that and in general the Market's responding pretty favorably it looks like now what exactly does djt do can you share a little bit of a background on this company for as a whole maybe for some of us that aren't as familiar with this sure that that's a good place to to start Lacy so Trump media and Technology Group which trades under the symbol djt it's the parent company for the social media platform truth social and that's the simplest way for investors to understand that and the reason why I say that is because I think if you're looking at the stock from the perspective of an of an investor that's what you're investing in you're investing in a social media platform there's really not a lot of information that investors have to go off of it's only had um one earnings report since going public company doesn't make that much revenue it's not profitable um and there were some concerns if you look at it again as an investor in their last earnings report it's saying that they're having trouble um solidifying their base of users and that they're not really sure um if how that trend is going to go if uh if Donald Trump decides that true social is not going to be the exclusive plat form that he's you know posting content on right he's a pretty important for the business he's pretty Central to everything that they do yeah and Thomas that's actually what I wanted to ask what kind of role does Trump play in it he's essential as you're saying but is he leading it is he involved in the business decisions or how does that kind of play out well knowing what I do about Trump I have to say that I think he is involved with the decisions whether or not the execs want him to be but but I think generally speaking he's like a figurehead he's the face of the company he's not really involved with the operations he might come up with some ideas that he wants people to follow but there's a team of other people whose job it is to actually make this company work all right well whatever his role is the company seems to react daily to anything that the former president does and we're going to dive into that in just a moment so we know a lot of stocks tend to react to the news of the day but djt really is unique in just how reactionary can be on a given day uh tell us more about that well right the the market volatility has a lot to do with the ownership and in this case Donald Trump owns most of the company like I think at least 50% Chris had I think maybe close of 60% but quite a bit amount of the of the company yeah was really a lowf float stock only a small amount of the stock has been floated on the market and when you look at the short interest the short interest compared to the number of shares allowed is like one or two% but the short interest compared to the float is like 10 or 12% so it's also a highly shorted stock so we've got a meme quality stock with a low float and a high short interest with a reactionary volatile news environment so what you're going to get is a lot of volatility up and down movements y so there is a lot of volatility as we know kind of with any meme stock but are we going to be seeing any positive swings for DJ djt or is there more just of that back and forth as you mentioned depending on the headline of the day yeah I think you're going to see a lot of back and forth with this stock I mean that's that's the that's kind of the um that's kind of where the stock kind of gives itself up as far as who's really trading in it right now if you were trading if you were investing in the stock because of Truth social there's really no reason to explain a lot of the price movement that's happening with it right now what's happening with it is clearly happening because of the events of the day uh when the ruling in the New York trial came out um stock went down since then it's been ticking back up um and it ticked back up sharply last week after the after the debate it's it's really being driven by how investors what investors perceive about Donald Trump not necessarily what it perceives about true social yeah right it's a very good point the stock market is not tied to fundamentals it's tied to a news cycle and an image of Donald Trump there's a lot of Market mechanics involved with it not so much fundamentals y um I wouldn't expect to see too much difference other than volatility within this range until the company starts to to exhibit at least Revenue growth if not some better profitability so we can maybe agree that there's not any actual business moves here it's just that kind of reaction to the news absolutely yeah I think it's too early to tell what truth social is going to be and so again as an investor it's it's hard to get a grip on what the company is right and they're trying to get involved in uh I think streaming TV content as well I agree I think there's like two different platforms along that way djt plus I think it was called something like that so yeah there's definitely some uh there's some questions up in the air what's going to happen well the streaming services aspect of that will be on our radar is there anything else that investors interested and maybe buying djt should be prepared for um I don't see a lot of Market conviction in this stock there's no analysts covering it the institutions are not involved with it so until that happens um I really think that this stock will remain range bound and that investors should EXP some pretty large swings and just talking about the swings and the volatility using beta as a reference this stock has a 6X beta which means it moves six times as much as the S&amp;P 500 has since it's been ipoed that's that's huge I mean if the market crashes people invested in this stock are going to lose their bottoms I mean that's just for a lot of the reasons Thomas just said I think it's really hard to justify anybody taking a long position in the stock I as far as a trade I suppose people could look at it and take a short position if you think that um Donald Trump will exercise his option in September and sell some of his stock but even if you were going to think about going short I don't know Thomas I mean are you thinking you'd have to look wait for the stock to go up to about what $50 yeah anybody that wants to try to buy in or sell in to this Market to try to make capture some of those volatile gains needs to really Target um support and resistance levels you need to wait for these levels to be exceeded you need to wait for uh for signals to be given because even if it goes down to the bottom of the range and you expect a rebound there's nothing saying that it's GNA rebound um right well a lot of risk here and a lot for investors to consider thanks for breaking it all down for us today guys we're going to continue to follow the highs lows of this stock throughout the election season and Beyond until then Happy investing,1.0,-0.5

MarketBeat,ee6YH5x9IuQ,2024-07-01T14:29:38Z,MarketBeat’s Levitt Sponsorship,MarketBeat,our partnership with Market beat is a powerful example of how when local business businesses invest in the Arts they ignite a chain reaction of Goodwill growth and Community engagement that benefits us all. that's what community engagement means to us at Market be. every concert that's played at the LoveIt shell echos our commitment to su falls strengthening bonds celebrating culture and creating a vibrant downtown that everybody can enjoy we heard that the previous sponsor was going to give up the title sponsorship and it became available so once we heard that was going to happen we were excited to have a conversation with Nancy and her team as to whether or not we could fill that role and of course we did end up filling that role and now markip be will be the lead sponsor for the next four years. our relationship with markip bead started in 2019 with our very first concert season when I was desperately trying to get the word out to our community about what the levit would bring Matt was one of those people who graciously opened his doors and said well come in and tell me about it and then of course this past year when Matt said I want to be the presenting sponsor that was a huge moment for us. we couldn't do this expansion without the support of our great Community Partners like Matt and our friends here at Market beat so we're looking forward to celebrating that new addition and all of the expansion that the future will bring. markip B does exceptionally well financially but one thing that I recognize is that money is no good to you after you're gone so we are trying to do as much of our giving possible while markab is here and we're here to see our giving an action.,1.0,0.95
MarketBeat,ee6YH5x9IuQ,2024-07-01T14:29:38Z,MarketBeat’s Levitt Sponsorship,Levitt Sioux Falls,our love for the levit has really only grown over time partnering with the levit isn't really about getting our company name out there it's really more about breathing life into the heart of sou Falls and bringing people together through music and culture. through a series of 50 free concerts every summer we seek to bring our community together in a space that is welcoming to everyone here in sou Falls. the levit venue is actually built on an area of our downtown that was really not usable for a long time and then the levit came in and transformed this underused green space into a beautiful welcoming venue for everyone. seeing the joy and the unity at loveed events and knowing we had a part in helping make these events happen that's what community engagement means to us at Market be. every concert that's played at the LoveIt shell echos our commitment to su falls strengthening bonds celebrating culture and creating a vibrant downtown that everybody can enjoy. our relationship with markip bead started in 2019 with our very first concert season when I was desperately trying to get the word out to our community about what the levit would bring. our sponsor ship of the levit is just one of many ways that we do that so that sou Falls is a great place to live work and play. When the levit was built in 2019 it was hard to know how we would be using the venue and it was hard to know what the vision would be how our community would respond to what we were bringing forward since that time it's been incredibly successful our attendance has exceeded all expectations and our programming has grown exponentially so we are looking forward to an expansion of our building that will allow allow us to host even more artists and to have all kinds of community activity in the venue not only during the summer but really year round.,1.0,0.95
MarketBeat,GlhlvWtUA0E,2024-06-28T13:00:59Z,Volkswagen's $5 Billion Deal: Rivian Stock's Real Boost or Just a Bailout?,Volkswagen,I think this is ultimately going to turn out to be more of a Volkswagen story than a rivan story. rivan has had a soaring week on the stock market after a major investment announcement from Volkswagen. Volkswagen has agreed to invest up to five billion dollars in a new joint venture with rivan. rivan is helping VW with software. VW wants the software. I'm not sure if it legitimizes rivan in the eeve game as much as it maybe legitimizes Volkswagen right. Volkswagen wants the software so they can use that software for their own VW cars right. BW is investing in software for its EV not so much investing in rivan yes. does it make a difference that this money is coming from Volkswagen or would investors feel any type of way if it was coming from a different car maker. I mean I think it's it's it's helpful in the sense that they've had a partnership with Volkswagen so the fact that Volkswagen's willing to invest more in rivan is encouraging. is this new Volkswagen investment kind of a bit of a surprise at all given rivian's recent valuation struggles I mean yeah I I think it is because people are wondering why would Volkswagen sink money into this failing car company because they are struggling they're burning cash whether or not they can reach profitability is Highly Questionable it could be money down the drain except for the dealers for the software and Volkswagen wants the software so if they've invested in the company and they own some stock and whatever happens down the road they've got a vested interest in the software and that's what they're going to have no matter what happens. I I agree with where Thomas is going with this I think this is ultimately going to turn out to be more of a Volkswagen story than a rivan story.,1.0,0.2
MarketBeat,GlhlvWtUA0E,2024-06-28T13:00:59Z,Volkswagen's $5 Billion Deal: Rivian Stock's Real Boost or Just a Bailout?,Rivian,I think this is ultimately going to turn out to be more of a Volkswagen story than a rivan story. rivan has had a soaring week on the stock market after a major investment announcement from Volkswagen but is the surge here to stay or is it just a knee-jerk reaction to the news. Volkswagen has agreed to invest up to five billion dollars in a new joint venture with rivan. does this investment legitimize rivan as a player in the EV sector um I would say that it doesn't exactly legitimize them the deal isn't for rivian cars it's no change to rivian's operation and ultimately what's happening is rivan is helping VW with software. I'm not sure if it legitimizes rivan in the eeve game as much as it maybe legitimizes Volkswagen. BW is investing in software for its EV not so much investing in rivan yes so the cash makes sense on paper here but just how fruitful do you think this partnership is going to be well it's five billion at face value but only 1 billion up front right and uh it doesn't really help rivan so much I mean it gives them more Capital they've got a clear Runway towards reaching profitability but we're still years down the road before it makes profits and will it need more money probably yeah one thing that would concern me if I were a rivian investor in terms of a long-term investor is those followon Investments that are coming are based on Milestones that weren't necessarily clearly defined right and so it's kind of like well rivan as long as rivan meets those objectives the cash will flow but long-term investors don't really have a sense of what those objectives are that they have to hit right and uh the structure of the deal too the first billion is in warrants so it's dute you know it's going to dilute the value of the stock right. rivan saved from the EV graveyard for now uh but just how much of an impact has this partnership made on rivian's stock price this past week what have we been seeing in the news well this the stock popped I think it was like 60% on the news that was absolutely a knee-jerk reaction this stock is in a major downtrend the pop already hit resistance were down some today I think it's a sell the news event or bu the or sell the news yeah this doesn't change my overall thoughts on the EV Market. I want to dive into just significant rivan surges in a minute. rivan stock has seen a significant downward trend Trend since the start of this year is this new Volkswagen investment kind of a bit of a surprise at all given rivian's recent valuation struggles I mean yeah I I think it is because people are wondering why would Volkswagen sink money into this failing car company because they are struggling they're burning cash whether or not they can reach profitability is Highly Questionable it could be money down the drain except for the dealers for the software. I think this is ultimately going to turn out to be more of a Volkswagen story than a rivan story now back to the issues that rivan's been dealing with and kind of that whole Eevee graveyard as a whole are those issues just unique to rivan. I don't think the problems that are the broad problems in the EV sector are are unique driven at all and I don't I didn't want to make it seem earlier like I was burying rivan it these are sector problems that they have. rivan could follow suit right. so it's been a pretty good week for rivan but Chris Thomas what do you think about the long-term performance possibilities for this stock. I mean looking ahead okay they're getting this5 billion dollar um investment here but what after that I mean if if that doesn't work well for them are they just done are there going to be other opportunities what can we look forward to well I think the question whether or not rivan survives is still up in the air it'll be years before their cash runs out the question is if this cash injection will get them across the Finish Line as far as the stock price like I said it is in a downtrend they need to make money to get out of that downtrend and that's not going to happen for years. my initial thoughts upon hearing this is that I think this does set rivan up as far as being more of an attractive takeover target if and when and I think it's more a question of when the consolidation in the EV industry happens. now do you see investors are they going to be jumping into this stock now with this kind of surge happening or do you think um they're going to back out instead and maybe see how the partnership plays out over time yeah I wouldn't say that there are a lot of investors in the stock this is a Trader stock it's a meme stock it's a short seller stock um investors are looking for margins and cash flow and capital and profits.,1.0,-0.6

MarketBeat,JXUbtA-4V9c,2024-06-21T15:21:36Z,Microsoft Leads the Way in Summer Stock Rally,Microsoft,at the top of the list right now was Microsoft. Microsoft is the well for the quarter it's the number one constituent of the S&P 500. it's part and parcel to why I believe the S&P will rise another 15% by the year end and this is driven by Ai and the cloud when it comes to the stocks that are performing the best right now it is the Blue Chip Market leaders industry leaders and the themes in the market right now is a in Tech and Microsoft is the Blue Chip industry leader in Tech um it's not a chip stock like Nvidia but it is a leader in providing AI powered services but also in AI infrastructure for the rest of the industry. The last earnings report was awesome because of all of the major cross Cloud Partnerships that it's forming with companies like Oracle and Google which cements the idea that the Magnificent 7 the top seven largest market cap stocks in the S&P 500 will continue to move higher because they're the ones where all the AI money is going to they have the scale and the size and the power to follow through and that's where business is going with their money now obviously as you mentioned Microsoft is doing well but with so many new competitors in the AI Market is there a chance here that Microsoft's 12year streak as a golden Tech stock uh for investors could be coming to an end. I really don't think so and it just goes back to what I said before with AI and the cloud Microsoft is a leading player and in the cloud specifically it's emerging to be Head and Shoulders better than AWS and Google it's getting the most growth the fastest growth in Cloud infrastructure. I think that it has really entered a new game for itself it's reinvented itself again I think that uh this rally has legs and it's going to continue to maintain its position for quite some time yeah and don't forget that analysts right now are really bullish on Microsoft stock I mean I think it's gotten at least two uh two upgrades in the past week I know one of the price targets was 550 I think the other one might have even been a little bit higher so analysts are B the stock higher which is telling investors that they're expecting solid earnings from this company going forward this is a safe bet for any investor.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,CxQkGF-1e60,2024-06-20T20:19:53Z,NVIDIA Tops Microsoft and Apple for Most Valuable Company,NVIDIA,it's been a game-changing year Nvidia literally created a a new industry a new market with its chips. it's the only company that really was leaning into that Avenue with a full stack approach right from the beginning. Nvidia is now the largest US company when five years ago it wasn't even in the top 20. but Nvidia has finally become the world's most valuable company. what's truly remarkable to me at least is just how fast Nvidia Rose to this level especially when you're thinking about where the chipmaker was just a few years ago. Nvidia has created a brand new market with uh Ai and its chips. last year it was the fifth biggest company in the world just two years ago it was the 10th and five years it wasn't even on the charts in the top 20. the company's new position as the highest valued in the world mean maybe for current investors or new investors. I really want to get into Nvidia and now the price is where I want it to be that can cause more money to flow into the stock. would draw investors to the table for NVIDIA. now there's been quite a bit of news this week from some major ETFs switching billions of dollars from Apple to Nvidia. specifically for NVIDIA and apple what it would mean is that a lot of institutional holders will need to trim their apple positions put some pressure on that stock in order to buy some more Nvidia positions and help lift that stock higher. we've been seeing Apple Microsoft and Nvidia all vying for that top stock uh valued stock. all three of these companies or Nvidia you said Nvidia Apple Microsoft yeah they're all leading players in this AI race. it's not very common for a stock like Microsoft that has a three trillion dollar market cap to get caught by another stock that seemingly comes out of nowhere. all right guys so what does happen next in video is clearly continuing to sort but is the sky really the limit for this company I mean do you see any end to its growth or do you think it's possible that Nvidia is going to leave other companies behind set a new bar for what is the highest value company what does that look like right now. I think there's going to be a normalization with with Nvidia as AI moves away from Hardware more towards software but this the demand for Hardware is going to be there the only question is going to be when other companies like AMD start to start to make significant inroads into nvidia's market share. Nvidia is the only leading fullstack player so there's all about software and that's why they're getting the boots they've got the best chips but they've also got the software to power it and they're providing so many services to the AI industry in infrastructure and in AI services and apps and whatnot that it's just gonna it's just going to keep growing. nvidia's story has changed it's switching it's making a a shift the way Oracle shift it and Microsoft shifted from Legacy businesses to its new cloud-based Services business.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,asnaCOVI4t8,2024-06-19T13:45:25Z,3 Strong Buy Stocks for a Summer Surge,Broadcom,"I think there are some kind of sleeper plays and some plays that investors aren't really looking towards and inside the chip sector especially one of the ones I'm looking at is broadcom avgo uh they've got a great position with embedding AI into devices especially with apple and I think that they will have a market leading position for some time to come so with 43% growth in the last year it's easy to see why broadcom is one of your summer favorites uh but it does come with a hefty price tag we're talking over $1,700 um the company did announce a 10 for one stock split is coming in the future Chris is it better for investors to get in before the split or should they wait until the cost of Entry is more attainable okay so let's remind investors that you know a stock split's really just a mechanical move it doesn't it doesn't necessarily shouldn't affect a company's overall valuation but what it does change is how investors feel about a stock and that certainly has been the case broadcom announced their stocks split I think about a week ago I think it was around June 12th or something the Stock's up about 20% since then that's the effect that a stock split can have because investors believe that you're going to see higher earnings you're going to see higher Revenue they're bidding the stock higher now should you get involved the the what you have to think about is do you believe the stocks going to go much higher than it is prior to uh July 12th I think that's when the stock split takes effect right now that's a pretty big gap to fill I don't know if broadcom's going to go higher I'd be looking for a little bit of a pullback but I certainly could understand if an investor wanted it wanted to chase it a little bit higher right I agree with the the buy the dip Outlook you know broadcom is trending higher it should continue to Trend higher like Chris said the split really just affects sentiment it increases um ownership to some degree um but I want to point out that Nvidia just completed their stock split we had the same Outlook you know kind of wait to buy the dip maybe have a dip after the split but it didn't come that stock is still rocketing higher uh broadcom could do the same so it's no surprise that two out of three of your summer picks are from the booming tech industry Thomas is AI the only way to go this summer or are there other industries that are still expected to continue climbing",1.0,0.8

Cohen's Impact on GameStop Shareholders,GameStop,"there's some big pivot that's coming that Cohen's playing chess when the rest of us are playing checkers. They think that they know what Ryan Cohen's going to do and they don't. The only thing that I know that's happened is that that Cohen has done is dilute a lot of shareholder value. So you can point to the fact that the company has no debt right now but he's done that because he's duded sholder value right right right. Now I wanted to ask you about entry and exit points here but you both brought up Cohen so we need to dive a little bit deeper into that here quickly. What are your guys's thoughts on this you know sure maybe but again it's like can can can he buy a company and turn it into a business and literally change this video game store into something else and what would that be? I mean might he might he bring back the age of cyber cafes where people can go to GameStop and play video games on the internet because right now video games have gone to the cloud. I mean what else is they going to do? Yeah at this point I mean if you're holding GameStop shares you've got to believe that there's something else here, there's some big pivot that's coming that Cohen's playing chess when the rest of us are playing checkers.

MarketBeat,9n-YHaHmbe8,2024-06-17T16:26:05Z,Roaring Kitty's GameStop Gamble: What Went Wrong?,GameStop,today we're diving into the wild world of the GameStop Mania and the legendary roaring Kitty stick around because we're breaking this down welcome back everyone roaring Kitty also known as Keith Gil became a sensation by turning a modest investment into a mass massive payday with GameStop maybe it's a massive payday not not quite sure about that but as you know there's more to the story than just buying and holding with this Krist and Thomas I have you joining me today because I know you have a lot to say about this hot topic I think I know what Chris's argument is going to be right off the bat and that is fundamentals matter Chris why are fundamentals so important here even in the case of a mem stock like GameStop Hi Lacy yes I I do believe that fundamentals matter um at any time but particularly when markets are as volatile as they are right now um this is a time when investors should be looking to buy the best that they can to buy the best quality stocks and and forget the rest and I put GameStop in that category now I also understand that many people who are holding GameStop shares could care less about fundamentals but I think over time when you're looking at stocks that are going to perform well for the long term the fundamentals matter and the analogy Lacy I would use is this um there are a lot of different methods that people can use to lose weight and some of those are are very um fattish they're very sensationalistic it doesn't mean they don't work but over time people that get consistent results it's all about diet exercise calories in versus calories out the fundamental don't change and it's the same thing with the markets um and I think I'm not alone in that Don shares data with Thomas and I a lot about the type of stocks that marketbeat investors are in um and I see it on the market beat dashboard they're looking at a lot of the stocks that are strong in the fundamentals and are going to give share price growth and dividend growth over time right it it comes down to to profits you know fundamentals most important fundamental factor is profits you know profits companies that make profits are able to grow and their share prices will grow because the businesses are growing but then companies like GameStop that don't make profits are going to have their their share prices decline because their fundamentals are shrinking this company is eating itself to death it's sold a bunch of shares to make a bunch of money but it's not that's not profits or Revenue money it's just selling more shares it's going to burn that cash the balance Sheet's going to continue to to contract the way that it has been and that eventually will bring the stock price down now another crucial point is understanding why people invest or trade the lur of easy money and the thrill of price swings can be tempting uh but typically there's always a downside to that most people can't handle the volatility so it's always important to have a strategy there but when someone says this company is different it's usually a red flag uh what was it that roaring Kitty blatantly ignored here I guess to learn from this what should investors look out for to maybe avoid getting caught in this type of hype I don't think that roaring Kitty sorry Chris I don't think Rory kiding really ignored anything but the market did yeah you gotta remember roring Kitty wasn't really investing in fundamentals he orchestrated a short squeeze and that's why the stock became a meme stock way back in 2020 this most recent pop is I believe him just trying to reignite that short squeeze you know he may make you think that he's a fundamental Play Because GameStop can be turned around it hasn't for the last 10 years right a speculative play on Ryan Cohen spending this money to buy a new business but that's another giant what if speculation they tried to buy new businesses and to change the companies several times and have failed so I think the market is ignoring the fact that this really is not an investment it is a trade and it's somebody else's trade that right now appears to be unwinding in a bad way boy you know Lacy I know you hate it when I say this but boy Tom just took a lot of what I was going to say just words right out of my mouth what concerns me the most about what I see happening right now is you have a lot of investors following this thinking they know what RoR and kitty is going to do and I don't think they do they think that they know what Ryan Cohen's going to do and they don't the only thing that I know that's happened is that that Cohen has done is dilute a lot of shareholder value so you can point to the fact that the company has no debt right now but he's done that because he's diluted shareholder value right right right you know roran Kitty I've seen many articles explaining how he has really skirted the laws of Market manipulation he's not doing things that are illegal but he is absolutely 100% manipulating this market and be aware of that yep now I wanted to ask you about entry and exit points here but you both brought up Cohen so we need to dive a little bit deeper into that here quickly um waren Kitty has had a lot to say about Cohen what are your guys's thoughts on this you know sure maybe but again it's like can can can he buy a company and turn it into a business and literally change this video game store into something else and what would that be I mean might he might he bring back the age of cyber cafes where people can go to GameStop and play video games on the internet because right now video games have gone to the cloud I mean what else is they going to do yeah at this point I mean if you're holding GameStop shares you've got to believe that there's something else here there's some big pivot that's coming that Cohen's playing chess when the rest of us are playing checkers and you know what that could be exactly 100% the case I don't see it $4 billion do you know that he supposedly has in cash to play with that's not a lot in the big picture right well go ahead Thomas he is counting on the share prices to rise right because if he tries to start selling his stock NOW to capture this his his profits he will push the market lower he may end up causing himself to lose money so back to talking about entry and exit points we know that those are crucial especially in such volatile markets like this one uh what are your thoughts on how this has been approached with GameStop entry and exit points I don't think anybody really has good entry and exit points I mean there's good exit points because there are some clear lines of resistance on the chart you can see it uh the market did not get above where it got in 2020 and it has confirmed resistance at lower levels since then so there are definitely exit points I think the entry points are going to be kind of a a gamble in a guess like do you get the lowest low or do do you get a low do you make money do you lose money I mean it's it's it's that risky right now right now roaring Kitty owns what 9 million shares more than six million ion in cash I think the latest that I read uh what's the real reason you don't think he's sold and taken advantage of the volatility how did he get into this current position exactly well like again I think that he was expecting from what I'm seeing I think he was expecting the share price to move higher and to stay higher so that he could hold these things to expiration and then exercise and sell the stock and make a lot more money than he's going to be making right now right now the stock price is way down from its low so he's not going to get quite the the the profit that he might have gotten if he had sold out at the peak when the shares were trading at like $80 so what would the quote unquote right way for investors to kind of identify how to navigate these volatile markets then if we aren't taking Rory K roring K's advice here um are there any specific tools or things that investors should watch out for well I'll be real quick and say that investors can navigate this Market by avoiding it and sticking with high quality stocks yeah that have an outlook for growth and pay dividends and buy back shares well GameStop story is one of incredible highs and dramatic lows are there any other lessons that you want to leave our viewers with today it's it's good entertainment yeah right well thank you everyone for tuning in to this hot

MarketBeat,JwLenifEayE,2024-06-12T11:35:32Z,Palantir Stock Excluded from S&P 500: Still a Buy?,Palantir Technologies,paler Technology stock may still be a buy despite being left out of the S&amp;P 500 this quarter let's talk about why welcome back everyone the news here is that paler was excluded from the S&amp;P 500 this announcement came last week and the immediate aftermath was a drop in its stock price now is this just a temporary setback or is it a long-term concern I mean this is the decision for now but it doesn't necessarily mean that be the decision forever uh Chris fill us in on the details of this okay so for those investors that may not be familiar with this uh every quarter of the S&amp;P 500 looks at the um the stocks that comprise their index and they rebalance it and in not necessarily every quarter but most quarters uh some stocks get added if they add a stock it's a onetoone thing so they'll take they'll remove another stock um there's are certain crit IIA that stocks have to meet to gain inclusion or to be considered for the S&amp;P 500 paler met those requirements back in the end of 2023 this was the second uh time that they were up for possible inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 they didn't make it um it's as you said Lacy it's not a forever decision it's a for now decision stock went down a little bit because there was some retail enthusiasm about if paler got included at the S&amp;P 500 it would have um increased the amount of institutional ownership in the stock knocked down the volatility a little bit and it would have made it more attractive um for a broader number of investors so I do think it's important to note some of the larger business movement with this uh how do you feel about paler $50 million contract with Tampa General Hospital another recent contract that happened was with the US Department defense uh do you think this has the opportunity to significantly boost the company's stock I mean I guess my main question here is um are some of these ongoing contracts in healthcare in defense sectors is it going to help achieve stable growth for the stock uh there's a lot of questions in there Lacy what I would say is um the size of the contract doesn't do much for me um because we're talking about tens of millions of dollars in the case the government W it might be up to 4 million we're not talking billions we're talking Millions which the significance of this though is it's almost now happening on a weekly basis or a bi-weekly basis that you're hearing about paler getting another win getting another win getting another win and the wins are happening not just in the government side of the business but they're happening in the commercial side of the business and that's I think where the excitement comes in um when paler launched their AIP platform the question was okay so what how is it going to generate revenue for the company how is it going to make it more profitable and every time the company stacks these winds up it starts proving the fact that when companies start to use palente technology they like it and in both of the case of both of these contracts these were companies and parts of the government that were already using paler and are now saying yeah we're going to continue to use it yeah right kind of agree with what Chris is saying uh paner stock definitely can go higher because it's gaining traction but also deepening penetration it's going on both sides of the business so it's a it's a dual Tailwind really a quadruple Tailwind because both sides of the business new winds and penetration um so the business has some has some some growth ahead of it and I think this thing with the S&amp;P really is a non-fundamental driver um it would affect the market sentiment it would increase ownership but it doesn't really affect the business fundamentals which are positive and and driving the stock higher so now when it comes to artificial intelligence stocks I think we can agree that paler is stands apart I mean they've had AI tools for years now uh but where do you guys see paler maybe one five let's say 10 years do you think that the company's AI advancements are going to be able to keep it at the Forefront of the industry at all I do think that actually because paner is not doing AI for AI sake alone it's not just building this thing because it can it's been monetizing AI from the beginning and that's the factor that's driving all of the big AI names today is that they monetize it AI is fine if it's just a toy but when you turn it into a business you make money out of it that moves your stock price now guys paler has a price to sales ratio of 23.3 uh is paler overvalued do you think or does it have the potential to grow into its valuation uh can I cop out and say both are true no C outs here um yes I think I think the stock is slightly overvalued if you look at that metric and you say it's it's 23 time sales uh so just from that metric alone yes the stock is probably undervalued um it's not a a stock that a lot of Traders are going to be interested in um in terms of trying to get in it but I think if you're if you're in the stock already you're looking for opportun ities to just kind of keep averaging in when you can uh and when the stock gives you that opportunity because I think the the move here is going to be higher all right knowing all that we've discussed today about paler how should investors approach this stock guys I mean for those looking to invest in this do you think this is a good entry point right now or would you maybe wait for further price movements uh quickly but before you answer that though I think now would be at a fine entry point uh the stock did pull back a little bit on the news Friday but it was a marginal amount investors bought this dip there's positive action since then the market sitting on support showing good support at a higher level I think that it's just waiting for the next earnings report and that should be a good one yeah yes well don't forget pound teers next earning report is coming up on August 5th should we anticipate any significant announcements within that do you think I don't know if you're going to hear any significant announcements uh heading into the earnings report I think something for investors to look out for is about a month after paler reports earnings is when the S&amp;P will decide who might get into the index for the fourth quarter and if paler delivers a very strong earnings report it may seal the deal for them as far as getting included in the s&amp;p500 that's a good point Chris that's what I wanted to mention before this momentum it has you know it's not quite good enough for S&amp;P to to include it but it's got this momentum it will build a critical mass it could happen over the summer or in the fall yeah all right well thank you everyone for tuning in don't forget to leave us your comments down below let us know your thoughts on paler and of course stay tuned as we continue to explore more investment opportunities and market trends we'll see you next time [Music],1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,JwLenifEayE,2024-06-12T11:35:32Z,Palantir Stock Excluded from S&P 500: Still a Buy?,S&P 500,paler Technology stock may still be a buy despite being left out of the S&amp;P 500 this quarter let's talk about why welcome back everyone the news here is that paler was excluded from the S&amp;P 500 this announcement came last week and the immediate aftermath was a drop in its stock price now is this just a temporary setback or is it a long-term concern I mean this is the decision for now but it doesn't necessarily mean that be the decision forever uh Chris fill us in on the details of this okay so for those investors that may not be familiar with this uh every quarter of the S&amp;P 500 looks at the um the stocks that comprise their index and they rebalance it and in not necessarily every quarter but most quarters uh some stocks get added if they add a stock it's a onetoone thing so they'll take they'll remove another stock um there's are certain crit IIA that stocks have to meet to gain inclusion or to be considered for the S&amp;P 500 paler met those requirements back in the end of 2023 this was the second uh time that they were up for possible inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 they didn't make it um it's as you said Lacy it's not a forever decision it's a for now decision stock went down a little bit because there was some retail enthusiasm about if paler got included at the S&amp;P 500 it would have um increased the amount of institutional ownership in the stock knocked down the volatility a little bit and it would have made it more attractive um for a broader number of investors so I do think it's important to note some of the larger business movement with this uh I think this thing with the S&amp;P really is a non-fundamental driver um it would affect the market sentiment it would increase ownership but it doesn't really affect the business fundamentals which are positive and and driving the stock higher so now when it comes to artificial intelligence stocks I think something for investors to look out for is about a month after paler reports earnings is when the S&amp;P will decide who might get into the index for the fourth quarter and if paler delivers a very strong earnings report it may seal the deal for them as far as getting included in the s&amp;p500 that's a good point Chris that's what I wanted to mention before this momentum it has you know it's not quite good enough for S&amp;P to to include it but it's got this momentum it will build a critical mass it could happen over the summer or in the fall yeah,1.0,0.0

MarketBeat,BLJwc4bJank,2024-06-11T22:11:00Z,GameStop Mania: Which Meme Stocks Will Follow?,AMC,first AMC one that we have covered before it's the world's largest movie theater operator that can't seem to make a profit ever uh what do you guys think about the future for this stock what is it going to look like I think the future for this stock is liquidation uh the four things that I've got written down for my notes that really tell me not to to get involved with this one are its losses and the balance sheet you know it's losing money continuously the cash balance is down the share the shareholder deficit is growing and then there's delution and the short interest the stock has been diluted by 100% over the last year the share count has doubled and it's 20% short so with losses and a weakening balance sheet I mean this is like Mullen Automotive it's just going to go down to the dumper uh whatever they do to boost the stock price is just going to lead the short sellers to lean heavily back into it and send it back down yeah and you know I think if anybody's counting on the fact that there's a there's something there with a business model I think that it's important to note that AMC doesn't even own a lot of the a lot of the movie theaters where you know where they have where they're doing doing business so it it just doesn't seem to be a very viable business model fundamentally right and that's sad because it's movies we love movies AMC should be great but it's not right,1.0,-0.9

MarketBeat,BLJwc4bJank,2024-06-11T22:11:00Z,GameStop Mania: Which Meme Stocks Will Follow?,Beyond Meat,all right well another one that used to be the Talk of the Town maybe it still is uh beyond meat do you guys that plant-based meat is a strong enough market to support its stock uh tell us a little bit more about your thoughts on this one well I mean I kind I kind of like the stock I think the product is okay but I mean I'm not a vegetarian so I'm not buying it very often um but you can't really argue with the market they're struggling uh cost are a problem they're not really gaining traction uh the analyst don't like it they have a strong sell rating and a 40% downside and it's 40% short I mean there's really not a lot about this stock to make me want to buy it except for maybe as a very itty bitty super specul speculative position just in case there was a massive short squeeze but what's going to spark that yeah I I think that Beyond me went public at a time when it was pretty much the only game in town or close to the only game in town from a retail perspective if you went to the supermarket you weren't going to find many other options other than beyond meat I think um at that time one of the problems was it was a premium compared to compared to ground beef then the pandemic hit that premium went down a little bit but then competitors came in the space and I just think that right now biam just got a lot of things working against it from you know from just being that strong buy of a stock that an investor can count on,1.0,-0.7
MarketBeat,BLJwc4bJank,2024-06-11T22:11:00Z,GameStop Mania: Which Meme Stocks Will Follow?,Big Lots,all right last meme stock I want to bring up today is Big Lots it's a home discount retailer and a big disappointment in its fiscal q1 2025 earnings uh Chris do you think its discount retail business can survive the volatility of the meme stock market I think the discount retail movement and and Market is here to stay I think it's very investable but I'm not sure if big lot's the right company to do that with very high short interest on the stock I think it's around 24% right now in like four days to cover uh this is a company that's just experienc in large losses every quarter um they they are right sizing their inventory so there's some good things trying to happen here but I just think this is a case of there's too much competition in the markets in which they do business and consumers just have a lot of Alternatives in the discount retail space that's true there is tons of competition Big Lot is another name that I have liked and liked in the past but my feeling over the last year or two is that there's it's just been too little too late for them as far as like trying to gain traction and and keep their target market interested um they really lost some relevancy in the discount sphere because you've got names like oi's Bargain Outlet and DJ Warehouse wholesale clubs TJ Maxx um raw stores all really killing it right and Big Lots is just like a it's a ghetto version of a discount store um but something out of all these three stocks I think it might be the one that you could risk some money on because they're they are right sizing they're supposed to be returning to growth soon and regaining their margins I think the really the biggest risk for them right now is the balance sheet they lost a lot of money over the last few years repurchasing shares when they should have been hoarding Capital so it's kind of a crapshoot on this one maybe they can pull it off maybe they can't yeah they cut their dividend I think in I think it was last year they cut their they they suspended I should say not cut it they suspended it so yeah that's right right right this was one of my big picks for the for the pandemic for the uh social I mean it was huge it did so well but then it just didn't follow through so yep,1.0,-0.4

MarketBeat,r3Jk3LVhqbs,2024-06-07T18:51:27Z,Buy or Bail? Stock Upgrades and Downgrades,Nvidia,we can't talk enough about Nvidia of course uh Nvidia has regained its leadership position with another record setting quarter what do you guys think about how nvidia's cautious guidance uh what about that despite such impressive results well I mean right uh AI is this bubble it's still growing but the bubble is really centered on Nvidia and we don't really know how big it is it's still growing they outperform by 500 basis points they raise guidance above analyst consensus by 500 basis points those are huge numbers and with the momentum that they're showing I expect to see analysts continue to upgrade uh the stock and the price targets over time time and you know like right now it's the number one most upgraded stock so we know it's got a lot of Market conviction behind it we're looking at Double Digit upside still so I think that this stock still has plenty of room to run right I mean I think we have to distinguish between cautious guidance and poor guidance I mean I think they're they're still they're still offering double digit guidance right I think Nvidia is just trying to maybe temper expectations and say you can't expect us to maybe hit a grand slam home run every time we're still going to hit a home run right right right right and maybe and maybe a double it worse but we're maybe it's just not the Grand Slam that you expect yeah I mean really the only thing that I see bad right now in the Nvidia Outlook is that the growth is slowing right but we're talking about it grew 200% I think in the last quarter so slowing from that we're still talking hyper growth in this company that it will soon be as big as Microsoft and Apple it's bigger than Apple now right I think as far as um yeah past yeah it's a big company to be growing this fast another risk is Tesla is spending a lot of money right now and to tie this back to Nvidia Elon Musk said that his conglomeration of businesses are going to spend about 10 billion dollars on Nvidia Hardware this year 10 billion he's one company he's like one of the smaller of the big AI companies spending 10 billion this year so think of what that means for NVIDIA when all of the other companies Apple Microsoft Oracle Adobe are spending even more money than they are on Nvidia Hardware,0.95,0.8
MarketBeat,r3Jk3LVhqbs,2024-06-07T18:51:27Z,Buy or Bail? Stock Upgrades and Downgrades,Tesla,all right well now let's take a look at Tesla this is one of the most downgraded stocks sorry Elon uh but Tesla has faced 28 downgrades in the last 90 days tell us a little bit more what is contributing to this negative sentiment among analysts yeah I think it's it's a valuation concern and the premium price that Tesla gets uh because right now Tesla is in this transition from the EV boom period which is kind of over to the next phase which is going to be driven by AI so right now the question is do we still value Tesla based on the Elon Musk factor or is it just a car company and when it's making cars it is a tech company but it's also at hard is still just a car company cre that a high valuation but the analysts uh looking at a lot of headwinds right now uh there's a share vote for Elon mus pay package we're talking about the expectations for declining earnings in Revenue so analysts are lowering their targets and the thing that I see is being the risk is their price targets have come down to the low end of this range and the stock is showing some signs of resistance at the low into that range so I see it falling out of the range which means it could fall 10 20 30 40% from that point yeah Thomas Thomas hit it very well I'm sorry Lacy Thomas hit it very well I mean Tesla's having a hard time right now convincing analysts that it is anything more than just a car company and in any event it's going when you're the market share leader in the US as far as electric vehicles go and electric vehicle demand is down you're the one that has the most risk and that's what's happening in my opinion that's what's happening with Tesla stock another risk is Tesla is spending a lot of money right now and to tie this back to Nvidia Elon Musk said that his conglomeration of businesses are going to spend about 10 billion dollars on Nvidia Hardware this year 10 billion he's one company he's like one of the smaller of the big AI companies spending 10 billion this year so think of what that means for NVIDIA when all of the other companies Apple Microsoft Oracle Adobe are spending even more money than they are on Nvidia Hardware well as you guys mentioned with the musk factor in play there are definitely things that investors need to watch out for in Tesla's next move,0.95,-0.7
MarketBeat,r3Jk3LVhqbs,2024-06-07T18:51:27Z,Buy or Bail? Stock Upgrades and Downgrades,Lululemon,now Lululemon has also been downgraded recently what is driving analysts to lower their expectations with this one and guys I do want to mention we know lul Lululemon has been known for its strong brand and loyal customer base so do you think that these downgrades are temporary setbacks or do they indicate maybe deeper issues with the company here I don't think it's deeper issues but I think it's the marking coming back to reality Lulu lmon has kind of lost its glow and it's kind of lost its premium valuation because of slowing growth and improving competition uh the latest report was better than expected but it still resulted in some more price Target downgrades so I think Lulu has got some upside but it's going to be limited and the analyst will be capping gains I think yeah I think the the selloff looks a little bit harsh right now given the company's Revenue um I I and and their earnings I mean the revenue and earnings are still growing year-over-year right now I agree I think there's more competition coming in the market which is probably going to peel off a little bit of those middle to lower income people that maybe were stretching up to BU Lulu I think the premium Market is still going to be there for the company I I see this as a temporary setback so do you think there is a silver lining then for Lulu investors to come or is it time to consider bailing this stock yeah right now I'm on the with Lulu I would say I mean I bailing on the stock no I think you know hopefully you took some profits off the table when it was trading where it was um but I'm not necessarily thinking it can't get back up there again,0.95,-0.2
MarketBeat,r3Jk3LVhqbs,2024-06-07T18:51:27Z,Buy or Bail? Stock Upgrades and Downgrades,Google,all right well let's get back to the upgrades here Google has become the second most upgraded stock uh receiving 35 upgrades this quarter what strengths in Google's performance do you think led to such a positive analyst activity here well based on the report it was strength in all segments uh you got to remember Google is still a significant player when it comes to the internet and uh search uh the internet is still growing like penetration of the world global of the global population is still growing to underpin Google's business penetration of services by person is still growing AI is still growing YouTube is doing well uh so we're talking about Revenue growth margin growth high levels of cash flow uh the analyst just love it so I see this one going higher too all right so with Google's consensus price Target now more than 10% above its current uh price do you think it is the right time to buy or should investors maybe wait for further developments well I wouldn't go in and back up the truck and just load up on it but uh it's certainly a good time to add to a position or start a new one,0.95,0.85
MarketBeat,NsKuupcl4zw,2024-06-05T17:33:11Z,Profit Like Congress: The Stocks They're Betting On,Applied Materials,now let's roll into it here some of the most active Congressional trades this quarter uh Applied Materials is the most bought stock by Congress this quarter this one we haven't spent a ton of time covering on this channel but let's get into this one what is driving interest in this stock well right this one was most most bought by dollar value and by the number of members buying so this really is a significant spot for appli materials and I think it really comes down to the fact that this company makes equipment to build semiconductors America is getting ready to spend billions of dollars to bolster our onshoring efforts of building semiconductors so this is a totally an Insider Buy in my opinion yeah I I agree with Thomas I mean if if you are gonna say Nvidia is in the Forefront of the AI movement than a than Applied Materials is the company that's helping Nidia build the chips that are needed to help Propel the AI so it's it's totally logical that investors and especially members of Congress who want to get out in front of of that movement well right because we know that Intel and Micron and I think Taiwan semiconductors are all building foundaries in America right now right yeah so maybe they're trimming their apple position in order to buy some applied material yeah I think right now it's like I just said it looks like um they're into technology the foundations of tech maybe they're trimming some Apple to buy some other tech stocks,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,NsKuupcl4zw,2024-06-05T17:33:11Z,Profit Like Congress: The Stocks They're Betting On,Home Depot,all right Home Depot was also actively bought on this list how do economic conditions in the housing market maybe influence the appeal to investors with with this one which is going to be good for Home Depot yeah and I also think that we're at the start of what is conventionally known as hurricane season that runs through now I think October or maybe even November it's logical all it takes is one somewhere to create a big problem and create interest in Home Improvement materials that companies such as Home Depot provide so it it seems logical that this would be a pick right Home Depot is a solid play for dividends and the weather,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,NsKuupcl4zw,2024-06-05T17:33:11Z,Profit Like Congress: The Stocks They're Betting On,Baldwin Insurance Group,all right now let's talk about the most sold stock by Congress that was Baldwin Insurance Group we're talking a massive sell-off with this one nearly 3.8 million uh why do you think that this sell-off occurred is there maybe a hidden agenda behind this move at all all right so this one's significant because it's three trades by one member it is sign significantly the largest amount of sales over the previous 90 days by like 30 times 30X I think but this is a member of Congress from Florida selling an insurance company ahead of a highly active hurricane season so I think this could just be him trying to get out of this Market before the Hurricanes strike Florida where he lives knowing that Florida's going to get hit hard by hurricanes this year and that the insurance companies are going to lose a lot of money and I'll take the other side of that on this one I'll say also this is coming at a time when insurance companies in States like Florida are having are restricting who they're actually allowing to have insurance or the insurance rates are very punitive so some some homeowners are choosing to go without homeowners insurance because the rates are so punitive so I think there could be a story there as well right and maybe you should avoid insurance,1.0,-0.8
MarketBeat,NsKuupcl4zw,2024-06-05T17:33:11Z,Profit Like Congress: The Stocks They're Betting On,Apple,"We do have to mention apple and all of they are currently getting the stink eye from Congress uh what are your thoughts on this given the current market position All right so we have uh eight trades by six members of Congress so this is fairly active they didn't sell a ton just under $140,000 alog together we have members of both sides of Congress kind of my take on this one is maybe they're trimming their apple position in order to buy some applied material Lacy people sell stocks for any number of reasons these are human beings they have lives they have taxes to pay and different family events that they're working through but when you see Congressional members sell a stock it can send or signal to the market that maybe is unintentional I agree with Thomas this may just be a case of some people were trimming their position in apple which has run up quite a bit in the last month and I did notice that I think there was at least one one member of Congress that bought apple right within the last 30 days so it's one of those situations where it it gives the appearance of something that might not be there simply because of them being members of Congress and that just to me is is unsettling yeah and to point out that this was like one of the most active as far as numbers of members go so you know like collectively as as a group you know they decided that it was a good time to sell Apple whether they were right or not maybe they're trimming some Apple to buy some other tech stocks",1.0,-0.3
MarketBeat,g-Jk7Kep3hc,2024-06-04T18:01:40Z,Cathie Wood’s AMD Buy: Smart Move or Risky Business,AMD,Kathy Woods has made some significant trades recently with one of the most notable being the purchase of more AMD shares love it or hate it we're here to cover it so let's get started Welcome back guys today we are talking about something I know our viewers will have strong opinions on from each side so go ahead don't be afraid to comment down below we do want to hear from you so let's just get into it uh Cathy wood has made some significant trades recently with of the most notable being the purchase of AMD Chris Thomas what do you think are the key reasons behind Cathy Wood's decision to invest in AMD stock I want to talk about that um and what has been the Market's reaction to this have we seen any immediate impacts on AMD stock price at all well let me let me start with the first question you asked and that is you know Kathy Wood has been investing in AMD for a while so I'm not necessarily sure if this is a new position for her I don't think it is and to your second Point um AMD shot up uh Friday right before the close but so did a lot of stocks it look I don't know if that was the algorithms having a field day at the end of the day and then but since then they've been kind of muddling around so so it hasn't seemed to do much for the stock this week yeah right like Chris said Kathy's been uh investing in&amp; since about 2018 I think she's bought it she sold it she's bought it she sold at this latest position latest purchase is probably because the stock is down but I think she's investing in AMD because it is a potential disruptor you know she focuses on disruptor she's a swing for the fences kind of investor you know AMD isn't the largest in any of its in markets but it's a very good player in all those markets it's uh definitely got a uh an opportunity to take some market share in Ai and to be disruptive in that in that in that regard I mean we look at the release this past weekend they just announced like the next three steps in their AI progression so we know that they're working hard to keep up with Nvidia and the competition between those two companies is going to result in some serious advances in technology yeah so you mentioned it I want to talk about that Kathy Wood's investment style uh it's important thing to cover here but people love it or they hate it how do you think that Cathy wood views the current state and the future potential of the semiconductor industry I mean particularly in relation to AMD here I mean as you said she does have a disruptive innovation investment strategy she's known for high risk High reward investment style so clearly she has her eye on something here with AMD uh what do you think others might be missing how does this AMD investment fit within that context well I think that Kathy W when I've whenever I've heard her speak over the past year she's very bullish on AI I don't know if she's um bullish on semiconductors per se other than to say they are the place to be right now they're the tip of the spear as far as where AI is going because they're the picks and the shovels that you're going to need to get AI up and running so she's very bullish on AI and I think right now she sees AMD as being a disruptive play in the growth of AI but perhaps not perhaps not in in terms of saying the data center Market which which Nvidia has covered very well right now yeah right like I was saying before AMD isn't really the largest player in any of us in markets but it is a a critical player in data centers in Ai and PCs and iot and what I see in AMD is it Bridges the gap between the data centers and the large language model the cloud and the generative AI That's being built out right now and AI at the edge where it exists on our devices our computers and the iot and that really is the future of where most of the growth in I in AI will be because right now I mean with the models and the cloud we're all kind of connecting to those models and using them but AI will really Blossom when it's at our fingertips when it's in our devices and that's what I think the AMD play is really focused on right okay now how does this move affect uh investor sentiment towards AMD at does it do with that at all I mean again there are two very strong sides to this as we know but do think Kathy Wood's investment boosts confidence at all I think that depends a little bit on how you feel about Kathy Wood but the thing is Kathy Wood is I would say she's a long in investor but she's not a Buy and Hold she's as Thomas has said she's been in and out of AMD she's been in and out probably not fully but she's been in and out of stocks like Tesla like pal Ander so she's not afraid to sell but when she's buying it generally means she's buying for a reason and I think that's the thing that investors have to try to be keing on is what's the reason why she might be um what why she might be buying AMD right now and I think that might be because she's seeing that there's going to be a refresh cycle in CPUs and gpus and that's where AMD really can get market share or they I they have market share right now and they can hold that market share advantage over a company like Nvidia Thomas why think she's buying right now what I think she's buying well first I want to say I think that Kathy WS buying AMD is more of a newsworthy event than a market moving event right like we said she's an aggressive Trader she's active um she's not afraid to take a loss you know she gets into a position and if it's losing she'll get out of it as quick as she can but at the same time she's got this long-term view so putting those two things together with AMD she's targeted AMD for this long-term opportunity the stock goes up the stock goes down she's going to try to buy in when she can she's going to cut losses when she can when the stock moves lower she's going to try to get in and build that position and try to get the best base position she can for this long-term opportunity that will produce value over time I think let's take a quick look at AMD versus the competitors uh Thomas I think you touched on this briefly but how does AMD compared to let's say Intel and Nvidia as you mentioned um looking at ter in terms of technology and market share here well like so specifically with data centers and market share and AI AMD was kind of late to the game but that's you know it's understandable because Nvidia really created the game so AMD is kind of coming back on board but it's uh proving to be a pretty solid competitor it's right there neck and neck it's just a matter of time before it is able to gain share in the AI and the data center Market sphere all right long-term outlook here uh what is a long-term outlook for AMD do you think it will continue to be a strong performer in the tech sector absolutely I I I agree with Thomas I think there's there's no question it's going to be around um you're looking at a solid company great CEO uh they tend to be that company that over prom or under promises and overd delivers which which Wall Street loves that it's a it's a good stock to be in for the long term right I think the the biggest uh the headwind right now for AMD is that they were a little bit slow to the game yeah I would say that their Hardware is on par and in some ways better than Nvidia they both had their advantages nvidia's Advantage is that they started it sooner they leaned into the full stack approach from the beginning they've always been building out their operating system which is really what's helping the data centers and the companies today um launch their AI models so AMD is catching up with that and I would expect to see them start making some some even bigger strides over the next year all right guys we've talked the talk of Kathy Wood and AMD today so now I want to know do you agree yes or no with her decision to buy AMD stock why or why not I do want to hear from our viewers as well so don't forget to leave your comments down below Chris let's hear it is there anything else you want to add I will say yes I agree with Kathy was decision to buy AMD and I'll look at it like this if you're looking at this as a Nvidia versus the field over the next 10 years almost anytime you give me a bet that says somebody versus the field I'm going to take the field and AMD is one of the leaders in that field that's not disparaging Nvidia in the slightest it's just if I'm going to say nvidia's already had this Majestic growth over the last year it's probably going to do Majestic growth for this year but if I'm looking at it as a long-term opportunity even if I'm looking at a trade that I'm only going to hold the stock maybe for two or three years I'm going to look at the field and AMD is one of the stocks I'm going to look at in that field I like AMD for all the reasons I've said I would be on board with Miss Wood's decision to buy AMD for all those reasons and another one and that is because the Legacy in markets are also normalizing the inventory reset for the semiconductor Market has had a big impact on the Legacy market for the last two years that market is normalizing and is returning to growth compounded by the data center and AI growth which I see as a dual Tailwind for this company over the next two to five years yep right well thank you everyone for tuning in for this Hot Topic today don't forget to catch us back here at Market beat for more and of course if there's a

MarketBeat,g-Jk7Kep3hc,2024-06-04T18:01:40Z,Cathie Wood’s AMD Buy: Smart Move or Risky Business,NVIDIA,so we know that they're working hard to keep up with Nvidia and the competition between those two companies is going to result in some serious advances in technology and I think right now she sees AMD as being a disruptive play in the growth of AI but perhaps not perhaps not in in terms of saying the data center Market which which Nvidia has covered very well right now and they can hold that market share advantage over a company like Nvidia Thomas why think she's buying right now well like so specifically with data centers and market share and AI AMD was kind of late to the game but that's you know it's understandable because Nvidia really created the game so AMD is kind of coming back on board but it's uh proving to be a pretty solid competitor it's right there neck and neck it's just a matter of time before it is able to gain share in the AI and the data center Market sphere I would say that their Hardware is on par and in some ways better than Nvidia they both had their advantages nvidia's Advantage is that they started it sooner they leaned into the full stack approach from the beginning they've always been building out their operating system which is really what's helping the data centers and the companies today um launch their AI models I will say yes I agree with Kathy was decision to buy AMD and I'll look at it like this if you're looking at this as a Nvidia versus the field over the next 10 years almost anytime you give me a bet that says somebody versus the field I'm going to take the field and AMD is one of the leaders in that field that's not disparaging Nvidia in the slightest it's just if I'm going to say nvidia's already had this Majestic growth over the last year it's probably going to do Majestic growth for this year but if I'm looking at it as a long-term opportunity even if I'm looking at a trade that I'm only going to hold the stock maybe for two or three years I'm going to look at the field and AMD is one of the stocks I'm going to look at in that field,1.0,0.3
MarketBeat,g-Jk7Kep3hc,2024-06-04T18:01:40Z,Cathie Wood’s AMD Buy: Smart Move or Risky Business,Intel,I think let's take a quick look at AMD versus the competitors uh Thomas I think you touched on this briefly but how does AMD compared to let's say Intel and Nvidia as you mentioned um looking at ter in terms of technology and market share here,0.9,0.0
MarketBeat,g-Jk7Kep3hc,2024-06-04T18:01:40Z,Cathie Wood’s AMD Buy: Smart Move or Risky Business,Tesla,she's been in and out of stocks like Tesla like pal Ander so she's not afraid to sell,0.9,0.0

MarketBeat,M1Nx0CyGJKw,2024-05-28T03:41:46Z,4 of the Best Stocks for Share Buybacks,Apple,all right well first up we're taking a look at Apple they announced a massive 110 billion share buyback program recently their buyback yield is 3.1% % and they also uh offer a dividend yield of 0.54% uh how significant are these figures for long-term investors well the dividend youo to me isn't significant at all I've long Lacy you've heard me say this about Apple for many times there are technology they're a technology company that happens to pay a dividend it it the dividend is really insignificant for even for a long-term investor it's just not that significant at this point the share buyback was interesting um you can be a cynic and say that it was kind of curious that Apple chose to do a share buyback when it sits on all this cash why aren't they doing it to invest in other things um I think Apple's I think the AI story for apple is coming you've been seeing that reflected in the share price over the past month I believe investors are getting behind that story we're going to learn more at their developers Conference in June that could be a key Catalyst for the stock right now though I wouldn't read too much into the share buyback and I certainly wouldn't read too much into the into the dividend yield,0.95,0.15
MarketBeat,M1Nx0CyGJKw,2024-05-28T03:41:46Z,4 of the Best Stocks for Share Buybacks,Chevron,all right let's take a look at Chevron now their 75 billion shared uh buyback program is also quite substantial uh how does the cyclical nature though of the oil industry influence their decision to initiate such BuyBacks yeah you're making a really good point there Lacy this is a this is something that's very common in the oil sector because of the cyclical nature of it um chevron's not a newcomer to share BuyBacks and even the the 75 $75 billion number that's not necessarily uncommon for them the bigger story for Chevron if you're a long investor has to do with the their acquisition of Hess which is due for a shareholder vote by hes shareholders I believe it's early next week and although that's still expected to go through it's now supposed to be razor thin it almost sounds like a episode of succession now instead of what was supposed to be a pretty much a easy uh merger going through,0.95,-0.2
MarketBeat,M1Nx0CyGJKw,2024-05-28T03:41:46Z,4 of the Best Stocks for Share Buybacks,Adobe,all right Thomas let's get you in on this one uh there's also Adobe which I know you're interested in uh who announced a $25 billion share buyback program to address its stock performance how effective has it this been in stabilizing the stock price for Adobe well right I'll say yeah maybe and I want to say it's a little coincidental that they announced this buyback at the same quarter where they kind of gave some tepid results and tepid Guidance the market had really had a lot of expectation for AI for Adobe not really playing through uh so this buyback should help support the stock price and it kind of is but what happened after that release is the share price tanked to a new low we are seeing some boding at this level and we may get a a rebound uh the stock price is kind of in line with the low into the analyst range so there may be a floor in there and I do want to point out that these share BuyBacks have been a creative to to shareholders over time uh in the last quarter the average share count was down 8% so we are more than offsetting share based compensation that is good for shareholders over time you assume that the uh the stock price is the stocks market cap is going to increase there's fewer shares to to divide into that market cap so the share should be worth more,0.95,0.3
MarketBeat,M1Nx0CyGJKw,2024-05-28T03:41:46Z,4 of the Best Stocks for Share Buybacks,Tractor Supply,all right well last but not least we're talking about Tractor Supply they have been consistently buying back shares since 2007 what makes their buyback strategy unique compared to other retailers yeah but I wouldn't call it unique so much as aggressive they buy back shares every quarter and every year and they are creative in the last quarter shares were down 2% average and that's on top of a 2% reduction in the previous year so technically speaking um share BuyBacks reduce shareholder Equity because they're spending money on something that doesn't exist anymore if they retire the shares but at the same time the company's also growing and proving it market cap reducing its share count so shareholder value is actually increasing uh the share repurchases more than double the yield so I think that this is a good long-term play for uh for income and Equity investors,0.95,0.7
MarketBeat,h7PvPSBcpEU,2024-05-24T19:46:49Z,Micron Stock is the NVIDIA of Memory,Micron,Micron Technology stock is on a rise and is set to hit new highs this year why because it's the Nvidia of memory chips let's talk about it welcome back guys Micron stock is surging let's get right into the details Thomas you had mentioned something along the lines of uh where nvidia's differentiated chip designs have spawned a new industry Micron is perfectly positioned to capitalize on it because of its power consumption so tell us more about this in the recent price surge if you would do you think Micron can truly become the Nvidia of memory chips or is this comparison just kind of overstated no I I think it's happening right now and to think about the power consumption angle the data centers that they're using and building to power AI use as much power as Bitcoin the one of the biggest issues with Bitcoin since its Inception was how much power it uses is it really worthwhile because of all the power it uses it's not green and technically Bitcoin really is green because more than 50% of its power is renewable as compared to AI which is not that good AI uses as much power micron's hbm3 chips use 30% less power than the competition which is a significant amount of power reduction for comparable or Superior performance that just sets it Head and Shoulders apart uh right now SK hex leads the market because they kind of invented the hbm3 um you know configuration Micron was kind of late to the party but it's definitely producing some solid um solid equipment I think that's going to take it uh to market share gains and help it dominate this market now let's talk about one of the other big things here and that is Micron getting the chips act money we're talking more than six billion in fragile grant money here so why is this so significant for micron yeah well like Thomas just said micron's making a huge investment in building out their infrastructure and let's be clear while $6 billion is a lot of money it's about a tenth of what Micron is going to be spending as a company to do this whole buildout over time still right now as we've seen over the past 12 months or so the federal government's probably the biggest game in town as far as injecting juice into the market and ingesting juice into the economy this is big for micron and in terms of in terms of getting those projects started it's going to be big for those local economies where they hit overall this is a bullish sign for the stock right let's remember that Micron is the only domestic producer of memory chips that's why it's getting the chips sa money this is part of National Defense I mean Micron has the support of the government now recently Micron has been investing heavily in new facilities which is obviously seen as a strategic move for future growth but do you think these Investments are going to pay off or is Micron kind of making too much of a risk right now no I don't think it's too much of a risk because they're ramping production to meet expected industry demand but also to build out capacity for this new hbm market so um over time this is certainly going to play well into Mike Ron's growth all right analysts are responding very well to micron's position and the evolving outlook for them uh what is that Community saying overall about the stock well I think the analysts uh they like the stock they've been upgrading it they've been raising their price targets it's ranked on Market beats list of most upgraded and top rated stocks uh the most recent one came from Morgan Stanley I think it was yeah Morgan Stanley they upgraded to equal weight from underweight saying that they had carried a bullish or a bearish stance far too long they were lamenting their position they mentioned all the things that we've mentioned um they credit uh micron's performance uh and it's it's late start but it's also a it's position in the in the market and its ability to take share all right so Micron is at an inflection point guys and we could see shares hit $200 uh let's take a look at the chart and talk a little bit more about that right so this is the weekly chart of Micron stock you can see it bottomed here in 2022 as industry normalization kind of began and we kind of see the end of that coming coming about over here industry Market normalization is happening AI is taking off excuse me the analyst lead is stock to a new high we're testing resistance right here this is a significant resistance a critical Pivot Point the market gets above here see it gaining $20 which would be this magnitude from here to here up to 50 to $75 which would be from this Rally Point to here the bottom to the top but from this 20 130 breakout point we could put this like up to $200 uh pretty quickly I think yeah I'm gonna take the under on that um and it's it's really just for no other reason then I think micron's a good example of two things that can be true at the same time I think Micron is one of those companies that has the everybody's looking for what companies are going to be the next Nvidia which sounds insane but that's kind of how a lot of investors think they've already moved on from Nvidia at least some have and they're looking for that next stock that they can get in while it's still relatively small Micron could be one of those companies the stocks up over 90% for this year year for the last 12 months of their revenue and earnings they're actually lower than they were from the prior period so there's something there that's not aligning for me anyway I think this is a case of just a stock that's a little ahead of itself right now I think it's going to go up I see some analysts do have a price target of over $200 I'm not seeing it getting there in the next um you know in the next 12 months I do agree with Thomas I think that $140 range that could be a reasonable price Target here I'm just not seeing it go to 200 at least not in the short term.,1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,Ik7sR_A-KGk,2024-05-23T15:41:37Z,NVIDIA’s Explosive Growth: Why the AI Leader’s Rally Isn’t Over Yet,NVIDIA,"nvidia's rally is far from over and same goes for volatility let's get into it welcome back guys Nvidia has once again outperformed expectations marking their fifth consecutive beat and raise quarter they tripled Revenue in q1 and are forecasting another strong quarter ahead so truly significant movement Happening Here guys tell us a little bit more about what you're seeing with this what I'm seeing is that uh despite all the hype in the AI uh the market has still underestimated it um the the surge in growth the amount of outperformance the guidance just says that this thing is bigger than we thought in our wildest dreams it's still accelerating so I think that this story still has legs I don't know if I believe that the market underestimated Nvidia I'm more of the I think the the market was trying to Tamper their own enthusiasm so that they so that Nvidia stock had room to run when this report came out because I don't think anybody really expected them to not do what they did last night that seems to me to be a little bit weird I mean everybody go ahead THS well they they beat by almost 600 basis points and the guidance is also about that same amount above consensus all the analysts have been raising their estimates for the last five quarters I mean yeah this is this is a significant amount of outperformance okay now I have seen some jokes going around social media I'm sure you guys have to Reddit all the things um about how Nvidia is carrying the economy on its shoulders but is it really a joke guys I mean I don't know things are getting a little serious um in nvidia's data Center Revenue jumped 427 to 22.6 billion can this growth be sustained do you think or will competition from in-house AI chips um that we're seeing from Tech giants like Amazon and Google maybe pose a significant threat to them right so can the growth be sustained probably not this is wicked growth it's blossoming it will Top out we're al already seeing that in the guidance growth is slowing still way significant way more than expected but slowing and so that's going to be a bit of a headwind for the market it's going to keep the analyst from really rushing ahead and raising their price targets to really extraordinary levels but like Jensen hang said last year I mean the data center industry is worth a trillion dollars it's growing at a 10% cagr but also there's this revolution where all the old data centers are being upgraded to this new technology so this is a dual Tailwind for for the business I think that it's going to sustain the operations for a while as far as other chip companies go I don't know what Chris thinks about this the opportunity for them was to gain share from Nvidia because they've also got AI chips their businesses are also booming but because Nvidia is such the dominant player and its business is growing so quickly I would assume that it has gained market share from the 80% it was running in Data Center and now it's probably pushing like 90 95% yeah I'll go back to the first question you Lacy and that is you know is NVIDIA propping up the entire economy I don't know if it's propping up the entire economy I think it's safe to say it's propping up the market right now uh because you know the market turned around as soon as that the Nvidia results came out uh we'll see what happens in the next day or so to see if it you know if this is the start of a new Rally or if it's just going to be confined to Nvidia but I think we can safely say maybe nvidia's taking the crown where people used to say as Apple goes so goes the market I think it might be as Nvidia goes so goes the market and to Thomas's point I do think that there's going to be these other players trying to go after market share but I think right now it's going to have to be more of a niche type thing like what you're seeing with Qualcomm trying to get in and do the chips for you know specific applications as opposed to maybe it's going to be I think harder to get in in in a broader sense because nvidia's got that market pretty much covered right just to the to the idea of Nvidia carrying the economy you got to think that nvidia's results have trumped the fomc the fomc is saying that they're not on track to cut rates the way the market thinks that that it is that to me is a is a brick ceiling for the market and yet it's going to keep Rising because Nvidia is trumping it Nvidia is certainly carrying the tech sector and along with it the broader Market well right I mean nvidia's going where Nvidia is right where this whole transformation is happening in the economy with AI and Nvidia is at the tip of that and that's that's something that like you're saying they're ahead of the fomc they just you know the FC is trying to digest all that and Nvidia is just out in front of it go ahead and comment Down Below guys what you think about Nvidia and the economy and all of this we want to hear from you but let continue on here Nvidia announced a 10 to1 stock split making shares a bit more accessible so is it a good time to jump in um of course there's volatility here as We Know It uh how is this going to impact the stock in the near future though because I mean the stock is up 900% in the last 18 months so this might provide an an attractive profit for early investors right right I see the stock split inducing volatility it's going to lower the share price it's going to make it more accessible people are going to want to get in I'm thinking about getting in after the split but I also think the split's going to cause um a lot of volatility there's probably going to be a selloff before or after and I would wait for one of those significant dips to get in I'm not going to chase this one Higher right now yeah I think it's a the stock split we've talked about this before Lacy I mean these generally are they shouldn't be as big of a deal as they are but they are a big deal I think it's especially a big deal if you're probably an employee of Nvidia and you're looking to buy buy the shares of the stock instead of buying maybe fractional shares you can actually buy whole shares now so I think that's that's good news I agree with Thomas I'm when I heard about the stock split yesterday I thought about okay huh maybe I'm G to buy Nvidia after the stock split right now uh I'm probably not going to chase it at at $1,000 right now but certainly it's going to look a lot more attractive at the split adjusted Price Right the split is it's a sentiment factor it's not a fundamental Factor so it's affect what people think but not the value of the company now nvidia's gaming segment once their biggest Revenue Source now seems to be minor compared to their data center sales uh do you think nvidia's Focus will continue to shift here or is there still significant growth potential in their gaming sector right so I think invidious Focus has shipped it to AI it's a full-blown AI company now full stack is not just chips it's the entire infrastructure of AI from building out its own own AI networks and providing services to other companies uh gaming is going to be part of that gaming is going to benefit from AI right now gaming is like a really itty bitty part of their revenue compared to data center but I would imagine data center will eventually Peak and top out and then we'll start seeing growth in all these ancillary segments after the AI infrastructure is built and that will include um the games and we'll have Edge Computing Edge AI embedded in the games uh so yeah that's just that's another future growth Avenue to help sustain Nvidia over time I think what else should we be looking at as we watch Nvidia in the coming months guys right I'm going to be looking at expanding Partnerships and just to point out one that was announced last night snowflake it's already built most of its technology on Nvidia chips but it's hinting at expanding collaborations driven by AI demand that plays into Nvidia is focused refocused to a full stack AI company uh now that they're selling the chips they're going to start doing more and more service services and so that's what I'll be watching for well that wraps it up for update on Nvidia today be sure to check out Market be

MarketBeat,pUeUt3l334w,2024-05-15T13:44:58Z,"Home Depot Stock: Earnings Mixed, Wait to Buy the Dip",Home Depot,"Home Depot's latest earnings are a mixed bag let's dive into what this means for the retail Giant and its investors. Today we are here to take a look at the latest with Home Depot stock. Thomas can you give us a brief overview here of Home Depot's earnings report and why it's been described as kind of a mixed bag? I really wouldn't call it a bad report or a good report it's definitely mixed relative to the analyst estimates uh you have the Top Line fell short the bottom line is outperforming both of the misses or the out performances were very slim really what we have are results that are in alignment with the expectations. I think a year of flat growth is really normal and just part of Home Depot's uh digesting its growth and preparing for its next phase. Now the report does mention some cautious consumer spending due to high interest rates so how do you think Home Depot can kind of adjust its strategy to boost consumer confidence here and maybe continuing uh the spending in its stores? Home Depot for their strategy they've kind of been leaning into the professional business they've got a larger professional business than Lowe's does and they're starting to lean into that more because that business is doing better than the Consumer end and so I think we'll see them uh lean more into that over the year maybe in the years to come. How is Home Depot positioned against other main competitors in the retail sector especially given Uh current slowdown and its growth also I want to take a look Beyond this current fiscal year Thomas if we can but what long-term strategies does Home Depot have in place that can ensure its growth going forward? I think that just all comes back to the professional side of the business. Now Thomas analysts seem cautious about this one with some lowering their price targets do you have anything else to add to this yeah right I think that uh Home Depot like I mentioned before is just in this period of of digesting the gains that it's had the analysts are still positive on the stock they still see some upside but over the last month they began determing their targets or their price targets for the stock I don't see that Trend changing now so what I see this resulting in is just some range bound trading you can see that on the chart as well the market I can pull it up if you want. As I was saying Home Depot has been digesting uh this large amount of growth that it's seen over the last few years you can see that here in this sideways trading range the analysts have been trimming their targets so they see consensus being about right here that's probably the cap for the market right now uh the post relase action has the market Market down but they're buying the dip as I mentioned in my article I don't see this as a selling opportunity or a buying opportunity it's really an opportunity to hold the stock right now we can see some people are already buying the dip the stock may continue to dip down lower but ultimately what I see happening is Home Depot grinding sideways within this range to meet this line right here let me change to the monthly View and you can see that this is a very significant up trend line for this stock all right we get a huge boost here from the the pandemic and social distancing now we're digesting those gains the market is returning to Trend at some point over the next year or two it's going to get back over here into this range we'll probably see a really fantastic Trend following signal at that time it may coincide with a return to growth wider margins a combination of the of the two but long term I think that Home Depot will continue to Trend higher along this line. So Thomas given the mixed signals from the q1 report what should investors really watch for in the next few quarters that might indicate stronger recovery or even further challenges for Home Depot? The real signal will be when Home Depot results return to growth and we start seeing some leverage in in the earnings. As we discussed Home Depot's latest earnings and what it means for the market and potential investors, how do you see Home Depot's future shaping up?",1.0,0.15

MarketBeat,4a0xH-H_iVc,2024-05-07T18:06:43Z,"Palantir Stock Solid Earnings, Sudden Drop",Palantir,despite a solid earnings report paler stock took a surprising dip let's dive into the details welcome back guys let's take a look at paler Technologies today who just released earnings now they reported solid earnings and I want to hear all the details on that but first paler stock did rise about 8% before the earnings release so what do you think drove that optimism initially yeah we were just talking before we started to before we start this video and uh peners had a history of coming in better than expected and I think there were a lot of traders that were trying to get in front of that and bit up the stock before the earnings report so that they weren't caught on the wrong side of that if tenter surprised the upside right and then the results were just as expected I mean there wasn't a lot in it to to drive the market even higher we've got that big pullback now but 10% it seems big but it's really just down to a key support level I think the uptrend is still intact yeah yeah so going into that tell us more now about their performance and which if you guys would share the details of why the stock reacted negatively despite uh solid earnings well I'll let Thomas talk about the the stock price performance because he was just starting to talk about that when he gave when he finished up there the earnings report itself was was a really solid report for paler um revenue and earnings came in higher on a year-over-year basis uh earnings were more in line with estimates Revenue were was above estimates but both were higher on a year-over-year basis they were Gap profitable um for the fifth consecutive quarter and that's important because paler is trying to get included in the um in the S&P 500 so this will be another way of trying to make that happen um boy operating margins were up customer count was up just overall it was a solid report um I think what we were saying before we started taping was this earning the earnings report became a trade for the Traders and they were banking on it either going one way or the other and the report was great but maybe not the Home Run they were looking for and they sold off right I think the report was good too I'm looking at the uh the customer count the client growth commercial and government business all growing customer count up 42% um they call it remaining deal value but that's up 75% that's showing some momentum building in the backlog um government strong at 16% commercial up at 27% double the government growth so we got some good strong growth metrics here and just like we were talking about uh the market was expecting strength um they they bought into the market ahead of of the report U the report was as expected so no Catalyst for rally we get a selloff selloff looks big but we're still in line with the trend I would expect to see this stock put in some pretty good support at this level and prepare for another run higher so analyst still see paler as a golden buying opportunity what's your guys's take on this what side are you on with that yeah I tend to agree with with where uh the analysts are going from a longterm standpoint um Dan Ives of wedbush he was the person that said paler is the Lio Messi of AI and before the earnings he had reiterated his buy rating on the stock he gave it an overweight rating with a $35 price Target he described the results yesterday as a as like you were just saying Lacy as a golden buying opportunity for investors um it's a lot of this has to do with their AIP platform and the boot camps that they're using to uh gain customer share right now yeah it's it's hard to use the analyst as a gauge for this stock because uh like we're getting some revisions but not very many really for the report and for you know as much um Market attention is put on the stock um and even then their mix we have the two raising price targets like after the report but one is at hold and one's at reduce all right so still some negative sentiment in there um Market beat is showing this consensus the consensus sentiment as reduced which is still kind of wacky given the company's growth and it's trajectory um but then like Dan IES he's probably the most bullish person on on Wall Street um and he certainly sees upside in the stock and I I agree with that um I think eventually the analysts will get on board with it maybe they won't I don't know but in the end that just means volatility uh right now the trend is up when the stock is down it's usually a good time to buy it okay so Chris you mentioned this in your article for Mark beat but there are always misconceptions out there when it comes to investing so I want to hear uh what your thoughts are on this but what are the common misconceptions that you hear about investing in tech stocks like paler and is there any advice that you would give to someone that's looking to invest in paler or even similar AI technology companies well I think what you're referring to Lacy is I was I was saying in my article that you know paler there there are two clear tracks going on with paler right now there's the track that the Traders are on and there's a track that investors are on and it long-term investors excuse me and there's it this is a question where both sides can be right at the same time even though it doesn't seem like it um if you're a long-term investor there was nothing in this report that should steer you away from holding the stock perhaps adding to it especially if the stock were to drop any lower than it did in the pre-market I haven't checked it since the Market's been open but I know it was down around 21 or so when the market when the market opened it was down like 11% there's nothing here that should discourage you the customer counts up again the company is now profitable for five straight quarters and it's not looking like that's going to end anytime soon they reported slightly lower than expected fouryear growth but again nothing that a long-term investor should be concerned about on the other hand if you're a Trader the stock is fundamentally overvalued it just is I mean I don't even I don't even know what the PE is off the top of my head but it's it's objectively overvalued and Traders are going to take advantage of that they're going to take advantage of getting any profit they can when they want to take it and so if you're a long-term investor that's just a volatility that you're going to have to live with that's the price of entry in a stock like paler both sides can be right but I think if you're choosing to be a long-term investor there's nothing here that should steer you away from be doing that yeah I think the big uh the big caveat with tech stocks that we talking about is when they're young and they're new it's easy for the market to price in the total addressable Market or the total growth Outlook and the reality is that today the company is still small it still has to grow and build its it's a platform and its infrastructure to be able to support that growth so it takes time and so the market will start seeing this Avenue towards growth and shoot up and then the reality of the results will make it fall back down but right now the trajectory is positive the company is growing so all of these dips should turn out to be by the dip opportunities for long-term investors great well great analysis today guys thank you everyone for joining us as we unpacked palun latest earnings report

MarketBeat,wVidAfStIyg,2024-05-06T15:44:09Z,Amazon Stands Tall: New Highs Are in Sight,Amazon,new Highs are in sight for Amazon let's talk about the details welcome back guys let's talk about the recent developments with Amazon stock NOW Amazon recently reported strong q1 results with significant growth across all business segments so we want to talk about that but what are the key drivers that are really behind this growth well really they displayed strength in all of their Core Business segments so there's firing on all on all cylinders retail is growing AWS is growing on the retail end I would say that was probably more widening use of digital and deepening penetration of clients more so than spending growth on the consumer end but still it's growing and then AWS it grew 177% it's 17% of the revenue it's becoming a significant portion of the business and the company says that it's seeing significant demand um what did they say strong demand driven by long-term deals and larger clients so this is like a double Tailwind inside that segment so as long as they can sustain some uh some consumer in growth they should be in good shape for quite a few more years Thomas in your article you had mentioned that it's really the analysts that are going to drive Amazon to new heights so how exactly do the analysts fit into the equation here I mean what specific aspects of Amazon performance are they really finding to be the most promising well what the analysts are seeing is just what I mentioned they're firing at all cylinders all these major segments are working but they also see the company still in the early stages of its growth I mean as big as Amazon is over the last 20 years it still has Room to Grow because not everybody uses the internet not everybody uses e-commerce not everybody uses Amazon to buy all their stuff all day long Chris I want to hear you in here let's talk about uh the recent performance with Amazon how is this expected to impact Amazon's long-term strategy uh particularly we're looking at International markets and the emerging sectors here well one of the things that was uh interesting for Amazon happened right before the earnings call was they launched their own chatbot to compete with chat GPT their chatbots called Q uh that I think is something that got the analysts excited because this is an example then of a company that's not just talking about AI but they're doing something that's measurable um now Q as I understand it Q is something that's more um it's more for the internal Amazon employees so I'm I I I probably need to do a little bit more digging there but nevertheless this is something that uh that was something that analysts are going to be wanting to see from let's say another company like apple that might not be showing that and also I think um seeing Amazon launch something like that is exciting for the possibilities that might exist for an emerging sector such as blockchain technology which Amazon already has in its bag but hasn't necessarily launched in a big way one of the things I noticed in the report and I was kind of like secretly thinking man is Amazon gonna do a dividend and they didn't right and we've had quite a few of these Blue Chip tech companies do dividends because they're kind of seeing the peak of their massive growth phases Amazon is continuing to like hammer down on capex so they're still investing and I think a lot of that investment is one in their own platform but also in AWS which is you know that growth platform with AI and data centers so I think that that's probably going to continue for the next I mean few Quarters at least maybe a couple of years because the data center end is just really blossoming I mean it's huge yeah I would have been surprised if they had announced a dividend and actually I think it would have been maybe a little bit more concerning if they did I think the fact is that they had enough to report with growth in the cloud sector growth in the you know the Amazon Prime with the advertising that they're showing that they don't need to do the dividend in order to reward shareholders right now so that's that's a positive right so now let's talk about how these setting new highs uh that does come with some technical implications so can you guys kind of discuss some of the potential market dynamics that will happen if Amazon does achieve these projected prices they're talking about also how is the going to address the increasing expectations from investors and analysts this is a chart of monthly price action each one of these bars is one month of action but you can see Amazon was trending steadily higher up until 2020 and then we get that little bit of that bubble that we had the event that shall not be named but this bubble the correction the rebound this is a nice trading range and when we move Above This High that's going to be a significant technical pivot point that opens up some pretty easy to to reach targets and the first Target is just the magnitude of this run which is like from 90 to 180 $100 so we're looking at 280 but this move is also worth over 100% so the stock could rise as much as 100% from 183 given these technical projections with the analyst with the analyst leading the market I would expect to see the simple projection reached within the next year or two and uh the bull case scenario might happen over the next 5 to 10 years all right so to wrap this up what do you think that investors should be most excited about here growth growth exciting the analyst because really uh Amazon is kind of a momentum Tech stock so as long as they're keeping the market excited um investors will be excited and that should keep the stock price moving higher we hit that technical pivot and I see it trigger U triggering an influx of even more new money and that would add even more momentum yeah we're really starting to see um uh kind of a i this word gets used a lot today it's bifurcation but we're seeing a lot of that in the tech sector where um even with the chart that Thomas just showed you're seeing a lot of tech stocks that were out of favor a little while ago are now back in favor and I just think you're seeing a lot of that and right now Amazon's Amazon's in a good spot because they're showing the things that are exciting analysts right now and are going to be attracting investor money and it'll be interesting to see that compared to maybe a stock like apple to see maybe Apple's not doing that as much we'll we'll have to see and certainly Tesla would be in there as one of the ones that isn't showing analysts what they want to see right now all right well thank you everyone for tuning in for this Amazon update we'll be right back here at markab be to see

MarketBeat,OKrFU8OBqlo,2024-05-03T14:42:28Z,Time to Buy the Dip on Advanced Micro Devices Stock,Advanced Micro Devices,AMD is down 35% so now it's time to buy the dip let's talk about the details and opportunities for investors welcome back we're here to take a look at Advanced Micro Devices AMD saw it share prices rise significantly in 2023 and early 2024 fueled by expectations of an AI driven boom similar to that experienced by Nvidia however amd's share price has since Fallen by 35% from its peak Thomas what do investors need to know tell us more about these q1 results we're looking at well I think the q1 results were good they were pretty solid and what we're seeing in the charts is the bubble driven by the should say a wave more than a bubble because this is the first wave crashing in AI not so much of as a bubble that's bursting that's going to go away with this wave crashing with AI drove the stock up and uh so performance hasn't really been exceeding expectations enough to keep the stock price Rising we've had a a reset of the market but now we have these results which are still pretty solid so it seems like the market has kind of come back into alignment with reality what I see in the results is that everything is just exactly as expected but like Chris was saying a little while ago there is this bifurcation in the tech industry Tech market and you can see that in the results um AMD has four core operating segments two of them are growing two of them are Contracting resulting in near flat results y why but looking forward what we're expecting is some normalization in those two underperforming businesses to stop offsetting the growth in the two growing businesses and so sequentially throughout the year results should start to accelerate so looking at these results how does it kind of compare with Market expectations then and what are and compared to previous quarters well the company is growing but it's not growing Gang Busters the way Nvidia is but the thing is the core segments that are the most closely aligned with Nvidia are growing and that's in the data segment which is up 80% and then the client segment which is up 85% both of those segments are leaning heavily into um ai ai capabilities we have the Mi 300 chips involved in that mix as well as the ryzen chipsets the ryzen chipsets are going into a lot of computers so AMD is really like launching the first wave of um of like AI at the edge for all for all of us to be able to use on our computers now what about the guidance provided by AMD for the upcoming quarters what growth or challenges are we anticipating here and Chris I want to hear you jump in on this one our our supply chain constraints a cause for worry at all right now for investors well I'll I'll let Thomas talk about the supply chain issue and right now what the analysts are saying is that uh AMD is probably sandbagged as guidance and could potentially outperformed by a significant amount of course that has kind of the expectation for the last couple of quarters so whether or not that happens or not is yet to be seen but I think in the end it really will come down to the normalization of the of the two underperforming segments so they can stop impacting the top line as much as they are now with AMD stock at what s some analysts are considering Rock Bottom uh what buying opportunities might exist for investors let's pull up the chart right so you can see how this bubble forms right here this Aid driven bubble stock hits a peak because the market starts to get concerned that results really won't live up to the expectation we get this 35% correction but this correction is starting to show signs of support and a potentially overextended Market ready to rebound these low levels align with the analyst uh actually they're below the analyst uh lowest targets suggesting a deep value opportunity what we have going on here is just some price Discovery the market knows that AI is driving the price higher we're not sure how much higher it's going to be but this correction or the bubble and the correction both overran reality somewhere in the middle is where the stock is really valued right now over time that value should increase because revenue and earnings really are expected to start accelerating and and growing faster as soon as the next quarter and to continue accelerating into the end of the year looking ahead what would you say are some of the key indicators that investors should really be focusing on that might influence their stock performance well for AMD one of the big segments that's hurting uh hurting results right now is the gaming SE uh sector so if we see some improvement in gaming demand from other other companies that could play into to amd's uh return to growth and accelerating growth and the same thing with the embedded Market the embedded Market has had a um an inventory problem for the last couple years we thought that those inventory issues would be more resolved by now taking a little bit longer than expected but that's still supposed to happen before the end of the fiscal year so that segment should return to growth by the end of this year Chris any final thoughts you know this is one of those that this 35% pullback is a gift if you're a long-term investor in AMD because like Thomas said we're in the price Discovery phase you you you don't know necessarily where the ceiling is for AMD but you know that this that you're probably pretty close to where the floor is and this is a good opportunity to get in and buy some shares you know take a position now because again the you don't get these type of pullbacks very often so this is a good time to get in right well thank you everyone for tuning in to this update on AMD as always we'll be keeping an eye on this stock and many more right here at markby so don't forget to tune in for the latest analysis until next time we'll talk soon,1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,C5kMaOQAERo,2024-04-30T20:34:13Z,Meteoric Rise of Chipotle Mexican Grill Stock is Not Over,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"the rise of Chipotle Mexican gr stock is not over let's talk about it all right Thomas welcome back today we are discussing Chipotle stock now you have been following this stock for a while now so I know you have lots of good things to say here so let's jump right into it uh the price action in Chipotle has been smoking hot to say the least and it's not over yet I mean the 1,00% gain posted since 2017 is just the tip of the Ice Break here for this fast growing fast casual restaurant that is gaining leverage I mean it's even on the brink of running uh International expansion but they had a robust first quarter with significant gains so if you would Thomas can you break down the key factors that kind of drove this 14.1% increase in net revenue I know you have something to say also about CEO uh Brian Nichols here so let's hear it all right so that key Factor really is just one key factor and that is the CEO Brian nickel um when he took over and even still today Chipotle is just a burrito shop it's a good good burrito shop but it's just a burrito shop that exists all over the country what Chipotle does and what Brian Nichol has done is elevated the operations to a very high quality consistently and sustainably in a way that he can do across the country and that's just something that many restaurants are unable to do many of restaurants today even publicly traded ones aren't able to perform at the high level that they are and so what we're seeing today as far as results go comps are up 7% transactions and check averages are both up store count is growing and it's all being boosted by the digital presence uh store count is up 8% year-over-year they're planning to double the the North American footprint over the next you know five to 10 years so doubling the business if you use McDonald's as an example as far as what the international expansion could look like The Intern National Expansion could double the business again so what we're looking at is a potential for this business to grow by 400% over the next you know five to 10 years and that is a huge huge driver for the stock price that's why it's up 11 100% that's why I think that in the bull case scenario it could rise another 1,00% but with adjusted earnings growing by 27.3% Thomas and surpassing forecast significantly uh what do you attri contribute this strong performance to and how sustainable do you think these margins are moving forward all right so I think uh with Mr nickel the two really big focuses for him was to like kind of capture restaurant quality he took over right after they had all those so call scandals but problems with food quality and foodborn illnesses he's kind of erased that past history kind of reinvigorated the business but at the same time he leaned real hard into digital brought the company into the future so digital order tie into the chipot lanes which is really a big driver of the growth and the margins the chipot lanes are drive-thru locations but you can only order online so you have to use that digital access to get to the chipot lanes chipot lanes are improving location growth but also margins um the new store count is leaning heavily towards chipot Lane I think it's like about 90% right now of new stores include chipot Lanes remodels are focusing on building chipot LAN so the the growth driver is just the store but also the digital the margin driver is quality and also the digital those four things all really tie together and that's what we see in these results now let's talk about the upcoming stock split here Chipotle is playing a significant 50 for one stock split in June pending shareholder approval what are the expected impacts of this Thomas tell us more about these details all right so there is some bearish and some bullish implications um in the near term the uh the promise of a stock split is helping the stock price to rise now people are buying into this news when the stock split happens if it does happen we'll probably get a pullback in the price action because it'll be a sell the news event but also all these extra shares will be on the market will be a lot of opportunity for people to take profits now what I see is in this scenario stock price runs up we get the split we get a pullback in prices that's going to be a very opportune time to start building a position or adding to a position if you already have one because I really do see potential for quadruple digit gains over the next five to 10 years because of the growth strategy well why don't you pull the chart for us here Thomas and let's take a look at the technical Outlook the Chipotle story is such a big story that it's really best seen on the monthly charts that's a very long-term chart view but you can see over here this is just before Mr nickel took over the companies had struggles with its foodborn illnesses he takes over and all of a sudden the company just starts taking off and the pandemic really had a lot to do with that as well people looking for that social distancing getting some good food away from the house and still still social distancing but this Rally from here to here is what's really important this is that big 11 100% gain you have a nice consolidation and the market right here broke out so the simple projection is just to project um the price gain for this rally to this breakout point which gives a target of $3500 which is right about here and that aligns with the analyst sentiment so I would expect to see the market reach 3500 pretty soon but longer term with that $3,500 price Target if we get a pivot above that that will bring in the bull case scenario which is a potential for an 1100 per gain from this level down here which puts the stock I mean well well above where it is now looking ahead Thomas what are the biggest challenges that chipotle faces in maintaining this growth trajectory what do investors need to keep their eye on I think really the biggest risk might be growing too much too fast um it's happened in the past for some other companies they just invest too much in growth end up taking on uh too much overhead too much dead weight it takes them a little while to digest those gains um that's totally possible for Chipotle so I would just keep a lookout for the growth metrics um and just um yeah watch out for that well thank you everyone for joining us in this discussion on Chipotle's impressive growth and strategic initiatives Chipotle is not just heating up the grill but also the stock market with its ambitious plans and robust performance.",1.0,0.9

We aren't talking Nvidia today uh instead we're talking about other ways that investors and Traders can cash in on AI. How do you maybe uh go about finding other fast moving AI stocks outside of Nvidia? AI is is it's being integrated into every single industry it's not just Nvidia it's not just chipmakers it's not just Microsoft it's not just Google. What I joke about all the time is hey you know what if you if you gave me you know nvidia's earnings um for a quarter down the road and and was just it wasn't like anything amazing just getting into the numbers I wouldn't really be able to turn that into a trade but if you show me a chart I can instantly tell you hey that's something I like or that's something that I don't like. For example Nvidia right this very minute isn't really you know doing much it's it's just sort of hanging out it's had this huge run this year it's up what Almost 100% in 2024 but right now it's just sort of in a consolidation paas so we don't really have a lot of trades in Nvidia. One of these other names that I just mentioned this VRT which is sort of like a brick-and mortar AI play um they provide the cooling systems that cool these massive AI systems um they're having a great run right now as people start to realize hey you know what there's more to just Nvidia in this AI craze.

MarketBeat,IGws-7r_N0U,2024-04-26T18:49:13Z,Alphabet Stock is Surging,Alphabet,alphabet has announced its first ever dividend alongside impressive earnings report signaling a new chapter for the tech giant. alphabet stock reported last night and they got a much needed win from its first quarter earnings report. Shares are up more than 11% in premarket trading um after the tech giant announced its first ever dividend. apple or alphab excuse me delivered a great uh earnings report beat on the top and bottom lines they raised their guidance. now they're all opened up to Google that might be part of this rush in prices and the repo again too good but it's not awesome 70 billion is a lot of money for me and you but it's only like 1.75% of the market cap because it's divided between Class A and Class C shares it's not all going to one share share group you know know so it's good but it's not a a Tailwind to drive the stock 10% higher especially when I see in the results this is just ongoing business it's not ai ai is still not really like bloomed for Google yet. earnings have not been a problem for alphabet same was true in this earnings report from them um they reported significant earnings beat this quarter. so Revenue wasn't that much of a beat on the top line um on the bottom line they they posted a181 in earnings per share that was 26% higher than estimates and it was 54% higher year-over-year so again earnings not a huge problem here for the company going forward. given meta because Google's Core Business kind of aligns with metas they're about traffic and ads and so this revenue is all about search and YouTube and then the margins are about cost control that also kind of aligns with meta's story they've been leaning into efficiency and that's driving results more so than like the rise of AI so the first quarter of 2024 has been bit of an ey sore for the company I mean they uh debuted their Gemini generative AI model to some criticism as you mentioned in your article Chris but the model produced some historically inaccurate images so can you tell us a little bit more about the concerns with this company how do they plan to maintain leadership in AI technology I mean alphabet is taking measures to cut costs while they're also increasing Capital expenditures particularly in AI of course. the growth in the earnings report really came from their core businesses it was came from their search it came from YouTube it came from the cloud. they're expecting AI to be a much more part uh vital part of all of their core businesses that's what they're saying to justify the AI spend which they say they're still a leader in. one of the one of the interesting things to watch for investors will be to see how alphabet positions this if AI starts to take over a larger part of their search business that could also start hurting their ad driven business because if be you know because they'll be they'll be making less money from the ads because the AI will be taking over more of the search component there but this is a this is a tight RPP that they're going to be walking but again the company still believes that AI is where they're going to go and it's going to drive that Core Business over time. I wouldn't think that Google had back burnard AI but they might be taking a less frontf footed approach with it you know after their missteps right. Google's plans to increase capex aligns with that um so again it's just a a future story and not really a today story for AI and Google. Focus Shift from moonshot moonshot projects in favor of more immediate growth drivers for alphabet. Google is showing some of the same things in the current quarter they're doing the cost cutting they're they're reducing headcount now some of that might be because they're replacing those jobs with AI but still they're showing that we can do some disciplined cost cutting and it's not it doesn't all have to just be about growth growth growth growth growth all the time. Google is trying to establish its place in the AI world where right now it's being dominated by Nvidia and Microsoft and to a lesser extent companies like Oracle. right now alphabet doesn't necessarily have as much to show on that end so it makes sense for them to also be saying we're going to reward shareholders in other ways. continued integration of AI into into Google search I think that'll be kind of an interesting thing to watch. the US Department of Justice is looking into Google as far as did they sign unfair contracts uh that are giving them a competitive Advantage those will be things to watch but I think really it's going to be more of the same for alphabet it's going to be showing investors that they can actually you know do both the growth and the shareholder value thing over time. well thank you everyone for joining us today to unpack alphabet's earnings report stay on top of this stock with us right here at Market be.,1.0,0.4

MarketBeat,eIKDy97xEN8,2024-04-25T20:06:14Z,Mega Market Reset for Meta Platforms Stock,Meta Platforms,"there's been a Mega Market reset for meta platform stock let's talk about the details welcome back guys meta platforms released earnings and it has outperformed expectations with a solid quarter give us a quick details here yeah right I didn't really see anything wrong with the report uh my take is they' gain leverage times three we've got increased users we've got increased ad delivery and we've got increased Revenue per ad all three of those things plus the to efficiency gave us a significant Improvement in margins 1,300 basis points for the operating margin I mean that's a huge number for a tech company um generating generating Oodles of cash flow um I think that they're set up well this is really is a knee-jerk reaction to news I think and uh it is a market reset that should lead again to higher prices. okay now so despite strong q1 results meta saw a 15% correction in its share price what factors have contributed to this Market reaction here and how are we going to address those concerns going forward well right I think Chris has an interesting point I'll let him get to that in a second uh but for me it was the guidance in the capital uh capex so guidance was in line with expectations the market really wanted it to be better than expectations you know the secret whisper number and then they were increasing capex uh the results support the increase in capex but the market take is that it's costing more to get AI going than they thought AI is not producing that performance they were expecting and so the AI can has kind of been kicked down the road until next year yeah I I noticed all the things that Thomas was saying last night when after meta reported then this morning we have the GDP the first read on first quarter GDP came in lighter than expected and sure enough the yield for the 10-year bond went up significantly uh that to me signals that there's a flight to safety uh tech stocks are always going to be the first ones to get hit I don't know if the market was anticipating that last night when the selloff started but I think it's going to likely continue to pressure meta stock as well as other tech stocks here in the short term. all right let's take a look at the analyst perspective here how does meta kind of uh interpret the mixed signal from analysts some are trimming targets others are uh projecting significant stock price increases what are your guys's thoughts on this well right my take with the analysts is that it's mostly bullish I mean we do have some price Target reductions in play but the range of these new targets implies a at consensus or higher price target with the market reset we're looking at 20% upside at consensus with a Chance of 50% at the high end so again we just give the market a chance to digest this news and get a new base we should see the uptrend resume and some new highs set maybe by the end of the year yeah institutional investors you know they're going to be wanting to make their numbers in the second quarter if you've got tech stocks that already close to where they were projecting them to be that the stocks only have one way to go and that's down in order for them to pop back up later on and I think that's what's going on with meta here. well let's take a look at the a long term Vision now here how does meta platforms plan to sustain its Market leadership amid rapid technological advancements that we're seeing um there's also been kind of an increased competition within the social media sector right well yes social media has always been super competitive but uh meta is really um entrenching itself behind its moat and that was one of the big takeaways from the analyst chatter was that the lean into AI is really helping to the company to sustain that moat and so it should help protect it over time. okay guys so given the volatility uh that we've seen and the potential 100% increase in stock price over the next let's say 12 to 18 months what should investors know about investing in meta right now I mean with a potential Rebound in meta stock on the horizon what do we need to watch specifically well I think the market has entered a weight and C mode um it looks like they're buying the dip today there's some pretty solid support at today's lows above some critical support levels but I would expect to see some volatility over the next few weeks or months simply because of market conditions nothing to do with meta You add in The Meta St the volatility might be a little bit more pronounced but I think it's a buy on the dip and hold it till it rips higher you can see right here the market peaked ahead of the earnings report and this peak aligns with the analyst consensus which right now is predicting about 20% upside this candle here certainly looks pretty negative we've got a tower reversal in play but we're already showing support right here at the 150-day moving average now let's look at the daily chart and you can see pretty strong buying here on that average it looks like this level at the bottom of this Gap is pretty solid support I would expect to see this Market consolidate in this range and then possibly move Higher by the end of the year.",1.0,0.7

MarketBeat,MjVUZbWZ5_w,2024-04-24T18:48:33Z,The Bottom is in For Tesla: Watch This Before Buying the Bounce,Tesla,Tesla released q1 earnings yesterday what is Elon up to now let's talk about it all right guys Tesla reported earnings yesterday after the bell and there were some maybe good things if you want to say that mixed in with bad things um but Shares are up more than 10% following the q1 earnings release and they may move higher here but Thomas you are saying that investors should not expect a sustained rally here instead they should only be uh expecting volatility so what is this I mean you kind of referred to it as a relief rally can you tell us what you mean by that and I guess what are the drivers with that right so this is totally a a relief rally the market has been selling off on fears of Eevee slow downs and Tesla's inability to widen margin and price Wars and uh they was just waiting for any any excuse to to rebound and to rally and so this is just a natural occurrence within what I see to be like a bare Market I don't see really anything good in the report except for some comments by Elon Musk and the company all of these comments are really forward-looking there's a lot of big wha ifs um I don't see them impacting result materially until like the middle of next year if ever so I think it's just a lot of smok and mirrors on the part of Elon Musk kind of pointing attention away from this year's weakness to what might be good next year next year is a real big Maybe I don't see this rally as being sustainable okay so let's talk about that more I mean to some investors excitement Tesla said it's going to be accelerating the launch of some new vehicles I mean there's Buzz about the model 2 coming and some other new products but there's not really a timeline for that so yeah as you said I mean could just be all talk so I do want to talk about Elon and all of this obviously it seems like he's trying very hard to control The Narrative of course um I mean in the earnings call it seems like he's stressing the fact that yes Tesla does sell cars uh but the ultimate goal for them is to become an AI robotics company so what do you guys what are what's your take on that I mean we've been talking offline about how it seems like Tesla when things get bad he just he says something to try to get the stock to pop tell us more about this well one of the things about an earnings report is that the CEO kind of has a captive audience and that plays very well to what Elon does very well which is it gives him an opportunity to lay out his vision for what he sees Tesla being and if you're somebody that believes in that Vision that's very reassuring because that's what investors want to hear they want to hear that there is a plan and Elon will clearly lay out that plan now the question is the devil is always in the details and Elon Musk has always struck me is somebody that doesn't necessarily pay strict attention to timelines and details when it's details that don't seem important to him in the moment and that's where I think I agree with Thomas this is ultimately it's a relief R because ultimately when investors have a chance to digest this earnings report they'll find out that there's not much there in the short term right and just speaking like to the model two specifically right this is something that's been in the yeah Whispers The Wings whatever for years and years and years last year they back bured it they've been trying to get a cheap car for all this time hav been able to unable to produce one back bured this program now all of a sudden it's back and they're going to be able to produce it ahead of schedule yeah right okay so I don't discount that uh Elon will be able to do this do the AI do the robo taxis but when is the question and between then and now this year is going to be all about Contracting Revenue tightening margins and negative cash flow so it does seem like there's kind of a lot of lip service let's say about these uh new upcoming projects for Tesla so I'm just kind of curious like how long do you guys think that this can kind of Trail investors along I mean at some point like three or four times that they hear this and it hasn't happened are they going to drop off like what do you guys pick how how long do you think Elon can keep this going like that probably for a long time because he can produce and he does produce Tesla produces it's great it's a good story one of these things will happen over the next year or two or three years which one how many how well is the question so I think what we're talking about really here with Tesla Chris might or might not agree it's not so much the company so much as the market and musk there's the Elon mus Factor we've always talked about there's his true believers when he says jump they're going to follow when the company stumbles the market will sell off and it's going to be volatility until it regains traction which might next year it might not be yeah I think Tesla to me it's kind of interesting because it's one of the most heavily traded stocks I think that's fair to say Thomas oh for sure but it's also to me the real value in Tesla I suppose is if you're taking a long position in the company and if you're taking a long position then then I guess a one quarter's earnings versus another quarter's earnings doesn't really matter because you're banking on the fact that at some point Tesla is going to have its Nvidia moment it's going to have its it's Microsoft moment and it's just going to be one of these stocks that's going to be one of the stocks that you wish you would have boughten at well right you know you should have bought at a certain level those people that are investing in Tesla with that value proposition can hang on for longer than any of us believe they can right but those people should be targeting dips not chasing the price action and today if you're chasing price action I think you might get whipsaw into a loss as early as tomorrow correct okay so now we have seen a mix of reactions from analysts with many lowering their price targets so how should investors read into these kind of varied options or opinions excuse me right so I think with the analyst their response kind of aligns with the whole idea of volatility um they're very mixed some up some down there's was an upgrade I think and some downgrades so it's like they're not totally sure what's going on we've got some people poo pooing today some people cheering for tomorrow but what we're really seeing I think is that range is narrowing right uh we're trying in the discovery like long-term discovery of Tesla what it's worth there's always been a big wide range of analy targets and that range is slowly Contracting and shrinking and sooner or later it'll get narrowed down to the point where this is what Tesla is worth and then we can say okay now they're going to start to regain traction again now we can actually have a sustainable rally uh but until then then I think that we're still just looking at volatility yeah I think you make a really good point Thomas about valuation because investors have I think investors have known for a long time that Tesla's an overvalued car company oh for yeah right but Tesla's always said we're more than a car company Elon Musk stressed that in the in the earnings report last night that it's a tech company I think the problem for investors right now is that some analysts are starting to say okay you're a tech company but you're an overvalued tech company and now it's up to Tesla to prove that thesis wrong right and that's the whole thing about being a car company is like they're more than a car company they're an ecosystem right but it's a transportation ecosystem that relies on cars so it's a car company right so all right so given the volatile nature of Tesla's stock and kind of the speculative elements of its valuation we kind of touched on this but what should uh investors realistically expect in terms of stock performance and the company's growth and let's say the short to medium term here H shortterm for sure volatility I don't see a sustained rally medium-term we might see that volatility result in a bottom right now the stock is kind of trading at a solid support level you might want to target that to buy into the stock but I think that you would want to wait for the short to medium term to see how that plays out because there's also a kind of a downtrend in play over the last six or eight months that could take it to a new low so really this is a a wait and see time for me I think All right well thank you everyone for tuning in on Tesla's q1 earnings uh update here and what lies ahead for the company

MarketBeat,i14wR_m_UpQ,2024-04-19T20:23:10Z,"Buy the Dip in Netflix Stock, It Won’t Last Long",Netflix,Netflix shares fell 5% following the q1 earnings release opening up a solid buying opportunity for investors let's talk about it welcome back guys Netflix shares fell 5% following the q1 release and the guidance update which is opening a buying opportunity that will not last long as you're saying Thomas so give us a quick update here and then we'll kind of dig into it what's going on right I think it was really a strong report all the way around they beat on the top and the bottom line subscriber growth was good margins widen significantly free cash lows up double digits I want to say operating income up 54% that's huge this is really a really good report I think the thing that has the market moving lower is that guidance even though it was raised it's a little bit light on the top end and then the shift in uh in reporting strategy so um some knee-jerk reaction I think to otherwise a good report yeah okay so you just briefly mentioned this but Netflix did announce that they have added over 9 million subscribers but then they also announced that they've decided to stop reporting subscriber numbers which kind of shocked Wall Street just a little bit I mean investors aren't really happy about this announcement it seems like it's been one of the metrics that people have really cared about so they don't want to see that go um it looks like even with this good report the stock actually fell 4% that we saw after hours maybe because of this announcement what is your take on this in the whole kind of business model evolved in here well right I think this was kind of in inevitable they they stopped um giving guidance I think it was last year and that's part of the business's um maturity um it's no longer a Growth Company it's more of a mature Blue Chip Tech stock its revenue is impacted by far more things than just Revenue growth or by subscriber growth and this is just a shift in the direction to get the market kind of away from that um but yeah I don't really see it as as a big as a big deal um so like I said before I think this really is a knee-jerk reaction to some news ultimately the company is in fine shape uh but I I do think that Chris disagrees with me on that yeah I would I would say it's not so much a question of disagreeing with you first of all I I I totally agree with you about the market reaction to the report I think this was a classic uh sell the news earnings report I think the market was looking for any reason to just take a little bit off the top of Netflix so that they can dive into it later at a better price um as far as the subscriber numbers go so I understood last year why they stopped issuing a forecast for subscriber numbers this to me seems a little bit um I I don't know I I don't like it when the company's basically telling you we'll tell you what to evaluate us on don't evaluate us on this and that seems to me to be what Netflix is doing they're saying don't look at our subscriber numbers why well because we're telling you not to look at our subscriber numbers which which is just seems a little odd to me I don't I think Netflix understands why they're doing it and it makes sense to me but at the same time why not just report your subscriber numbers let us know down below what you think about this are you mad that they're not reporting subscriber numbers do you kind of think that it doesn't matter we want to hear from you uh but let's take a look further into margin news and guidance here uh margin news is maybe the brightest spot in the report guidance is solid uh what do investors need to know here yeah I think right right now the thing investors should focus on is the cash flow the cash flow is improving significantly they're using that to reinvest in the business versus funding it from external means uh they recently acquired credit uh credit quality investment quality credit ratings um so they're leaning into that trying to improve their balance sheet even more in that regard another change that they had made with some of their financial metrics and they're going to um they increase their revolving credit facility to improve liquidity that's not necessarily a bad thing it's not a sign of any kind of danger just them trying to access of more available cash for improved cash efficiency so I think long term it's just all good news to me one metric that I would be paying attention to would be uh their continued spend on content one of the things that perhaps Bulls were looking for was Netflix suggesting that they were be putting a harder cap on that kind of spending and the only thing that they said I believe I'm right Thomas is that they said they're going to they're going to cap it in the sense that they're going to make sure the content spend doesn't exed Revenue but they're not necessarily going to cap content spend yeah I mean they're a Content company so they're going to have to continue to invest in that so I think that's something that investors are going to want to watch yes but don't ever expect content spending to go away no right right right yeah so um but that's part of the that that's a concern I guess I would say if you're on one side of the Netflix camp or the other is this is a business that requires a lot takes a lot of money to generate that content totally and that's kind of where a lot of the margin gains came from all of them there was some uh some attribution to the timing of spending on content so right certainly they're going to spend that money sooner or later but hopefully it all right comes it to the bottom line okay now let's talk about the analysts here how have analysts reacted to Netflix's latest earnings report um and what are their kind of expectations for the stocks performance moving forward well right I would say that the response so far has been mixed but mixed in that way that's actually good for the stock um I think we tracked five or six revisions so far two of them were negative one was a downgrade to hold but its price Target is above consensus one was a lowered price Target the lower Target the new Target is still above consensus the other four that we're tracking so far include an upgrade with a price Target increase and three other price Target increases that have lifted the consensus Target by 10% just in the last 30 days so we definitely have upward bias and the analyst sentiment they are leading the market higher so that totally plays into the idea that this is a buy the dip opportunity yeah so let's consider their Market position here what risks does Netflix face at its current stock price level and maybe let's look at what could trigger a rebound or maybe a further decline here well I think the biggest risk that I see was just the valuation trading at 35 times earnings ahead of the report the market certainly wanted to see a more robust guidance than it did so we maybe have a little bit of price multiple contraction going on I think some other major tech companies have also pulled back from that high level um so kind of in line with market conditions right now again I think this is a buy the dip opportunity because looking forward earnings will grow looking towards next year the p&amp; is like 27 or 28 times earnings so there certainly is some leeway in there for the market to kind of contract a little today in order to make those gains for tomorrow I agree with Thomas there I think you know there's no doubt that Netflix is not is going to be the leader in this I heard it said the other day I thought it was pretty funny they said you don't really hear about the streaming Wars anymore because Netflix just won so right all right well thank you everyone for joining us for this update on Netflix as always don't forget us don't forget to let us know your thoughts on this investment in the comments down below otherwise

MarketBeat,dPwC0zkH_EE,2024-04-18T19:18:05Z,"Easy Growth Over for Tesla, Stock Driving Lower",Tesla,as Tesla gears up for its first quarter earnings report next week amid a turbulent period of layoffs and high valuation here's what investors can expect welcome back guys we've been a little quiet on Tesla lately here on this channel so I think it's time for a little quick update let's start with stock confidence Tesla's stock is at a yearly low what turnaround do you expect from the upcoming earnings report yeah not really a lot to tell you the truth I mean right now the analysts are lower ing their targets they're expecting some contraction in the top and the bottom line they may still be overestimating their results there have been a lot of price cuts a lot of price pressure some industry pullback uh Elon musk's own warning um I think that the results could be disappointing all right following the recent layoffs and executive resignations how are these changes going to impact Tesla's operational strength and maybe the market perception as well you know I the market generally investors don't like uncertainty they don't like noise around a company and or I should say especially negative noise around the company and that's Tesla's got a lot of that right now um that makes that makes it kind of difficult when you're looking at getting in or starting a position in Tesla if you don't already have one uh it's just there's a lot of news going on around Tesla and none of it's very good it doesn't necessarily mean that any of it's necessarily bad but there's just a lot of noise right now right yeah I'm looking at the layoffs and it includes two Executives and what I see is just like the the Heyday of of Elon Musk Tesla's growth are over it's no longer just grow grow grow ramp ramp ramp produce it's okay we've reached the top of the market the addressable market for now and we've kind of got a pullback to align with this and that's undercutting the eveve story that's a story that we've been talking about all this year just the EV Market is it's crapped out I mean it's hit a top it's not growing um Tesla obviously is contracting because of the price Wars that are ongoing so you know again I'm not really expecting a whole lot of good news out of this report the party's over is what you're saying right the easy growth is over I think Lacy I think that's I I I hear what Thomas is saying and I would say I think it's the easy growth is over as we're kind of figuring out where the EV Market is in the United States and globally and now Tesla's having to make some moves that mature companies would make to make sure their earnings stay in line with what shareholders expect okay now Tesla's valuation is currently 40 times its projected 2025 earnings what justifies this High valuation do you guys think in your point of view well really nothing does because they're not growing right now they're Contracting so the Valu a is also projecting a lot of growth that hasn't come and a pivot back to growth that we're not sure when's going to happen so I see that valuation as a problem a headwind for the market that plays into what we'll probably talk about next which is the analysts so with analysts cutting targets and Tesla being one of the most downgraded stocks are there any other specific factors you guys think that are contributing to the negative sentiment here well I think what we're talking about in general is the big Market reset we were just talking before we begin shooting analyst consensus is still projecting about 30% upside for the stock but it's a very wide range of targets and the entire range is coming down we have a lot of downgrades a lot of price Target revisions right now Tesla is amongst Market beats lowest rated stocks which means it has the highest percentage of low ratings of any other stock on the platform it's among the most downgraded stocks um and while that pressure is pressuring the market it's just going to keep the market moving lower and right now the price action is sitting on a pretty critical technical res uh support Zone if that level breaks the market could really start to fall I think you've got two things going on right now with Tesla is you've got a group of committed investors who are who bought into the thesis a long time ago that Tesla is more than a car company and then you've also got the people right now that are selling off because it's an expensive car company if that's your thesis then you're going to keep selling that's a great Point Chris I do want to just say uh leave a comment down below let us know what side of this that you're on uh go ahead Thomas well right just again we talking about you talking about Kathy Wood and she's really committed to Tesla and there's we've said ourselves the Elon Musk factor in all the parts of the company that aren't cars so back to the idea of a market reset the market is resetting on the idea that the Eevee part of the business is played all right it's here it's established it can make money the wild growth days are over we're resetting for the next phase of growth that even Elon said himself as part of the the workforce reduction setting up for that next phase of growth which will include the AI that you mentioned Chris and Robotics and all the other you know science fiction type things that Elon Musk and Tesla get into right so given the likelihood of uh retesting recent loads do you think Tesla stock will reach new lows in the near future I think it could so right we can see Tesla hits a peak here middle of last year it's been trending lower ever since we've been talking about the analyst lowering their consensus estimates putting pressure on the market and we're sitting right here on this multi-year low as long as this headwind and downward pressure continues to pressure the market there's a risk that this level will break if it breaks we could see Tesla move down to $100 real fast and if that level breaks it can go down to 50 I don't think it's going to go down to 50 but I definitely see a chance for it retesting $100 well thank you everyone for joining us as we unpacked the complexities that are facing Tesla today we're providing a clear perspective on its immediate challenges and the future trajectory of this stock,1.0,-0.8

MarketBeat,a-mZuOKedFc,2024-04-16T16:38:49Z,7 Cheap Dividend Stocks Offering Value and Price Upside,Starbucks,okay well you also have Starbucks on this list Chris Starbucks showed resilience through pricing power uh despite commodity price hikes that we saw but how important is the company's ability to manage costs and maintain margins for dividend investors well it's crucial La see and you know pricing power only goes so far and Starbucks is showing that they're working both ends of it yes they are increasing their prices a little bit as anybody that's gone to Starbucks knows but they're also working on the back end to make sure they're containing their cost so that that earnings growth is sustainable that's a key word here is it's got to be sustainable uh as we go through this cycle where companies are trying to manage through inflation just as consumers are trying to manage through it so Starbucks has shown the ability to do that and their stock um actually it's been um going down here still in the short term but I think that's more of uh that's more of being affected by the overall commodity news that cycle May turn around and when it does I think Starbucks is going to be a great opportunity and you can buy it now at a lower price and still get that dividend,1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,a-mZuOKedFc,2024-04-16T16:38:49Z,7 Cheap Dividend Stocks Offering Value and Price Upside,Big Five Sporting Goods,okay now considering Big Five Sporting Goods uh they cut its dividend twice so what signals should investors watch for that might indicate a dividend stock is becoming maybe less attractive yeah so I've I've been harping on the fact that you know you're looking ideally for companies that are growing their dividend so people might say okay you're being you're being hypocritical to put a company in here that's cut their dividend but one of the things that stood out to me with big five is the company did cut their dividend and they didn't just cut it once they cut it twice but they did so with the idea of cleaning up their balance sheet and they've done that and this company just looks right now they're trading at Penny Stock levels it kind of looks one of those situations where it's kind of so good so bad I should say that it's probably good um you don't ideally you would rather see the company not having to cut their dividends but if they did cut their dividends you like to see that they've used it for some productive purpose and now the business looks better it looks in fundamentally better shape and as com other companies have shown like ocidental petroleum you can catch up with those dividend payments relatively quickly but you have to get your balance sheet in good shape,1.0,0.5

MarketBeat,PcOcOn-r__c,2024-04-11T16:35:44Z,Delta Air Lines Stock Should Take Flight After Solid Report,Delta Air Lines,today we are soaring Into the Heart of the aviation sector to unravel the success story behind Delta Airlines remarkable quarter let's get started welcome back guys today we are covering Delta Airlines who has recently made headlines with a report of a record quarter start us off here what do you guys think were the key factors contributing to this unprecedent success here well it's a couple of factors in play there's normalization of the travel market after this huge event that we've just gotten through but also Delta is the Premier premium flight line and they're working hard at optimization and efficiency so they're being and I think they said it in their in their own report it's a time of normalization and optimization kind of coming together in sync yeah Delta I one of the specific things I noticed Thomas in your article was that Delta was commenting that business travel is part of that normalization they're seeing they're seeing um higher spending on business business travel which is a huge Money Maker for the Airlines and Delta also seeing a strong growth in in international travel which as everybody knows that's been very popular right now as consumers have been able to travel again right I think that was one of the very first things they said in their report was just to point out that all three of these segments are firing on all cylinders we've got retail travel business and um and international flights all really strong but let's look ahead here Delta is guiding for significant growth uh can you guys elaborate a little bit on maybe the specific strategies that are in place to achieve these targets that they have and how might these initiatives impact the market well right they're they're focusing on their their core profit drivers and their core Revenue drivers which are those three segments we just talked about but also premiumization they're doing a lot of Premium add-ons for their flights and services um in the airports that are driving a lot of their revenue growth right well let's move on to their Financial Health here the report did highlight that Delta had solid cash flow which is enabling debt reduction of course Capital return how does the company kind of uh plan to balance the reinvestment in the business with shareholder returns I mean I mean right now they're they're trying to focus on investing in the business while improving the balance sheet and improving the balance sheet plays into the the forward outlook for shareholder returns they took on a lot of debt during the pandemic they're trying to pay it down their leverage ratio was down below 3x now it's going to fall further this year they're planning to pay down another three billion in debt what this is going to do is raise their credit quality rating for The Debt that they want to issue to investment grade that's a huge bonus for the business but also free up cash flow so they can pay the dividend you know they' reinstated the dividend it hasn't been brought back to its prior level but they could do that within the next year or so and that will be another big uh Catalyst for the share price all right well analysts have now labeled Delta stock as a deep value in your guys's perspective Chris Thomas what has changed in the Market's perception here and how might Delta capitalize on this revised Outlook I mean what do you think yeah well you know everybody's calling this a stock Pickers market and I think for if investors really want to see a good example of that Delta's a really good example of that uh I was looking at something that said in one of the airline ETFs I don't remember which one Delta is like the largest single holding of that ETF like over 11% of the ETF is in Delta and it's it it really is one of it's the best stock in what's been kind of a bad neighborhood over the last few years and Delta just keeps on for all of the reasons Thomas said they're the ones that continue to grow revenue and grow earnings in this period And I think that's and now the dividend is starting to come back into play which is I think the reason why analysts are getting so excited about it right what's interesting and we talked about we talked about this before in previous videos and this morning that you know Delta has been producing these kind of results for over a year this Outlook is not just emerging now the analysts have been bullish on this stock for a year it has tried to achieve liftoff several times over the last 18 months and just failed to do it who knows why exactly I mean right now it's trading below the analyst lowest Target so it should be moving higher but yet it still isn't able to get above that resistance point I think there's just some kind of a hang-up in the market um technical it could just be some overhang of people that are trying to you know trim their losses or whatever from before but I think eventually this critical pivot where the market is now it's going to fall it's going to get broken down we'll see a significant shift to the upside and when that happens there should be a good momentum play as new money floods into the market Chris you had just mentioned the dividend briefly um I want to talk about that the reinstatement and expected aggressive increases of Delta's dividend is definitely noteworthy so tell us more about that guys Thomas you go ahead right I mean the dividend is not that that big right now but we're talking about like a 50 to 100% increase when they're able to do it so when they do that that's going to be a big sign of the company's Health it's will have been it will have completed its turnaround it's it's recovery from the pandemic and it will open the door to the future of Delta which is just a big blue chip solid cash flow producing um investment grade quality debt dividend payer yeah now Thomas you are saying that Delta is undervalued so what leads you to this what are kind of the key indicators or metrics at the Market is overlooking right now well trading at seven times its earnings uh with the leverage ratio that it has the expectations for debt reduction investment quality debt and dividends I think that it could easily trade at Double its current valuation and that just plays into the analyst sentiment analyst consensus um is like 15 or 20% upside I think the low end of the range is like five or six% upside so this stock really should be moving higher it just needs something to push it over that edge so that it can uh break past the resistance point and start advancing again yeah so I'm sorry La go ahead say mentioning uh that resistance it uh the potential resistance is at the $52 level so what kind of uh main risk or challenges are facing Delta right now to kind of they are staying at that critical turning point so what now well I was just gonna say Lacy I think one of the one of the issues that might be um impacting investor sentiment maybe not analyst sentiment is they're concerned about not so much what Delta reported this quarter but what they're going to report next quarter and in the quarters to come Delta affirmed their guidance so that was good I mean they didn't they didn't lower their guidance for the year but they didn't increase it either which some investors were hoping for and I think they didn't increase it because of fuel costs um we talked about it when we did their video on the CPI energy is the big story that's going to hit jet fuel as much as it's going to hit diesel fuel as much as it's going to hit the gasoline that we put in our cars and I'm not sure if investors are confident that Delta's going to be able to keep up this rate as that starts to factor into their future earnings reports right you know they forecast solid demand for the summer and a good back half of the year but there's this whole inflation interest rate fomc thing hanging over the market the market is expecting a broad economic shift in the back half of the year that is predicated on fomc interest rates and right now the CPI does not say that we're going to get a rate cut in in the summer and that's going to impact the back half Outlook including Delta so like what Chris is saying I think investors might really want to see that we're able to get into the summer and get past this next hiccup which will be the fomc telling us that we're not going to get a rate cut until the fall all right guys so looking Beyond immediate financials here where do you see Delta in the next five years oh higher for sure because in within five years interest rates will have cut economic stability will have happened we will have entered the next like recovery phase of economic acceleration and that should be a huge driver of growth and profits for Delta yeah I'm probably I I tend to agree with Thomas I tend to be a little bit more cautious about it but I tend to be more cautious about Airline stocks in general um if I had a crystal ball and you could tell me what the uh what the political Outlook was going to look like for the next four years as opposed to this four years I might be a little bit more optimistic because if I look at Delta over the last five years they've never been able to get back up to their pre-pandemic High yeah and as Thomas was saying we don't really know why but that area around 5052 has been a firm point of resistance even after this last earnings report it should be moving higher and I think to for all the reasons that Thomas said in the next five years you would expect that you're going to see a more um you're going to start seeing more uh normalization if I will with the economic data you're going to see we're either going to adjust to the interest rates where they are or the interest rates are going to be lower so you would think that yes the outlook for Delta is higher I'm just not quite as sure but you're looking at a company like Delta that is committing to shareholder value and that's a great reason to own the stock like I said in a in a stock Pickers Market this looks like one of the better Airline stocks you can own when you have a lot of other Airline stocks that I wouldn't even be wanting to touch right now right well great discussion today on the challenges and opportunities ahead for Delta Airlines to our viewers we hope this has offered you a deeper understanding of the aviation industry's Dynamics and Delta's ambitious path forward,1.0,0.85

MarketBeat,pal1aWf9nJE,2024-04-10T15:32:24Z,Inflation Heats Up: Unpacking the Latest CPI Surprise,Federal Reserve,what we're really talking about here though now and the risk for the market is the fomc Chris can comment on this too yeah the market is expecting the fomc or has been expecting the fomc to start cutting rates in June or July that will Mark a significant economic shift and pivot hopefully to re accelerate some activity but they don't need to re accelerate activity if it's already causing such high inflation so right now the risk is that the fomc will not cut rates over the summer and they might not cut rates again at all this year and that just means that the back half outlook for the S&P 500 and earnings growth is garbage and that could cause a real big uh stock market correction I do not think it's going to hit the fed's target of 2% soon or on their target timeline it may linger around this I I don't know if it goes significantly higher than this three and a half but I don't see it I mean forget about getting down to 2% I'm not sure it gets down below 3% anytime soon oddly the S&P 500 may be able to continue rallying because the economy is still solid we still producing solid economic growth the big negative is inflation right so right now the economy and the market is racing with the FED towards this idea of interest rate Cuts in this situation any signs of Market weakness economic weakness means the FED can step in and cut rates or do some other kind of stimulus to help reinvigorate the economy which to me means the fed put is in place which should help keep the market rallying higher I personally don't think if I were them I would be counting on a rate cut um I kind of think the fed's going to hold the line on rate Cuts I think they're going to be looking at some other things Thomas uh Don and I were talking before the video I think you're going to want to look at the FED balance sheet and what they might be trying to do there as far as trying to take care of some of the government debt problems in other ways but that's a that's a topic for another video,1.0,-0.2
MarketBeat,pal1aWf9nJE,2024-04-10T15:32:24Z,Inflation Heats Up: Unpacking the Latest CPI Surprise,Government,there's just simply a lot of government money going into the system there's still a lot of stimulus coming in in the form of when you looked at the jobs report last April or last month excuse me um well actually last Friday if you want to get right down to it uh still about a quarter of the jobs created were government jobs that means that there's still a lot of government spending in the economy you still have money from the Iran ically named inflation reduction Act Right pumping into the economy from the chips act pumping into the economy and you can you can feel however you want to feel about those acts and whether or not that stimulus is necessary for those Industries I'm not here to debate that but what I'm saying is you've got that money that's still pushing into the economy that's an inflationary effect plus you we're finally starting to coales around this idea that the employment number numbers we're seeing is being largely impacted by the fact that we've increased the legal or illegal population of this country dramatically over the last three years and that's trickling into the employment data and making those figures very muddy right we've talked about the government spending before without all this government stimulus we probably would have been in a recession or a very uncertain economic time for the last 24 months that's really the reality of the thing I think you're going to want to look at the FED balance sheet and what they might be trying to do there as far as trying to take care of some of the government debt problems in other ways but that's a that's a topic for another video,1.0,-0.7
MarketBeat,pal1aWf9nJE,2024-04-10T15:32:24Z,Inflation Heats Up: Unpacking the Latest CPI Surprise,Automotive Industry,I do want to jump in here on one of the sectors that you had just mentioned the automotive sector so given the resistance from consumers on vehicle prices how do you kind of see this affecting the automotive industry and consumer purchasing Trends uh in the near future then well the automotive consumer Trends are definitely being affected so car prices Rose and now car sales are flagging they've been weak they're not growing car prices have started to come down that's being offset by the increase of insurance prices so someone who's having a hard time with money and thinking how should I buy a new car one there's the increase of the new car cost plus there's the increase of your insurance because when you get a new car your insurance is going to go up so I think that the automobile industry will probably have a hard time over the next year or two I don't think it's going to implode but I would not expect any kind of significant growth I think it all ties together with the energy story is you've got so many of the Legacy car manufacturers right now that have shifted production to EVS which already carry premium on price that consumers are already saying they don't want to pay so there's not as much Supply going into the market of the internal combustion engine cars that consumers may be able to afford but maybe now won't be able to afford because they're just isn't because the demand for them will be so high right and that's also why the oems really are cutting back on EV plans and they're shifting into hybrids because they need to try to stay green they need to keep the cost low and hybrid is the way to go,1.0,-0.7
MarketBeat,A7OlYofXkQw,2024-04-09T19:20:19Z,5 Hottest CEO Stock Purchases,Legion,let's start off with a legion it's a Dublin based security firm that's focused on doors so why don't you tell us about CEO John Stone here and what's ahead for this company so JN Stone his purchase in q1 is the seventh largest buy CEO that got him on the radar puts him in fifth spot as far as this list go goes um so his buying is offsetting some selling by other insiders that's really that selling is associated with share base compensation the two things kind of balance each other out but the company's also being supported by institutional buyers they own 92% of the stock and the company is expecting a return to growth and margin expansion over the next year or 18 months and that's really got the market kind of uh kind of jazzed on it the valuation of the stocks a little bit High compared to consensus estimates but the analysts are raising their targets so I think that if this stock were to pull back it would be an opportune time to buy it,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,A7OlYofXkQw,2024-04-09T19:20:19Z,5 Hottest CEO Stock Purchases,Marpe,awesome well next we're looking at marpe their CEO notably increased its Holdings along with a positive outlook for hypergrowth uh given the AI powered businesses service disruption potential Thomas what should investors watch out for in this high growth phase yeah well this one's interesting because insiders have only bought this stock for years um insiders large shareholders and institutions own about 60% of the stock um the CEO actually purchased twice in q1 and those two purchases effectively tripled as Holdings so if that's not a vote of confidence for the business I don't know what is there's absolutely no reason for him to buy so many shares at such a time without a positive outlook for the business now the outlook for the business is hyper growth this is an AI powerered business services company who's focusing on self-insure self-insuring employers it's a multi-billion dollar industry that could be easily disrupted by AI this is definitely a stock to walk,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,A7OlYofXkQw,2024-04-09T19:20:19Z,5 Hottest CEO Stock Purchases,Keurig Dr Pepper,all right well next we're looking at curig Dr Pepper they saw significant Insider buying uh including a 5 million purchase by the CEO against a backdrop of institutional selling so how does this kind of uh contrast affect the stocks valuation and appeal to individual investors Thomas right so uh this CEO purchase is significant because it almost hit $5 million it's our third largest purchase by CEO on this list he uh that purchase is compounded by another purchased by an Insider together they bought 7.5 million worth of shares this is offset by a large shareholder jab Holdings is selling but jab owns like 20% of the company they're selling into a rally of taking profits that's probably a good thing for them not really a worry because the other institutions xjb are still buying the stock um and the analysts view it as a deep value trading below the low end of their range I think that Dr Pepper is going to be heading higher this year,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,A7OlYofXkQw,2024-04-09T19:20:19Z,5 Hottest CEO Stock Purchases,Snowflake,all right number two on your list we're looking at snowflake they made big news when it announced a surprise CEO transition their new CEO immediately purchased $5 million in shares so how should investors interpret the timing and transition of this investment well right the surprise CEO transition certainly caused a stock price implosion it raised some questions about the company's future but the new CEO was an existing exec he came on board with a an acquisition last year he is an AIC Centric person he will help take the company on its next phase into this budding world of AI that we live in today uh so significant about him is the announcement of his appointment as CEO caused a major stock price implosion and he bought the dip he didn't need to buy more shares he already had some added to his Holdings institutions are also um buying this stock and the analysts see 30% upside at the midpoint uh their estimates are rising so I think this is certainly a buy the dip opportunity for investors,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,A7OlYofXkQw,2024-04-09T19:20:19Z,5 Hottest CEO Stock Purchases,Sphere Entertainment,all right well number one the number one Stock B bought by a CEO in q1 is sphere entertainment formerly Madison Square Garden CEO James laurren Doolan made three purchases for $1 million now these are significant because they include the largest purchase by an Insider in two additional trades on par with that amount what else are we looking at here with this investment Thomas right this is another huge vote pH of confidence by CEO I mean for him to buy one lot was awesome $5 million was a big a big purchase but to follow it up with two more purchases and double that to almost $1 million is a huge huge sign um all three of those purchases are top five as far as the last three months of insider trading goes um institutions are also buying the company has a great Outlook um it's International growth trajectory and the franchising opportunity is significant however the analysts are dragging on the price action right now they think there's going to be a couple of soft quarters ahead um but again that long-term Outlook is what's keeping them in the market um they're concerned right now about capacity utilization in the wake of this event that happened a few years ago still not quite back up to full speed but it is coming so again um great vote of confidence there's a possibility for a stock price pullback I would view that as a buying opportunity based on the long-term Outlook,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,A7OlYofXkQw,2024-04-09T19:20:19Z,5 Hottest CEO Stock Purchases,JAB Holdings,this is offset by a large shareholder jab Holdings is selling but jab owns like 20% of the company they're selling into a rally of taking profits that's probably a good thing for them not really a worry because the other institutions xjb are still buying the stock,1.0,0.1

MarketBeat,5AEuQvvhZoE,2024-04-04T17:14:59Z,7 Must-Buy Stocks Under $20,Barrick Gold,all right well here's a stock we've been mentioned on this channel recently baric gold I mean even with economic uncertainties gold remains a safe haven and baric is one of the largest gold miners that's at the forefront um so with gold prices storing and a promising future for fored should investors be in on this opportunity Chris I think every investor should have some sort of exposure to Precious Metals in one way or the other if you don't want to hold the physical metal of gold um gold mining stocks are a good way to do that when the market for the metal is going up as it is with gold I just saw this morning I think gold was up like um $11 this morning and it's just it just keeps on going up and up and up however one of the things one of the reasons why I like baric is because quality matters baric is one of the largest gold miners and this isn't just a um a 2024 story uh if you've bought if you've held on to Barrett gold for the last five years you're up 19% that doesn't maybe sound like much especially when you compare it to some of the tech stocks but when you consider that bar Gold's a dividend player and everything else it's a it's a nice steady stock it's been growing consistently and with demand and for gold increasing uh you know around the world this is a good time to be getting in on a stock like bear gold,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,5AEuQvvhZoE,2024-04-04T17:14:59Z,7 Must-Buy Stocks Under $20,Riot Platforms,okay well there's a few more that are definitely important to cover uh so one of those is Riot platforms with which gives investors an indirect exposure to Bitcoin now there was a recent price drop here and the having event is now on the horizon what can you share about this one Chris well I think you just really nailed it um this is the the pullback is largely expected to be due to the fact that this Bitcoin having event is coming up at some point in April um there's been a huge pullback just in Bitcoin itself in the last week um Riot platforms is a way for investors to get exposure to the Bitcoin Market without buying into any of the Bitcoin ETFs without buying Bitcoin directly I look at Riot blockchain as more of a you're investing in blockchain technology this is to me seems like a very safe way to do that um right now the stock still has like a $177 83 C price Target so if that if they hit that that's like a 39% gain over the next year Riot you know Riot platforms is one that I think investors might want to look at if if they're looking to get exposure into that sector of the market,1.0,0.7

MarketBeat,fg-3WRY2mLI,2024-04-02T19:47:40Z,5 Tech Stocks to Buy Now,Palo Alto Networks,Pao Alto networks is making bold moves by investing in the future um Thomas why don't you tell us a little bit more about the long-term benefits with this one and why do you think investors should keep a close eye on this stock specifically yeah right paloalto is kind of the poster child for what we're talking about here it's growing it's got this great trajectory for growth uh because kind of Highly highly Val valued was kind of trading in the high end of the analyst range and then comes the latest results results were awesome but the guidance was kind of trimmed and cautious and weak because the company is Shifting its focus instead of like focusing on margins and revenue right now it's going to give up some of its margins and revenues right now by giving away free services the long-term implication is trying to regain or trying to gain new clients for long-term growth when it gains new clients it can then start focusing on penetrating services is also trying to move into platformization it's got a bunch of disperate products trying to get them all in the same place to make it easier for clients to use and for them to sell and to make upsells over the long term but what you will see after the results I'm sorry if you're trying to say something you know the stock price crashed like 30% analysts are raising their price targets so what we've had is the market has moved back down while the analysts are moving back up and we're kind of requal and now I see the upper trajectory uh coming back into play I think the same Z zscaler kind of got hit by the Poo Alto news because Palo alto's news is kind of bad for Palo Alto now but it may be bad for zscaler long term if paloalto is gaining Z zscaler potential clients but again the analysts are raising their targets and they're leading the market higher from its current position so assuming that these upcoming results are still good then the stock should rally,1.0,0.6
MarketBeat,fg-3WRY2mLI,2024-04-02T19:47:40Z,5 Tech Stocks to Buy Now,Zscaler,well despite a recent drop uh analysts are also still bullish on zscaler moving along to that one so with positive revisions here uh could this signal a strong comeback what do you guys think what is the outlook for this one yeah I think the same Z zscaler kind of got hit by the Poo Alto news because Palo alto's news is kind of bad for Palo Alto now but it may be bad for zscaler long term if paloalto is gaining Z zscaler potential clients but again the analysts are raising their targets and they're leading the market higher from its current position so assuming that these upcoming results are still good then the stock should rally yeah I haven't looked at Z scaler in a in a couple of days I know that when I was last looking at it um I was seeing that the consensus price for Z scaler was below where it was trading so I was thinking it might be ready for a you know that this might be one of those stocks we're talking about that's ready for a little bit of a pullback and you know one of the things that I like about zscaler right now is that it's really heavy into the zero trust which a lot of cyber security companies are moving towards but zscaler has been there for a long time and that's with remote work and hybrid work being the the norm now uh many companies are really looking to see how they can implement this zero trust platform,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,fg-3WRY2mLI,2024-04-02T19:47:40Z,5 Tech Stocks to Buy Now,MongoDB,well then there's mongod DB uh they aren't just surviving here this company is really thriving kind of thanks to its positioning uh in the cloud and AI markets so what makes this one a leader though and how does this kind of translate into the growth uh prospects here uh let's just take a closer look at this one what do you think about this company well mongodb is is important because it's a it's Cloud infrastructure but it's also Ai and database infrastructure so it's all about building that infrastructure and the data handling that's necessary for doing the AI they've been focused on AI right from the beginning they're a leader and applying AI services to their own internal operations but also for their clients um they've got these these Partnerships with companies like gitlab which is the dev SEC Ops platform so we've got this uh it's like a method of a means a platform for developers globally to be able to work with AI from wherever they are with whatever kind of projects or team that they're working with safely and securely um I see mongodb as a competitor for companies like Oracle which is also big in Cloud infrastructure um again uh the results cause the stock price to implode but analysts are raing their targets um by my calculations the consensus price Target is almost double from last year and it implies 30% upside so stock price might wallow for a little while but I see upside ahead and all it will take is a catalyst and that could come in the next quarters reports,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,fg-3WRY2mLI,2024-04-02T19:47:40Z,5 Tech Stocks to Buy Now,UiPath,well next up is UI path this stock has been on a roller coaster but a reversal might be in sight uh with analysts impressed by recent results could there be a rally soon um what are the signals here and what does it mean for investors yeah I think UI path is on track for a reversal it's been trending up off a bottom uh the recent results have caused the price to come back a little bit but that price pullback aligns with the uptrend we've still got support at critical levels what we're seeing in the results is that after the company's initial push it's starting to regain traction with growth and that's because of it's AI powered Bots um AI is all about if efficiency and improving productivity and that comes down to Automation and that's where uipath is a leader we've got accelerating growth and the analysts are now raising their targets consensus is almost 30% above the price action and Rising so this is another one that I see being led Higher by the analyst if I recall correctly that's a that's one of Kathy Wood's uh favorite stocks recently I think she made a fairly significant Buy in that in the last month or so right because she's selling Tesla to pay for this yeah exactly,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,fg-3WRY2mLI,2024-04-02T19:47:40Z,5 Tech Stocks to Buy Now,Snowflake,okay well the fifth stock we are going to talk about today is snowflake snowflake CEO change has kind of ruffled a few feathers uh but what does this really mean for the company's future I think that it's ultimately a good thing for the company's future because it puts into place in the CEO position um an AI Centric CEO former CEO was perfectly capable of running the company did a fantastic job this is just a shift that aligns with the current technological shift in the market I think that uh you know the stock has got upside for sure the analyst responses have been a little bit mixed but we have downgrades offset by upgrades there's more price Target upward revisions than downward revisions um they're predicting 30% upside so again this is another great candidate for a rebounder rally given strong q1 results yeah snowflakes been in the news uh I think I know Market beat there was an article out e it's either been out or it might be coming out today or tomorrow or um that new CEO that Thomas is talking about just bought just made a major buy about you know about5 Million worth of of the company shares which may have been part of a you know might may have been part of a pre-arranged deal but still it's it's encouraging to see that he's coming in and and putting his money into the stock that's a good point because um he was already an executive so he had his skin in the game this is additional skin but that's definitely a a bullish sign for the market yep,1.0,0.85
MarketBeat,AS58Z-5VmqE,2024-03-28T16:27:47Z,7 Stocks That May Be Next to Split Their Stock,Chipotle,a few weeks ago Chipotle announced a 50 for one stock split Chris so that means that this is approved by shareholders um at the company's annual meeting in June that shareholders who hold shares on the record date of June 18th are going to receive a 49 additional shares of the stock for every share that they own and this specific spefic stock split may have surprised some investors got them a little excited um but analysts have been eyeing this as a potential split candidate for a bit now. I think it's up about 5% uh from the moment that they announced the split and it's up for like 10% in the month overall and the chances are the stock is probably going to keep going up prior to the split.,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,AS58Z-5VmqE,2024-03-28T16:27:47Z,7 Stocks That May Be Next to Split Their Stock,Broadcom,"what are we looking at first it's broadcom right yeah broadcom was one was one of the companies that I put on the list first and um you know the reason why I was looking at this is this is a a chip sector stock so it's it's one to think about in terms of we're talking about Nvidia obviously that's the hot stock on everybody's mind but what I noticed about broadcom was uh when I was writing the article was in recent days there it was trading at a much higher volume than it normally trades at that's sort of an indicator that there's there's a lot of interest in the stock it's trading it over a hund I think it's up over 100% in the last 12 months and of course the stock price is trading at over like $1,300 a share so the bullish case here is we're in the super cycle and semiconductors now might be the time for a company like broadcom to think about splitting it stock because that momentum in the stock is still going to be there so even if you bring the price down you there's chances are you're going to have an outsize number of investors coming in and so the stock price can go right back up probably not to the level it was but it's still going to be enough to give current shareholders a nice game",1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,AS58Z-5VmqE,2024-03-28T16:27:47Z,7 Stocks That May Be Next to Split Their Stock,Nvidia,"we're talking about Nvidia obviously that's the hot stock on everybody's mind. lamb research and Nvidia have both been pivotal in the semiconductor uh industry's expansion. right so I actually I wrote the article before Nvidia did their developer conference and so then they recently just announced the fact that they're coming out with yet another new AI chip and that's creating even more momentum in the stock. uh so Nvidia has been a name that's on some people's mind some people feel like they're not going to split but other people feel like if they do cross that $1,000 Mark that they may decide now a good time to to split the stock",1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,AS58Z-5VmqE,2024-03-28T16:27:47Z,7 Stocks That May Be Next to Split Their Stock,Lamb Research,lamb research and Nvidia have both been pivotal in the semiconductor uh industry's expansion. lamb research another another one they did a five for one split back in 2000 this is a company that um they make the equipment that's needed to make the semiconductor chips so it's a good pick and shovel way to invest in semiconductor stock again their stocks up almost 100% in the last 12 months they're seeing um a little bit lower volume than they've been over last five years and that's something that some investors look at when they determine are companies going to be looking to make their stocks more liquid,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,AS58Z-5VmqE,2024-03-28T16:27:47Z,7 Stocks That May Be Next to Split Their Stock,Lululemon,well Lululemon and Costco are also on this list these two companies have shown remarkable resilience and growth even in challenging Economic Times. so I'm not necessarily sure that either Lulu or Costco are great bets to have for stock split but I think they're I would put them in the category of they could and the common feature that both of them share is the shares are both trading at a discount to their five-year average in terms of volume and in the case of Lululemon I think they're trading at around maybe 20% less volume wise than they were about five years ago and that's significant because generally speaking companies will consider splitting their stock when they're just not seeing as much retail interest in their stock and for companies like Lulu and Costco that is not going to be because the companies aren't popular it's not going to be because they're not doing they're not delivering solid revenue and solid earnings it's because there's some fundamental Factor there that's keeping retail investors away and the common denominator for both of these companies would be their price so I think for both of them I looked at a a decline in trading volume from where they were five years ago and that suggests to me that they might be candidates for split,1.0,0.4

O'Reilly Automotive they've split their stock a couple of times in the past again stocks trading at a fairly elevated level the volume's a little bit down compared to where it was and this is a sector where again people are looking to keep their existing cars in good working order for longer and I just think there's a secular Tailwind going for the auto parts market and oh Ry may want to take advantage of that,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,7M3TB2EimWM,2024-03-27T15:58:24Z,Reddit's IPO Rises: A Breakdown of Hype vs. Long-Term Value,Reddit,with Reddit officially going public and the stocks performance Turning Heads we're here to break down what's happened what it means and what could lie ahead let's get started welcome back guys so we talked Reddit stock previous to their IPO go ahead and check out that video if you'd like but since then they officially went public and we're here to discuss the latest developments so of course we want to hear from our viewers as well so don't be afraid leave your comments uh down below we'd love to hear from you now this stock went public at $34 it jumped 48% in the first day of trading um on Monday it shot up again and ended the day just below $60 so it's still creeping higher uh what are your initial thoughts here guys I mean you seemed very hesitant about the success of this stock in our last video um so how much of the performance here do you attribute to initial excitement U versus maybe solid investor confidence and reddit's long-term value I I see this almost 100% as being um initial excitement people wanting to get in on the stock um especially when you consider that they were offering a certain percentage of the stock to the to their um I guess You'd call it most valuable content creators and such um you know I I this isn't necessarily a typical of a of an IPO like this um I don't but I don't necessarily think that it all also says much about the long-term value for the stock this stock is a lot like GameStop you know they're they're closely related they're not really exactly the same but there are a lot of True Believers in Reddit and they're just happy to be buying this stock because it's available yeah and now there's some AI hype in play as well that's kind of driving some volatility and uh what they're doing is they're trying to price in and unknown the company is not making profits and there's not really a clear path to profits this thing about selling data to AI could generate profits long term but it's it's hard to know when and where and how much so you know it's just an unknown quality they're they're pricing in so I would definitely expect some volatility okay well in our last video uh we did Express concerns about potential challenges that Reddit might face as a public company you kind of just mentioned them there but uh given it strong start that we are seeing what are the key milestones and metrics that you believe investors should maybe watch for in the next quarters to come um to engage the long-term health and growth trajectory for this company well I think like the key Milestones really are going to be their earnings results and one thing that I was reading a little while ago is the second quarter earnings release may be the more important of the two that are coming up because the lockup period will expire just after that by a few days I know I think there's some owners of the stock like the the redditors and whatnot don't have the same lockup rules as the Insiders do but they won't be able to sell shares until uh till after that 2key report so that will certainly be a big milestone I mean you're gonna look I'm sorry Li yeah I mean you're gonna look at it for for anything that you know about Reddit you're going to be looking at stuff like are they you know is going to be ad revenue and then again whatever color I guess you call it that the company can give us on how successful this this data mining Revenue stream is is doing along with that I do also want to mention that market volatility is a common feature of IPOs and given reddit's rapid price increase here uh what advice would you guys give retail investors who are maybe considering actually buying at these levels I mean my best advice is to wait and see because like we've been saying we've all said in one form or another volatility is going to be the Hallmark of this stock going forward um the huge price increases post IPO will likely lead to some pretty big profit taking you got to think about how much profits people are making in only a week so that's going to put a cap on the market um I was just looking at the chart a minute ago and the fourth or fifth candle that's forming is a really ugly one that could become a shooting star that might result in a 20 or 50% price implosion just because of how much profits have been made already since the IPO yeah Thomas is making a really good point I think whenever you're looking atock that are coming through an IPO um you have to kind of think about the ceiling and the floor and Reddit may very well be a $60 stock it may even be higher but that doesn't mean it's a $60 stock right now and so I think if you're a retail investor you're going to want to wait for some price Discovery because the chances are you're probably going to be able to buy the stock at a lower price in a little while and that's going to feel a lot better for you you if you're trying to average cost up later in instead of you know buying it now and then maybe having to try to average cost down to try to make up your losses yeah I like that Chris pointed out price Discovery two words that popped into my mind were the normalization of Market forces and then some market equilibrium we need to get some equilibrium to where some of the hype has been bled off the market and the buyers and sellers are kind of more and an equal footing where we're not just looking at hype driving the price higher yep yeah great insights there thank you for adding that um I do want to take a quick look at maybe a little bit bigger picture here so say some of us are deeming reddits public debut as successful does this mean Tech IPOs are back guys do you uh foresee any impact maybe on this strategy of other tech companies considering going public it's possible but it depends on how successful this one is right now it looks pretty good but if it turns into a dud it May Scare some other IPOs um out of the market but if it is able to hold its its ground and and maintain its upper momentum it may attract some some more IPOs into the market it just depends on if they think they can get their value out of investors or not right and you know I'm I'm gonna say I'm gonna put myself more in the skeptical camp on that Lacy only because you know to Me Reddit sort of has the um it has that Meme stock effect and again I'm not trying to I'm not trying to make a value judgment on the company one way or the other but it had a lot of built-in excitement uh from people who were very very excited to see this stock go to market you see another stock this morning that's going that's going public and it has that same sort of enthusiasm with it I don't know if that's necessarily the case for every Tech stock that's going to want to do an IPO okay well the question remains here whether this momentum is just a flash in the pan or if it's a sign of sustained growth what do you think do these early successes change your view on reddit's potential as an investment let us know in the comments down below we want to hear from you but until next time keep analizing keep questioning and most importantly keep investing wisely,1.0,-0.3

MarketBeat,WIZl0wHTChE,2024-03-21T13:37:56Z,You NEED to Know About This Stock!,Airship AI Holdings,Airship AI is a stock you need to know about it's seen over a 500% spike in just a few days let's talk about why welcome back Thomas today we're going to talk about a stock that's probably unknown to most but it's a stock that investors need to know about we don't say that lightly uh it's Airship AI Holdings it's an emerging Visual and video data management and threat assessment player this stock has spiked like crazy over the past few days um like I said as an emerging player in AI as a niche product and first mover Advantage I mean the stock was trading at$ 170 $1.70 at the beginning of the year and since then shares have increased by well over 500% that's certainly eye-catching uh but Thomas Phil Us in here why should investors take a look at this one well right let's just start with the chart because that's where the story starts I got interested in this stock when it was trading down around here because it turned up on one of Market Beach tracking tools for unusual AC ity it was up a couple hundred% that's amazing so I was checking it out turns out it's an AI company it's a software platform that helps Aggregate and manage streaming data video so it can uh use your video and pick out objects detect objects do threat assessments and enhances security through video AI surveillance since I since I became interested the stock has continued to Rally this chart is really awesome for a couple of reasons one the immensity of the move this is a huge move but the candles that are forming right now we've got a little bit of resistance up here but we still have three solid green candles three weekly candles accompanied by high volume that tells me it's a three soldiers pattern that's a continuation pattern this Market has legs so just this week the market moved Above This previous alltime High to me that's an inflection point uh because the market can be very reflective we can assume that the motion the movement above the inflection point is going to equal what came below it this is a $9 or a 600% rally I think a $9 move from 1050 up to1 1950 or $20 is very very easy and somewhere up into the $70 range is possible over time so that's what's going on with Airship AI so tell us more about their core product here if you would how is it setting them apart yeah well there their core product their core product is an operating system and software package that um Aggregates and manages data um it's being used by governments around the world it's starting to get um increased uh use for for border control security which is a big deal because border control security is going to grow at a 6% cagr it's going to more than double over the next 10 years so considering the growing interest in AI here and at security Technologies uh do you see Airship AI as a potential acquisition Target and if you do uh what makes it attractive to larger companies and how might an acquisition impact investors going forward well I think it absolutely is an acquisition Target or a potential Target simply because of what it does um this new Revolution in AI is all about managing data and the next step from uh doing the large language models and feeding them pictures and words to learn is for them to be able to track visual data through video so this to me is an evolution of AI it would be a um a good acquisition for virtually any AI player but one that really stands out to me is paler because they're already into that data management and threat assessment so adding in that visual aspect would really round out their offerings and looking ahead what are some of the key indicators that investors should watch to gauge Airship ai's performance and Prospects how do you foresee the company's Evolution maybe in terms of development Market expansion and also financial performance over maybe the next few years well I think we're going to see a real real surge in Revenue starting this current quarter uh they ended the year with an 11.8 million backlog and $140 million pipeline since then they've announced two major contracts worth multi-million dollars each one of those is a second contract with the US government under the FED ramp program that program helps vet and establish which cloud-based companies are okay for government agencies to use now that we have two including the border control we should see US government uh contracts really start to accelerate um another contract that they just got since that data was released was with Singapore they're doing the same thing using the platform to aggregate existing video systems to manage that data flow for border security so thas while the company's primary business is with the US government and allies uh it's also available to commercial customers this is kind of parallel with paler strategy here so how do you assess the potential for airships AI growth in this sector do you think that the stock can sustain these levels or reach for new highs I think this stock is going to be in a hyper growth phase for the next couple of years because as it gains these contracts and there's more use case evidence of its efficacy more and more businesses are going to learn how to apply it to their own operations um threat assessments and security is only one aspect of the the video the visual aspect of AI it extends all the way into warehouse management and Manufacturing controls um internet of things so I think this company has a long trajectory well

MarketBeat,TkvQF8mKGyM,2024-03-18T13:00:25Z,Crafting Your Portfolio's Magnificent Seven: Top Stocks for 2024,Nvidia,So of course let's start here with a performer with significant growth driven by the AI Revolution that's Nvidia so given its current valuation how should investors kind of weigh in its potential for continued outperformance here against the high expectations that's already kind of priced into the stock well thanks for having me back Lacy yeah this was a fun article to do and Nvidia is the only stock on this list that is part of the original Magnificent Seven from last year some people might even say that it's that that list has been T trimmed down to the Magnificent one and that one is NVIDIA um had a blowout earnings report shows that demand for its AI chips remains strong the stocks had a little bit of a pullback here in last week some people are questioning uh how high can the stock go I don't think this is an AI story I think this is becoming more of a broader economy story um there were expectations in January of you know six or seven rate cuts which seemed absurd at that time now we may be lucky to get one um so we'll see I think that's really the headwind that investors have to think about in terms of the stock price performance but as far as whether or not you want to be in the stock I don't think there's much question that you do because again this is not a question of is AI Gna grow it's just more of a question of is the economy going to grow,0.95,0.7
MarketBeat,TkvQF8mKGyM,2024-03-18T13:00:25Z,Crafting Your Portfolio's Magnificent Seven: Top Stocks for 2024,Advanced Micro Devices,all right great analysis for that one now let's move along we have Advanced Micro Devices who is challenging Nvidia in the AI chip Market what factors here should investor consider when they're evaluating amd's ability to kind of capture market share and impact on the Stock's future performance well you you hit it right there Lacy we've talked about AMD a lot on this channel and for good reason right now um again the AI story is in place and companies like Nvidia and now AMD are the companies that are providing the hardware that um that businesses need to get to the to power their AI applications right now businesses are looking for choice they love Nvidia they love the performance of the chips but they would like some competition they'd like some options AMD right now is the furthest along in providing that option the early results of their new Chips show that they're exceeding Revenue estimates I expect that to continue but again I think this is becoming more of an economy story but not an AI story right,0.95,0.7
MarketBeat,TkvQF8mKGyM,2024-03-18T13:00:25Z,Crafting Your Portfolio's Magnificent Seven: Top Stocks for 2024,Palantir Technologies,well paler Technologies is next on this list they've received a mixed response from analysts despite their solid earnings so how can investors interpret these signals and evaluate paler growth prospects um when they're expanding their AI Services market right so we're moving now from the hardware of AI now to more the software of AI and that's where paler specializes that's where they Excel um this is going to be a controversial choice I know there's a lot of our viewers that love paler a lot of them that hate paler but I think if you're looking for stocks that are going to outperform in 2024 it has to be on your list for consideration the big question for paler is going to be can they live up to the ginormous expectations of growth that they have um so far paler has climbed over every obstacle that's been put in front of it we're going to know more they report earnings I think in early May that should really set the tone for the rest of the year,0.95,0.4
MarketBeat,TkvQF8mKGyM,2024-03-18T13:00:25Z,Crafting Your Portfolio's Magnificent Seven: Top Stocks for 2024,Palo Alto Networks,yeah stay tuned for that I'm sure we'll be covering their earnings report right here at marab beat uh now now cyber security is more critical than ever as we know Chris and pal Alto networks is at the Forefront of this how might their strategic decision to capture market share translate into long-term value for investors yeah Palo alto's been been kind of an interesting case they're they're looking to do a little bit of a different business model where they're trying to become more of a a software as a service company or in this case maybe you could say cyber secur is a Service Company they're willing excuse me they're they're giving away some of their uh their lower tier services to try to get more sticky of that annual recurring Revenue that people love We talked about Palo Alto just recently as one of the stocks that was seeing heavy Congressional Insider buying um that alone should be a reason why investors should keep it on the radar but cyber secur is a huge sector it's going to be about as big as AI in fact we talked about it we said the growth of AI is going to just it's going to bring the growth of cyber security Right Along on his coattails because for all the good actors and the Bad actors that might be trying to do stuff with AI you need the cyber security to combat that all right,0.95,0.7
MarketBeat,TkvQF8mKGyM,2024-03-18T13:00:25Z,Crafting Your Portfolio's Magnificent Seven: Top Stocks for 2024,Monster Beverage,well here is one we don't talk about often Chris monster beverage they've seen impressive growth they're now expanding to alcoholic beverages uh tell us a little bit more about this one so I haven't been paying much attention to monster beverage and that's and it's really kind of a shame on me I should have the stocks up more than 92% Last 5 Years it's amazing um this this is a company that you know the products kind of have a cult following and the stock has a cult following too but you can't really deny the performance the company's been moving into the alcoholic beverage category that was only a fraction of their revenue in 2023 but they expect that to be a significantly higher portion of their business you know some people might have put Celsius here instead of mon beverage I give the not to monster just because of their track record all right,0.95,0.8
MarketBeat,TkvQF8mKGyM,2024-03-18T13:00:25Z,Crafting Your Portfolio's Magnificent Seven: Top Stocks for 2024,Eli Lilly,let's move along to Eli Lily here the company has introduced Blockbuster products with significant sales uh considering the Stock's High valuation how should investors assess their uh the potential here for future earnings growth and the stocks price trajectory yeah so this is another story that um I think the economy is going to have some bearing on it the weight loss sector is is um was was a sector that kind of came out of nowhere even though the products have been around for a little while they were primarily for uh treatment of type two diabetes but now these gop1 uh products have been approved in some cases for weight loss and that's the case with Eli lilyia they have a product mararo which was for type two diabetes but they also got approved for Zep bound and that is for weight loss so far the company's been seeing tremendous sales of that there's a little issue possibly through here with what's been going on with um with insurance pricing and different things like that that's something that investors might want to watch for one of the reasons why I like Eli Lily here as opposed to maybe a Nova Nordic is because Eli Lily just has a pipeline of other products including Cancer drugs and other diabetes treatments too so this just looks like a very solid stock that investors are going to want to have in their portfolio for growth and for Value all right,0.95,0.8
MarketBeat,TkvQF8mKGyM,2024-03-18T13:00:25Z,Crafting Your Portfolio's Magnificent Seven: Top Stocks for 2024,Booking Holdings,well last but not least number seven on the list booking Holdings uh this one stands out as a non-traditional AI play in the travel industry so with travel demand still going strong how do lower interest rates and consumer confidence levels kind of factor into the growth outlook here well I feel better about this pick uh now than I maybe did a week ago when I put it on the list you know I I like booking because I don't think demand for travel is necessarily going to soften I think there's been some headlines this week that maybe is are going to cause consumers to change the way they think about how they get to destinations and where they stay once they get there but booking doesn't care about any of that because they're here to handle all of it they're here to do your trip planning and they've introduced some new AI tools through kayak and other parts of their their business that make it seamless again this is just a stop stock that looks very expensive if you just look at the price but when you look at the value and you look at the expected earnings growth investors may want to really get in on this again for investors that don't want to pay the high price for one share you can get in on this with fractional shares this just seems like a stock that seems this might be the right way to play the travel boom right now,0.95,0.7
MarketBeat,NKIbt85Cjro,2024-03-14T14:11:47Z,Reddit IPO: Game-Changer or Meme Stock in the Making?,Reddit,whether you're considering adding Reddit to your portfolio or just curious about the buzz stay tuned as we analyze the up votes down votes and the financial potential of reddit's move to the market. all right guys today we are exploring reddit's much anticipated IPO as the front of the page of the internet as it's called prepares to go public under the ticker symbol R DDT. we're diving into what makes this IPO stand out um the poten risks and rewards here for investors and what reddit's Community Driven model means for its financial future. this is going to be one of the most talked about IPOs of the years so let's get right into it here. so with this news it's first important to understand that Reddit is different from the typical social media IPO. it's an interesting IPO because there's going to be changes um investors aren't going to just let the company continue as it is without making money so there's certainly going to be some pressure on the business to alter its model I think after the IPO. so the company currently they make money through advertising Revenue through charging for premium subscriptions and through some e-commerce activity that they have on their site. and what the company has said is going forward um they're going to continue to do all of those things plus they're planning on um selling data for their redditors uh to companies that are creating language learning models for AI. interesting to me is that the companies also acknowledge that they may never be able to be sustainably profitable. the the the whole the data mining thing to me is just a turn off I've never really been a redditor anyway I me they call themselves the front page of the internet but it's the front page of a lot of junk I mean there's some news but it's mostly junk. some people might come after you for that comment Thomas I feel like there's some people that they really stand behind Reddit so you better watch out in the comments. okay well I saw that Reddit is aiming for a valuation of up to 6.4 billion and it's planning to issue 22 million shares. yeah a lot of the chatter that I'm seeing is that it's just an over another overvalued IPO that makes no money and back to our our our previous you know conversation this previous question you know they're only selling about 10 or 11% of the company that leaves 90% of shares left for them to sell so you know it's possible that over time they won't even try to make money they'll just continue to sell shares and dilute the stock use that cash flow to sustain business and that's just not a that's not a good model in my opinion. okay so to add flexibility to the IPO Reddit has included a green shoe option. okay so another reason that R's IPO is unique is because of its directed share program that allows users and moderators to participate directly here how do you think this decision is going to affect the stocks futility and maybe their price trajectory in the early days on the market. I mean I think this just plays into the potential for it being a meme stock. the lack of the lockup period is the key thing to me I mean on one level I can I can respect what reddit's doing is saying that you know they were built on the back of these users and they're it would be wrong for them not to allow the users to participate in the IPO okay fair enough but when you're basically saying that they can just they just buy the shares and sell them right away that's just introducing a lot of volatility into this. as Reddit takes this bold step into Wall Street the platform's unique blend of community-driven content viral potential and Uncharted Financial territory presents a fascinating case for investors. we'd love to hear your thoughts on reddit's IPO and your strategies as potential investors are you considering buying into Reddit or do you think there's too much volatility ahead.,1.0,-0.4

MarketBeat,5UtkyITLlmI,2024-03-13T17:54:53Z,Oracle Stock Skyrockets by 15%,Oracle,today we're zeroing in on oracle's latest earnings report and the impressive rally in its stock let's get started welcome back today we're diving into some exciting news from Oracle the tech giant has just posted a solid quarter with its Cloud growth and margins catching everyone's attention this comes amid a surge in demand for AIC Centric services and infrastructure a sector where Oracle is rapidly expanding its capabilities so with the stock sky rcking by 15% and the market buzzing we've got a lot to cover so let's break it down what is driving Oracle success and what it means for the future of AI and cloud computing Thomas give us a quick overview here what were the critical drivers behind this performance all right so the long-term story is Oracle shift from Legacy businesses to Cloud Centric businesses now the drivers of success in this current quarter is a new and larged clients they're just uh they're securing new and larged clients for their next their Gen 2 cloud and that is really driving results so the the Legacy business was flat to down but the cloud business is up 25% it's up 25% on a 50% increase in infrastructure services and a 50% gain in the Gen 2 Cloud that's all driven by artificial intelligence and it is gaining momentum we should expect to see these results continue uh to accelerate or at least sustain these high growth levels for the next few quarters so given the high demand for Oracle AI Centric services and their infrastructure how sustainable is this growth you say we can expect this momentum to continue um what does this mean for long-term investors though well right now uh the company is expecting for hyper growth to continue for the foreseeable future that means three to four quarters at least um right now we've got the uh Remain the remaining performance obligation surged by 29% to 80 billion um that's a significant surge in infrastructure capability that will then parlay into future service revenues um yeah I just think that this company's going to continue to grow at this pace for for quite a few more quarters uh the Topline growth might not be that impressive because of the offset of the Legacy businesses but the cloud business should be strong okay let's touch on their strategic partnership now with Invidia that's in play this obviously suggests a strong commitment to their a infrastructure um how should investors interpret this move kind of in terms of oracle's competitive position in the cloud market right I think that investors should interpret this as the next bullish Catalyst now the real takeaway is that they they didn't say what the partnership was only that they only to confirm that it existed uh they're planning to reveal details I think next week um my take is that Nvidia with its full stack of AI supportive uh tools starting with chips and then their operating systems combined with oracle's Market leading uh database systems we can just expect them to be doubling down on the buildout of the Gen 2 cloud and establishing even more AI infrastructure now enas have upgraded Oracle stock and they've increased price targets significantly are there any specific takeaways you want to mention for our viewers with that uh just that they've been very favorable to the market they are leading the market higher um right now the stock is trading about fair value um in line with the consensus estimate but all the new targets have been increased and almost all of them are above consensus suggesting we're going to see 10 to 20% upside fairly soon in my opinion a break to new highs would open the door to a sustained rally that could lead us to you know a 50% to 100% gain over the next couple of years all right well now let's consider the technical Outlook and analysts expectations Oracle stock what kind of potential risks and reward should investors be aware of I mean despite the current rally we're seeing what do investors need to know right let's pull that chart up and we'll look at the risk right so this chart is interesting because you can see there's just this long-term uptrend which is Oracle shift from Legacy business to the cloud 2021 2022 we start seeing some boosts with this AI over here oracles results really start to reflect the impact of AI and we see a surge but we become capped here at this resistance point this resistance point is equivalent with the analyst consensus Target so it is a critical pivot this target make cap gains for the foreseeable future but like I said I think that the the deal with Nvidia the details of that deal will be a catalyst and it should send the market back Above This Pivot Point once we cross cross this point the market could eas gain $30 the magnitude of this range is $30 so that's a good good Target for the first movement um after that it's just going to depend on the results and how the future results and guidance unfold well today we uncovered the layers behind oracle's recent success and what this means for investors it's clear that Oracle is at the Forefront of the next wave of AI advancement setting the stage for a future where technology adoption is more widespread than ever whether you're an investor a tech Enthusiast or just curious about where the digital ages heading Oracle journey is one to watch,1.0,0.85

MarketBeat,MFjGE8qpn_o,2024-03-12T13:30:09Z,Crypto's Next Bull Run: Expert Insights with Robert Ross,Bitcoin,"crypto is already moving up fast and the Bitcoin having on April 22nd is set to kick into overdrive. This is something that happens about every four years with Bitcoin specifically. It's called the having and to kind of understand what that means you need to understand like how Bitcoins are mined or how Bitcoins are created so I'll just do the quick overview here be great um so how that works is when a Bitcoin is mind companies are using these these giant supercomputers to solve these complex mathematical equations in the bit in the bit on the Bitcoin blockchain and when that happens whoever solves the the problem first gets rewarded in Bitcoin so it used to be I want to say in 2010 you rewarded about 90 Bitcoin but as but over time to kind of create more scarcity in the Bitcoin Market it's in the Bitcoin code that these mining rewards get haved about every four years um so we are on the precipice of the next having of that and the cool thing about it I mean if you just think about it from a supply and demand standpoint when the demand for any good is rising or is constant and the supply is cut in half that usually puts upward pressure on prices and historically when we see these having events both the year leading up to it and the year after are typically some of the best times to be in crypto and Bitcoin especially. Every Bitcoin Bull Run will have we'll routinely see these 30% even 50% draw Downs that we had last cycle but I do think that it is suitable for for at least a small percentage of basically everyone's portfolio. With crypto and even with the you know quote unquote lower risk or blue chip cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ethereum you can still generate significant returns with not as much risk as I think people think. I've owned crypto and Bitcoin ethereum you know for you know seven years now. You can buy Bitcoin through a black rock ETF now the ticker is I I bit I want to say that that is the easiest I was buying it in my Roth IRA um a few months ago just as just because I wanted to use the product myself. The first is called net unrealized profit and loss indicator this is free you can look at it anywhere um a glass note is the one that I usually check typically all the way that nle works is the more that Bitcoin holders are in profit the higher that that percentage Rises and The Flip Side is true as well but when 75% of Bitcoin holders are in profit that has marked the top of every crypto cycle we've had since Bitcoin was invented um and it's the opposite is true too when 0% of newly mined Bitcoins are in profit that's usually the best time to buy um which was not coincidentally when the right at two weeks after the FTX collapse was a nle bottom blast cycle but Google searches right now for Bitcoin and crypto also not showing that that frothiness or that euphoria that we typically see at the top of every cycle and I I know this from my own personal experience I have 500,000 social media followers um with my my tick STS tick STS brand on Instagram and Tik Tok um and no retail does still does not really care about crypto so we're not really getting that Euphoria we're seeing yet but so we have the trajectory for Bitcoin I don't think Bitcoins Peak. For new cryptocurrency investors out there I think it's Paramount that you probably have at least 90% of your actual which should probably be like 5% of your total portfolio depending on your age and risk tolerance 90% of that 5% should just be Bitcoin and ethereum. Those have rallied back after every cycle to make new alltime high well we're getting close at least with ethereum um but I think that will give you kind of dip your toe in the water.",1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,ZKdrcvOSdSY,2024-03-07T17:16:55Z,"Apple Scraps EV Plans: Here’s What’s Next, Lower Prices",Apple,"Apple has scrapped its plan to build an electric vehicle so what does this mean now for the stock let's talk about it all right guys we aren't surprised about this well at least I'm not uh but as we heard Apple has officially scrapped its plan to build an electric vehicle I mean after 10 years of effort there wasn't even a timeline of when a car might be developed so there's shifting their focus here analysts are not phased by this news Chris Thomas what is your take on this yeah I'm just like what what I mean the EV the Apple EV hasn't really been in the news for years when they got started it was like what are you doing you can't build a car you know that's kind of ridiculous I mean ultimately what I expected from Apple was an operating system and even that's not going to come now yeah and coincidentally they scrapped it right after the EV Bubble Burst so that they can go chase another fad so to me the Eevee thing for Apple was a fad they wasted 10 years and billions of dollars chasing it and now they're behind on AI yeah I to me the news doesn't come as that big of a surprise to me you like Thomas I just I I never quite got my mind around Apple car that just never really worked for me um I agree with Thomas it does uh it is something that they've been putting time and resources into that they could have been putting into other things I'm not necessarily worried about about that though I mean this is still a company that has a lot of cash so it's not like they couldn't afford to uh spend something on a moon shop right I'm not worried about it per se but it's just like whatever you know yeah I agree with you that's that's a good way of looking at it okay so you said the eeve bubble has burst but is Apple still expected to play some sort of role into the EV market now that shifted its focus away from manufacturing uh vehicles or is it kind of out of that right like I said before it's the operating system if they can come up with an operating system that's better than Tesla then they'll probably do well with it but right now it's like all the EV makers have their own operating systems and apple doesn't have a car to put one into so I think it's really like a it's just a nogo all right well let's talk I'm sorry La I I was just gonna finish up something that Thomas was saying I think that this with everything that's going on in the EV space right now I think investors ought to be thinking about Apple's move away from the Apple car as something that says less about Apple and says more about what Apple thinks about the EV industry well let's talk about Apple's share prices though so they hit a peak in mid 2023 um and that may turn into a long-term top Thomas in your article you had mentioned that the company is struggling with traction and its 2024 results are kind of looking weak uh tell us more about your reasoning behind this well right the analysts are looking for a low single digigit decline in in Revenue um this year and I think that they're underestimating the weakness because of the recent iPhone sales data from China now China is not all of iPhone sales but it is a significant market for them and iPhone sales in China fell 24% so we're looking at probably a mid single to high single digit decline in Revenue based on that um foxcom one of their suppliers they they actually assemble most of the iPhones what's their number they fell by like double digits yeah 177% in the first two months of the year also points to some significant weakness for Apple so I'm looking for weakness in apple this year add in the fact they just got slapped with a big fine by the EU Shares are moving lower I see a significant opportunity for a break of support and even lower share prices okay so I I can't disagree with with Thomas's outlook for the stock in the short term um I think a couple of things I would throw out there would be number one is if you're looking at Apple just through the lens of the last six to eight months or even in the in the course of the last year um you know I think Apple reminds me a little bit about some of the um some of the criticisms and arguments I hear against Bitcoin in the sense that yes Apple may be down quite a bit from where it was at $200 a share but if you look at it over time there's a lot of Apple investors who are just fine with where the stocks at and it and they've made a lot of money in the stock and as far as the company itself goes there's a lot of focus on Apple in China right now and I think where I would tend to look is Apple got rich in China but where are they going to go now and it's because of the the cash that they have and because of the wealth that the company buil up in there it's allowing them to Pivot into places like India Vietnam Malaysia that's I think the story for Apple going forward okay maybe you kind of mentioned this a little a little bit there Chris but despite recent challenges that some analysts remain optimistic uh they remain optimistic about Apple stock so what are the reasons for this what are the potential catalysts that could drive Apple stocks price higher the the key word right now is artificial intelligence AI um there is a lot of anticipation um about Apple's developer event coming up in this summer uh that Apple's going to make a big splash that that will clearly show that apple is in the AI game I have no Insight on that I have no Advanced information on that that's just what the the Scuttle is that apple is going to launch something big to show that there are that they are a major player in the AI Arena right that pretty much that aligns with uh what wed Bush's Dan IES is saying you know he's maintains his price Target maintains his rating saying Apple's had these top times before several times over the last couple of decades and it always comes out ahead and so in the near term there's certainly some pressure we're definitely looking trying to look past the next month or two towards the next developer conference and what the AI offerings might be because that's probably what will reinvigorate the market for Apple products and the stock is there anything else that investors should be considering with this stock well you know if I think it really depends you know if you're if you're bearish on Apple and I can understand that there's ample reasons to be bearish if you're bullish on Apple as I tend to be um I would just throw out there the fact that investors should be aware of the fact that the company is um they're a cash generating machine they earn and this isn't really a joke this is just what the numbers say they earn about $3,000 every second so this is a you know unless you believe that there's something fundamentally different about the company right now you'd kind of have to believe that this is a company that has plans they know what they're doing it may be taking longer for them to execute it but I still believe fundamentally that the stock is is a buy going forward for long-term investors.",1.0,0.3

MarketBeat,V6IZUua0gH4,2024-03-06T18:17:50Z,Palantir Stock Spikes on U.S. Army TITAN Contract,Palantir Technologies,palente Army contract win has sent the stock surging let's talk about it all right guys we just had to jump on here today to talk about the hottest stock market news right now paler Technologies they won a new17 million arming contract for Titan artificial intelligence enabled ground stations and it's giving the stock a big lift fill us in on the details of this contract okay so um the contract is is a two-year contract so that's important for investors to knowe they're not going to realize the entire $178 million in the first year it's going to be 89 million over the two years uh to put that in perspective palente here did about $2.25 billion dollar in Revenue last year um there will be critics that will say even with this additional 89 million this year it's it puts Palante full year guidance shy of the $2.8 billion that analysts are projecting for it but this is still a really good start and um what it does is really cement palente uh reputation as being an integral defense contractor for all branches of the United States government right this is definitely another affirmation of the company's utility it's not just a defense Data stock for the government it's actually got utility on the battlefield this Titan system helps soldiers shoot things they can't see I mean that's that's Cutting Edge it's next Generation it's futuristic science fiction I mean it's happening today okay so let's talk about more of what has the reaction been to this news well the market reaction seems pretty favorable the market is up but the analysts are still crickets I mean I don't know what's going to take for the analyst to get on board this Stu stock I mean I've heard some talk about some kind of a hidden conspiracy of the analyst trying to like shake out the weak hands and not get too hyped about the name but I mean gez you can start to believe that after all these good news stories come out it's still pegged at reduce the price Target still assumes a double digigit downside so something in there isn't quite right and it'll come out in the wash I think maybe later this year yeah you know I don't I I think before we came on I was looking in so it's kind of predictable paler stocks down a little bit from where it peaked it was over $26 at one point this morning it's down probably in the 24s right now at least it was the last time I checked that's a natural pullback I agree with Thomas um you've heard me say this before Lacy paler to me is a classic it's a yah but stock yeah everybody seems to have an objection to it I'm sure that there will be people that will say yeah but this is just a defense contract and it's not going to drive the overall growth that people want to see for paler um I agree with Thomas I don't really know anymore what it's going to take for paler to prove itself to the analyst Community but I think Thomas you made a really good point in your article last week that people need to be aware of analysts may have an overall rating of reduce on paler stock but they're raising their price targets and also institutions are continuing to buy the stock right okay so what does this look like for paler going forward into these next few months what is next here are there any projections on maybe how this contract uh could affect the earnings per share in the upcoming quarters well by my math it looks like this contract is worth about 3% of Revenue based on this year's estimates so that's a pretty decent boost to growth but what it really is is that affirmation the company's building momentum the more it proves its utility the more business is going to get right now it's expanding its government defense contracts it's also building out its Enterprise and its um its business offerings that's really the side of the business that's going to take the stock to the next level because there's so much more opportunity in the in the private Enterprise side than in the government side um but again it's just another affirmation of the company's utility a stepping stone on the path forward um eventually it'll gain traction with analyst I think um but we'll see about that yeah I think I'm probably going to step into where you might have been going next Lacy but there is something that investors can pay attention to this week in fact it happens tomorrow uh palente hosting what they're calling AIP con and it's going to be an event as I said they're hosting it it's also going to be something they're G to be live streaming on YouTube and the exciting part about this is paler is going to actually have 60 existing customers showcasing what pal AIP platform is allowing them to do and also at this event paler supposed to be announcing uh 20 new C excuse me over 20 new customers that have signed on to the platform and all of this is taking place two months before they report earnings next so there's it'll be interesting to see what happens with analysts later this week and into next week okay Thomas you kind of hinted towards some controversy type things but are there any potential challenges maybe regulatory challenges execution risks or competitive pressures um that palente are going to see going forward well there's a lot of competition in the AI space and there is a lot of competition in the defense world but what I see with paler is that it's establishing itself as a as a dominant player um it's its use of data and its application of data across verticals of businesses is really unparalleled um so sure there there are risks but I think that this company has a has a long growth trajectory ahead of it okay and you you mentioned the broader defense sector um are there any potential spillover effects that we need to think about with this you know I'm not necessarily sure that there is this is one of those situations where um I I think I think there's a lot of uh a lot of talk that Palante here is one of many and I think the conversation with paler needs to be that it's the only one that does exactly what it does and that's not necessarily easy to for investors to get their mind around because it's not just a technology company it's not just an AI company it's uh as Thomas and I were talking about before you came on Lacy this is a data company right and their applications really go there's really no sector that can't get involved in right and so I think that's that's something that gets missed when people talk about paler stock right and it's it's disruptive I mean it's a disruptive technology yeah just look uh to get this Titan contract it beat out Ron RTX you know that's one of the largest defense contractors they were definitely in the running for paner to overtake them is saying something so I think the other defense contractors need to be on the lookout for pantea and uh we should expect to see some some more competition come

Right now the valuation of Nvidia is over a trillion dollars, that's amazing.

MarketBeat,jnRWlgiXfMo,2024-02-26T13:53:45Z,7 Dividend Stocks with Double-Digit Growth Rates,Philip Morris,all right then there's Philip Morris a sin stock that's been undertaking a multi-year pivot towards smokeless tobacco products the company has increased it si in for 16 consecutive years so that is promising what are the important details with this one well like you said Lacy this is considered in that category of sin stocks and for some investors Philip Morris is going to be a no-go and I understand that um it simply is one of those stocks that when you're looking for defensive stocks stocks that are going to perform well no matter what's happening in the economy Philip Morris is going to do that not just with their smok their their tobacco products but with their increasing portfolio smokeless products um and as you just pointed out they have a rising dividend this is a stock it's defensive in nature and like I said I understand it's a no-go for some investors but if you're looking for again dividend stocks that are paying Rising dividends and have a chance for double digigit stock price growth this year Philip Morris should be on that list yeah I think Philip Morris is among the companies with the most the safest cash flows uh you know send stock people are going to smoke so it's got a safe dividend it's good for your portfolio,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,jnRWlgiXfMo,2024-02-26T13:53:45Z,7 Dividend Stocks with Double-Digit Growth Rates,UPS,Okay last one UPS kind of a bit of a contrarian Choice as you said Chris to close out this list uh UPS is down 19% sent in the last 12 months but analysts are looking ahead on this one uh with ups taking measures to modernize and improve their efficiency uh what growth prospects should investors be aware of for UPS well yeah the story story with UPS right now is uh deteriorating business now while they're setting up for the rebound they're building efficiency and building leverage so when the economy does turn which the market thinks will happen in the back half and growth resumes it'll have leveraged earnings this Stock's also trading at a discount it's trading near its lowest levels in a few Quarters at least if not for a year or two um it's definitely a good buy yeah and the time to do it is now because at some point this year analy still believe there's going to be at least one rate cut and you're going to want to be in the stock because as Thomas said the company's taking the steps now to be a really good buy and a really strong buy when that pivot happens right I think all it will take is a single rate cut to signal to the market that the FED has exited its high rate stance give the economy a chance to uh to re accelerate and that will definitely be seen in UPS earnings as businesses and consumers start to buy more and ship more products,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,1O3A1eyOlus,2024-02-22T21:21:39Z,AI Powerhouse NVIDIA Will Hit $1000 Soon,NVIDIA,AI Powerhouse Nvidia will hit the Thousand Mark soon now how soon will that really happen let's talk about it welcome back guys AI Powerhouse Nvidia announced its highly anticipated fourth quarter uh results on Wednesday Thomas you said it yourself in the news that just dropped on Market be Nvidia had another mindbending quarter of growth and raised guidance give us the fresh details well yeah to call it mind bending you have to put this in perspective this company outpa consensus estimates again for like the fifth quarter in a row by 750 basis points revenue is up 265 per year-over-year this kind of stuff just doesn't happen with established businesses like Nvidia but basically all segments are performing well Automotive is the only one to be down compared to last year but it was still up sequentially so we got some normalization there helping to to support the real growth drivers which really is the data Center business which grew 49% over last year I mean that's just it's it's mind-boggling but then again the guidance was also better than expected by a thousand basis points this story is one that is exploding we're still early in the discovery phase I think that uh Nvidia could continue to perform like this for the next few quarters until we get a better idea of what kind of money businesses are spending on AI all right now analysts were slow to isue the first revisions but now they're rolling in here fill us in on those why are the analysts overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia and what does that maybe signal about the company's future Market potential what I mean they're overwhelmingly bullish because of the results the company is growing at a ridiculous Pace this is um a new industry evolving not just a flash in the pan so once uh we get through this this bubble phase Nvidia will still be performing at this high level and uh it comes down to margins too the company's margins expanded significantly we have triple digit margin gains earnings are up 486 per adjusted its cash balance doubled so I see Nvidia reaching this new kind of phase in its own life where it might be able to start paying a dividend that matters and repurchasing shares significantly yeah I think this was one of oh sorry La I just yeah I think this was one of those earnings reports I can't remember the last earnings report that I can think of that was this closely watched and just how it just seemed like the market was on kind of a Razor's Edge going into this and I think an the the report just did it gave analysts permission now a bit higher because I think they were just really concerned that I think everybody expected Nvidia to have a good report I don't think people were expecting it to have the report that it had and the guidance it gave and that just gave analysts all the cover they needed to to move the stock higher there was such a high expectation I mean the market was ready to sell off on the slightest sign of weakness we got no sign of weakness and every sign of stength that we could have asked for exactly okay so there's always going to be challenges and risk though so what might Nvidia be facing on its path to further growth man I I don't know that I can see one right now I mean maybe if they can't meet demand but right now the market is so huge even if they lose market share they're still going to continue to grow um maybe the analyst bit them up too high and there's going to be a significant correction yeah but but right now I think we're still in this phase where next quarter's results they could outperform they could raise guidance again and then outperform that again in the next quarter so this is right this is It's a momentum play as for the market as much as for the business I I think you're making a good point Thomas because I keep hearing and and I don't deny that this is true I keep hearing that there's a lot of businesses that are saying okay Nvidia is really good but we want other options when it comes to AI chips but I agree with you I don't necessarily think that takes market share away from Nvidia I think it's just making the pie bigger right I mean variety is the spice of life if Nvidia chips make AI great one way and AMD chips make it great another way if you merge those two things together it's going to be super duper great so okay so these results are sending shares to new highs but how much higher can they go how soon could Nvidia really hit that thousand level I mean it could happen any day really the way the Market's been going all it will take is for enough sentiment to build up enough feeling that the stock is going to move before the people can buy it that fomo that fear of missing out that could drive the stock exponentially higher very quickly but I would say within the next couple of weeks or months uh right now the easy analyst targets are at a th000 uh some are well above that level so I think a th000 is an easy target by mid year okay guys a lot of exciting things to cover on this one is there anything else that you want to add well I think we talked about the cash and the potential for dividends and share repurchases I think that'll be a real game Cher for NVIDIA because it'll get all of the uh the name Chasers and the story Chasers to be compounded by Buy and Hold investors and that'll really solidify the market I think what the Nvidia report is saying is that we're still in the very early stages of what AI is going to look like and I think that you're start when you have companies like meta and Microsoft saying we can't buy these chips fast enough I think that really is telling investors that again we're not at the end of something we're at the beginning of something right and Nvidia is at the beginning of that right right it could be next year before we see a significant uh correction in the AI Market just give them a chance to catch up on chip demand give the uh the infrastructure Builders a chance to build the infrastructure and then see where we are yeah I mean eventually it'll mature but that day is not today right exactly all right well as Nvidia edges closer to the Thousand Milestone the question remains how will this Tech Titan continue to shape the future of AI and Computing stay tuned for more updates,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,o7Bt7OnYYGM,2024-02-19T17:22:49Z,DraftKings' 5% Dip: Market Warning or Buy Signal?,DraftKings,"is draftking share price drop a red flag or simply a hiccup for an otherwise bullish Trend let's talk about it. Welcome back guys we're here to talk about the recent developments with DraftKings. Following their Q4 earnings release and their guidance update DraftKings saw a more than 5% drop in share price so is this a sign of trouble or is it maybe just a minor setback kind of in a larger bull mark Market Trend? Let's break down those details here and talk about what this means for investors. So what exactly led to the 5% uh decline in share price? That 5 per drop was really just a knee-jerk reaction to the headline news, um the report was good, um I think what happened is we had a mixed report where Revenue missed by a really itty bitty margin but margins were impressive and guidance was good so investors bought the dip. So how does this kind of recent price action fit into the broader Market trend for DraftKings? Well DraftKings is then an uptrend, it's driven by its results and by the analyst, uh the analysts since Friday have come out with several price Target increases that are going to continue to lead this Market higher. Despite the decline though uh DraftKings reported nearly 50% year-over-year Revenue growth. What all goes into that? It's about um expanding the new territories and deepening penetration so the company has a dual tailwind and that Tailwind will continue to blow this year. I know they're getting ready to open up some new markets where I live in North Carolina, we've been seeing a bunch of ads recently, um and I think that we're going to add I think with Puerto Rico about 4% of the addressable Market in in North America which is a pretty big gain for them this month. Yeah they're you know DraftKings is is increasing the number of users uh that are using the their mobile app and the mobile sports book and the thing about that is that's not necessarily business that they're taking away from other sports books because a lot of people that enjoy sports betting they have accounts on more than one sports book at one time because they want to have the different um they want to have the different opportunities that are available to them to maybe get different odds with one sports book or another and to also you know double their winnings and all that stuff so the fact that DraftKings is increasing their their users doesn't necessarily mean you know it doesn't mean that the pie is any smaller for them. Yeah like Thomas said it's you know you've got North Carolina that will go online with the mobile sports book and we're still not even talking about some of the other stuff I think we'll probably hit that a little bit later you know in terms of how big their Market can get. So considering their adjustment and valuation and the company's performance how should investors kind of view DraftKings growth prospects and their Market positioning here? I think they should view it very well I mean as Chris was saying they're they're growing their their footprint but they're also deeply penetration they're not necessarily taking business from themselves or from other sports books they're also investing in growth. One of the details that I saw was the hold rate improved and the hold rate is just the amount of money that bers are putting on the platform the company gets to keep it's like their their their margin their margins are improving and that all plays into the long-term Outlook. Another area I kind of wanted you guys to provide some of your insights on here is that insiders that are owning a significant portion of the company are starting to sell so how is this going to affect DraftKings in the near term? I mean I don't think very much it's pretty tightly held by insiders based on how the company was started and how it's been grown right now they're selling small amounts into the rally I mean good for them they're making bank on their on their on their their business and their growth, um until they start like dumping in mass I don't think it's going to be a big headwind. A lot of the selling looks like it's sort of organized um contractual you know 105b type of selling so I don't think it's you know they're not dumping the stock because they don't believe in the stocks prospects. Yeah just in general I mean Insider selling isn't the red flag that it used to be in the old days there's too many people watching there's too many regulations they have to file these things in advance it's not like they can just come out there and start dumping shares right so yeah I mean it's it's been factored into the market it's just that's them taking the profits and good for them yay. Okay what else to our viewers need to consider for draft Gams? There's there's a couple things that I would look at um number one is as Thomas was saying you have to look at the addressable Market not just now but going forward, um you've got Texas and California are still not in play they're not going to be in play this year uh the earliest Texas could could come online would be 2025 that's just a function of how their legislature meets California it's got a pretty heavy lift before they're going to allow um mobile Sports books online Sports books of any type. But having said that it still looks like there's a good opportunity in Georgia this year and potentially Missouri. What that means is that you might see draftking sales and Mark marketing costs go down a little bit when I was looking at their balance sheet that cost was up year-over-year but it's been down in the last couple of quarters. DraftKings themselves is saying it's costing them less to uh do their sales and marketing to existing customers so that's good so it looks like their Mark sales and marketing costs may come down a little bit that way that's something for investors to look at. You know overall I'm not I'm probably I'm maybe not as big of a fan on the stock as Thomas is um it it's sort of one of those things it it's funny because it's a sports betting site because I kind of look at the betting and I'm looking at the analysts raise the bet I know I think I'd probably take the under on that right now but um just because again I don't know how many new markets they're going to get into this year but um if you if you're a sports fan and you're a sports betting enthusiasts right now DraftKings is one of the only pure plays out there and it's and it looks very solid. One more thing Lacy don't want to get long L on this one thing to watch is going to be DraftKings free cash flow which they say is going to start becoming positive in 2024 if that happens and now they have free cash flow that they can start using to reward shareholders in different ways then the stock becomes a little bit more interesting for me. But for right now you know I'm probably more inclined to bet on DraftKings than I would be to bet on the stock. One of the things that Chris made me think of in this right now is that DraftKings in its price action has got a pretty fair amount of momentum so this is kind of a momentum play as much as is a growth or valuation play. So investors are probably going to want to wait for dip to buy and certainly whenever the stock price surges use those times to take some profits.

MarketBeat,_YbWiwRvkbg,2024-02-16T17:32:03Z,7 Speculative Stocks that Could be Worth the Risk,iCAD,okay lastly we have IAD uh as AI becomes more and more integral to healthcare particularly in cancer detection what challenges and opportunities icad face and especially when considering its partnership with alphabet so this one is the one that's probably the most um the most intriguing to me um as as we're all aware of as we're talking here now breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women um it's also a cancer that we've learned that if it's caught early there is a better chance of uh of survival from it uh so IAD comes comes to this with the idea of you have mammograms it's building artificial intelligence into that process to help hopefully uh detect cancer earlier and maybe find it in cases where maybe it otherwise isn't showing up obviously the idea is then to detect it at the earliest possible stage it's intriguing for that reason uh obviously that's a reason why a company like alphabet is going to want to partner with it um I would sit here and think as Thomas has brought up with a couple of them that would lead me to believe that you might see this company as a takeover Target for another company that wants to come in and and uh have this as an offering right I think this is probably the most interesting stock on the list I think that Ai and healthCare is um is a big business future business AI is supposed to really Advance drug Discovery and detection it should be a huge Money Maker um so yeah I'm on board with this one for sure,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,mkL3d22_QUY,2024-02-13T13:55:56Z,PepsiCo Stock NOT Flat,PepsiCo,"Pepsi CO's Fizz has not gone flat and it can still be a refreshing choice for your portfolio. PepsiCo did not lose its Fizz and the dividend King continues delivering for investors. The dividend increase was 7%, and although revenue was a little weak and below consensus estimates, the margins expanded and earnings grew. PepsiCo is being considered undervalued relative to its historical Norms, presenting a good time for Pepsi Co investors to add to their positions. Investors that get in now will be getting Pepsi at a cheaper price than usual with a higher yield with an expectation for some growth and some capital appreciation a price multiple expansion over the next few years. There was a volume decline in food and beverage segments. PepsiCo is managing costs and staying focused on its core growth strategy to bolster growth and margin across its portfolio. City Bank gave the stock an upgrade, and W bush reiterated favorable and positive Post Release action, with price targets above consensus, making Pepsi a pretty good buying opportunity. There is a significant trend in PepsiCo; its chart is pretty significant, showing a sustained uptrend for the last 30 years due to its diversification strategy, growth, and dividend growth. Unless Pepsi is in trouble or the global economy is going to contract, there's no reason to think that Pepsi will break this trend or this support level. I would target this region as a good place to buy the stock. Over the next two or three years, we'll see it resume this uptrend and move up to new all-time highs.",1.0,0.8

Anybody that was familiar with our old office will remember our 500g saltwater fish tank. this the Mark we sign is still on there that's kind of fun to have a view of the old space from the new space and kind of remember where we came from. We wanted to build out a space that big enough for our team today but also big enough for our team 10 years from now so we we have room for up to probably 30 people in here right now as it's currently configured we could probably add another 10 after that but we wanted a space with room to grow and room to expand and I think we've accomplished that. Another thing is that you know markab beat we really believe in the development of downtown sou Falls so we have supported projects like the parking m r mural the levit and startup sou Falls and the mark be holiday Plaza. you know part of making downtown a great place to work is to you know put our office in downtown sou Falls and really make an investment you know in having your teen here. a lot of people help make this dream of reality um you know we could never do this by ourselves but with the help of isg or architects um Interstate Office Products uh Northern plans management design who are designers and Journey Group construction um they all work together to make this project the reality that it is and we're just super grateful for all of them. you know our office has a lot of cool features some of them are really obvious like the fish tank and the mural and the stock ticker but some of them you're just going to have to come in person to see for yourself. thanks for taking this virtual tour of the office we want to invite you to come check it out in person we're going to do a ribbon cutting and an open house uh on February 27th from 400 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. so we hope you'll join us then and come see it for yourself.,1.0,1.0

MarketBeat,FXESex9tRR8,2024-02-09T17:48:13Z,Disney Stock Rising!,Disney,the return of Bob Iger was the best news Disney could have given shareholders and the proof is in the q1 fiscal 2024 results. let's talk about it today we have an exciting video Disney's recent performance and what it means for investors. the return of Bob Iger coupled with some strategic moves has ignited a buzz in the market. uh his returns seem to have sparked a wave of optimism among shareholders so how has his leadership kind of influenced Disney's recent performance um and the Strategic Direction here well he's put the company back on track it's certainly lost its direction over the years when he was absent um him coming back was an emergency move by the board it was a good call and it's definitely showing in the results. yeah I think it's there's there's a little bit of a similar story playing out with Disney uh as we're seeing with meta. Disney seems to be doing the same thing right now. all right getting into some of the numbers here uh despite weakness in entertainment Disney's q1 fiscal 2024 results indicate positive momentum in various other metrics. so how do we interpret this trend and what does it mean for potential returns for investors well it's it's good trends for investors uh the sports and experience segments were both Up Entertainment was down but that's elasticity with higher prices um growth is expected to return so I see the company building leverage across that segments now. yeah I think go ahead go ahead Chris well l just going to jump in and say you know that to me as I was looking through the earnings report I mean it really looks like Disney's starting to get to that point where you can call it a some of its parts business again they're getting the theme park revenue is back and and it's showing growth especially internationally. you're seeing growth you know on the entertainment side that's the streaming in the and the Legacy Cable business and you know I think it's the studio work right now that's going to be where people are going to be looking at it a little bit but um there might be a little trough there as far as the original content coming out of there but Disney is starting to return to that okay this is a business where if one side's down the other side's up and that might make it a more attractive investment. the margin news was also good I didn't mean to skip over that before too but you know iger's cost cutting and Chris's Comas getting back on track he's getting the company back on track to where it can focus on core strengths get back to growth and deliver those cash returns to investors yep. okay now Disney quietly resumed its dividend distribution um and they've been kind of aggressive in share repurchases recently haven't they well they were aggressive with their dividend increase they brought it back finally they just increased it by 50% they have not been repurchasing shares since 2018 but they've brought that back as well that's another sign of strength in the company it's a good uh confidence builder for the market I think they're targeting 1 billion in share repurchases the first year we should expect that to grow by the by the end of the year. yeah I think the dividend uh the the reinstitution of the dividend and then the quick dividend increase I think that's to me that's probably one of the more attractive features of the entire earnings report yeah it just brings the market back to Disney you know they're not rning it anymore it's like now we can go buy some Disney they're starting to do what what it needs to do exactly. so I want to touch a little bit more on their strategic initiatives for growth here here um I'm talking about the sports franchises um they're entering the gaming space with epic games how should investors kind of see these moves positioning Disney for future revenue and their earnings growth oh these are good moves I think ESPN has been an underutilized asset for years Iger is now going to try to expand and build on this brand I think that it is the Premier Source for Sports content so they just got to get it out to where the people want to see it and then with the the gaming side they're leaning into the metaverse you know kind of they didn't call it the metaverse but they're leaning into the metaverse build a platform um and if you compare this move to kind of to what Roblox is doing Roblox is tracking for three billion in Revenue that's worth 3% to Disney right there so I mean that's a definitely a good a good growth strategy I think. okay well Disney's recent performance is promising um are there any other potential challenges or maybe risks that are on the horizon that we as investors should be aware of yeah I'll jump in here and say you know right now as I look at the earnings report and this is kind of getting a little bit into the weeds but there's kind of a race going on in their entertainment division they've got to get the streaming profitable before the Legacy Cable business starts becoming unprofitable right now they're on track to do that but it'll be that to me is the story that I want to watch for over the next couple of quarters can can they get streaming Pro Prof itable um in at the same Pace they're doing if they keep on the same Pace they're doing that'll be interesting if not you know this the stock May struggle a little bit Thomas do you have anything else to add there uh I mean the analysts like that like the news they're raising the targets um I think they're going to drive this thing into a reversal right now the price action is kind of struggling with some resistance at the top of its trading range but once we move past that I think it's going to be uh a clear road ahead for some sustained rallying. all right well as we wrap up it's evident that Disney's recent moves have injected excitement into the market here um from Bob iger's return to strategic initiatives and positive analyst Outlook um there's a lot to consider for investors that are I Disney stock so we are going to continue to monitor these developments closely.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,-DsoW3FO4AE,2024-02-07T12:02:16Z,Palantir Stock Continues to Silence Skeptics,Palantir,paler stock pops 20% and continues to silence its critics let's talk about it so paler Technology stock is up 20% in after hours and pre-market trading um after their strong earnings report so the company reported after the closing bell on February 5th and delivered several highlights we're here to cover it for our viewers uh so let's just jump right in guys um this stock has been on a roller coaster ride but recent performance is undoubtedly Turning Heads tell us about some of those highlights well the so they reported earnings after the Bell last night earnings came in right in line with expectations at around uh eight cents a share um Revenue slightly beat estimates they they came in at 68 million analysts were projecting 603 million um but I think and I we're going to talk about this a little bit later Lacy what really had the stock jumping after hours was the forward guidance from the company yeah go ahead I was just gonna say yeah you had mentioned something um that investors particularly are excited about is the company's forward guidance so tell us more about that what does it mean for the Future Okay so the uh palente reported strong growth in their um Commercial Business uh I think they I think let me see if I consult my notes Here uh 70% yeah thankk you Thomas it was like 70% year over year and then they're projecting to do another 40% commercial growth for next year year-over-year and that's going to mean probably about a 20% growth in Revenue year-over-year which would be about the same as this year and they're projecting to be uh continue the track of being positive earnings for all of next year um Alex karp is BAS basically saying right now they're growing so fast it's hard for the company to keep up with the growth well right I think the guidance is is cautious I mean get the F year guidance was strong q1 guidance is really cautious I think that What's Happening Here is is Panter is in this discovery phase and pointing back to the 70% commercial growth where the commercial business is discovering that paner is awesome to me paner is one of if not the most comprehensive cloud-based AI platforms that a business can use itiz because it starts with just data management and analytics but extends that into threat detection threat prevention and mitigation so it's like you've got security and data all in the same place uh I think paner this story is is only in the very very early Innings and one of the neat things about how they're approaching their commercial clients their goto Market platform with commercial um with sorry their goom Market strategy excuse me with their commercial clients is they're conducting these um on on not on site but they're these live boot camps where essentially they're letting the customers jump in interact with the product and the company says in their own literature they go from zero to use case in five days and that's really a clever way of doing it because the customers are seeing for themselves how the software Works what it can mean for their business and that's just making it you know very sticky as far as that Revenue growth goes for the company for sure okay so we've had this kind of yeah but perspective come up on several other stocks that we've covered here on marquet beat um but it's evident here with paler critics that seemingly their attitude what is their backing with this I mean go ahead Thomas oh I'm sorry I mean I'm not sure Chris's viewpoints but my view with the analyst and the market belief in general not so much retail investors but the the analy is they're just not on board with this company for some reason their their sentiment has and there's been some changes since the report but they're still lagging the market their sentiment fell from Whole to reduce over the last year the price targets Rising but it still lags the market I think that uh the analysts are kind of in this shifting Discovery phase too where they're going to discover that businesses like pante here and it's going to continue to grow I see uh significant potential Catalyst in their sentiment they continue to upgrade the stock and raise their price Target they could send this thing up triple digits yeah i' I've been following paler um since they went public by a direct listing in 2020 and um the the yah but sort of started with paler then there were a lot of analysts that didn't like the fact that they went public via a direct listing because that kind of worked around the whole IPO process then there was they were too relying on government contracts then it was how are you going to monetize Ai and I ironically now now one of the yuts is well yeah you're growing the commercial side of the business but what are you going to do for the government side of the business because as I wrote In my article it's not going to be as easy for them to do these um boot camps for their uh for their private you know public sector I should say the government contracts but that doesn't mean they can't get it done it just means it's going to take longer and they're already in the you know in the early stages of doing that plus palente has a huge first mover Advantage with the government there in lies some of the other question that some analysts have to Thomas's point of why they're not on board uh some analysts don't necessarily like the clients necessarily that paler has decided to take on from a government perspective but right now with paler showing the fact that it can grow not only the government side of the business but the commercial side of the business I agree with Thomas this just looks like analysts are a little behind the curve on this one and they're catching up yeah I I think it might be a case and sometimes I'm at fault of this they just want it to be bad right even though it's persistently proving to them that it's not bad they want it to be bad eventually the community will get on board with the story as it's playing out and it's very bullish okay so paler has been here before the stock has shot up in the last two earnings reports um and it's pulled back sharply each time but to higher lows right yeah right there are some pretty interesting things in the chart and we'll look at that in a second but what we're seeing this volatility is the tug of war between the retail Market which sees Palante here advancing Ai and advancing its business and the analysts which just don't for some reason let's pull that chart up so like Chris was saying you know paner IPO it shot up on all this hope of AI and what it could possibly do analyst just didn't buy into it we get some sideways trading and then a downtrend here we got a nice bottom and you notice this bottom kind of coincides right here with when AI starts getting the Market's attention and all of a sudden this bottom turns into a reversal and you get some rallying here and this is clearly an uptrend you've got a reversal that plays into higher highs and higher lows right now we're making another higher a higher low we broke out and I think that we set an inad day high we haven't quite made a closing High yet but it looks like we're on track for another new high technically speaking if this Market breaks above this red resistance line I would expect a good little pop up to maybe the 24 26 region and then for it to come back down and I would Target this region right over here as the next entry point we'll see how that plays out okay so ultimately a big question here do you guys think paler is a buy sell or hold buy paler stock now hold your position or wait for a better entry point okay so I just I I'll I'll stick with what I said in my article and I think right now probably holds for better entry point uh to Thomas's Point that he's made on several of these videos you know the charts telling you a story right now that story in the last two earnings report is it shoots up higher after earnings pulls back a little I'd wait for that little bit of a pullback before I jump in um something to remember is the 20% year-over-year growth that they're talking about is very good but it it's something that the analysts are saying is that worth a premium valuation that right now the company's drawing that's for investors to to think about if you're a long-term investor that really is not something you have to worry about but I would still say you maybe you want to wait for it to pull back a little bit rather than Chase it at this high price and then buy when it when you when there's a little bit more established price yeah there could be a pullback and I would certainly be a buyer on a pullback I think that there's also a chance the stock will continue higher right now I'm going to go ahead and call it a trade a trading buy for now it's also an investing buy for the long term.,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,-DsoW3FO4AE,2024-02-07T12:02:16Z,Palantir Stock Continues to Silence Skeptics,MarketBeat,okay so we've had this kind of yeah but perspective come up on several other stocks that we've covered here on marquet beat um but it's evident here with paler critics that seemingly their attitude what is their backing with this I mean go ahead Thomas,1.0,0.0
MarketBeat,SGLzvDtx5_o,2024-02-06T15:21:45Z,PayPal a Fundamental Buying Opportunity in 2024?,PayPal,despite an AI fuel rally and a Workforce shakeup PayPal stock seems to be stuck in neutral but is there a hidden opportunity for investors let's find out so we had a viewer request to take a look at PayPal today we love the suggestions we're here to keep you informed so let's get into this one uh if we take a look at PayPal's history quickly uh from 2021 or 2020 to July of 2021 the stock experienced a significant surge um but since then it's dropped by a whopping 80% that's a yikes I don't know um what caused this dramatic decline so Lacy there's a couple of stories going on here and one's kind of a technical story and one's a fundamental story um I know Thomas is going to show the chart in just a second but a lot of what happened uh with PayPal it's it's a similar story that you see with a lot of stocks U there was a lot of growth between between the middle of 2020 to about the middle of 2021 and that had to do with the explosion of e-commerce it had to do with the fact that there were a lot of individuals who were turning their passion projects into side hustles and maybe even full-time jobs and there was much more demand for PayPal and its services and the stock price went up and it went to record highs probably went a little too high and probably got a little overvalued shouldn't say probably it definitely did and what you're seeing now over the last you know year and a half is you're seeing much more normalized activity for PayPal the stock price has come down the question really I think that has to be asked is maybe is the stock price come down too much you know I but I know Thomas wanted to jump in and show you some of the stuff on the chart right well let's let's look at the chart for a second right here the uh how the government stimulated this bubble up to this peak and the Market's trying to price price in this growth that's never going to end but then you know the bubble burst like it did stock price falls off and what we have in here is a lot of analyst sentiment impacting the price action PayPal is amongst the most downgraded stocks and lowest rated stocks on the market beat platform because of the sustained trend of lowered price targets lowered sentiment I believe the analysts are still holding it they still see some upside but the trend is still down now technically speaking I don't really see a bottom here yet a bottom could form we've definitely got some high volume days here down on this kind of this trading range but there's no clear bottoming yet that may start to happen over the next week because we have earnings expected to come out next week there is a relatively decent expectation for them to perform that may help get the analyst to start reversing that Trend in sentiment okay so despite the decline uh PayPal's revenue and earnings today showed slight growth compared to a few years ago does this have anything to do with the company diving head first into AI enhancements uh which by the way investors are a little wary about aren't they right so so to answer your first question or to answer the first part of what you said yeah the the Curious Thing when you look at the stock chart is the stock price is below 2019 levels but revenue and earnings are above that now I'm not going to say they're astonishingly above that but they're above that and so you would expect that that would be a bullish uh that would be a bullish note for investors the fact that maybe the stock is being a little bit undervalued now I don't think AI is the real story PayPal is trying to make it a story they have released um of several products uh through not only PayPal but through venmo uh the problem that analysts are seeing right now is that the products don't seem to be setting PayPal apart in other words the products aren't doing something that's unique it's not something that other companies such as Amazon aren't already doing so on on the one hand it's probably table Stakes you have to have ai you have to be able to show that you have that capability but I'm not sure if it's something that's really going to be driving the stock higher right now so PayPal did have a first mover Advantage uh in the payment sector two decades ago um but tell us more how has that Advantage kind of since diminished over time and how is that going to impact uh their competitive position now where are they playing catchup well I think it's number one is they're playing catchup in Ai and yeah I mean 20 years ago PayPal was kind of thought of in the same way not exactly the same way but there were similar sentiments about PayPal as there was to bitcoin it just seemed like this weird thing why would anybody use PayPal why would we be doing peer-to-peer stuff you know it's your money safer with the bank why are you doing this now now it's a very accepted way of moving money around um a lot of younger we're talking gen Z that's the only thing they know and they don't really even you know they don't even really have much use for a bank necessarily and but I think there's also a lot more competitors in the space you see even companies like visa and apple and Amazon getting into the buy now pay later thing so there's just a lot more competition doing the things that PayPal used to do having said that and In fairness and I do point this out in my article PayPal is still the market share leader in the space so we can't forget that but there is a lot more competition yeah right I think Chris had on two really good points and one is just that PayPal is kind of matured into its space it's the leader in the space everybody accepts it it's mainstream so the days of wicked growth are over they're gone never Happ never going to happen again at the same time there's lots of competition and one of the competitions that I see emerging that may not affect them for another year or two but will certainly impact their business is Elon Musk and X Elon Musk is trying to turn Twitter into a multiplatform including payments on Financial Services he basic he started PayPal he's got lots of experience so it's very possible that he could disrupt their business and even if he doesn't you know send them packing he will certainly be able to gain some market share from them all right guys here is where things get interesting though PayPal stock is trading relatively cheap um around 16 times forward earnings what does this mean for a potential investors and why uh has short interest dropped by 15% recently okay so let's look at the two parts of that um it's trading at 16 times earnings and the significance of that for investors especially for investors who are more value oriented is PayPal is trading at a discount to where it normally trades you know from a historical perspective and 16 times earnings is more reflective of what Thomas said of a mature company but at the same time it's also trading at a value to itself so that's not so that's appealing for investors who are looking to get involved short interest was never necessarily that high from a total share basis but it has dropped 15% in the last month and that could also be something where if you have if PayPal does report strong earnings on February 7th then at least retail investors aren't having to overcome the shorts there they don't there's a little bit more room for shares to grow yeah I I don't quite see the same value per Prospect as Chris does I mean trading at 16 times earnings it is a discount to itself historically but the company has changed from being a growth Tech stock to being a mature financial company and that respect 16 times earnings is kind of Fairly valued and there's no dividend yield so people looking for a Financial stock will probably want to look somewhere else people that want to play PayPal for it its Tech and its growth may also wish to look somewhere else okay well as you mentioned mark your calendars uh February 7th PayPal is going to release its earnings report um is there anything else with this that we need to be looking out for I think the report it's a potential catalyst the analysts have been raising their targets uh they're expecting growth to slow a little bit but still remain pretty steady in the mid single digit range um like Chris said there's a chance for out performance even just steady performance could be enough to get the market to bottom and now bottoming is is a start yeah I mean I think if you're not in the stock right now I don't think there's a hurry for you to get in and if the stock does start to move you'll have time to get in on it I would say it's probably a watch list stock for you um the bigger question is what do you do if you actually own the stock right now all right well there you have it stay tuned for more updates on PayPal right here on this channel and on Market beat,1.0,-0.2

MarketBeat,vQoo_KGAnOw,2024-02-01T17:35:39Z,Microsoft Stock to $450? Here's How,Microsoft,Microsoft suggests a move to 450 is coming soon and we're here to break it down for investors let's get started we're here to talk Microsoft stock today Q4 results didn't spark a rally or a massive correction in the stock price but Thomas tell us about the results in the future outlook here um I think the results were strong and the Outlook are strong um all segments were up double digits the only area that I would be concerned about was in more personal Computing because a lot of that game was due to the addition of Activision Blizzard uh the gaming industry is a little bit wanky right now but other than that everything else was real solid okay so yeah I'm sorry Lacy I think investors were looking for two things I think they were looking for um you know Ai and I don't know if Microsoft really said a lot because I don't think they really have the numbers yet to talk about what co-pilot's doing for them and then I think the other one was Azure and as far as I know they pretty much are crushing it with Azure so right you know but I don't know if they crushed it enough to really give the stock the bump that it needed well right Asia was up 30% and uh they are embedding co-pilot across the stack and I think Lacy wanted to talk about that too but that's one of the drivers for the businesses getting that AI into the stack and the that's happening right now with with AI for the business yeah that was actually what I was going to lead into I was going to say so I feel like AI might be driving Microsoft to new heights here eventually um but yeah is there anything new with the technology stack that investors should be looking ahead to can you touch more on that right so what the CEO SATA Nadella said was that they're in the shift from uh from building AI in the cloud to applying it and in terms of the AI Market the applications and the services are going to be far larger than the buildout growth faster so that's the real opportunity if we think that Microsoft has had a big boost already uh we should expect a bigger boost to come over the next few years all right well let's touch on the margin news here gross and operating margins are above the consensus figures hit us with those numbers Thomas well right I don't have the gross margin number in front of me but I know that the net and operating incomes were both up 33% double the Topline growth margins are being expanded that's being aided by Revenue strength but also by internal efficiencies driven by its own AI so that's really a dual Tailwind I think for the business okay and what about guidance it looks like it's pointing towards higher share prices well the guidance was good uh they're looking for uh for growth looking for margin expansion and like I said nadela says they're in this shift from like the building phase to the using phase and it's the use that's really going to drive the gains long term well analyst activity for Microsoft has been pretty robust uh the analysts are giving Microsoft a big thumbs up what are the key insights that investors can take away from this activity well first off the first thing that I noticed this morning is that we've seen six boosted targets since the report was released now What's significant is that these six targets include the new highest Target and all six are in the high end of the range now let me pull up my chart and you can see what got me excited with this right so technically speaking Microsoft had $110 rally last year hit a top corrected created a flag pattern broke out in a continuation signal this continuation signal to me means that the next rally could move up by this magnitude $110 of 45% that gives a range of$ 450 to 490 which is right in alignment with all these new analyst price Targets this is where I think Microsoft is going so the critical resistance of right now is near 410 uh and it's breaking through that it sounds like it could pave the way for a rally what is the risk here though I honestly don't see a lot of risks right now it's kind of in a wait and seee mode to see if these results really unfold the way they are I don't know what you think Chris uh right now I think the risk is not being invested in Microsoft yeah I I would agree with that I mean the thing with Microsoft is because of their their close relationship with open AI they've already got a lot of the infrastructure done with AI so it's not like interest rates are really a big concern for them as it might be with some smaller cap companies and right now I think if you're gonna if I'm going to throw any cold water on it Lacy and this is really just a reach it would be if they come out in subsequent subsequent quarters and say that maybe the revenue they're getting or they're seeing from co-pilot isn't what they expected but I think that's a very very minor risk I think investors should be looking at any pullback they're getting right now as a gift and an opportunity to get in on Microsoft even at this price because again there's a difference between the stock price and the value I think Microsoft's offering a really good value right now all right well thank you everyone for

MarketBeat,1uX6PjWQTIQ,2024-01-31T19:18:48Z,Advanced Micro Devices at Significant Turning Point,Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices is at a significant Turning Point Let's Talk the details all right guys we just covered AMD on the channel not that long ago so go check that video out but there's more happening more to talk about so let's get into it amd's share price imploded following their Q4 release but Thomas you're saying this isn't something investors should get ansy about right tell us more about this decline right I think this is a knee-jerk reaction to to the guidance which really should have been kind of expected um so the results were solid for Q4 um as expected so no Catalyst in that q1 guidance was a little bit weak weaker than expected so we have some stock price selling off but within the results what I see is um a bifurcated Market that's going to come into alignment later on this year on the one hand we've got Ai and Cloud driving results driving growth on the other hand we've got uh what was it it was the gaming and the embedded markets were both down so those two markets are supposed to return to growth by the second half second half of the year when those two forces come into alignment I see growth really accelerating and outperforming even what are already pretty robust um expectations for the second half Thomas mentioned something about AMD having an Nvidia like quarter what do you mean by that exactly and Chris go ahead jump in here too as well as far as the Nvidia like quarter goes AMD totally had an Nvidia like quarter in two segments data centers and client which are both focused on the cloud and AI so data center up 38% client was up 62% those were offset however by a 177% decline in gaming and a 22% decline decline and embedded so yes a Nvidia like quarter but offset by some Legacy weakness you know the one of the things that we've been talking about in our last video with AMD was the uh Mi 300 chips and AMD beat their sales forecast of 400 million for the quarter they exceeded that they've raised their guidance for 2024 from two billion to three and a half billion dollars and I just heard Lisa Sue talk uh on CNBC this morning and after she got done the analysts were saying the three and half billion dollars is probably conservatively low she yeah and she was asked about the gaming question because I think that's a really good point you brought up Thomas she's viewing it more as a cyclical thing she's she's tying it back to supply and demand and she said this is kind of a normal uh thing that they're going through right now she does expect some weakness in the first half because of some over Supply but she figures that's going to normalize and there will be growth in the second half of the Year okay let's talk about some more of the good news here the margins amd's Mar margin expansion both on a gaap and adjusted basis is something worth noting what are the details here well right so what we're looking at here and that is I sequential improvements so margins are really kind of flattish from last year but what we're seeing is um is normalization so the uh normalization happened over the course of the last year has kind of worked its way through the system the company is no longer being impacted by a lot of the same issues that were happening in 2023 margins are beginning to expand and the critical detail is that margins are expected to continue expanding in 2024 so we'll see some YY growth in that respect even in uh even in q1 I think what are the key factors or catalysts here that investors need to be monitoring uh in the coming months um to maybe assess the accuracy of these growth projections and the overall health of AMD as a stock investment the results from Microsoft suggest that demand for AI chips is huge robust Microsoft is accelerating its its its guidance so I see that impacting AMD um as long as this story continues to unfold in this manner um I believe what Chris said is right the 3.6 billion Target for mi30 sales is probably very very low so uh yeah from what I am hearing micro roft likes the mi30 chips already so they're they're a pretty good customer of AMD already right so AMD listed Amazon Google Alibaba Microsoft and Oracle all as buyers of the chips they listed uh meta they listed um super micro HP Dell Lenovo all this users of the platform so this is a huge win for the company um you know maybe they don't gain market share on Nvidia but they certainly will not lose lose any um sales should be real strong this year,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,1uX6PjWQTIQ,2024-01-31T19:18:48Z,Advanced Micro Devices at Significant Turning Point,Nvidia,Thomas mentioned something about AMD having an Nvidia like quarter what do you mean by that exactly and Chris go ahead jump in here too as well well what I was going to say was you know and this ties in nicely with where we're going with the Nvidia like quarter um I think some analysts are reacting to the fact that on the call I guess last night Lisa Su talked about I'm sorry CEO Lisa Su the CEO I didn't want to leave that out um she referenced the fact that Nvidia would have a $400 billion do total addressable Market Tam uh for their accelerated Computing by 2020 7 and I think there might some of the selloff might be some analysts are choking on that a little bit uh the growth is going to come from as you would expect it from Ai and the buildout that's going to happen from that but I think I think some in some analysts might be um trying to process through that and figure out if that's a believable number as far as the Nvidia like quarter goes AMD totally had an Nvidia like quarter in two segments data centers and client which are both focused on the cloud and AI so data center up 38% client was up 62% those were offset however by a 177% decline in gaming and a 22% decline decline and embedded so yes a Nvidia like quarter but offset by some Legacy weakness you're going to want to watch results from the other Cloud companies inidia but also Microsoft and Oracle people like that to see what kind of demand that that they're having you know maybe they don't gain market share on Nvidia but they certainly will not lose lose any um sales should be real strong this year,1.0,0.3

MarketBeat,jZ9VR6Gs5dY,2024-01-29T20:01:55Z,The Tesla Earnings Story That's NOT Being Told...,Tesla,from Tesla's latest results to its future outlook we're here with the analysis you need to make smart investment decisions let's get started all right guys if the past year of price cuts and sluggish sales didn't already signal a shift in the EV landscape Tesla's recent Q4 results and 2024 Outlook certainly do so we're here to talk about both Tesla and the EV environment as a whole so while Tesla is still growing the days of uncontrolled production expansion are behind us um so one thing that investors might be a little bit worried to hear uh Tesla's growth is slowing and profitability is ailing what is contributing to this slowdown and how does Tesla plan to address these challenges in the coming years right so that's a really big question with lots of answers but I think uh like the big answer for the question of what is happening is that the EV market bubble has burst um this morning I'll bring that chart up in just a second I was looking at at a chart of Tesla and rivan just to kind of get a little bit of a comparison of like how Tesla has been doing versus the OEM startups we know their Bubble Burst a couple years ago they've been in the pits ever since then so let's look at that chart and I'll show you what I'm talking about right so if you look over here the OEM EV craze really started over here Tesla starts ramping production and we get a bunch of OEM eeve manufacturer started coming to market the market just goes out of control drives Tesla up drives Tesla up and right here we had a top this top coincides with uh the top of the EV OEM Market all right now Tesla is a much better company they're making some money they're established they still corrected very hard when that Bubble Burst Tesla has tried to rebound since then but now we've got just the EV Market in general has just played the demand has disappeared um in order for them to sustain growth they're cutting their prices that's cutting into margins and that is just nothing but bad news for the stock price all right let's bring it back in here to Tesla specifically um investors should not forget that Tesla isn't just a car company um that's another great point that you had made in your Market be article Thomas uh Chris I want to hear from you on this one too Tesla has other segments obviously that are generating profits instead of losses tell us more about those segments yeah and that's kind of the part of the Tesla earning story that's not getting told a lot I mean if you look at um their services their gross profits AI energy storage um even insurance and uh uh what do they call it energy trading and Robotics I mean there's just a lot of layers to Tesla and those other layers are still doing are still doing well so again this is more than a car company that's just that's just factual so we've seen that analyst sentiment has been a little bit negative lately Are there specific reasons behind these downgrades and price reductions that we maybe haven't touched on yet in this video and I'm curious what do you think about their stock price going forward is Tesla going to fall further there is a definite risk that Tesla shares could fall further because the analysts are lowering their their expectations and their targets they're doing that because Tesla guided for a week year um there's no expectation for Ev demand to pick up so we're not really going to be looking for Tesla's Revenue to grow it's not going to have a easy time expanding margins because of price Cuts so the analysts are reducing their targets I think that this is a trend that we've yet to see end um it really just depends on how deep they cut right now they are leading the market lower I would think that if sentiment Remains the way that it is this Market will break below support fairly soon yeah I heard I heard excuse me Lacy I heard somewhere where they said and I I know I know I've heard Don say this a lot over the past year that Tesla's like has been a very easy trade and right now Tesla's not really an easy trade anymore it's kind of and so it's a little bit different um in the way in the way investors are even thinking about it so are there any other insights that we need to consider about Tesla's future plans or any of the potential risks that investors should be aware of when they're considering Tesla as an investment well I think Tesla is still a win for the long term um there are all the other ancillary businesses the chances to advance technology but then there's also the core business I see Elon um as kind of like the Henry Ford of our day he is working to make EV cards affordable for everybody and Advance the technology they will make those advances it's just a matter of time when they will come through and be seen in the product and in the margins uh but that could start happening by 2025 uh Tesla is leaning into some new manufacturing techniques that should cut down on the manufacturing costs uh I think they're going to start using those in a more widespread manner this year um and if that's if it pays off it should it should widen the margins significantly yeah keep and keep in mind that he's not just doing the lower priced EVS because of you know to try to make it affordable for the American Consumer although he is but he's also doing it because he knows that China is aggressively trying to lower the price of their EVS so he knows that he needs to keep up in you know keep up with that market as well all right well thank you everyone for joining us today as we talked the Tesla talk,1.0,-0.1

MarketBeat,9H1d1n7YbrI,2024-01-24T13:30:04Z,Johnson & Johnson's Stock Price at Critical Turning Point,Johnson & Johnson,Johnson Johnson stock price is at a critical turning point we're going to dive into the impressive Q4 results explore the factors that are impacting the stock price and uncover opportunities and hurdles that lie on their path to growth let's get started Thomas you had noticed something in the chart that alerted you to the possibility of today's selloff so can you show us what you were talking about yeah Lacy I'd love to right so this is the chart of monthly price action and you can see that Johnson and Johnson has been in a sustained and strong uptrend for over a decade this is the company growing and Performing and paying dividends buying back shares you can see our little uh pandemic blip right here is barely a blip on the on the radar you got a little bit of a bubble formed right here and the market tops off this is because the pandemic bubble is burst the kin view spin-off gets priced into the market and so what I saw was this trend line is broken we rebounded back but the price action did not break back above the trend line which suggests that a turning point was at hand the stock might have rocketed higher and it might have confirmed resistance which is what actually happened today so let me go and find this other chart and here you can see uh the weekly bars price action broke through that trend line bounced off of this solid support line here but again we're having a hard time getting above this trend line and this trend line is now going to be resistance so what I see happening now is that J&J is probably going to be range Bound for the next year or two it may drift upwards it may come down and retest this support line but I don't see us making new highs significant new highs um anytime soon so as I was saying in that article there's not a lot of catalyst for a rally but there's plenty of information to help support the price action over the next couple of years while this Market uh normalizes and prices in that can VI spin-off okay yeah Thomas I noticed that um the analyst ratings on Market beat for J&J I was looking at the same thing that you were on the chart and I saw that even this morning after the earnings were released it did break below that support line I don't know if it's bounced back up now but it had Dr went lower and I was wondering too like how is it going to how is it going to get a sustained growth back up to its previous Highs but I did notice that some analysts are projecting price targets of like 185 I think one analyst was even in there with a price target of over $200 and I was wondering I don't know what what they're seeing there that maybe isn't being reflected in the charts right now so I think a lot of those price targets especially the one the 215 Target came out before this earnings release all right and so they're kind of trying to price in uh future gains okay but that 215 price Target is significantly the highest Target by like 20 or $25 right oh yeah so the the range of targets is right around that 165 to 185 range and consensus is right at 165 which is right where the trend line is right now the consensus has been coming down so I think that that's going to cap gains at least until the analysts stop lowering their targets and right now I think that high 215 Target is the riskiest one because it is so high above the consensus it's the most recently said it stands the uh the most risk of being of being lowered okay well Johnson Johnson did have a solid quarter in Q4 despite uh the impacts of the kenu spin-off and the the leveraging of pandemic sales um however little has emerged to catalyze the Bulls so although there's ample news support uh that supports the stock price over the long term so let's kind of dive in there a little bit more how did jna strategically manage uh to maintain this strong per performance in Q4 well it's all a little bit of manipulation me and Chris were just talking about that so like the reported results are all down compared to last year and that's because of the kin view spin-off profitability was impacted because of deleveraging of covid but when you strip out the spin-off you strip out covid you've got core growth and margin expansion which is awesome that's one of those things that will support the business over time because that Core Business is solid its growing margins are good but those near-term headwinds are the Ken view spin-off and Co deleveraging so until those two things come into balance I think that the stock is really going to be range bound yeah I mean Lacy you and I we've talked about different stocks in the past and I I like to use the analogy with earnings reports of saying they're like progress reports because they talk to you about what's happened in the past they don't necessarily do a great job of predicting what's going to happen in the future but what Johnson and Johnson's doing here and I agree with Thomas it's it's a little bit of a game but all companies do it is they're trying to point investors beyond the now they're trying they're saying don't be a prisoner of the moment and look at our Core Business beyond covid beyond the K Ken VI spin-off and you'll see that there's a lot of growth there and when you look at the pipeline there's reason to believe that there's a lot more coming onto onto the market that should help boost revenue and earnings yeah so let's elaborate on that a little bit what are the specific products and markets that are contributing to Johnson and Johnson's growth uh back in Q4 and what are the unique factors that are propelling these segments forward well right now it's that normalization of in markets so on a segment basis uh both segments grew but Pharma was the weakest that was obviously offset by the covid decline but Medtech grew almost 10% that's because of a normalization of procedures uh one of the strongest sub segments was wound closure which speaks right to increase the procedure volumes so the more times you cut into somebody the more time she got to sew them back up and then contact lenses people have to see so it's these these core basic businesses are really sustaining the business now and the growth now and that is really exciting to see for the long term because as Chris was saying there are some potential catalysts for revenue and earnings growth coming down the pipe line if they can maintain this stable Foundation when those catalysts come into play there is upside potential for the stock price okay so margin news is also favorable here both gaap and adjusted earnings are showing positive Trends tell us more about that part of it just like we said before I mean reported results are down the core business is improving looking forward we just want to see that Core Business continue to be stable Andor improve to help sustain some Market sentiment some positive sentiment while the market is normalizing yeah the midpoint of Johnson and Johnson's guidance they reaffirmed their guidance actually for the coming year and the midpoint of the guidance is I think still over 10% for earnings growth which is outstanding right um you know but it aligns with the analyst's expectation so again supports the price but doesn't catalyze the market to new highs right so in comparison into its peers here and the historical uh performance how does Johnson Johnson's value and yield position uh and yield position itself as an attractive opportunity for investors and I'm also curious what are the expectations of a dividend increase uh you said that the dividend is safe for 2024 right Thomas um it looks that way to me um as far as the VA the value goes it's trading in alignment with the S&P 500 but it pays about a 100 basis points more dividend so that provides you a little bit of a value for income investors but it provides more value relative to its sector and to itself now Abbot another major Medtech company trades closer to 25 times earnings pays about half the dividend um Johnson and Johnson historically has traded at a much higher price multiple with a lower dividend so it's also got value relative to itself um it looks like a pretty good opportunity to get into Johnson and Johnson we're just going to want to look and pick the right entry points yeah I think the I was looking before we came on I think the forward P for Johnson and Johnson's like 16 times earnings which yeah right right I don't think I can remember a time when they've been that I think historically it's trading at like 25 or 28 times earnings so certainly um certainly a chance for a price multiple expansion yeah and with the dividend yield of 3% and earnings growth I think this year like they're saying maybe around 10% I mean that's that's more in line with what investors want to see especially when inflation is still around 3% and even the most optimistic uh analysts are saying it's going to be a little bit of time to get that inflation rate back down to the fed's preferred you know Target of around 2% if it in fact it even gets there this year so when you start seeing earnings growth of 10% is and then the dividend yield on top of that that starts making Johnson and Johnson a little bit more attractive for income investors as opposed to the 4% they can get right now on the on the treasury so knowing all of this what else do investors need to consider well there are some headwinds coming up um Co is still a headwind they're still going to be deleveraging from from that respect but also um the Medicare negotiations that could have a significant impact on sales for Pharma and devices uh so we're going to want to keep a a close eye on that as well yeah they've got some uh very interesting uh drugs in their pipeline especially as it relates to cancer treatment but like Thomas said those are going to be subject to uh you know scrutiny over the pricing and things like that and then this and then the tal lawsuit isn't totally resolved yet and that's going to be something that investors are gonna have to pay attention to in the short term yeah there's a significant potential for T um settlements to cut deeply into cash flow and cash Reserves so yeah all right well thank you everyone for watching this one stay tuned for more updates on J&J right here on our Channel and of course the marbe website where Chris and Thomas share their insights there's plenty of great articles from them uh for investors to continue their

MarketBeat,MTyulBi-j_E,2024-01-23T18:00:27Z,A 50% Upside for AMD? Here’s How,Advanced Micro Devices,while it may not be in the Limelight like some Rivals we've got compelling reasons to believe that Advanced Micro Devices is gearing up for a potential 50% surge by the end of 2024 let's talk about it we're talking about Advanced Micro Devices today and it seems that AMD may not be gting as much attention as some of these other semiconductor stocks which by the way we have discussed semiconductors on this channel previously so don't forget to um go back and watch some of our analysis on those but there are multiple factors suggesting that there's a promising outlook for 2024 and we could potentially see um an slight increase in value by year end here so we're we're talking 50% um so that's certainly significant so let's dive into that right now what really are those major factors that's contributing to this potential growth yeah so right now I'm seeing like two maybe three underpinning themes for AMD uh the first is in Market normalization uh the whole semiconductor industry experienced an innovatory glut that is only just now coming back into alignment that spans memory Computing PCS devices totally includes AMD. AI is huge um Nvidia is obviously the leader there's no doubt about that but it can't keep up with demand that leaves room for AMD to gain market share and they're already the number two player in data centers so in between those two things is AI at the edge that's uh AI in your computers and your devices so AMD is also working hard to bring AI to the edge with its Rising chip line and it's making some pretty big strides in that development um so that plays again into the End Market normalization and a secular grade multi-year up cycle that could last I mean five years or more as AI advances are become are become embedded into our devices okay let's talk about uh the competition a little bit here how does amd's revenue growth forecast um and other significant factors for 2024 compared to Nvidia so what's contributing to these differences and how is this an opportunity for AMD to gain market share well so I think the growth forecast is ridiculously low it's only 177% right now which is only a few hundred basis points above the industrywide forecast and this is compared to Triple digit growth for NVIDIA who was the AI leader I think that AMD could easily see an Nvidia like year as far as AI goes uh AMD is an Nvidia but it will benefit from that demand and nvidia's an ability to keep up with the demand um so yeah that's that's that's my take yeah and I think investors here are really going to be focusing on how well AMD can compete with Nvidia on price um I've been hearing that the Mi 300's been coming in with the price that's significantly lower than Nvidia if that's the case then AMD may be that that forecast that Thomas is talking about may very well be very conservative that's a great point that Chris made I was just checking up on that before we started and it looks like uh the Mi 300s are running about 20 grand as a starting base price which is like 30% lower than the the h100 so that's a significantly hu that's a huge cost difference all right well speaking of opportunities here uh can you provide us a little bit more details about amd's upcoming Mi 300 line and its potential impact on the market so uh the Mi 300 is a competitive chip it's meant to compete with h100s and they do offer some advantages they've got uh some better processing speeds and better memory but the real difference is the software layer nvidia's been building its software layer for almost a decade and that's what allows all these AI companies to really use the chips and really get the most out of them uh AMD is catching up um but it is the software that makes them work um but regardless of that numerous players have said that they're going to offer the AMD chips even if it's only for uh for choice you know and many other players have said that they want the choice yeah I mean one of the things that's happening with this chip is that AMD is entering the that the generative AI space in a big way and I think this is a real good um lesson for investors that you don't necessarily have to be the first in the space and if you come in late and you do it well there's still room at the party for you especially in AI because as Thomas was saying demand is just exceeding the ability of Nvidia to keep up with it so there is an opportunity here even though AMD would be considered late in the space okay and there's already some major companies that are on board to support this series right so does that imply that sales should be significant I think sales are going to Boom this year uh right now we've got Lenovo Microsoft Dell meta many others saying that they're going to use these chips CEO Lisa Sue thinks that the Mi 300 will bring in two billion this year but I think that's a very low figure I just saw one of the most recent analyst uh reports talking about 4 billion which may also be a low figure You got to remember that Nvidia is estimated to have made 37.5 billion off the h100 last year alone so there's a chance that AMD sales could reach the six seven eight billion dollar levels maybe not this year but next year for sure yeah I agree with Thomas I think uh the numbers that AMD is is forecasting are are conservative and we all know that there's a there's a uh there's a game that some of these companies play in terms of they try to lowball so they can have they can easily beat it I don't think that's what AMD is doing here but I do think that in 2024 especially as it relates to AI companies don't want to miss their forecast so I think you're seeing a number that's going to be conservative it's a number that they believe they can hit and probably beat but I think it's good that they're throwing out there a number that's probably conservative okay so what about the potential risk factor of manufacturing here we know that both Nvidia and AMD uh rely heavily on Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing for all their Advanced AI chip manufacturing um and they've already stated that it's going to be well into 2025 before they can catch up with AI demand so there's that hurdle um is AMD doing anything though to mitigate this risk well AMD has already mitigated that risk to some extent I mean it does rely on Taiwan semiconductors almost as much as Nvidia but Nvidia relies on it just that much more to complete all of their Advanced uh packaging processes so AMD has been using a company called Tong Fu microelectronics for years they do a lot of that advanced packaging they've been taking on more and more responsibilities over the last year or two they're already known to be testing the Mi 300s so we can expect that to be uh you know less of a problem for AMD than Nvidia and in this case it might be all all that takes for AMD to get its chips to Market just a little bit faster and gain that edge yeah there's something else that investors should be watching Pretty closely um so we're all familiar with the chips act which is it's the uh legislation that was proposed by the US Congress passed by the US Congress I should say that allows that's rewarding uh semiconductor companies for bringing their chip manufacturing into the United States and amd's invested about 20 billion dollar to do that they're trying to open up two facilities um one is rumored to be in New York I don't remember where the other one is scheduled to be they're trying to do this however at a time when they're trying to kind of um you know reduce their uh their cost of manufacturing so to speak so this is this is a little bit more of a books and numbers game it's not really affecting the company's operations per se but it's just something to watch because it is an investment that they're making and I'm not sure you know when those plants are supposed to be up and running but it is something that's going to be a cost to them yeah it'll still be a few quarters year or two before some of these new foundaries get up and running that's really a story I think for next year and the year after but could be a significant factor in the long-term direction of the stock price all right Thomas talk to our viewers a little bit more here about amd's technical Outlook um their potential for upside and any other takeaways that we need to hold on to right you know so coincidentally the very day that I wrote the article this video is based on uh the stock surged more than 5% and set a new all-time high uh so the rally and the technical setup suggest a solid 30 to 50% upside and that is echoed by the analyst sentiment uh the take here is that AMD looks like it will make a run for the 300 level and it may surpass that level as the year progresses um that's assuming that the results come in as I think they might yeah I'm not sure if I'm willing to go all the way up to 300 that seems like a bold call but I agree with Thomas amd's forecasting earnings growth about 50% this year uh there was I just noticed before we came on to tape that I think it was uh Barkley came out with a $200 price Target just yesterday uh KeyBank came in around 196 so the the analysts are starting to bid up the price now it just depends on you know if AMD can deliver the earnings to justify those yeah I mean I'm I'm really looking at nvidia's last year and thinking that AMD is going to have a very similar year with growth outperformance beating its guidance raising its guidance and having the analysts persistently raise their estimates as the year goes on yeah well there you have it there were some great insights here for Advanced Micro Devices and it's potential for growth in 2024 thank you for

MarketBeat,MTyulBi-j_E,2024-01-23T18:00:27Z,A 50% Upside for AMD? Here’s How,Nvidia,AI is huge um Nvidia is obviously the leader there's no doubt about that but it can't keep up with demand that leaves room for AMD to gain market share and they're already the number two player in data centers. how does amd's revenue growth forecast um and other significant factors for 2024 compared to Nvidia so what's contributing to these differences and how is this an opportunity for AMD to gain market share well so I think the growth forecast is ridiculously low it's only 177% right now which is only a few hundred basis points above the industrywide forecast and this is compared to Triple digit growth for NVIDIA who was the AI leader I think that AMD could easily see an Nvidia like year as far as AI goes uh AMD is an Nvidia but it will benefit from that demand and nvidia's an ability to keep up with the demand um so yeah that's that's that's my take yeah and I think investors here are really going to be focusing on how well AMD can compete with Nvidia on price um I've been hearing that the Mi 300's been coming in with the price that's significantly lower than Nvidia if that's the case then AMD may be that that forecast that Thomas is talking about may very well be very conservative that's a great point that Chris made I was just checking up on that before we started and it looks like uh the Mi 300s are running about 20 grand as a starting base price which is like 30% lower than the the h100 so that's a significantly hu that's a huge cost difference. the Mi 300 is a competitive chip it's meant to compete with h100s and they do offer some advantages they've got uh some better processing speeds and better memory but the real difference is the software layer nvidia's been building its software layer for almost a decade and that's what allows all these AI companies to really use the chips and really get the most out of them. as Thomas was saying demand is just exceeding the ability of Nvidia to keep up with it so there is an opportunity here even though AMD would be considered late in the space. You got to remember that Nvidia is estimated to have made 37.5 billion off the h100 last year alone so there's a chance that AMD sales could reach the six seven eight billion dollar levels maybe not this year but next year for sure. we know that both Nvidia and AMD uh rely heavily on Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing for all their Advanced AI chip manufacturing um and they've already stated that it's going to be well into 2025 before they can catch up with AI demand so there's that hurdle um is AMD doing anything though to mitigate this risk well AMD has already mitigated that risk to some extent I mean it does rely on Taiwan semiconductors almost as much as Nvidia but Nvidia relies on it just that much more to complete all of their Advanced uh packaging processes. yeah I mean I'm I'm really looking at nvidia's last year and thinking that AMD is going to have a very similar year with growth outperformance beating its guidance raising its guidance and having the analysts persistently raise their estimates as the year goes on,1.0,0.7

MarketBeat,MTyulBi-j_E,2024-01-23T18:00:27Z,A 50% Upside for AMD? Here’s How,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing,we know that both Nvidia and AMD uh rely heavily on Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing for all their Advanced AI chip manufacturing um and they've already stated that it's going to be well into 2025 before they can catch up with AI demand so there's that hurdle um is AMD doing anything though to mitigate this risk well AMD has already mitigated that risk to some extent I mean it does rely on Taiwan semiconductors almost as much as Nvidia but Nvidia relies on it just that much more to complete all of their Advanced uh packaging processes,0.9,0.0
MarketBeat,MTyulBi-j_E,2024-01-23T18:00:27Z,A 50% Upside for AMD? Here’s How,Tong Fu Microelectronics,so AMD has been using a company called Tong Fu microelectronics for years they do a lot of that advanced packaging they've been taking on more and more responsibilities over the last year or two they're already known to be testing the Mi 300s so we can expect that to be uh you know less of a problem for AMD than Nvidia and in this case it might be all all that takes for AMD to get its chips to Market just a little bit faster and gain that edge,0.9,0.7
MarketBeat,LJhfFs4jJrI,2024-01-22T13:30:14Z,"Buffett Keeps Buying Occidental Petroleum, Should You?",Occidental Petroleum,today's topic is a true attention grabber ocidental petroleum a stock that has been catching the eye of none other than Warren Buffett himself but why has oxy's stock price been range Bound for two years and what is the deal with the Buffett buy Zone we're here to talk about it so let's get started we have an intriguing topic on the table for today's video accidental petroleum a stock that's been grabbing the attention of none other than Warren Buffet himself first and foremost here uh why has oxy's stock price been range Bound for the past two years what's keeping him buying is improved cash flow debt reduction share repurchases and the dividend Outlook um I think the stock has been range bound because the market knows that Buffet can buy up to 15 more percent of the shares and they're ready to sell into the rally whenever he starts buying the stock is up like 200% what did I say 200% 300% since the lows so that's a huge selling opportunity for people that bought in in 2020 what do you think Chris yeah it's funny when it comes to ocidental because I don't even have to look at the chart because I know where the price is because I'll see Don message you and say Hey Thomas it's in the buffet bu and then you write an article about it because it's in the buy Zone and you guys have been right all the time every every time and let's not forget about the dividend because from what I saw uh it's been four quarters since um oxal last raised its dividend that means that we're getting to that point pretty soon probably this quarter when there's going to be a dividend increase in outon Buffett's not going to pass that up probably this quarter yeah right yeah and just to elaborate on what you said it's like Buffett bought an energy company and Oil stock because of the oil Outlook he bought oxy because of the capital structure Outlook and the capital return Outlook which I think is far superior to just about any other Energy company that I can think of all right guys well maybe you've touched on this a little bit but if Warren Buffett an investing genius obviously it keeps buying oxy stock there must be a compelling reason why um what could be driving the force behind his Investments and why should the average investor be taking note of this yeah well you know Thomas just T touched on the capital structure and I'll let him get into more of that but you know Buffett is a legendary value investor and there's only really one reason why he's buying into oil companies and oxy is not the only one that birkshire half theway owns and that's because he knows that the longterm outlook for oil prices is that they're going up um and possibly sooner than anyone expects um he oxy is an integrated oil company that means it touches oil at every stage from drilling it to delivery um it's one of the top names in the sector the world's going to continue to need oil for a long period of time and and Buffett has also spoken glowingly about oxy CEO uh Nancy Hub and the direction she's taking the company in so that's a ringing endorsement as well yeah right just to touch on the the capital structure like we said you he bought energy because he knows that it makes money um he's buying oxy because this company when the other energy Giants were leaning hard into divid increases and boosting their share repurchase programs it decided to improve its balance sheet and cap cap structure and pay down its debt now these value building efforts support an outlook for robust Capital returns over time and that's what Buffet's into he's not trading this stock he's buying value cash flow and profits y okay so Thomas you had mentioned before how one of the key reasons for owning uh oxy stock is the cash flow can you elaborate a little bit um how is oxy generating healthy cash flow here and what factors in the oil industry are the ones that are contributing to this well right now the cash flow starts with oil prices oil prices are well off their Highs but they're still trading above the average for the six years going into 2021 so that's an elevated Revenue base to start with cash flow is aided by production gains OPEC is curbing production while the Western producers are ramping their Productions putting the W record highs so that's giving them production leverage add in efforts at efficiency oil field Investments and technology and you have today's oxy so all of these things they're doing with the balance sheet to improve their capital structure is also freeing up cash flow so you've got this kind of dual triple Tailwind for the company generating its cash flow so what were exactly the highlights from oxy's Q3 results um how did they impact the company's financial position balance sheet shareholder value well so revenue and earnings were down on the deleveraging of oil prices but production volume exceeded gu guidance and offset those declines to a degree so the real takeaway is that Revenue fell 20% but cash flow remains healthy and near record levels the cash flow and free cash flow were also down impacted to a degree by spending but the YTD free cash flow allowed them allowed them to buy down 15% of their preferred stock incre reduced its net debt by 9% and increased shareholder Equity by 20% now that 20% increase in it is a fantastic signal that's one of the metrics that I'm sure Buffett's looking at it's a real indicator that the company is taking its business seriously reinvesting in itself and positioning itself for future growth birkshire hathway owns preferred stock in oxidal so how might this influence oxy's future actions um regarding debt repayment and share BuyBacks yeah so um most investors know that about in 2019 Berkshire bought about 10 million dollars of preferred shair from you know preferred shares of oxy and you know I think the company's going to continue to do more of the same of what Thomas just said they're going to continue to pay down debt they're going to continue to um you know increase the shareholder Equity that's just going to Simply make the stock more attractive for for Buffett to buy uh and as Thomas said it already owns I think 28% of the company it's that is undoubtedly going to go higher and I think I saw that those preferred shares currently the dividend on those is about 8% so you know Berkshire is not going to be interested in getting rid of those shares anytime soon yeah all right so oxy is expected to report Q4 results soon what are the analysts anticipating uh for this quarter and what factors might lead into potential underestimations in demand um and operational quality well so the Outlook is a little mixed with Revenue declines expected to persist into Q4 but growth in revenue and earnings should resume again in this fiscal year so within that operational quality both in the oil field and in the cash flow statement should uh generate cash flow improvements help sustain the capital return Outlook the debt reductions of repurchases and even improve the shareholder returns over time so as Chris was was mentioning before we're expecting a dividend increase now basically um if they don't do one that'll be a warning sign uh but what I'm expecting is for it to be sizable I mean it's not going to be like 20% but it might be a solid 10% um and that'll be a driver for the stock oh regarding demand I think that the demand issue was more fear-based in reality at this point um there's a lot of fear that high rates are going to curb demand but there's not really a lot of signs in the data either labor or consumer spending that demand is weakening uh right now we've got wicked cold across most of the country W in the mid East and both of those are good for oil prices so I'd expect to see demand holding steady oil prices going up and ocidental doing better what growth prospects does ox petroleum hold are there any specific factors that could lead to significant outperformance of current uh estimates well so so Thomas touched on the geopolitical risks um investors should pay close attention to what's going on in the Middle East because any escalation of the conflict there is going to be directly um it's going to hit oil prices directly and that means that they're going to go up um I also noticed that uh ox CEO uh she was speaking at the World Monetary Forum in uh the world economic Forum excuse me in Davos and she was saying that starting in 2025 as long as things continue at their current Trend there's going to be a supply shortage for oil starting in 2025 that's going to last for the foreseeable future because oil companies simply have not um invested enough money in new places to drill and there's just going to be a demand that's going to that's going to far exceed the ability of the oil companies to supply that for me what I see is ocidental is ramping production outperforming its own targets so I would expect that to continue um if there's any revenue or earnings weakness that's going to be price related uh right now I think Chris are me and Chris are pretty much an alignment that there's a floor in oil near where we are now and that the Outlook is for it to go higher so I would that if that were to be the case that ocidental will significantly outperform this year and the support of the analyst which who may drive the stock higher okay let's quickly talk about the price action of the stock what are the key resistant levels that we need to watch out for in the near future well the stock is definitely range bound right now but the floor looks pretty solid at the 56 level that's where it's trading now it's bounced pretty solidly from there a few times over the last two years um with it at this price I would definitely expect to see Buffett buying some more soon so look for news over the next few days um I think the top of the range is near $65 right now I think that it could be tested again by mid year um if the economy survives the winter without recession and the fomc cuts rates I think that oxy could be at Fresh highs by the end of the year oil prices too all right well as always we're going to keep a close watch on this stock uh with Warren Buffett's backing health cash flow and the potential growth prospects oxie is in the spotlight for all of the right reasons thank you for joining us today at Mark B stay tuned for more insights in our future videos thanks [Music] guys,1.0,0.9

I don't think we're done buying Nvidia AMD Intel Amazon the Microsoft of the world. when you start to say I'm buying Nidia because of AI like AI is a section of their technology that they using a drive business to sell actual chips they also still sell gaming chips computer chips servers like they make chips for cars and so like we can't look at like am I late investing in AI we have to look at it as what companies also layer in Ai and do it the best that have the potential to take their revenue where it's at to even further because of this new explosive technology so I think we have to make that distinction.,0.8,0.4

MarketBeat,yogPn05INbs,2024-01-12T14:53:13Z,Amprius Technologies Stock Amps the Market,Amprius Technologies,"a groundbreaking player reshaping the tech sector with its revolutionary battery Innovations ITS ous Technologies stay tuned as we unravel the secrets behind their recent surge let's get started today we're talking about aprus Technologies an Innovative player in the tech startup realm they're revolutionizing the landscape of energy storage solutions so let's Jump Right In um we're going to discuss how they are amping up the market um Thomas you recently wrote an article for marab on this very topic so I know you're prepared to share with us um but we saw a recent surge in the stock price and they're taking Innovative strides uh strides in this Tech sector so fill us in and help us understand here what are they all about um and what are the driving forces here yeah so ampus Technologies is a battery company they're making standard lithium ion batteries but it has a game-changing formula they use a silicone anode design which is industry-leading and provides multiple advantages including energy density discharge rates charge rates and costs it also reduces Reliance on graphite which has a problem with degradation so just as a point of note how do they Stack Up aprus powered cars took the top four spots at an important race in Australia last year the Bridgestone World Challenge that's a 3,000 mile transcontinental Race Across Australia across some of the most challenging Terrain in the world and Aus took the top four spots that says a lot the winners reported about 30% better capacity per pound which means they got a longer range with less weight allowing them to add other items they might need in this scenario they could have increased their battery size gotten even more power and outperformed at an even greater rate so I think that the uh the opportunity here was tremendous all right and Thomas you also reported in your article about the grand opening and free remont California um so that opening allows uh for production to be expanded by 10 times so that's significant um and because that we saw shares surge up more than 40% after after that event um I mean as much as 60% the week after Christmas so what else is significant to highlight about this particular event uh for the company well it's a it's a real vote of confidence proof of concept um it allows the company to meet its existing demand and add new customers it's Al an important Milestone on the path to the gigawatt capacity and showing their their ability to scale so it's just uh really um amplifi the Market's confidence in this company's ability to continue going forward okay so their Advanced lithium ion EV battery more battery density uh means a larger capacity and less space longer battery life and faster charging right uh so are there any other benefits that I'm missing here uh do you know how far ahead the company is does this give the company a wide Mo Beyond 2025 well so the the silicone anode removes the need for graphite and batteries graphite is required to stabilize the system allowing for Reliable charging and discharge graphite anodes have a tendency to break down by a chemical reaction and by mechanical processes they degrade and can cause system failures silicone anodes are much more durable and provide a much longer lifespan and uh greater system um reliability so I think that ultimately um ous technology batteries or technology similar to them will overtake the entire battery industry um you also mentioned in your article that virtually all of the company's business is dedicated to air transportation um in the company's investor presentation it cites market and markets research that then sites uh there will be a 67 billion addressable market for Ev batteries by 2025 uh how much of that might amprius uh be able to get well so you know they have other business besides Aerospace but their top customers are major aerospace companies including Airbus and tadine Fleer um and they've also listed several Premier Aviation companies as new clients including including um an evil company which could be Archer Aviation or Joby Aviation um either one of those companies could become commercially viable within the next year or so driving increased demand but as far as the addressable Market goes it's like I said before uh this is game-changing technology for batteries so even if amprius doesn't command the market its technology or similar technology will overtake this Market in time um Thomas I did a little bit of pre-recording research um and I took a look at some of the company data on Market Beach so two things jump out to me here uh first Institution ownership is really low um but it's grown massively in 2023 um and second thing is that short interest is also really low uh particularly for a small cap stock like amus um so what should that say to retail investors who may want to take a position in this stock well i''s say the short interest isn't all that low it's about 5% it's not astronomical but this is down from the prior month short covering may have played a part in the in the rally last week the short interest fell in December and could easily have fallen again following the um the grand opening of their facility in Fremont um add in the Santa Claus rally and I think that's why we had such a such a big such a big rally all right what else should investors know here what are the analysts saying and what is the chart looking like right so I think this is a pretty good-looking chart you have a clear Head and Shoulders bottom right here and then a giant volume driven Spike breaking above the neckline prices have pulled back a little bit but we're already showing support at that neckline which to me confirms the chance of a reversal as far as the analysts go the analyst's lowest price Target is way up here at $10 so it looks like this stock could double within the next couple of months well it seems aprus technology is poised for an electrifying future with its Battery tech um as Thomas shared with us today the recent milestones and Technology breakthroughs position this company for significant growth uh thank you everyone for watching us today thank you Thomas for sharing your insights with us stay tuned for more updates and Analysis right here at Market B we'll talk soon",1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,Q6TTbwTNeUs,2024-01-11T14:24:34Z,Upgraded Mid-Cap Stocks to Keep on Your Radar,MarketBeat,so that's why you used our Market beats uh most upgraded stocks tool to find these three midcap stocks that we're going to be talking about today. I got a lot of the information for my article from an article that Thomas wrote about a month ago on gitlab and so when I saw that gitlab was part of uh the list of most upgraded stocks on Market be I was like okay yeah I'm going to grab on to that because it's a it's a trend that investors can see when when a company is consistently on that list from month to month it shows that again analysts are very um supportive of that stock. NOW one thing that Lacy you brought up at the beginning of this you you said my list was a very interesting list of companies well you know I couldn't come up with this list of companies by myself and that's one of the reasons why the market beat tool is really great is because you can just click on it and you can screen in this case I just screened for midcap companies because I was interested in midcap companies and these were the names that popped up and you can sort it really quickly so usually the list comes in I think alphabetically but in this case I sorted it because I wanted to see which ones were getting the most upgrades because I really wasn't interested in companies that were maybe getting one or two analyst upgrades I wanted to see the ones that were getting the really big analyst upgrades and I think in this case I think gitlab had like nine upgrades in the last 90 days that's huge so upgrade is meaningless but a trend of upgrades will drive a stock higher exactly and so and that's what I wanted to do and that's what the market beat tool makes it really easy to do and then from there it's just you kind of start there and that's where you do your due diligence of saying okay you know which of these companies interests me which one do I think you know is is a is a worthwhile investment. yeah let's actually take a quick preview here of that tool um I know you guys are in that frequently so Thomas will you pull that up for us show our viewers um kind of how you use that tool within your research just real quick quick navigation to it we've got a bunch of tools on the website and I think it's right here you can get the fresh ratings for the US and down here you've get the most upgraded stocks which is what Chris is talking about and I love this list because you can find a stock that's most upgraded down in the 10th or 12th spot and if you see it start moving up the ranks that's one that you really want to pay attention to but you can see right here we got Micon at the top they've recently appeared crowd strike has been on the list for a long time Lulu has gained some positions over the last quarter or two zscaler Salesforce workday snowflake have been regular uh regular appearances on the list all year and it is highly adjustable you can adjust it by ranking by share price by the number of upgrades it's really a great tool.,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,Q6TTbwTNeUs,2024-01-11T14:24:34Z,Upgraded Mid-Cap Stocks to Keep on Your Radar,CyberArk Software,um and those that you found are cyber Arc software gitlab and Wing Stop so kind of an interesting combo here if I do say so myself but um these are the ones that are showing in a significant number of uh analyst upgrades in the last 90 days here so I'm excited to cover these uh let's just jump right in um starting with cyber Arc software it's a company that's specializing um in identity Security Solutions here so um kind of to talk more about that cyber Arc has seen an impressive 39% surge in stock value over the last 90 days um and the consensus price is targeting slightly lower than the current price um but what is driving the enthusi uh enthusiasm among uh analysts and kind of talk to us about what should investors consider adid the stock uh recent stock fluctu fluctuations can't talk today. sure Lacy first of all thanks for having me on that article was fun to write to especially when you're kicking off the new year um so the big story with cyber Arch here is it's one company among many that are in the Cyber sec security area and I think all of us can relate to the fact that cyber security is a growing issue it's been a big issue for the last several years and it's only going to continue to grow um I know for myself personally I just got a notification in the mail this week from a uh company that I serviced my mortgage like 15 years ago that said they were subject to a data breach they were letting me know and you know so that I should there were some steps that I could take from there end to say this is the that might have been compromised you might want to check this sort of stuff so we all know it we've all been we're all part of it we're all living in it um cyber Arc uh in particular works in the area of identity protection and that gets into the area of zero trust uh this is the idea of saying that as more and more uh employees are working in a remote and hybrid situation it subjects a company to more risk because their servers are being accessed from outside of the um the company's campus if you will and zero trust is the type of technology and the type of software that prevents these employees from getting into the servers without verifying their identity it just helps prevent Bad actors from coming in. yeah right Chris is hit the nail on the head cyber security is more important than ever you just have to think about the rise of AI the growth of the cloud the shift to digitization which is driving the entire Tech sector that just equals more need for cyber security and zero trust really is um like the future of cyber security all the big players are kind of Shifting in that direction because like Chris said you know the old old methods of security you kind of had this perimeter around your business anybody inside the perimeter is deemed safe but more and more opportunities arise for Bad actors to get inside your perimeter and just start accessing whatever data they want so that zero trust kind of protects the remote workers as well as infiltration from within the system that's really really a good thing for sure. all right so yeah like as you guys mentioned we know that demand for cyber security isn't going to diminish um so what is cyber Arc doing particularly to maintain that demand um and position it for growth in 2024. yeah it's not something that cyberark is doing that's necessarily special but one of the things that they have as a company that relies on software as or service SAS saas as part of their business model is that comes with annual recurring Revenue a a is the acronym and cyberark is growing that ARR and that's something that investors love because that type of Revenue comes with really good margins which means better earnings growth which is why uh investors are willing to pay the premium for the stock that they're paying for it. yeah that ARR also provides a highly visible Revenue stream it's not a question if they're going to make money it's yes they're going to make this money every year yep recurring and that curring amount of Revenue is growing yep. out of these three midcaps cyber Arc gitlab and Wing Stop which one are you leaning towards it's gitlab for me uh for all the reasons that we talked about there's a couple of names in the cyber security area I like a little bit better than cyberark but it's not a bad name.,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,Q6TTbwTNeUs,2024-01-11T14:24:34Z,Upgraded Mid-Cap Stocks to Keep on Your Radar,GitLab,um and those that you found are cyber Arc software gitlab and Wing Stop so kind of an interesting combo here if I do say so myself but um these are the ones that are showing in a significant number of uh analyst upgrades in the last 90 days here so I'm excited to cover these uh let's just jump right in. all right well next on our radar here is a gitlab it's a pivotal player in software development for both devops and AI integration um there was a notable 34% uptake in at stock value and recent analyst upgrades um so how does gitlab fit into this growing landscape of web 3.0 and artificial intelligence and uh what might be the implications for its future earnings record. well gitlab really is that the Nexus of 3.0 it's where the developers go to create the apps and the advances and technology that are driving the technological shifts today um the iot and artificial intelligence uh the advantages that it brings are numerous because it's got a secure platform but perhaps the biggest thing is that it is a cloud-based platform so it's perfect for remote workers and collaboration of teams that could be located in different parts of the world um as far as earnings go I think it's going to smack mash the next earnings report analysts are raising their targets but the consensus is still pretty tepid compared to the trends um they expect growth to slow and I think growth is going to accelerate also the margin should remain solid if not improved due to revenue leverage the company has already turned profitable ahead of schedule and that's only going to get better as uh Ai and the internet advances. Chris is there anything that you want to add here um about your take on gitlab and maybe the opportunity here for so there's really not much that I have to add to what Thomas said in fact I got a lot of the information for my article from an article that Thomas wrote about a month ago on gitlab and so when I saw that gitlab was part of uh the list of most upgraded stocks on Market be I was like okay yeah I'm going to grab on to that because it's a it's a trend that investors can see when when a company is consistently on that list from month to month it shows that again analysts are very um supportive of that stock. NOW one thing that Lacy you brought up at the beginning of this you you said my list was a very interesting list of companies well you know I couldn't come up with this list of companies by myself and that's one of the reasons why the market beat tool is really great is because you can just click on it and you can screen in this case I just screened for midcap companies because I was interested in midcap companies and these were the names that popped up and you can sort it really quickly so usually the list comes in I think alphabetically but in this case I sorted it because I wanted to see which ones were getting the most upgrades because I really wasn't interested in companies that were maybe getting one or two analyst upgrades I wanted to see the ones that were getting the really big analyst upgrades and I think in this case I think gitlab had like nine upgrades in the last 90 days that's huge so upgrade is meaningless but a trend of upgrades will drive a stock higher exactly and so and that's what I wanted to do and that's what the market beat tool makes it really easy to do and then from there it's just you kind of start there and that's where you do your due diligence of saying okay you know which of these companies interests me which one do I think you know is is a is a worthwhile investment. out of these three midcaps cyber Arc gitlab and Wing Stop which one are you leaning towards it's gitlab for me uh for all the reasons that we talked about there's a couple of names in the cyber security area I like a little bit better than cyberark but it's not a bad name and Wing Stop uh is a is a watch for me not a buy and that's just due to the possibility for a correction I'd rather wait to see the price come down a little bit. yeah I'm into gitlab too I'm all in on gitlab I think that uh it's a pretty unique play it doesn't really have com competitors or competition it's got a very deep moat with its Dev secc Ops platform um there are other cyber security plays there are other great restaurant plays uh but like I said git lab has got a deep mode and it's got a great Outlook.,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,Q6TTbwTNeUs,2024-01-11T14:24:34Z,Upgraded Mid-Cap Stocks to Keep on Your Radar,Wingstop,um and those that you found are cyber Arc software gitlab and Wing Stop so kind of an interesting combo here if I do say so myself but um these are the ones that are showing in a significant number of uh analyst upgrades in the last 90 days here so I'm excited to cover these uh let's just jump right in. all right let's get back into this let's take a look at Wing Stop um it's a unique Contender with intriguing analyst attention uh despite its hold rating so analysts seem kind of divided on the stocks trajectory here they're offering different price targets um so how might Wing Stops upcoming earnings report affect its stock movement and maybe what are the key factors that investors need to consider with the recent price Corrections. right so I think that the next report will be good Wingstop is a solid Growth Company it's well-run and has a growing fan base I think it will out perform consensus and provide solid guidance but I also don't think that it will matter to the stock price the strength is well priced into the market this is one of the most crowded trades of 2023 it's highly valued well above Chipotle which is the premium stock in the restaurant space and it trades 15% above the analyst consensus I think this stock is about to correct to a more solid support level and it it could be a significant correction with maybe several quarters before the rebound begins. all right so maybe there's a growing fan base uh and you say that it's a solid Growth Company but are they really in a good financial position I mean the research that I've looked into uh shows that their debt is not well covered by operating cash flow so should investors be concerned. I I don't think so and the only reason I say that is because the operating income itself um continues to grow so as long as that number continues to grow and the debt is does doesn't grow then that should be manageable the current ratio for the stock is like 1.97 so that doesn't indicate any immediate problem with the company in terms of servicing its debt if I were to be concerned about anything with Wing Stop it would be the overall valuation um it's trading at like a 100 times earnings which is just a lot for any stock and for a you know for a a retail stock such as this um that's a big number but uh analysts like it for a reason and I think one of the reasons they like it is because as Thomas said they're expecting the company to have another great earnings report and with that earnings report uh the comps are going to be getting tougher from 2023 to 2024 but last year Wingstop beat revenue and earnings every single quarter on a year-over-year basis and as long as they continue to do that they're going to justify that premium having said that I agree with Thomas the stock looks ripe for a for a correction and that's something investors need to be concerned about. yeah my point is just that the uh great company and the market overran fundamentals so it'll take some time for them to catch up with that valuation maybe the value comes down to reality maybe reality advances to the to the stock price somewhere in there is is truth and there could be some volatility in the stock price until the two things match up right just because people are overpaying for the fundamentals doesn't mean the fundamentals are bad per se but it does mean that they're just paying a significant premium for the stock. out of these three midcaps cyber Arc gitlab and Wing Stop which one are you leaning towards it's gitlab for me uh for all the reasons that we talked about there's a couple of names in the cyber security area I like a little bit better than cyberark but it's not a bad name and Wing Stop uh is a is a watch for me not a buy and that's just due to the possibility for a correction I'd rather wait to see the price come down a little bit.,1.0,-0.4

MarketBeat,m5sG9HGGMKw,2024-01-09T13:49:24Z,Top 5 Most Active Penny Stocks,Bitfarms,we are covering bit Farms ter wolf uh tillay Fisker and canoe. let's start with the Bitcoin chatter here uh bit farms and te wolf are two on this list. well bit Farms is the larger of the two by far it's got more than double the expected Revenue in 2023 and 2024 it also has more leverage so it can invest more heavily in growth um that's why it trades at a higher valuation uh the the market cap is roughly double as well depending on the day and time that you look um as far as growth and stability goes bit Farms is the more stable but both are small caps with established businesses. well the price action has been hot since the Bitcoin rally started uh bit for bit Farms especially is hot with it breaking out of a range and entering what could be a new rally. There are some bullish factors in play for Bitcoin including the having the havening in April that's when the available Supply or the amount that's paid to miners is reduced by half uh this stock could double again after that um Tera wolf is lagging right now it's not viewed quite as well by the market but it's still in a solid position to follow bit Farm higher.,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,m5sG9HGGMKw,2024-01-09T13:49:24Z,Top 5 Most Active Penny Stocks,TeraWulf,we are covering bit Farms ter wolf uh tillay Fisker and canoe. let's start with the Bitcoin chatter here uh bit farms and te wolf are two on this list. This stock could double again after that um Tera wolf is lagging right now it's not viewed quite as well by the market but it's still in a solid position to follow bit Farm higher its last reported short interest was about 25% which provides ample fuel for a short covering rally should Some solid news or another Catalyst emerge I think this stock could double or triple or even quadruple in prices over the next couple of quarters in that scenario.,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,m5sG9HGGMKw,2024-01-09T13:49:24Z,Top 5 Most Active Penny Stocks,Tilray,we are covering bit Farms ter wolf uh tillay Fisker and canoe. let's move along to till Ray uh it is the third most active penny stock but for differ reasons right. I see this stock in a sustained downtrend the recent uptick in the price action is weak and aligns with the bearish Outlook it's really just a natural upswing in the market following the last selloff. right so the way I see it tillay broke through critical support at a historic low last year and has experienced volatility since so right now the market is normalizing in alignment with the downtrend the upswing is still well below the prior low which is now our critical resistance point the market May pop if the Q2 results are better than expected but it will take a seriously good Catalyst for it to an uptrend um that could be Federal legalization that could be profitability but I don't see either of those things happening within the next three to five years. of these I think till Ray has the greatest risk um it may not reverse course significantly even with Federal legalization.,1.0,-0.8
MarketBeat,m5sG9HGGMKw,2024-01-09T13:49:24Z,Top 5 Most Active Penny Stocks,Fisker,we are covering bit Farms ter wolf uh tillay Fisker and canoe. okay so then there's the EV oems U Fisker and canoe that Penny Traders are betting big on. yeah well the answer your question Lacy the reason that you might want to get interested is because these beaten down names are surviving and they're turning Corners um canoe and fiser specifically um at the current price levels the market is pricing in failure and we're far from failure I mean it's still definitely a risk but we're far from failing in both these cases. contrast here so how is Fisker addressing challenges specifically enhancing delivery capabilities well so like Chris said making making cars is one thing but delivering them is something else fisker's issue last fall was getting vehicles to pay in customers it had orders it had the sales but it had a hard time getting the deliveries so now it's ramping production and working to make deliveries more efficient the December delivery point delivery report was fantastic up up 300% from the prior quarter which points to a solid year in 2024 the stock jumped on the news volatility is still high uh but I think earnings are due out soon and that should provide a pretty solid Catalyst I think that they're going to surprise to the upside. of the ones on this list um you know I'd probably think about Fisker or canoe uh as much as I said things that might have sounded harsh about the EV industry it's not going away it's just like I said some of these companies aren't going to aren't going to make it through to the Finish Line I'm not sure if Fisker and canoe are going to make it you know you're but we'll see and that's that's the whole that's the whole point of investing.,1.0,0.3
MarketBeat,m5sG9HGGMKw,2024-01-09T13:49:24Z,Top 5 Most Active Penny Stocks,Canoo,we are covering bit Farms ter wolf uh tillay Fisker and canoe. okay so then there's the EV oems U Fisker and canoe that Penny Traders are betting big on. yeah well the answer your question Lacy the reason that you might want to get interested is because these beaten down names are surviving and they're turning Corners um canoe and fiser specifically um at the current price levels the market is pricing in failure and we're far from failure I mean it's still definitely a risk but we're far from failing in both these cases. talk to us a little bit more about canu here can you uh kind of elaborate on the uh a little bit on their recent developments for the company all right so last fall canu entered its Revenue generating phase that's excellent news it's still going to post losses but this means that cash flow will be able to sustain operations for longer with less help other recent developments include the onset of produ uction in the first sales along with at least one significant order for over 500 Vehicles now 500 Vehicles isn't a lot but it's a big score because of who bought it we're talking about La based Prime Time Shuttle which uh is an airport shuttle service in Los Angeles and just imagine the amount of traffic that they're going to see and the people that are going to go through those BS of those trucks and the amount of advertising for the company I think that's a big deal. of the ones on this list um you know I'd probably think about Fisker or canoe uh as much as I said things that might have sounded harsh about the EV industry it's not going away it's just like I said some of these companies aren't going to aren't going to make it through to the Finish Line I'm not sure if Fisker and canoe are going to make it you know you're but we'll see and that's that's the whole that's the whole point of investing.,1.0,0.4
MarketBeat,9OFRC3cmVyI,2024-01-02T14:15:39Z,3 Fitness Stocks Ready to Rally,Nike,we're looking at Nike Lululemon and Sketchers today so let's start with Nike the stock saw a 27% rally in the last three months but Shares are still up only 4.3% for the year so do you guys foresee anything changing with that The real story with Nike here is just the valuation um it trades around 32 times earnings and that makes it sort of a premium stock You would you would say in the past Nikes had no problem commanding that premium uh it seems like this year uh investors have been asking Nike to prove that a little bit more even though their earnings reports have been very good um so I think it's a little bit like apple in that regard um the good news is that analysts do believe that Nike is going to be one of the best performing um you know apparel stocks in 2024 and you know I think that's being reflected in what you've seen in the price movement in the last few months yeah right Nike has been able to sustain growth where other shoe makers and apparel stocks haven't been able to so for me this is a story of operational excellence it includes the shift to direct to Consumer um consumer strength is certainly um sustaining growth and that DTC channel is helping to improve margin and sustain that growth um it's also about cash flow the balance sheet and the dividend um there's also the China growth angle there's a lot going on for Nike um and I think that premium is there for a reason uh like Chris said uh the market kind of wants to see proof and the pudding but uh the premiums there for a reason I think Nike is going to look live up to it in 2024. let's bring Nike back into the conversation quickly because the next company that we're going to talk about is Sketchers and in contrast to Nike Sketchers is outpacing the market in uh 2023. my son might still talk about Nike and stuff and Air Jordans and different things like that but um by and large Sketchers has become the cool cas brand. exactly the analysts have been lifting their price Targets in sentiment all year help by the fact that Sketchers is actually out growing Nike they're growing faster than Nike. all right Chris start Nike at lemon or Sketchers. I'm going to go with Sketchers because over the past few years it's had some some gain gamechanging developments um it's on track for solid growth and share gains but it also trades out of value compared to Nike and Lulu.,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,9OFRC3cmVyI,2024-01-02T14:15:39Z,3 Fitness Stocks Ready to Rally,Lululemon,we're looking at Nike Lululemon and Sketchers today. all right great insights there so then there's Lululemon it's a shining star among retail stocks um for many years now and it continues to open brick and mortar stores I think the store count is somewhere around 686 last time I checked um but that also accounts for the 14 stores that were opened in the most recent quarter Alone um so not only are physical locations serving them well right now they of course are attracting customers with their e-commerce presence um so what are the key things to note about this company that might support investor confidence here. well I think you actually just just really nailed it l see that's that's really it I mean Lululemon is sort of um I'm not going to say it's the opposite of Nike but it's a Sim it's similar to Nike this is a valuation story Lulu is trading at around 41 42 times earnings at least that's it was the last time I checked and they're having absolutely no problem getting investors paying that premium for all the reasons you just said um they continue to build stores new locations but they've also got a really strong um online presence as well their products command premium prices which means premium margins and right now consumers are having little issue paying that um they just even announced A1 billion doll share buyback program in the last quarter you know if there's one thing you could quibble at maybe a little bit is you could say the free cash flows down in 2023 as opposed to 2022 but that's nothing that I think investors need to be concerned about this the company doesn't have a cash flow problem. yeah uh to Me Lulu was a lot like like Nike and also like apple you know because it's a lifestyle product it commands a loyal following people that like Lulu are going to stick with Lulu other people that are into that kind of chic Fitness apparel lifestyle will move into Lulu speaking to your comment about store growth just the other day my wife was surprised to see that we have a Lulu near our house and I'm like you shouldn't be because builtmore Village is a premium shopping destination you can tell that by the other names that are in that location such as Williams Sonoma so Lulu was focusing on that premium destination shopping but also on direct to Consumer I think with like with Nike with Lulu the premium the valuation is there for a reason the company is growing it's providing solid cash flow the buyback is evidence of the cash flow uh moving forward I think Lulu is a gross story that is switching to a cash flow and capital return story and those two things should help sustain the stock price and stock price increases over the next couple of years. you know they really are a growth story I I just think about you know they have these brick and mortar stores but I even see like the yoga studio that I attend they have a small little like Nook that's a boutique for Lulu so they have all these ambassadors which isn't counted in that store count so like they really are just you know spreading their name out there even uh giving those discounts to nurses and teachers that kind of thing this it really is a whole universe of that so you could call it a penetration story more than a growth Story the market is there it's just how they get their product out to all these people that really want to have it all. all right Chris start Nike at lemon or Sketchers. well my daughters wish that I bought them clothes from here but I would say and that actually would be cheaper than buying them a share of the stock but I would say Lululemon uh and for a lot of the reasons that we talked about this is a company that commands premium prices but they get that and the margins are great um I just there's not a lot not to like about this it's a Lifestyle brand it's going to continue to grow it's worth the premium price now and it's going to command that premium price in the future. I'm going to go with Sketchers because over the past few years it's had some some gain gamechanging developments um it's on track for solid growth and share gains but it also trades out of value compared to Nike and Lulu.,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,9OFRC3cmVyI,2024-01-02T14:15:39Z,3 Fitness Stocks Ready to Rally,Skechers,we're looking at Nike Lululemon and Sketchers today. all right let's bring Nike back into the conversation quickly because the next company that we're going to talk about is Sketchers and in contrast to Nike Sketchers is outpacing the market in uh 2023 so the stock is up 48% here however there's potential expectations of a pullback in the near future so so I want to know how is this stock um how have they managed to stand out in the market despite that. yeah this there's a good marketing story here I mean in the last few years Sketchers has really become the the cool kid I would say and I and I bring that up because of my kids because my kids actually would probably talk more about uh Sketchers as opposed to maybe a Nike now my son might still talk about Nike and stuff and Air Jordans and different things like that but um by and large Sketchers has become the cool cas brand. and we're making a comeback from the Sketcher shape ups is what you're telling me because that that wasn't the cool kid brand exactly exactly and that's is coming kind of to me like alongside of Vance as being like it's not just a trendy fashion product anymore but it's more of a mainstream fashion product right right and and the stocks had a great year it's up about 48% you're right Lacy it's up so much it may pull back a little bit that wouldn't be you know that would be unusual here and right now that presents investors with an opportunity if you haven't been in the stock that pullback may present an opportunity for you to get in on it. so are there any upcoming factors here that might drive the stock performance higher in 2024 the most immediate one for me is the company reports earnings in January and if the numbers come in as they're expected to I would expect analysts to start upgrading the stock and with those upgrades will come you know stock price growth. yeah exactly the analysts have been lifting their price Targets in sentiment all year help by the fact that Sketchers is actually out growing Nike they're growing faster than Nike another solid report should reinvigorate the Bulls um some key developments this year include the widening margin and inventory Corrections that have it in lean operational condition and set up for leverage profits later in the year. all right Chris start Nike at lemon or Sketchers. Thomas what about you right so I view these companies kind of on par with each other as far as brand and growth but I'm going to go with Sketchers because over the past few years it's had some some gain gamechanging developments um it's on track for solid growth and share gains but it also trades out of value compared to Nike and Lulu so in the the world where like these premium companies command premium pricing I think Sketchers could see a price multiple expansion on top of its growth which could help really boost returns.,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,W7BHwWsxZIw,2023-12-27T13:30:14Z,Apple Stock - Best Days Ahead or Behind It?,Apple,are Apple's best days behind or ahead it's a question that is splitting opinions across the market and we're here to talk about it let's dive in today we're talking about one of the most debated stocks in the market that's of course Apple whether Apple's best days are ahead of them or behind is a question on many investors Minds today so let's dive into this debate to start what exactly is the temperature with all of this and kind of what are the primary reasons behind the contrasting views on Apple well Lacy I I wouldn't necessarily say there's a lot of contrasting views on Apple um most almost any analyst is going to tell you that Apple's a very well-run company this isn't something that anybody's worried about you know the company not being a viable investment for years to come but like you said the debate comes in when people start saying is the company's best days behind it or ahead of it um I think we've gotten spoiled with apple because ever since what around 2000 or so we've had you know it was the iPod and then it was the iPhone and then it was the iPad and then it was the earbuds and then it's the Apple watch and people are wondering well what's that next thing and they don't see it you know Apple hasn't come out with it yet they've kind of teased it but nothing come out of it people are looking for growth Apple has to deliver on it and at over 30 times forward earnings they're going to have to you know some investors want to see that before they're going to pay the premium for the stock yeah I think Chris is exactly right here um I don't think this is contrasting views because most investors view it as a most own Mo must owned stock excuse me yeah now it's amongst the most heavily traded and owned it's owned by funds and institutions but there is that debate to its value it does command that pre premium value for being the premium Tech growth stock I mean it's double the broad Market average and it isn't growing this year as bad as growth this year is the broad Market is still growing apple is Contracting the outlook for next year is better but still lags the broad Market consensus apple is awesome the question is how awesome is it and is it worth 30 times earnings yeah all right so let's dive into specifics just a little bit more here so Apple Services we're talking about everything from Apple TV the App Store Apple music iCloud there's many other subscription Services uh so sometimes it's easy to forget that there's more to Apple than just their iPhones um and we've talked about this a little bit before on another apple video on this channel but one product leads to another it's an Ecco system um but how significant is a Services Unit for Apple's revenue and why does Dan I believe that it's undervalued well services will be the growth driver for the long term services are currently less than 25 5% of the business and other tech companies are doing you see it all over the tech space previous software companies previous product companies are shifting more into Services because there's only so many iPhones and iPads that you can sell so penetrating with Services is the way to go those Services could include expanding the TV offerings including a bid for ESPN which Mr IES has called out as a Christ a Christmas wish yeah I mean like we've been saying apple apple is an ecosystem all its own um it's not uncommon that when you see people that own an iPhone they also own other Apple accessories whether that's the watch whether that's the iPad what whatever that may be um and all of those come with services that you can pay a monthly fee Fe to Apple or um one of those big ones is Apple TV and I think Thomas just brought it up um apple is made no no uh that there's there's no discussion that apple is trying to uh clearly get into the streaming um sector they're trying to get into the streaming Sports sector and whether you like sports or not streaming live sports is a huge growth Market in the streaming sector Apple wants in it they just missed out on getting the NFL Sunday Ticket contract in for this year 2023 um they've got the capital to get into the market and I believe that they will make some sort of Splash here in some form or fashion okay you had mentioned the Apple watch and so I just want to throw this in here really quickly so I'm sure you guys have seen the news um around their newest watch and the issues with you know someone else's patent here is this um something that needs to be concerning for investors or is it just something that's gonna kind of fly under the wheel they'll figure it out what are your thoughts on that um my my initial thought I've I've read some of the things about it my initial thought is I think that this probably is going to be not much of anything um as long as Apple doesn't make it more than what it is uh to me it's more of a it's more of a marketing issue than a legal issue at this point as long as it stays in that realm I don't think it's a big issue all right so moving along one of the most compelling arguments from Apple Bears is that the company's re Revenue uh continues to be lower year-over-year um admid concerns about declining Hardware software how is Dan Ives uh kind of countering that argument against Apple's future iPhone sales um especially maybe in the markets like China yeah well he's simply uh he's simply saying the data that some of the or should say the data that some analysts have is incorrect he's his his channel counters over in China are saying demand for the iPhone has not declined they're going to come in with good numbers in China uh he's saying holiday sales for the iPhone are going to be fine so really it's just a question of you know how much weight you put on somebody like Dan IV who's saying according to the data he is seeing demand for the iPhone is as strong as ever right Thomas talk to us a little bit here um Apple stock is facing resistant levels so share with us how might recent controversies and markettrends impact the short-term trajectory all right so this chart looks a little topheavy to me I'm not saying that Apple won't keep rallying or that it won't rebound from a correction and set new highs only that it's at a critical resistance point and set up to fall if when and how deep that correction is depends on economic conditions and the fomc as much as their results um regardless history says that if Apple Falls you should buy it because you'll be making money within the next six to 12 months all right and for the investors that are eyeing this stock what's the Strategic approach here uh what are the key factors that they should be weigh when they're considering it as a long-term investment well you need to understand that this is an ecosystem the products link um once you get new one new customer you're bound to penetrate with more devices so it's a lifestyle play as much as a Tech play uh there's also the AI Edge consumer AI um but strictly from the investment standpoint Apple has got solid cash flow a healthy balance sheet tons and tons of cash plenty of liquidity dividend and share repurchases it's really a total package uh the big question now was what will their next move be yeah so a little fact that that I heard that has stuck in my brain probably because I fit this profile is that 25% of the iPhone base has not upgraded their phone in four years so at some point even the most practical person you just have to upgrade your phone and so that's going to be a nice that's going to be a nice lift for iPhone sales here in the future one thing I think that investors should pay attention to especially if you don't already have a position in apple apple tends to get really funky around earnings and it's not uncommon for Apple to have really good earnings and have the stock fall uh so Apple reports I think February 1st something to watch for but you know again I agree with Thomas fundamentally this is a good long-term investment for you there could be some choppiness here in the short term um but the road ahead might have a few short-term hurdles but overall potential is keeping investors interested as we've seen,1.0,0.65

MarketBeat,aGeqRGfoiBU,2023-12-22T13:30:00Z,Top Retail Stock Upgrades to Watch,Costco,Thomas why don't we start with Costco it's the number one here it's the most upgraded retail stock and of course it's a market leader so so we've talked about this company on our channel before but what is it exactly that positions them well here Costco has a few things going for it I mean it offers value to Consumers with the bulk business but the membership club aspect provides a moat you know consumers aren't guaranteed to go back to Costco because they have a membership but it certainly tilts the playing field in their favor there's a good chance they will you know so this helps them to sustain growth compared to other businesses Target certainly losing out to Costco it's losing out in dailies in health and in grocery so I think that Costco is just well positioned for all those reasons yeah you know when I look at Costco one of the things that stands out to me is that every quarter this year they've beat on revenue and earnings and it might not have been big beats but still they beat and this is in tough comps to 2022 Lacy I know you and I talked about Costco earlier this year and at that time I was thinking that Costco was going to do a increase in their membership price in 2023 because historically that's what they've done they're they're on the historical path actually they're they're past the time that they normally do it but the CFO said in the last earnings call that a membership fee increase was coming sooner rather than later and if we look at history we say maybe that increase is going to be about $5 and if they if every subscriber that's currently on the basic plan re-ups for that $5 increase and I would bet that many of them will that's about a billion dollars that goes right to Costco's bottom line that's it's just a you're paying a premium for Costco stock but those are just a couple of reasons why the premium price is worth it Thomas this is the most upgraded stock retail stock so tell us a little bit more about that well yeah so it is the most upgrad crea retail stock and it's probably going to head higher but there are some headwinds and one of those headwinds really might be this expectation for the membership fee increase it's like a carrot leading the market higher we know it's going to come sooner or later the company's kind of waiting till like there's some bad news that needs to be offset they'll say oh we had a bad quarter bam membership fees are coming next quarter right kind of offset that thing um as far as the analysts go the analysts are leading the market higher but the stock is kind of outpacing their sentiment it's trading at a pretty high valuation relative to their range I think that this could keep the market maybe from advancing much higher but there's a caveat like we were just talking before we started shooting Costco reports earnings later today after we're done shooting so there's going to be new news before the video comes out that could certainly alter the situation but right now what I'm kind of expecting is for Costco to report kind of in line to give kind of decent guidance but not really provide any news that would invigorate bullish activity without um um the membership price increase and when the price increase comes it could be a sell the news event yeah Costco does that Costco does that neat thing where like every time the first of the month they they put out their sales numbers in advance of the earnings report so yeah if we start seeing interest rates come down I think I would go with Costco for the win the most upgrade retail stocks for 2024 Costco Domino's Wing Stop and William Sonoma,0.95,0.7
MarketBeat,aGeqRGfoiBU,2023-12-22T13:30:00Z,Top Retail Stock Upgrades to Watch,Target,we've seen names like Target even uh struggle to gain traction here while others are outperforming with their estimates and their growing Target certainly losing out to Costco it's losing out in dailies in health and in grocery so I think that Costco is just well positioned for all those reasons,0.9,-0.8
MarketBeat,aGeqRGfoiBU,2023-12-22T13:30:00Z,Top Retail Stock Upgrades to Watch,Domino's,all right let's move along to Domino's here I saw that they recently uh held an investor Day event um that caused the analyst to perk up of course so Market beat picked up 10 revisions from this and one of the main things I kind of want to touch on um was the potential for international expansion we're hearing talk of four times the US footprint that is huge um so what factors are driving Domino's growth expectation so it's it's the guidance for now and it's the growth outlook for later so they've guided us to the top end of the range for now they're also leaning into their International growth expectations they're kind of ramping up that that expectation so they haven't really increased their growth Outlook but they accelerated it and that's got the analyst taking note with the analysts raising their targets and leading the consensus price higher I think that dpz shares will break out of their range soon it's been in a consolidation range waiting to reverse so I think that that will happen pretty soon in that situation I think we got 35% upside maybe 50% upside yeah there there's a technology story here with Domino that to me is very similar to what you see from McDonald's um these are two companies that have been well into digital technology and AI since before 2020 Domino's has been using it for pricing they've been doing it for deliveries you know scheduling deliveries and such so they're they're big into it they're going to continue to lean into it according to their CEO I know they had the partnership with Uber they announced last year that doesn't I mean that doesn't do much for me personally but the market seemed to like it when it came across um you know the bottom line for me is that investors have to start looking at companies like Domino's and say it's not just a pizza chain right and I want to point out um dpz dominoes is possibly underrated for that in in that regard as far as it's leaning to digital I mean look at Chipotle Mexican Grill that company is banging it and it's all with digital I mean the company is good but it's the digital channels that are really driving the growth and upping the expectations for future growth and I think that could also happen with dominoes if they stay higher for longer and I'm not say when I say that I'm not saying the fed's going to raise anymore but I'm just saying if they keep the interest rates where they are high higher for longer my choice would be dominoes um they're still projecting you know low to mid single digigit earnings growth which is probably going to be low to mid single digit stock price growth and I get the dividend along with that keeps me ahead of inflation I'll take that the most upgrade retail stocks for 2024 Costco Domino's Wing Stop and William Sonoma,0.95,0.8
MarketBeat,aGeqRGfoiBU,2023-12-22T13:30:00Z,Top Retail Stock Upgrades to Watch,Wing Stop,all right then there's Wing Stop um they've been doing very well but the stock has been in uptrend all year it's likely to continue um but the stock price is kind of currently High compared to earnings um so fill us in on this one why is this one on the list right so Wing Stop is certainly performing well it's growing at a nice high double digit digit rate but I think of the stocks on this list it's the most worrying for investors now it's in a clear uptrend it has support from the analy but it has front run the analyst sentiment it's trading well above the high end of their range it's certainly set up for a correction I think that when it's due um it's trading at a higher valuation than Chipotle Mexican Grill and Wingstop and chipotle are not in the same the same boat they're completely different companies different markets um so yeah I think that there's a a significant chance of Correction in this stock yeah so prior to uh well it was last yesterday when the FED made their announcement the Russell 2000 has been doing pretty terribly this year and Wingstop actually was doing very well it's was easily one of the best Russell 2000 stocks it was up like 76% this year something insane like that so it's not surprising to me that you had a lot of investors who might be interested in stocks that are in the the that small to small cap range that the Russell 2000 covers they would be jumping onto a stock like wingstock stop and following it higher because you're getting growth somewhere that being said this is to me is an example of two things that can be true at the same time number one is I think Wing Stop is going to head higher number two is I think that it's due for a little bit of a pullback and for investors especially if you know for younger investors or should say newer investors um that's perfectly normal that's something that happens and you know that doesn't mean that the stock is bad it just means that the Stock's probably as Thomas said it's probably little overheated right now and it's due for a pullback um this is one of those times when you can follow that Warren Buffett axium to maybe get a little bit fearful when others are getting greedy nothing wrong maybe with taking a little bit of your position down take some profit give yourself a pat on the back and wait for better price and if you don't have a position in Wing Stop yet as Thomas and I are both saying it's probably going to pull back a little bit this is a time put on your watch list have a price Target in mind and get ready to pull the trigger when it hits that price Target the most upgrade retail stocks for 2024 Costco Domino's Wing Stop and William Sonoma,0.95,-0.3
MarketBeat,aGeqRGfoiBU,2023-12-22T13:30:00Z,Top Retail Stock Upgrades to Watch,William Sonoma,all right time to talk about the retailer that analysts love to hate you guys know which one I'm talking about I know you do um William somoma so this is one of the harder hit retailers here but despite their revenue decline in 2023 they have showcased strength in their margins cash flow and long-term growth targets uh so Chris what specific factors uh have contributed to the areas of strength and how sustainable is this yeah so um Thomas I know I know Tom this is one of Thomas's favorite I I like so when I look at William sow I see they have the right product mix um they also um they also have the benefit of having this direct consumer model now they they have brick-and morar stores don't get me wrong but they've made a successful shift over this Omni Channel Market um like I said so they're going direct to Consumer and that's working out for them very very well they also uh Target a more affluent consumer who has been less impacted by inflation even though now I'm seeing anecdotal evidence that even some of those uh some of the higher income earners in some of the luxury sectors you're seeing some effect of inflation happening but they've got uh because of the type of items that they sell they've got good pre or protection not pressure protection on their margins nevertheless you know I think I think a pullback here is probably a little bit likely but then again we saw the retail Sal sales numbers come out so I don't know what Thomas you like William Sonoma what are your thoughts here right I I do like William Sonoma I bought it pretty early after the crisis that shall not be named began um but I recently sold out my position I mean it's got good management it's got a great growth trajectory solid capital capital returns it's got an enduring business but even with the upgrades I think the upside is limited this stock is also trading well above the analyst high price high price Target and below a significant resistance point I just see it having a hard time moving any higher from here with a substantial chance of a correction because even with all of these upgrades it's had sufficient upgrades to be on our Mo most upgraded stock list but this is very relative it's still rated at reduce so their sentiment is lifting but it's not lifting to the point that people are going to start buying it right now they're just going to start selling it less interest rate cut should reinvigorate um consumer spending again and lead the company back into growth it's got solid you know cash flow and capital returns and and that's kind ofu the kind of stuff that I'm interested in the most upgrade retail stocks for 2024 Costco Domino's Wing Stop and William Sonoma,0.95,-0.4

MarketBeat,WbQjssfMbzM,2023-12-20T13:30:13Z,Is Rocket Lab Stock Worthy of Penny Stock Status?,Rocket Lab,"With a 71% decline in the last two years, Rocket Lab raises the question: are they worthy of penny stock status or is this a buying opportunity for investors? The stock went public in 2020 via a SPAC and jumped over 60% in its first year, but it's been a tough road since then. Rocket Lab is not profitable yet but is generating revenue, reporting a 9% year-over-year increase, generating $68 billion in its most recent quarter. A realistic path to profitability seems to be the case. They've launched 40 Electron small-scale launch vehicles. Their Neutron program, a reusable unibody rocket, is a critical component of the company's path to profitability, with expectations of significant revenue increases once Neutron launches. They are on track for profitability, though a recent launch explosion cast a shadow of doubt, and they might pivot to their first profitable quarter late next year. The Electron rocket is disposable, while Neutron is reusable. Rocket Lab might be the best choice for investors seeking a rocket company, as SpaceX is not publicly traded. Rocket Lab is planning 22 Electron launches in 2024 and appears to be conceding large payload launches to SpaceX, focusing on Electron and Neutron for mid-tier payloads and satellite launches. Its market capitalization technically makes it a midcap stock, but many still call it a small cap, and a shift to official midcap status could reduce volatility. Rocket Lab's potential demands a patient investment approach. They are already launching rockets and built their infrastructure when interest rates were low, giving them an advantage over competitors. Rocket Lab is launching, generating revenue, and should be profitable, proving financially sound. A prolonged series of launches with no problems and progress on the Neutron project are key. Institutional investors own 54% of the stock, indicating strong support, and analysts also back it, making it a high probability candidate for success, though investors must be ready for volatility and the chance that some more rockets will blow up.",1.0,0.4
MarketBeat,WbQjssfMbzM,2023-12-20T13:30:13Z,Is Rocket Lab Stock Worthy of Penny Stock Status?,SpaceX,"SpaceX has been launching reusable rockets for years; last year they launched more than double what Rocket Lab is supposed to launch next year, so they're clearly ahead of the game. The problem with that is as an investor you can't buy SpaceX, so if you want to buy into a rocket ship company, Rocket Lab might be the best choice. Rocket Lab is conceding the large payload launches to SpaceX, and they're really focusing on Electron, with Neutron sort of the mid between where SpaceX starts, which is basically as high as Rocket Lab is going to go.",0.9,0.1

MarketBeat,hXmbotPYmL0,2023-12-08T13:30:30Z,Is Microsoft the NVIDIA KILLER?,Microsoft,"Microsoft's rapid rise, fueled by its Cloud dominance and proprietary chips, is shaking up Nvidia's stronghold. We'll be discussing whether Microsoft stock is a buy, sell, or hold. Is Microsoft the Nvidia killer? Microsoft has the capability to disrupt Nvidia's hold on the AI Market, and Microsoft's new chips are evidence of that. Microsoft's recent announcement features an Azure Cloud architecture coming with its first two custom chips, slated for 2024. My first thought was Microsoft is a serious threat to Nvidia if it's going to start making a mass market AI chip, but it isn't. The chips it's making now are to run its own cloud, which will use Nvidia and AMD accelerators, reducing reliance on Nvidia. This is more about Microsoft increasing its own efficiency, optimizing their own cloud so its consumers and customers can use whatever AI tools they want more efficiently, a win-win for the industry that will help Microsoft and Nvidia in the near term. Microsoft has new highs on deck, and the price action confirmed a primary uptrend, breaking out of a range it was in for about two years. The latest results, plus the results of the OpenAI Scandal and the new chips, have the market breaking out to new highs, supported by analysts. I think Microsoft will coexist long into the future with Nvidia, as their business focuses are different, though Microsoft's chips may come to the mass market but not right away. Microsoft is a tech stock, highly tradable, and a solid Buy and Hold stock with ample upside, a great target to buy on the dips. Thank you for exploring the potential implications of Microsoft's advancements with us.",1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,hXmbotPYmL0,2023-12-08T13:30:30Z,Is Microsoft the NVIDIA KILLER?,NVIDIA,"Microsoft's rapid rise is shaking up Nvidia's stronghold. Is Microsoft the Nvidia killer? Nvidia has held a long, dominant position in AI, driving innovation in chips, infrastructure, and services. Recent developments suggest a shifting landscape with potential challenges, and Microsoft has the capability to disrupt Nvidia's hold on the AI Market. How significant is the risk of Nvidia losing market share to competitors like Microsoft? Losing market share would be a big deal for Nvidia; a single percentage point of revenue for them is worth over a billion dollars. Nvidia is clearly the winner, in an absolute new league compared to last year. It will be a while for other companies to catch up, but eventually other chip companies will come to the market with good AI chips. It's just a matter of time before Nvidia loses that share. Regarding Microsoft's new chips, the title 'Microsoft is a serious threat to Nvidia' was a knee-jerk reaction. Microsoft's chips are for its own cloud and will continue to use Nvidia and AMD accelerators, reducing reliance on Nvidia. This is a win-win for the industry that will help Microsoft and Nvidia in the near term. The rivalry between Nvidia and Microsoft: Tech is evolving rapidly. Nvidia is the most obvious and easiest to see, but there is competition. I think Nvidia will continue to dominate the chip space and be the AI leader for the foreseeable future. I think that it and Microsoft will coexist long into the future because ultimately their business focuses are different. In the end, the internet, the cloud, and AI are collaborative efforts built on efforts by all these different companies.",1.0,0.3

MarketBeat,z0vxwGrYnAM,2023-12-07T19:12:47Z,The Lure of GameStop Stock Still Powerful,GameStop,GameStop had a mixed quarter with better than expected margins and cash flows but shares fell 5% anyway any good detail here is offset by signs of struggle and we're here to talk about it let's get started all right guys let's get right into it GameStop what was the earnings report like tell me about the good the bad the ugly ok well I'll start here thanks for having us Lacy so the good news for GameStop um I guess you'd have to say earnings um they keep showing Improvement on earnings Thomas and I were chatting a little bit this morning I guess it depends on how you want to read the earnings report they either broke even or they were down a penny either way they were up year-over-year which is progress um the bad news would be Revenue uh they had a Miss on Revenue the Miss would have been worse uh if they didn't have um increased sales in the UK uh because Australia United States Canada all those were down signic iFly um and then the ugly would be that analysts are saying despite the fact that they've done the cost cutting measures that they've done they probably still have twice as many stores open as they need to have yeah right I think Chris hit the nail on the head here the report had a few Easter eggs in it but ultimately the story is still the same try as they might GameStop can't grow and it's slowly eating itself to death it carries a lot of dead weight and it's got little hope for a meaningful recovery anytime soon sales are down in all segments consumer is weak uh the holiday quarter is going to be pretty horrible um I don't see a lot of news to rally on in the report all right so just based on what you guys said there and also um based on our past conversations about this I know that neither of you are big fans of GameStop um so what is it specifically why is it anything about the company or the stock that um that you guys have those feelings towards this you know for me it's um for me really it comes down to the company um I just don't see where the growth is coming from there's nothing that I see from the company that I would say oh I have to go to a GameStop store for or I have to get that online or that Gamers would need to do that with I just I don't see anything like that I mean I guess you could say uh the Vintage The Collector side of the business but that's a very small niche market and it doesn't really seem to be contributing much to revenue and you would think that if they hadn't something like that that the company would at least do an earnings call which they haven't done in several quarters so they're not doing if they do have something that's really a unique proposition for their company they're doing the best job in the world of keeping it secret right to me it's the business model is kind of nonproductive ultimately what we have here is a publicly traded flea market for old stuff you know it's it's just not a a viable market for for growth you know you relying on people that want to buy these old things it's already a small Market um I think that a lot of pent up Demand right now when it becomes unleash will probably be more interested in new products than old products yeah right um you know so the whole shift with the core business they shift it into the Collectibles and nfts and those kinds of Avenues looking for growth and they're not growing at all they're costing the company money um you know Cohen's doing a great job controlling cost but there's no growth as long as revenue is pressured and declining uh the deleveraging is going to offset whatever kind of cost controls they can have um they did increase their cash this past quarter but at the cost of inventory uh the inventory decline did not equal the or was actually more than the amount of cash that they increased so that's kind of kind of a sign of just that comment before slowly eating itself to death you know they can persist indefinitely really the way that it looks but I think it's just going to be a slow burn until it company goes out of business all right well I saw that uh GameStops board of directors approved a policy and that policy permits the company to um invest in equity Securities among other Investments is this bullish for the stock I mean I don't think it is really unless GameStop is planning to become an equity holding company which I don't believe is going to happen I mean I think what this really is is a move that helps free up Mr Cohen so that he can start investing in things that he wants to do outside of this company uh the catch is that GameStop I think is going to have to do the same Investments as he does on his own um so that's my take on it I don't see it really as as a mover so much as um a nod by the board to Mr Cohen to help free up his personal life yeah I I saw something where um analysts from wed Bush are saying that they're calling the move alarming because it implies that GameStop is uh GameStop has to believe that they can achieve better Returns on Equity from other company stock than their own I mean that's just right that that's really that's what I thought of when I saw it yesterday I was like that's what you're saying I mean well totally it's like it's it's a GameStop they sell games and consoles and stuff yeah but now they're going to try to invest in equities they tried to capitalize on um cryptocurrency and that failed utterly you know so are they going to start investing in in in equities because then you should just start investing in like Venture Capital firms or mutual fund or something I guess I don't know yeah all right well we know that we're going to be hearing from Gamestop investors um they're GNA say that the fundamentals it don't it doesn't matter um they're going to keep holding the stock no matter what but um maybe we'll even get some of those comments down below but is this a viable strategy yeah I think it's a Fool's play if you say that fundamentals don't matter and the cash position is why you're buying the stock what you're ultimately hoping for is that the stock is going to get liquidated and you'll you'll get some gains off of that I mean this it's that's not a good not a good strategy right now this stock is in a definite downtrend there is some dip buying going on right now but that downtrend is still in heavy effect I would expect any upswing in the price action to draw more bears into the picture and just increase the already heavy short interest this is the this is the hardest part about analyzing GameStop because it's kind of like you've got these two things going on it's like a Marvel movie you've got on the one hand this this this this mild mannered company I used a reference to the office this morning that I said dud Mifflin but I'll say it's the Blockbuster video of video game companies um it's just it it's a dying business model and then on the other hand you've got GameStop which is this this meme stock that's going to slay all these hedge funds it's an odd Hill for Traders to be looking to die on but at the same time as Thomas said they've got cash and as long as they have cash this can go on this little cat and mouse game that's going on can go on indefinitely as these Traders are hoping for the next short squeeze which is really the only play that I see that they have yeah I think Blockbuster is a good analogy I mean if you look at rise of tech today we're in the AI Evolution the cloud Evolution um so more and more gaming is going to become PC based over the cloud you're going to need less consoles there'll be less cartridges there'll be less need for the used console cartridge Market I mean I think that it's just a matter of time before GameStop has nothing to sell all right well Thomas they're sitting on cash so does that cash matter or are they kind of burning through that position so I think that me and Chris have kind of commented on this a few times so far but in my opinion the cash is why this horse won't die we can beat it to death but it's not going to die until the cash position makes the Bulls think that there's no more hope right now they're hoping that there's enough cash just the same business do a turnaround to the next rebound but it's really just gonna you know sustain the business as it is because there's really not going to be a rebound in the future that we can see it's just there's lot of visible Catalyst for growth here all right as we discussed today GameStops

MarketBeat,lTapJl7oacs,2023-12-06T13:30:18Z,"Dollar Tree Stock Plunge, What It Says About the Economy",Dollar Tree,could Dollar Tree's performance be a telling sign of an impending recession today we're going to uncover the potential implications of Dollar Tree's trajectory for the broader economy let's dive in Chris today we're talking about Dollar Tree and in your recent article for marabe you had tied in a famous quote about General Motors um as goes GM so goes the nation and today investors who are looking at which direction the nation or at least the nationally economy is moving may want to look at Dollar Tree so let's jump right into that tell us about Dollar Tree's performance here and how does this reflect on the current economic landscape yeah so one reason I wanted to look at Dollar Tree this week was to see if their results tracked with the results that we've been seeing from other retailers this earning season Unfortunately they did Dollar Trees clearly indicating um not only in their report but in their earnings present ation that lower to Middle income consumers which make up their predominant um consumer customer base are feeling a lot of stress what Dollar Tree's report shows us is that the effects of higher interest rates are working their way through the economy and I believe that it means that the FED is done hiking interest rates I think we're done with that I don't think that means we're going to have a pause or I mean a cut I mean but I think it does mean that we're going to be keeping interest rates where at least where they are all right so despite kind of being a bearish narrative here um are there any bright spots that could potentially make Dollar Tree attractive for investors so there's a couple of Silver Linings um and I would encourage investors if you're if you're looking at Dollar Tree to look at the presentation that they issued when they released the earnings report you can find in the investor relations section of their website um they did show that they're gaining market share over the competition this may sound a little strange um maybe call it the best house in a bad neighborhood I sometimes overuse that analogy but I think it's Works in this case what they're finding is that in areas where they're competing with other retailers they're gaining more traffic they're gaining more share of that customer's wallet um that may not be a lot of com Fort to shareholders now but that may be something to watch in the future another area that um was positive for Dollar Tree was fuel costs uh as we all know um the price of oil is down and therefore the price of gas that we put in our cars and that has to go into trucks is down so Dollar Tree is noticing that that's having a positive effect on the cost that it takes to get the goods to their store so that was a positive if you want to look at it that way okay and let's talk about um you had shared a chart with me from Dollar Tree's earning presentation um and it says a lot it really does so let's take a look at that quickly um we see that traffic is up from 2022 but spending is of course down overall um talk more to that if you would okay so this reminds me kind of of one of those charts that you had when you were in school and they said you know this is your homework assignment you had to look at this and answer a bunch of homework questions about it but I think really it shows investors that it really doesn't have to be that complicated the leftand part of this chart shows 2022 numbers and the 20 the right side of the chart shows how it compares to 2023 numbers we can see that traffic is up in 2023 but the total ticket amount which basically means the bottom line the bottom line number that you see on your receipt when you check out that's lower so customers are they're getting more floor traffic into the store but they're seeing customers buying less overall and then you look at what are they buying these are another two items that you'll see on this what they call consumables that's your Consumer Staples items and you can see that consumer staples are taking a higher percentage of the customers's uh purchases than what they label as discretionary items okay so then there's theft which kind of seems to be a recurring theme here Chris and Dollar Tree is of course no exception there unfortunately um and it's been one of the largest drags on their margins here um but is the company employing any strategies to maintain profitability here or is all hope lost yeah I I brought up retail theft particularly My article because it was impossible to look at Dollar Tree's presentation and ignore it uh when you looked at what was affecting their margins which by the way are up a little bit that that should be said in fairness it was hard not to notice that retail theft was one of the biggest drags on those profit margins so retail theft isn't a um it doesn't come without a cost to these companies now Lacy I mean we you and I can look at it very practically if we decided to donate 50% of the groceries that we purchased every month and we donated that to charity well we have two choices we can either not eat or we have to replenish what we've lost and that comes at a cost to us especially when our income isn't going up we just have to replace it and so that comes out of our savings or out of our profit or we have to go into debt to replenish what we've lost it's really no different for stores to do it and insurance only goes so far and you know some cons commercial insurance policies will or won't cover retail theft but they'll you know it it gets it gets wonky in there so that's a cost for them and even if you don't even if you have the insurance it's still going to cost them in terms of the transportation cost to get that inventory to the store so this isn't something that this is a real problem the stores that sometimes gets glossed over by people saying well the store just has insurance for it there's two ways that Dollar Tree can get around this and other stores can get around it one is they simply close their stores earlier and I know I've seen that in my area you just see some stores that just close earlier now as I see the problem with Dollar Tree that when you close the store earlier that's going to affect those low to Middle inome consumers the most because they're the ones that make maybe working second jobs they may have a more of a need to have stores open on their schedule and when Dollar Tree is close to them that means it's a customer that's potentially lost to them and the other option is that they could hire security um the problem there is that when you hire the security that's going to eat into your profits because again you have to pay for that somehow so you're paying for that out of your your profits and that's going to mean lower earnings which means a lower share price all right well Chris I also just want to mention love when you share these analogies maybe it seems silly to some um but for investors that might be new to this I mean the stock market can get kind of confusing so we appreciate you kind of making those connections for us um but wrap it us wrap it up for us here uh how might investors consider approaching Dollar Tree stock given these current circumstances um and the future predictions here okay so um I'll try to keep this a little shorter than I've made some of my other points but here's the point if you looked at Dollar Tree if you look at the stock chart for Dollar Tree it looks like the stock formed a bottom around October and if you bought it into the stock at that time you've made a pretty nice profit on it Dollar Tree doesn't pay a dividend I don't know how high the stock has to go higher uh truest recently came out with a they reiterated their buy rating on the stock they gave it about a $129 price Target that seems about right to me but that doesn't give the stock a whole lot of upside so without a dividend it's hard for me to say it's a good stock for you to hold one strategy if you if you are a current Dollar Tree um shareholder maybe you bought that dip in October you've gotten a nice gain we're at a great time of year where you might want to just take a little bit of that profit and to offset some of the stocks that you've lost on and you can do some tax loss harvesting that way if you still believe in the over all story of Dollar Tree just wait 30 days and buy it back and you you can get it you can help you with your tax situation and you can and you can benefit from getting that profit from buying this stock back in October all right well thank you everyone for joining us on this insightful discussion on Dollar Tree

MarketBeat,9BAyp_wC640,2023-11-24T13:30:04Z,"Fisker Stock Results, Delivery Struggles, and SHARE PRICE IMPLOSION",Fisker Inc.,with fisker's Q3 results presenting a mixed bag investors are wondering about the company's future. today we're talking about Fisker which is already technically a penny stock it's trading beneath $5 doll it's on track to become more than a technicality. Thomas fiskers Q3 results continue a trend by other EV oems. Fisker is experiencing demand and should have delivered more cars. Fisker had a problem with delivery and that problem's already getting fixed so I would expect to see some pretty decent strength in the next report. Revenue missed the consensus estimates. Revenue was about 45% below consensus with a much worse than expected loss again those numbers are due to delivery issues and are not a fundamental issue with the business. this Q3 report also included an update for Q4 that shows October deliveries are already above the entire Q the entire Q2 delivery which means that Q3 is going to see a substantial ramp in revenue and a much smaller loss than in Q in Q2 Q3. inventory is up significantly compared to last year production and deliveries are ramping cash flow is of course expected to improve and operating losses are going to narrow. the downside is called a material weakness in Accounting Standards this is a reason I'm sure of why the CAO left the company so suddenly last month and it's why the company delayed its filings. those words mean that they were insufficient action taken to ensure accurate reporting and that means that the results and even its Financial condition could be a lot different than what the market thinks right now. we have improvements on the way but right now we're waiting for the company to get past this hurdle so we know where the where the Baseline is. share prices are continuing to Trend lower I mean we saw the stock fall 20% following the Q3 release it might just continue to fall. Fisker Shares are in a definite downtrend and hitting new lows. the short interest is very high it was 45% at the last report it's probably higher now there's also some delusion to consider the company bolstered its balance sheet but but it did that with convertible debt that is more likely to be converted than not. so for now I think this stock will stay in a downtrend that could change soon. this stock hasn't bottomed yet it may not for a while it really could seriously become a true penny stock with the price in the pennies. the big Catalyst right now is going to be the 10q filing we really want to see how how much materially different from the reality we know now the actual reality is so that's going to be the big news over the next couple of weeks. early part of the year the stock kind of put in a bottom looked fairly firm started seeing some downtrending here when they began talking about issuing more debt hit another new low just before the earnings release and there was even a small bottoming action right here but since the release there's been a gap lower and even new lows so I think that this stock is just going to continue to wallow at these levels or even move lower it really just depends on how that 10q news comes out. as we discussed fisker's current market scenario.,1.0,-0.8

MarketBeat,gEfXH9sON8c,2023-11-22T13:38:45Z,Home Depot Oversold or Further to Fall?,Home Depot,despite a stronger than expected Q3 underlying weaknesses persist for Home Depot and we're here to unpack what this means for you and your Investments let's get started if a rising tide lifts All Ships then a falling one can syn them and the falling tide is what Home Depot and other retailers are facing so Home Depot had a fine quarter as far as business goes it produce reasonably stable revenue and sufficient earnings um but revenue is down compared to last year so fill us in about these results um tell us how do these results compare to expectations and key factors that are influencing performance here yeah Home Depot and other retailers are in this weird situation where they're expected to contract this year and that's got them in downtrends or trapped in ranges but on the sequential basis as far as Q3 one especially uh they've been outperforming so that's been been producing some some near-term Pops in the price action but at the same time they're also lowering their guidance so reducing the guidance is really an unstable foundation for the rally you had this near-term pop on the strength that puts the stock higher but then the guidance undermines that strength and sets the stock up for a fall and that's what I see Happening Here with Home Depot I mean the stock could continue to go higher but I just don't see it exing its trading range anytime soon and there's a real risk of it retesting the bottom of the range before uh this movement's over with all right so with that Home Depot CEO Ted Decker had made a comment about consumer behavior um he said that people are noticeably shifting from large ticket discretionary items to smaller projects um so how might this impact Home Depot and the broader retail sector in in the coming year Chris yeah Bo I mean if I had the answer to that i' I'd be making a lot more money um you got this is the real conundrum that's facing investors so you've got evidence that consumers are slowing down and or shifting their spending habits that was kind of anecdotal over the summer but this latest round of earnings reports are confirming that there's a Slowdown there so on the other hand consumers are still spending and the big if and it's a ginormous if is if inflation is truly regressing to the mean meaning the rate of inflation we're not in disinflation yet but the rate of growing inflation is actually moving down towards the fed's preferred 2% Target then it's possible that that consumer spending can increase you know we saw we saw just in last CPI in the PPI reports they came in cooler than expected largely due to lower oil prices which meant more gas prices lower gas prices when consumers feel that they've got they're spending less of the pump they may be inclined to spend more in other areas what does this mean getting back to Home Depot and other retailers well right now retailers are fighting for every dollar that they can fight for and those dollars are harder to come by so I think the stores that are going to tend to do better are going to be the ones that go direct to Consumer as opposed to the big boxes but Home Depot has an advantage in the sense that even before 2020 they were engaged in this Omni Channel initiatives things like you know buy online pick up at store and other things home delivery so Home Depot kind of had an edge there Lowe's is catching up a little bit but Home Depot still had the edge there and that may serve it well as consumers are looking to spend but may not be looking to go to the store and spend all right well let's touch on Home Depot's Capital returns here how have they manage um despite challenges in the market are there any key indicators maybe that we need to note um of its Financial strength and stability that investors um again need to take note of I mean I guess what I'm asking is are there ways in which Home Depot's current situation in financial indicators impact its ability to deliver to share uh to shareholders all right so this is why Home Depot was a Buy and Hold stock and an excellent Buy on the dip Target candidate it's businesses sound I mean it contracted a a little bit but it's still doing well it's making plenty of money it's also gaining some leverage for when the consumer economy rebounds speaking to what Chris was saying before there are certainly ships in the consumer and we see that in Home Depot's reports less Big Ticket more small tickets we see that in Walmart and Target less discretionary more everyday items um but what this means for Home Depot is that their Capital return program is sound and solid dividends and BuyBacks are reliably safe dividend growth should continue I wouldn't expect to see a a slow down in share rep purchases and something I thought about earlier today writing a different article is with people expecting the FED to start um cutting rates next year there's an opportunity for this company and others to begin repositioning debt reducing uh their debt load their debt requirements freeing up more cash flow and accelerating Capital returns so Home Depot for me is definitely a Buy and Hold candidate for income dividend investors okay big question I mean this is for for those types of investors I mean it's like God love blue chip stock because that's Thomas is right on I mean you're investing in a stock Like Home Depot you're looking at the total return the dividend yod is around 2.7% and that's kind of ho hum for some investors but you have to look at that in the context of the bigger picture now this year the stocks flattish to slightly down I think at least it was when I L last checked but over the past five years Home Depot's been seeing like a 16% Average stock price growth so if you've been holding on to the stock you're fine even if you haven't been reinvesting your dividends you you've made you've made a nice gain on Home Depot over the last five years sorry to interrupt you there Chris um but moving along so to the big question here uh is Home Depot moving higher from here or what's the situation yeah so like the chart looks good right now this could turn out to be a solid trend following signal but I don't think so simply because of the way guidance is unfolding that undermines the forward Outlook so even with the post-release pop in the price action the market is still below critical resistance points it's within a trading range it's got a long way to go to hit the top I think this Market will continue to be range bound and may put in a lower high with this current pop today's action is showing a nice little inside day which is an indicator of of a market Peak um um so I think that we'll see some more range bound trading potential for another pullback and I think that we'll see a really really solid Trend following signal sometime in mid late 2024 or early 2025 once uh we get through this inflationary period and once we know for sure that the FED is or is not going to cut rates yeah we've been talking on this video a lot about the long-term investor and I think obviously there's a strong case here for saying if you own Home Depot you're holding on to it you're adding on every dip and doing that the tra as for Traders I mean there is there's a defined range I can see it on the screen uh some Traders like that some don't but there's a trade there I mean it's pretty defined where you where your entry point is where your exit point is so you know it just depends on how you how you want to play Home Depot really all right well thank you everyone for tuning in to explore this evolving landscape of retail and Home Depot's resilience in the market,1.0,0.3

MarketBeat,r3U7W2uHXEs,2023-11-21T18:07:24Z,Plug Power on the Brink of BANKRUPTCY?,Plug Power,"Despite positive news, Plug Power stock plummeted over 30%, signaling significant hurdles. The stock still tanked, talking more than 30% to a new low. The company issued a going concern notice, which is essentially a nice way of saying it's on the verge of bankruptcy, amplified by a statement that said they will have to raise new capital. The good news is that they seem to be on the brink of generating positive cash flow, if only they can sink in some more money into the pit they've already dug. This market may see Plug Power bought out by a larger company. Whether or not hydrogen happens with Plug as the brand is the question that needs to be answered. Plug Power plays a role in the green hydrogen market forecast and is one of the recipients of federal funds. However, the question is whether they're going to have the money to get to the finish line. The Q3 report highlights the need for cash; Plug Power is saying it's going to need additional capital and is investigating corporate debt, government loans, and new partners. They were supposed to be profitable in 2024, and any of these options kind of kicks that can down the road. There's also concern with fuel sales, as Plug Power is working to address challenges stemming from lower than expected fuel sales, despite a doubled loss. The problem with weak sales is weak infrastructure, which the company is working to improve; it needs more money to do that. Plug is certainly developing IP and assets that some other company is going to scoop in and buy. Analyst activity may decide the next move for this market; analysts are still holding, but there's been a lot of negative activity following the release, including multiple price target reductions and a few downgrades, which is going to weigh on the price action for the foreseeable future. It's a real shame because Plug Power is this close, but the federal government's not going to be able to get Plug across the finish line. I don't know exactly how Plug gets there; hopefully, they can get the funding they need in this higher interest rate environment.",1.0,-0.8
MarketBeat,7fcUKBE7whk,2023-11-20T13:30:03Z,Is it TIME TO BUY Evolv Technologies Stock?,Evolv Technologies,is it time to buy evolved Technology stock after its post earnings dip we're here to talk about it let's get started evolved Technologies delivered a strong quarterly earnings report in terms of Revenue um with a similar picture for earnings and I'm going to want you to touch on those results here Thomas um because despite the initial Spike the stock dropped over 6% um what's important to know well I think primarily the issue right now is that this is still a very small micro cap company with only about 20 million in quarterly Revenue the Outlook is good but the now is Teensy wiy there's not a lot of ownership it's got a relatively High short interest and there is some significant overhead resistance due to the wild wide decline in share prices so Outlook is good revenue's ramping profitability is ramping but the Market's working through some issues um but should come out okay assuming the company can continue continue to gain traction Chris can you tell our viewers um some more about the key achievements and Milestones that support evolves optimistic Outlook uh maybe particularly concerning the adoption of its evolve Express product um and growth in the various Market sectors here right so you know the earnings report was generally very positive um they reported over 600 new contracts for their evolve Express product in the last quarter uh the companies now uh they said they're scanning um somewhere around I think they scanned over 200 million people in the last quarter uh they've achieved the the goal of over one billion uh people scanned overall they're now the company now says they're scanning more people every day than the TSA is so you know there's there is widespread adoption going on for their product um as some people would expect hospitals are one of their big uh big areas of growth I think they saw 50% growth in the hospital sector this quarter um they've now uh they they signed on with a with with an NHL hockey team and so now they're in with all of the five major professional sports leagues they at least have one one venue or more in each of the uh the five major sports and of course unfortunately but we know schools are a major audience uh for them as well so again there's there's a lot of growth happening it's just to Thomas's point this is a small company um an Emerging Market let's just say that all right let's talk a little bit more about the emerging distributor model um how might evolved Technologies transition towards a distributor model um particularly I'm talking about the collaboration with Columbia Tech um and how is that going to impact the company's revenue streams balancing hardware sales and software as subscription Services um so with that what challenges or opportunities are going to arise during that that kind of shift we're looking at yeah that was something that came out uh during the earnings report they're actually um it's actually going much I think much smoother than the company expected um they're they're growing that business uh I think they saw like a 30% growth in that business in the quarter they're expecting that number to to get higher in the coming quarters what that's going to do and analysts were asking about this and the company was talking about it was it's going to lower the amount of annual recurring Revenue ARR that the company generates um so they're not going to get as much of that however what they said is there they do have a licensing agreement with Colombia Tech so some of the money that was being counted as annual recurring revenue is now going to be counted as licensing Revenue so that's going to be something that investors are going to have to work through in the next couple of quarters just to see okay so this number is a little lower but this is higher and how does it all shake out in terms of overall revenue and profitability all right so I've seen some news about concerns from the FTC uh re regarding involves marketing claims um specifically they're kind of investigating whether that the aib based system correctly identifies weapons as the company claims has the market reacted to this news well I think the market has reacted to the news um it's digesting it now and trying to work its way through these issues we talked about before um the news certainly plays into the Outlook but I think that it should help over the longer term unless the FTC has some evidence that their product just doesn't work what's going to come out is that it does work you know they need to tone down their their language a little bit but ultimately I think this will be um a market widening and exposure an an exposure event for them to where more people know about them Chris what do you think about this FTC investigation yeah in in a former life I worked with companies who dealt with things like this a lot I'm not going to come out here and say this is nothing uh but I think in terms of making a decision to invest in the company I think it's relatively nothing um this has to do more with marketing language not with product performance um evolve has acknowledged the fact that they probably went over the ftc's preferred line when it comes to the generalization of what their product did um so yes they'll have to tone down the language they'll have to change some of the wording but does it affect the product performance not really the larger issue that investors are going to want to pay attention to or at least I would say they want to understand is um evolv been getting some criticism because they don't come out and talk about like the rigorous testing that they do or the type of benchmarks that they try to achieve and evolve says they don't do it because they don't want to let the Bad actors know what they're doing because that would allow the bad actor time to figure out how to beat it um so some of the evolves competitors are crying foul on that um it's just a situation that has to work itself out I don't think evolve is going to change the way they do things whether or not that impacts you as an investor something for you to think about all right so investors of course wanting to see if companies can monetize AI evolve appears to be doing just that um so is it time to buy evolve after the post earnings dip or is now not the right time to get involved well I think this is a good play on technology but I would expect to see some volatility in the price action over the next few weeks or quarters uh the market is showing some signs of bottoming but I think it will be range Bound for the foreseeable future we need to see more news with the FTC but also with uh business traction and profitability um but within that range it looks like Traders might be able to target a 75% or 100% gain if you can buy at the low end it's certainly in a pretty wide range right now um my advice would be to Target uh dips uh moves to support uh but don't chase the price higher yeah we've we've been talking you know a lot in this video if you're a long-term investor um you know certainly you can get involved with the stock there's no reason to go all in there's no reason that you have to just get fomo and jump in right away this is a stock you can start out slow build your position over time understand that they're probably a couple years away from profitability According to their own records um here's something to watch for there uh the company in their last earnings report they said I think they have about 130 some million of cash they don't have any debt but there's still not profitable so they're burning through about 70 million in cash a year uh so actually that aligns kind of nicely to say that within about two years the company should be able to hit that break even Point without having to take on new debt if I were a longterm investor I might say let's wait a couple of quarters let's make sure they've been doing some really good numbers year over-year in terms of their growth but now in these next couple of quarters the comps are going to get tougher let's see what they can do there if they can continue to do that then that makes that two-year Break Even Point look better if not okay maybe you want to you want to hold off a little bit you know in terms of in terms of trading it I think I'll go back to something that Thomas said at the beginning this stock has a lot of short interest in it it's a day Traders playground and so you just have to be a little bit concerned about that because I think the movement we that the stock saw in the early part of the summer I think that was just a short squeeze and some of the you know some of the shorts had to cover their position so you know it's something to be careful about if you're looking to trade the stock,1.0,0.2

MarketBeat,_QKoguIq9NM,2023-11-16T13:30:12Z,Vertex Pharmaceuticals Stock a Buy on Any Pullback,Vertex Pharmaceuticals,today we're talking about vertex Pharmaceuticals despite a hiccup in their latest earnings report the stock is on everyone's radar having sorted over 30% this year let's talk about it fears of vertex Pharmaceuticals are down nearly 2% after the company delivered its third quarter earnings report yet the news wasn't particularly bad was it Thomas uh can you give us a quick rundown of the report yeah it really wasn't that bad at all I mean the revenue was a little a little bit shy of consensus but uh growth is present and the margin was solid um they produced an earnings beat um regarding the analyst estimates Revenue was like less than 1% short which is like a a me number to me I don't care about that um the bottom line outperformed so margin strength was absolutely present and that's due to some of their their their promising drugs um trota is one of their big sellers right now it's getting expanded use and approval which is helping to Wi the revenue stream and leverage the bottom line I think that should continue over the next couple of quarters Chris you just covered the stock in an article you wrote for markab be so I know you're ready to share all the insights with us uh so vertex stock is up over 30% in 2023 so how has the Market's expectation of perfection um kind of affected investor reactions to the slight Miss on the top line is this pullback presenting a potential buying opportunity for investors yeah I mean the point I was was trying to make in the article was the Stock's up about 30% year to date um it was priced it's it's trading at an all-time high right now it was basically one of those scenarios where the market was expecting a perfect result I agree with Thomas I don't the revenue number was whatever it was fine but it wasn't perfect and so because the report wasn't perfect the Market's going to try to bring it down a little bit I don't I I there might be a little bit of a pullback here but this this wasn't a perfect report but it was it was a fine report it doesn't change the overall thesis is what I'm saying yeah yeah right and what I oh I'm sorry Lacy just what I see on the chart talking to what Chris is saying is this stock is in a strong uptrend yeah I don't see a technical breakdown in the action uh there's really no reason to sell yet unless you need to trim some profits uh this is certainly a Deb buying opportunity okay so Thomas kind of alluded to the Pipeline and biotech uh stock investors know that holding a long position requires understanding the company's pipeline uh so how does something like vertex late stage nonopioid pain pain drug uh VX 548 um play into the company's future and what are the current concerns among investors regarding its delayed announcement of results with that so the this vx54 this could be a game Cher as far as um what we understand about managing pain and painkillers we could do a whole video uh I don't know if we're qualified to do the whole video but we could do a whole video talking about the opioid crisis uh not only in terms of the addiction but also in terms of the fact that there's a question about the eff the efficacy of opioids in certain cases this has a chance to be something that really changes the whole landscape of how we talk about pain management that's the opport for vertex now some concern is being expressed because vertex didn't really give an update on where this was at regarding the late stage clinical trial results however uh as you dig into the report and you don't have to dig that far you find out that vertex is saying there's some procedural issues coming in from the you know from the FDA these the studies haven't been unblinded yet basically it means vertex hasn't had a chance to see any of the results of the testing so therefore there's nothing that they can report on they're still expecting to see positive results but again it's a report where investors were expecting to see a home run they didn't get it so you know again they pull back a little bit okay isn't there another treatment in their pipeline that's uh might be worth investing or mentioning here um they have something in the works with Gene editing technology don't they yeah they do and um it's a part partnership that they have with crisper Therapeutics uh it's a product called Excel and it's a gene editing treatment for um that they're trying to get uh two indications for it one is for sickle cell disease and the other is for beta phemia and the the good news that came out of this earnings report is that they've gotten uh firm dates from the FDA as far as when the FDA is going to essentially let them know where they stand uh and for Cle cell it's I think it's next month and for beta phemia it's sometime in March but basically the idea is that the company is probably going to get the go-ahead with crisper to start um to start making this product commercially available there's some questions as far as how long is that going to take to be a creative to the bottom line but I think the bigger story is that this is like Gene editing technology that's like actually happening like soon and that's that's been something that investors have been waiting on for a long time in this space okay so the burning question here is vertex a buying opportunity uh it seems to me like the answer might be yes but maybe not in this very moment um what are your guys's thoughts yeah Lacy that's a pretty astute uh Viewpoint you know vertex is definitely a buyable stock but you're going to want to watch the price action and be wary of these upcoming potential catalysts there's probably going to be some volatility uh the stock might range sideways for another month or two or a couple of quarters until some of this news comes out but I think ultimately assuming they get positive uh approvals uh the stock should continue trending higher that's that's my opinion yeah and I I I alluded to that in my article Lacy I'm not sure it's a buying opportunity right now but you know you're either going to be looking for a pullback which you know it could happen if any of these things are delayed for any reason there could be a pullback otherwise you're also going to want to watch what the analysts have to say in the next couple of weeks if the analyst ratings go up higher then that certainly gives the stock a lot more room to go from where it is right now great well I think that wraps up our discussion today on vertex Pharmaceuticals performance and their potential,1.0,0.6

MarketBeat,iiLZmt7k5co,2023-11-15T13:30:25Z,"Palantir Technologies Stock, AI Evolution and Investment Outlook",Palantir Technologies,this video we're talking about paler Technologies a company that's making waves in the tech sector due to its innovative approach to AI software we're here to break down the latest developments and what they mean for paler future and your Investments let's get started paler Technologies recently released its Q3 earnings report causing a positive jump in the stock let us know how did the market react to volunteers financial performance yeah I thought it was a solid report we were already expecting to see strength in government spending just because of his position in the market and results from checkpoint that came out the week before so that was really no surprise the big surprise was the strengthen the commercial end of the business specifically in the US that is underpinning the growth I think us growth was above 30% which is pretty huge uh that commercial business is a huge boat of confidence for the platform it's Data Tracking systems and threat prevention tools um that all led to the top and bottom line strength ultimately this is about wider margins and an increased to guidance that has the market reassessing where the stock is going okay so the third quarter here was the first full period that its artificial intelligence platform was available to its customers um and this is a key factor to keep our eyes on isn't it guys um we're talking about potentially massive gains here aren't we yeah so we're talking about when when you're mentioning that you're talking about AIP which is their generative AI platform that they just launched I think it was in 20202 now it's interesting to me because it's not just about the fact that paler launching this platform or has launched this platform it's how they're doing it one way they're doing it is they're uh introducing these um uh AI boot camps and they're allowing perspective customers keep in mind the word prospective that means these aren't people that are actually customers right now to actually test out the software kind of get into it play around with it and identify their own use cases that are applicable to their businesses and I think it's a clever model because once a company can kind of get into the the software platform like that start to customize it for their business they're going to be really locked in and keep in mind that this is just one platform that paler has that they're being very forward about in terms of the generative AI capabilities Palante has been using AI in all of their platforms like Gotham and Foundry since you know since the company was since the company began right that's what that's what it is it's an AI an AI company right yep yeah and I think AI is proving to to Aid internal efficiency and operational quality for the business and for the clients so this is really a dual story a dual Tailwind that should boost business and widen margin at the same time so I think that uh it may take a little bit of time for the market to fully understand what's what's going on yeah all right so something else I'm curious about here that I want to spend a little bit time on um is so a substantial portion of palente Revenue comes from government contracts um and we did see in the third quarter that palente government revenue totaled 308 million which is up 12% year-over-year um but it was below analyst consensus prediction of 321 million so is this shortfall concerning to investors at all you see me smirking a little bit l so the thing is I've been following Palante here fairly closely since it went public um by a direct listing excuse me so paler is one of those stocks I look at as a yah but stock because that's really what the analysts have been saying about paler ever since it went public I mean it went public and it had a heavy Reliance on government contracts analysts were like yeah but it doesn't have commercial contracts so now it's building up its commercial uh the commercial side of its business and now you have analysts saying well yeah but now the government side isn't growing as fast well growth is still growth I mean 12% growth is still fairly strong um and I don't so no I don't see that as being an issue for the stock at all right I agree with Chris that's not a problem for me government spending is expected to accelerate globally over the next year or two especially in technology and AI because these people have got to stay ahead of the it curve there's no way they can fall behind or else the Bad actors are just going to take over the world and that's not going to happen Okay so I think it might be helpful if we quickly touch on the broader Trends in the tech sector uh related to generative AI so with that how does paler position itself compared to other companies that are benefiting from similar increases well I mean like Chris was saying they've got a really great approach to getting business into their into their house so you come and play with my toys now you got to buy it right the analyst chatter is very promising they're seeing a CH a chance for paner to gain market share with automated workflows and security and threat threat prevention Data Tracking all those things in a single platform um I think that we're going to see paner Commercial Business continue to expand and potentially accelerate speaking about specific analyst Dan IES of wed Bush who was just a really big Tech analyst he's always got something to say he called paner the lional Messi of AI which means that paner is not only the best player but it's the team captain if you want to know what's going on follow them to the win yeah I mean that's that goes back to what I was saying with like I said AIP the platform not only how they're rolling it out but how they're rolling it out is also key because that's how paler is going to get ahead of companies like Microsoft and alphabet on the commercial side of the business they already have a leg up in the on the government end of it but that allowing the customers to access the software play with it make it their own is is a is a really interesting way a way that they can get ahead of Microsoft and alphabet in that regard and de generative AI space okay so considering the excitement across the tech sector for generative AI is paler buy so Thomas brought up Dan IES and Dan IES has a price Target on paler of $25 and from what I've been seeing I was just checking this morning I don't see any price targets that are higher than that uh so if you look at Palante here it's trading around $819 this morning that would put it in a buy range um you could certainly you could certainly look for a pullback uh the consensus of analysts on Market beat would suggest that paler stock is is overbought right now uh but if I'm looking at the chart and and Thomas you can agree or maybe you have a different opinion but as I look at the chart if you're waiting for paler to get back down into the single digits again I think that's not a good bet so you're going to have to decide where you want to plant your flag but to me I see the stock as going higher and the $25 price Target that Dan I's you know projected again keep in mind that's an analyst Target for 12 to 18 months where it's going to be in 5 to 10 years is yet to be determined yeah right um I think the chart looks pretty strong and uh I don't think there's going to be a big dip uh the post relase action was very robust I think the stock gained like 20% didn't um but now we're trading right up at the recent highs right below resistance so technically speaking I'd be a buyer on a pullback I'd be a dip buyer I'd also be a buyer on an advance if the stock crosses that key resistance line you're going to see more Traders Pile in the stock will gain momentum so uh yeah it's buyable but I would wait for one of those two events all right well we took a look at paler journey through earnings government contracts and the potential Game Changer generative AI um thank you Chris and Thomas big thank you to you for your valuable insights

MarketBeat,xn1z8PxaEWs,2023-11-14T13:30:21Z,Occidental Petroleum Stock: Another Bounce from the Buy Zone,Occidental Petroleum,today we're diving into the recent Buzz surrounding oxidal petroleum and whether Warren Buffett's involvement has ignited a new spark let's get started welcome back let's get this discussion on oxal petroleum started Thomas the earnings driven bounds in Oxy shars raises the question of Warren Buffett's involvement with this uh can you share with us what might be driving this bounce even if Buffett's role is uncertain uh that's pretty easy the company is producing large amounts of cash and using it to improve the company's value for shareholders they're paying the dividend they're buying back shares and more importantly they're redeeming preferred shares they're buying back debt that plays into the buffet story I mean the stock uh stock bounced up a little bit after earnings and I think it pulled back a little bit and it's all about crude prices right now um oxy stocks pulled back uh but that's just because of concerns about demand uh and a recession it was just it was it was a it was a bad day for oxy to have a good report all right let's dive into the Q3 results more specifically here oxy's release aligns with other major oil players in that the revenue fell more than 20% on the deleveraging of oil prices so what's important for investors to note here so what's important to note is that despite the decline in uh in revenue and and oil prices the company is still managing to improve its margins and to drive significant cash flow so the company is ramping production even while oil prices are rising from earlier in this year it's driving solid cash flows and they're producing more than guided so that should lead the market to reassess future outlook um even with the reduction in uh in net cash flow operational efficiency is improving and producing robust free cash flow and that's what it's all about that free cash flow which is being used to redeem those preferred shares and to buy back shares and to pay the dividend yeah well you know dividends a really interesting point because I remember when Buffett first started buying oxie back in early 2020 and I I kind of was like H that seems like a very unbuffed likee thing I mean oxy was cutting their dividend I mean they went from 79 cents down to like a penny and I'm like this isn't what Buffett does this isn't what it does he doesn't do that and yet it turns out that you know he he knows something about what he's doing they've raised their dividend aggressively in the last two years I think it's already back up to 19 cents per share so and it's for all the reasons that Thomas said this is a very well-run company that's committed to shareholder value and like Thomas was alluding to oil companies are in an environment where right now even with prices now getting a little bit below that $80 level they're fine they're fine they're they're they're going to be okay even as they proved earlier this year they're okay even with oil prices down in the 60s not that I think they're going there but that's they're okay M Thomas in your article you had mentioned that the price action of oxy is characterized as tepid to warm um with the stock trending sideways within a range so how might this price movement be influenced by critical support and resistant levels um and if you could tell us what could trigger a significant buying round or a breakout well so you're right the stock is moving sideways within a range but support within that range is solid um what I noticed with Buffett's most recent purchases is that his buying Point has moved higher so he is starting to advance with the market and that is going to build some upside pressure um as Chris was saying before oil prices are weighing on the market because energy stocks tend to trade in alignment with the direction of oil prices but over the long term as he said they're still making plenty of cash flow the outlook for them to continue paying down their debt is good um so I think that it's just a matter of time and like Warren is not a a Trader for him this is going to be a multi-year play he still has about 24 25% of the shares that he's able to buy under his authorization I I think that it'll be many quarters and many years of improvements and slow incremental gains in the stock um it's just a matter of time great insights guys are there any last thoughts that you want to leave us uh with about oxy yeah I mean we've been saying for a while Thomas and I both that $80 is is the floor new floor for oil the floors arguably it's it's looking a little shaky right now but I still think you want to be in oil and gas stocks um and oxy is certainly one of the ones that you want to start looking at it's it's one of those scenarios right now where if the economy um weakens significantly the FED will cut interest rates and that will be bullish for oil and even if the economy remains right where it is right now and we get this sort of stagflation area OPEC has said they're not coming to the rescue so they're not raising production that means the production is going to have to come from somewhere and integrated companies like oxy and Chevron and Exon Mobile are the ones that you're going to want to be in because they're the ones that are going to have to get the the oil out of the ground yeah right I The View on the oil prices is uh sideways to up I mean this near term there's some pressure because of some de some demand weakness in the Outlook But ultimately uh without a recession without actual demand destruction uh we're going to keep burning oil um OPEC has CA their production it gives an opportunity for oxy and all of the western producers to ramp their production and leverage those bottom line gains so I think that uh oxy is a great stock to start building a position in use weaknesses and tests of support to to load up on shares um I think if you get a really big sell up in the stock you might see Warren Buffett and Burkshire put a pretty substantial amount of money into that play I agree all right well thank you guys for joining me today and for taking a comprehensive look at oxy's recent performance and all the factors that are at Play here,1.0,0.85

MarketBeat,DMroieNx6RU,2023-11-09T21:19:55Z,Rivian Stock Surges on Surprise Results,Rivian,"today we're talking about rivan after catching everyone's attention with recent Q3 deliveries. the company's recent earnings report brought even more excitement and of course we're going to talk about rivian ending and its exclusive contract with Amazon. we're here to break down the highs the Catalyst and what this means for your investment Journey. let's get started. rivan's recent Q3 deliveries and earnings report have garnered a lot of attention. we're going to go into some more of this in detail throughout the video but Thomas you would start us off by filling Us in on the highlights here and give us a brief overview of their performance. yeah you know I thought it was a pretty good report uh they had pre-released their Q3 production and delivery numbers so there was no surprise there those were just as expected but uh the revenue and the loss were better than expected so we have outperformance. they also raised their production guidance which to me is a really critical Factor um they're raising production guidance even while other EV manufacturers are lowering theirs which tells tells me they've got demand present uh in this light I expect to see Q4 results outperform and for there to be some pretty solid guidance for next year. all right of course we're here to talk about what we've seen in the news I'm sure that our viewers have been reading all about this too um but rivan recently ended his exclusivity contract with Amazon so that's going to allow them to sell EV delivery Vans directly um to the broad market so tell us a little bit more how is this going to impact um rivan and others CH. well so my initial inclination when I when I saw the headline was to look at the article and I was kind of trying to be a contrarian and think where's the bad news here and I really haven't been able to find any. I mean to me this is a win-win for for rivan. I mean on the one hand it didn't lose any business from Amazon and it still has about 990,000 vans that it has to fulfill from that order plus it gets to um it gets to directly sell to a market in a category of EV that might be more receptive to the technology than maybe the passenger vehicle consumer side yeah. right the big news for me in the report um bigger than the guide really was the deal with Amazon that exclusivity contract really locked them into only selling to Amazon. this opens up a multi-billion dollar Pere growth opportunity. I see this leading the company to double its Revenue more than once over the next few years and that's not counting um their core line of cars yeah. all right so going off with that Thomas in your article for marabe it's a really great one by the way um you had mentioned rivian's leadership position and kind of the moat in the electric vehicle delivery van market so tell us more about your statement on that what is setting rivan apart from competitors in this space. well number one it's producing Vans at scale um there are other manufacturers making Vans like Workhorse group and Mullen Automotive they're in the early phases they don't have the entrenched business that um rivan already has and rivan's Fleet is proven. Amazon has more than 10,000 vans on the road so if there was a problem with them we would know that know about it by now um and then this the entire class 4 Market is is so huge um today it's worth about $160 billion do it's expected to grow at a 5% cagr for the next few years and within that the EV segment is supposed to expand at 35% cagr right now EV is about 1% of the whole class 4 Market. this is an incredibly huge opportunity for rivan and they are the clear leader right now um the other companies May gain some share in this market but rivan's always going to have the most share uh the way things look right now. Chris what have you been seeing here I know you mentioned that you don't really see the downside right now with that but is there a downside. well I think right now the downside would be be more in the in the broader macroeconomic story if you're looking to invest in rivan you're going to want to listen to a lot of the points that Thomas just made about the opportunity they have with the class 4 as far as it relates to the price action on the stock post earnings I think it's just it's one of those situations where rivan picked uh you know rivan delivered a good earnings report at a time when in a quarter when many EV manufacturers either delivered disappointing results or just downright bad results so you know I I don't think there's really the stock went down I think that's just literally more having to do with the broader economy and investor sentiment in general I don't think it necessarily had to do with rivian specifically. all right let's touch on margins here uh rivan's margins appear to be positive despite some increased costs um is there anything investors need to keep their eye on here Thomas that's profitability with these evem. it's really all about profitability um they didn't make money this quarter but losses are narrowing they're better than expected and uh this leverage should continue as they ramp production and sales um I see profitability getting closer. I would expect to see some analysts start coming out with some chatter that says you know profitability is going to happen sooner than we expected which will be the real Catalyst for the market and just speaking to what Chris said a minute ago with with a chart action there's a lot of technical um resistance to higher prices there's lots of great fundamental reasons for the stock to move higher but right now we've got short Sellers and just overhead resistance from people whose initial positions are down from last year uh once we work through that I think that the stock will have a pretty clear um upper trajectory. all right so Market B is rating rivian as a moderate buy analysts are seeing the stock price ramp higher uh do you have any final thoughts um by the way I have seen a few rivan on the road I think they're sharp are you hearing me Elon um but what are your thoughts on this right. like I just said there's lots of reasons for the stock to go higher the question is if it will when it will. there are still some risks profitability is a big one short interest is still substantial the market may not recover quickly but I think that uh dips are good times to buy be prudent you know build a nice small manageable position and over time it should pay off pretty well. yeah I mean as an investor with a long-term focus rivan is intriguing to me uh right now do I want to get in on the stock I'm not sure. one thing that I'm noticing and and Thomas was bringing that up is that right now there looks like there's a level of support that was the level of resistance about six months ago so it'll be intriguing to see if the stock establishes that as a new base of support that'll be a good thing for investors to keep an eye on. also I was a little surprised Thomas brought up to short interest on the stock it surprised me that you didn't see more short covering with rivan so you know that's something else to watch in the short term again that's as far as you might not want to just go all in on rivan right now start a small position build it over time watch the price action and figure out where you're going there yeah. right because uh that initial pop was a lot of short covering but I think that the shorts just sold into it you know they sold it down some short selling some profit takers from near-term gains also people trying to trim out some losses from last year um so like I said um what Dawn calls overhead resistance um it's there we got to work through it once it's gone this stock should should move up y. all right well great insights there I think that wraps up our dive into rivan's recent performance. uh remember the road ahead for rivan is filled with potential catalysts so whether you're eyeing this as a long-term investment or considering a strategic move stay tuned for the twists and turns um we're Gna be covering it right here at Market Beach so check back with us right here thanks.",1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,lxFOgrjQJ9Q,2023-11-09T13:30:19Z,"3 Market Correction Opportunities: UPS, Lowe's & Tesla",UPS,right so my first pick in a rebound scenario would be UPS a recovery in the economy would mean a slow and steady uptick in package volume in that scenario we'd be looking for business and consumer package volume to increase um that would probably be supported by an increase in uh consumer consumer sales retail sales e-commerce um we probably see an increase in business spending in general um this would sustain an upturn an upturn in the price um but I don't think now it's the time to buy it I think that the stock really could fall another $20 or more before it hits the bottom and that's because the chart is it's craptastic that's the best word that I can use for it uh we broke support because the company has been persistently downgrading its guidance that's leading the market lower analysts are lowering targets and they're taking the wind out of this balloon the reason for people that own it now to hold it will be the dividend the dividend is still safe and growing the company efforts to reposition for the rebound are aiding margins operational quality that will provide some leverage once the rebound begins so until then I think the dividend payments are safe and we're just going to be looking for the bottom in the stock which will probably happen some sometime early next year but it really just depends on how the economy unfolds whether or not we have a recession and what the fomc does,1.0,-0.3
MarketBeat,lxFOgrjQJ9Q,2023-11-09T13:30:19Z,"3 Market Correction Opportunities: UPS, Lowe's & Tesla",Lowe's,so one of the stocks that's catching my attention right now is lows um so the stock is down about 177% in the last three months that's taking it down about two to three% for the year um some of the stories are pretty familiar here there's weakness in the housing market there's a pinched consumer there's in inflation there's retail theft uh revenue and earnings were down uh year over-year not a lot to not a lot of reasons to invest in the stock this year however prior to these three months the stock had stayed at fairly elevated levels it really wasn't a buying opportunity now that it's Fallen it is a little bit of a buying opportunity and any sign that there's going to be a extended pause or a pivot in the FED St strategy would be a boon to the housing market which would then translate to Home Improvement stocks as a matter of fact since uh since chair Powell yesterday said that it looked like they might be coming to an end to their hiking spree I noticed that Lowe's has bounced up pretty sharply off of trading near its 52- we low so you know that's already being somewhat being reflected in the stock and even even if you think that now might not be a time to enter a position or to add to your position you're still getting a great dividend uh it's supported by the cash flow they're doing share BuyBacks this is just a really solid stock as a Buy and Hold investment and let's see analysts generally bullish on the stock um you know everything that I'm seeing based on the analyst ratings suggest we're near we're close to a bottom anyway and you're looking at probably about a 20% upside low seems like a really strong play right now all right well we'll be keeping Lowe's in mind here,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,lxFOgrjQJ9Q,2023-11-09T13:30:19Z,"3 Market Correction Opportunities: UPS, Lowe's & Tesla",Tesla,of course we're talking about Tesla here Thomas tell us why Tesla is a good rebound stock yeah right so Chris and I had a discussion about Tesla he and I and Don talk about this stock pretty frequently um but we think it's a good play for the rebound um among the takes is that price Cuts today which are kind of impacting results today and pressuring the stock lower will help Drive sales and volume and establish the company's dominance and or continue to establish this dominance in the EV market so that when a rebound occurs it will be able to have some leverage it'll have more market share and be able to improve prices and that's really just uh the EV car story um within the bigger picture there's also so the charging Network which is expected to be worth about 5 billion in annual revenue once it's fleshed out that's worth about 5% in growth relative to 2023 um Revenue levels and then there's also uh solar solar storage AI robotics autonomous vehicles uh Tesla is just a very very unique company uh you almost have to own some just because of what it is I mean it's you can't get exposure to the things that Tesla does any other way yeah I mean right now we've all heard the stories you know EV demand in the United States is is leveling off um and that just to me though what it's really revealing is how far ahead in the market Tesla is uh in the United States they're just they're just head and shoulders above everybody else and I just don't foresee that changing uh if you know it's one of those things if the economy turns around who's going to be the beneficiary in the EV Market it's Tesla uh and then to the to Thomas's point about the charging Network I mean I live in a fairly small area of the country in terms of population and such and uh at at a store that I frequently shop at there's now a in the last few months there's a new Bank of Tesla chargers right and I was like who when did that get here and it almost seemed like it popped up overnight it's like oh wow okay so you know that just it's it's further evidence to the story that there's just a bigger story here with Tesla than just beyond selling cars and it gets bigger all the time too because I just thought about the UAW strike the UAW strike has caused all the major oems to pull back on their EV strategies y the EV strategies that have been driving these oems for the last couple years have evaporated that leaves an enormous amount of market share for Tesla to capitalize on over the next few years,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,TVRf5JrPXU8,2023-11-06T14:21:47Z,Intel is a Buy-and-Hold Stock for 2024,Intel,"Intel stock is beaten down but the bottom is in and the rebound is on let's talk about it all right guys let's talk about what's going on with Intel stock so what is the story with Intel and the company's Q3 results well the foundation of this story is the the relatively new cea uh Pat Ginger he took control of this company at what was probably the lowest low of the company's history and he's turning the ship around now it's a great big ship so it's slow to turn around but the uh the new results show that they're starting to gain traction the results really are centered on Ed excuse me on execution and show a lot of operational improvements but also some stabilization within the PC chip Market uh PC chips uh sales fell compared to last year but less than expected and there's return to growth is expected for next year so that's a pretty good foundation for the company to build on and it's got all of these new projects underway uh so um I just think it's a pretty solid foundation for the company to continue to build on Chris what factors both Market related and Company specific um are currently shaping Intel's investment landscape yeah I think I think Thomas hit on it there's going to be some short-term turbulence with the stock I was looking at this the chart before we came on and you know clearly it broke out of a range in the summer now it seems to be trying to see if he can get back up to that 52- we High don't know how much earnings are going to help with that I think the story here as Thomas was alluding to is are we in for a rebound in the chip sector um if we are then the dividend becomes very compelling because you can have a $1,000 investment in Intel and you could be looking at about $60 worth of dividends and that's that's a pretty nice Total return for your investment right now all right Thomas I know you always have something to say especially when we're talking about dividends um and since Chris brought that up I want some more details on that you are calling Intel's dividend a return to growth story and I mean Intel did catch the markets uh by surprise when it cut its dividend after years of uh sustained increase so share with us a little more about this dividend situation right now yeah so uh my thoughts on the dividend run like this uh they cut it to help uh with cash flow and preserve Capital to help get the turnaround started the turnaround is definitely underway and it's gaining traction and we have growth back in the forecast to me this means that dividend growth is also back in the forast I don't think that they're going to reinstate to the old level right away they probably won't make an increase for several more quarters maybe not until the end of the year but I think it's more a matter of when and not if um you know like Chris was saying we're looking at some chip Market stabilization within within these Legacy markets but Intel also has these new growth markets that it's developing including Ai and and so I see that uh revenue and earnings next year could outpace expectations and uh help lead the company to raise a dividend again all right so what else is important for investors to consider here um Chris are there any other strategic moves or Investments um that the company's making yeah I I one of one of the areas that we haven't really talked about yet but it's really important is that Intel's already invested about a hundred billion dollars in um uh building out their chip making in the United States and that's a huge story right now Intel is not the only company that's doing it they were the first to announce it and they did this under the previous administration um I know there's a few others I think TSM tsmc um is doing it I'm I I think AMD might be doing it as well Thomas but I'm not sure about that but this is a race clearly that semiconductor companies are going to want to win because right now there's a lot of incentive to Ure their production into the United States and Intel has a lead in doing that Thomas do you have anything else to add um on what investors need to be considering here well Chris is absolutely right and what he's hitting on is one of the core tenants of the turnaround strategy which includes domestic production and Foundry services so Intel working on Foundry Services helps the supply chain in two ways um and it expands its Revenue potential for one thing Intel's own clients will have a smoother supply chain plus with The Foundry services

MarketBeat,CikPO6s5FFs,2023-10-30T12:15:00Z,Is Netflix Stock a Buy After Its Post-Earnings Surge?,Netflix,"Netflix stock soared over 15% after earnings and with subscribers pouring in and a strategy shift we're here to answer the burning question is there room for investors to get in on this stock stick around as we explore the numbers and the streaming Revolution that's reshaping the game. Let's dive right into it guys, the recent performance of Netflix stock has been making headlines as we've seen; there has been a surge following strong earnings. The stock has shot up more than 15% the day after reporting. So Chris, Netflix has skyrocketed past his 200 day and 50-day Simple moving averages, so is there still room for investors to get involved with the stock? Yeah, the short answer is absolutely. The answer is pretty simple here: Netflix has embraced ad Revenue in a big way. They're finding out that consumers as much as consumers will say they want to have their streaming uninterrupted, they like the low price better. And here's something to watch for, said in the earnings report, that they're planning on raising the price for their premium subscribers which currently pay about $19.99 for the service. So I'll be curious to see how many of those subscribers now opt to move down to the ad supported tier that's cheaper, which coincidentally Netflix wouldn't hate at all. Let's talk about the password sharing Crackdown; this stock story might just be hotter than some of the binge worthy series that are currently on Netflix. Netflix had abandoned that long established practice of allowing subscribers to share their account passwords with friends and families that are outside of the same household. Obviously this has prompted more viewers who had been watching it for free, they had to then turn in to sign up for their own accounts, and so that had resulted in nearly 9 million new subscribers. Thomas, fill us in on this situation a little bit, what do these things mean for the company's future? I think you're right because you're kind of alluding to the fact that Netflix left billions on the table over the years allowing people to share their passwords but I like to think of that now as like an investment into the future growth. Netflix raises prices, brings in the ad tiers, cuts back on password sharing and all of a sudden it's got the strongest user growth and revenue growth that's seen in years. I think that the company is exhibiting tremendous pricing power and that this will continue to play out over the next several quarters. Netflix is really a Content heavy business, it takes a lot of money to produce all that content, so all these new subscribers and these new ad tiers and the raise prices are going to help them create more content and draw more subscribers so in that I see growth be getting growth. Thomas makes a great point about Netflix is creating the content that consumers are demanding and that's a really important point. The fact that they're choosing Netflix over some of these other options is pretty telling. What are the key takeaways here particularly in terms of Revenue and earnings expectations? For me it all comes back to pricing power, so the revenue was only as expected that's kind of tepid relative to the analyst's expectations, so that by itself isn't really a catalyst for higher share prices but on top of that the margins were strong EPS is growing outperforming expectations. The company is also adding in additional leverage with the new price hikes. I think that this story has quite a bit of more time to play out, I think that Revenue will probably continue to accelerate over the next several quarters, I mean if not for the next several years. Chris, there's the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike and that of course affects Netflix producing their own content. There is talk about Netflix upping its live sports game, so if you would tell us more about how are these factors going to affect the company? Yes that will affect Netflix in terms of if the actor strike continues for any length of time there'll be delays in getting some of that original content out to their viewers. Netflix management denies that they're going to make a big splash into live sports, I'm not sure about that, I kind of look at that is what else are they going to say, this isn't going to be something they're going to announce until they have something to announce. Is Netflix a buy? Well Lacy, earlier this year I would have said no but Netflix has surprised me and right now they're projecting about 31% earnings growth in the next 12 months that's certainly justifies the premium valuation which I think they're around 34 times earnings. It's hard not to get behind it, the way I kind of see it right now is they're in a heads they win, tails they still win scenario. If the economy weakens Netflix is a cheap form of entertainment just like it was in 2020, if the economy rebounds well you know what people are still going to pay for the ad supported tier about $6.99 so they win either way. Thomas, what are your thoughts here? I think Netflix is a blue chip quality Buy and Hold Tech stock, it's foundational to the internet and streaming. This is a story of not so much how it succeeds but how long it takes for the success to trickle through to the share price. I think the stock is cheap at 33-34 times this year's earnings, next year that falls to 25 times so I see some multiple expansion in play. I think that investors will see some volatility over the next quarter or two, maybe the next couple of years but I think that opportunistic investors will want to use those price dips to load up on shares.",1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,DZNqrBJtTrI,2023-10-26T12:30:08Z,Abbott Labs Stock Offers Favorable Entry Point,Abbott Laboratories,Abbot Laboratories has been on a downward spiral for two years but the game is changing the market once hesitant due to the pandemic's impact is now seeing signs of a comeback as normalization takes Center Stage stay tuned as we uncover why the shift is the next big thing for Abbott and what it means for your investment Journey let's get started Thomas let's talk about Abbot Laboratories solid quarter here it is no surprise that uh they are beating estimates but why does the market consistently underestimate their performance um and what makes them stand out from the competition you had mentioned that they are oversold and overextended um speak to that yeah as far as the underestimation uh it's hard to say except that abot is just a really solid stable company with a healthy portfolio of Brands and products that are entrenched it uh it has competition but the quality of the company and the markets that it's in it's diversification just help it perform solidly on a quarter to quarter basis now that selloff that you were speaking about is due to the there I say it the covid cliff you know they made tons and tons of money with covid testing that testing has really come down over the last two years and that's impacted their growth trajectory uh so right now the point that that article wasn't to expound on how awesome Abbott is because I think that we've said that plenty of times here on our channel the point of that article is to point out that the market is oversold it is overextended it was ripe for a rebound and the Q3 results provided a catalyst to start that rebound something else here Thomas you say that analysts think the stock is overvalued at least compared to others in this space um but they still see an upside so why is it worth overpaying for the stock now yeah I don't know if they see it as overvalued necessarily but it is highly valued compared to some competitors like J and J Johnson and Johnson the difference between Johnson and Johnson is that it's got more exposure to Farmer Discovery so it's kind of got a little bit of a riskier aspect to it Abbot is more of an established entr trenched company um as for upside the stock trades below the analyst's lowest price Target so that confirms that it is at least in their minds oversold and has a uh substantial upside potential okay Thomas as we know I am not a chart Guru um easy to tell but nothing looks exciting to me here to be completely honest so should we wait for an uptrend to be confirmed or what are we looking at well if you want to trade shortterm with an uptrend I would wait for the rally to be confirmed but this is an entry into a buy and hold forever stock so what we're looking for really is just uh confirmation of support at uh the bottom of a price range or at the bottom of a downtrend so that we can expect uh some upside over time the point point with abot is to build positions slowly over time uh incrementally buying shares as they present those value opportunities um and as far as abot and this opportunity I don't think that investors are going to see this yield and value combination in this stock for a long time if ever again so let's look at the chart and I'll show you what I mean okay we can see here we hit the peak over and end of 2021 that's all driven by covid testing at this point the market think hm the pandemic's over just about over testing sales are going to decline that's seen in the revenue and the stock sells off since uh late last year we hit bottom we tested that bottom a few times and then right here just before the earnings released the stock sold off and hit a new low that new low triggered buying as you can see in this candle right here what we have now is a market confirming support at this critical level what we want to see now though is for the market to continue bouncing move back up above this critical line and then possibly retested again for support before getting really really bullish on the name um as far as the rest of the chart goes the indicators are also favorable uh the macd has diverged from the low which means that there's not a lot of Market conviction sets it up for a rebound and stochastic also shows oversold and an early bullish crossover which is consistent with this bottom and the potential for a rebound so all things considered the stock is definitely ready for a rebound the only question now is if the market will follow through and the stock actually does Rebound Thomas how about an entry point I know you like to add systematically to your positions um is that the play here yeah I mean for me I own Abbot so this was an opportunity for me I bought a little bit more I think that investors who are trying to build positions in income producing stocks would do well to consider this for their portfolios,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,DZNqrBJtTrI,2023-10-26T12:30:08Z,Abbott Labs Stock Offers Favorable Entry Point,Johnson and Johnson,yeah I don't know if they see it as overvalued necessarily but it is highly valued compared to some competitors like J and J Johnson and Johnson the difference between Johnson and Johnson is that it's got more exposure to Farmer Discovery so it's kind of got a little bit of a riskier aspect to it Abbot is more of an established entr trenched company um as for upside the stock trades below the analyst's lowest price Target so that confirms that it is at least in their minds oversold and has a uh substantial upside potential,1.0,-0.1
MarketBeat,bVTy3jj2w1A,2023-10-25T12:30:22Z,"Delta Stock is About to Take Flight Higher, Patience Required",Delta Air Lines,Delta Airlines has the market talking thanks to concerns about Rising oil prices and a 25% stock price dip since July but is the pullback overblown stay tuned as we explore Delta's recent Q3 results breaking records and a robust dividend Outlook let's get into it today we're taking a look at Delta Airlines and its impact on the market is the recent guidance cut Justified or is there more to the story that meets the eye Delta sent shock waves to the market as we've seen when it cut its Q3 guidance so Chris if you would can you shed some light on the influence um of rising oil prices for us and the 25% pullback and stock price that's happened since July sure Lacy I mean really this comes out of a simple math problem that every investor understands um as the price for a company like Delta of the jet fuel as that as that price gets higher um they have to pass that cost along or try as best they can to pass that cost along to their consumers so they raise prices on flights and things like that and when they announced that that was going to be happening investors started to price that into the stock and that's why the stock moved down about 25% now the interesting thing is the company just reported and they had a better quarter than expected where they they beat uh estimates I think they beat on both the top and bottom line am I right Thomas that's what I remember yeah and so now the stock is priced pretty well because they they took a lot of that excess out of the stock with the 25% downturn all right so Delta Airlines did make the decision to suspend its distribution at the start of the pandemic um so I kind of want to know more about how this impacted the company's Financial Health I think Delta let's keep in mind Delta is reinstating the dividend and they weren't the only airline to suspend the dividend I mean United Southwest American they've all suspended the dividends during that time great perspective there guys now Delta's Q3 results um their Outlook suggests that the leading air carrier in the US um Thomas can you share more about the record setting Revenue here I mean Delta reported 15.49 billion in net revenue for the quarter um so go ahead break that down for us what are the factors that are driving this strong performance well it's a combination of a pint up uh pandemic demand and then the return to to to work uh so they've got strong business domestically and internationally business is being supported by premium seats and also loyalty programs so it's showing that Delta is really um delivering for its customers um the big takeaway right now for me is that business is stabilizing still growing really and it's above 2019 levels so I see no reason why the stock should not continue or should not rebound from its current lows okay so if you would can you help me gain a better understanding of uh Delta's debt reduction so the company has paid down a substantial amount of debt this year so what are the implications of something like this and uh how has it affected the company's Financial stability Chris can you help me out with that sure so Thomas alluded to it earlier Delta is a cast Capital intensive business all airlines are and frequently the airlines rely on debt to fuel their growth to buy new planes and do all the different things that they do by paying down their debt Delta put themselves in a good position or they're getting their balance sheet in pretty good shape so that they're not turning over and refinancing debt at higher and higher levels right I mean I'm sorry the the cost of debt is a is a huge Factor right now um but even more importantly these Airlines have to get ready for the next Crisis it's going to come sooner or later um if they're highly levered with poor cash flow they're not going to be able to survive so it's really in Delta's best interest to continue paying down the debt even though it's also in the best interest of shareholders Thomas you had mentioned that Delta stock is showing support at a critical level that's near $36 um how significant is this pivot point and what does this potential support level hold for the stocks future price action yeah right well it was showing support at that level about 10 days go when I first wrote that article uh since then the price has fallen through that level um and I see it heading back down to the uh the recent lows we could see another couple percentage points shaped off of this stock before it begins to rebound but I think that when it moves down to that critical support level um that we should see support kick in and a rebound begin Chris Delta Airlines is among Market beat's top rated stocks so what is the analyst consensus there so they're very bullish on the stock um there's 13 analysts that market beat tracks that cover Delta um they have a consensus buy rating of about $54.40 on the stock at least they did a couple of days ago that was the last time I checked and here's the thing some of them have been lowering their price targets for Delta but all of I shouldn't say all I think most of them that have been lowering their price targets are lowering them at a level that's above that consensus Target so that's very bullish for for Del that just says analysts are very bullish on the stock all right guys why don't you both give us a quick recap of the takeaways that investors need to keep in mind when they're considering Delta as a possible investment uh Thomas what do you have to share well I think Delta is a blue chip quality stock it's a market leader it's gaining share it's proving uh to have utility for its uh its customers and clients I think it's a good Buy and Hold stock um I think in the near- term though oil prices are a concern so so margins may see more pressure that may keep the stock uh moving lower or moving sideways in the near to midterm but I think longterm uh Delta is a great buy and should uh provide investors with a pretty solid return Chris what are you leaving with leaving us with yeah if if I was G to nitpick anything because I can't really disagree with anything that Thomas said if I was gonna nitpick one thing I would say Delta has a significantly fewer amount of international flights than some of the other carriers and right now the strength in the airline industry is international flights as Europe and other destinations have reopened um however given the general climate surrounding uh geopolitical events that might be swinging back to domestic travel and if it does then Delta has a big Advantage there as as far as some the competition all right well as we've seen Delta has managed to maintain positive margins despite challenges like Rising fuel costs keep your eyes on the horizon and on our channel of course for the latest insights on Delta's

MarketBeat,VAT-5WYM-pA,2023-10-24T12:30:15Z,Domino's Stock Delivers an Attractive Entry for Income Investors,Domino's Pizza,"In today's video we'll dive into the world of Domino's Pizza stock, its recent performance, and the potential for investors. We'll be discussing the company's trajectory of distribution growth, the impact of the latest financial results, and what the analysts are saying about the future. Today we have some great insights on Domino's Pizza stock. While it may not be a high yielding stock, the real story here is the remarkable trajectory of its distribution growth. In your recent article on Market Beat titled Domino's Pizza delivers an attractive entry for income investors, you had mentioned that Domino's has already increased the dividend payment for 11 years, which really puts them on par with dividend Achievers and future dividend Aristocrats. This isn't a high yielding stock; the yield is okay, it's on par with the S&P 500, maybe a little bit lower, but this is a dividend growth story. The company pays a small amount of its earnings, about 35%, but chooses not to pay more as it's leaning into growth. Money is used to invest in future cash flow which will help sustain dividend growth over the long term. Earnings growth in a solid balance sheet mean they can sustain a high double digit pace of distribution increases which is a real attractive draw for investors. I want to chat about Domino's recent Q3 performance, as total revenue has declined year-over-year. The three factors that really played into the revenue decline were a small, very mild decline in US comps about a half percent, Market Basket pricing where they charged less to their stores, and exiting Russia because of the war in Ukraine that impacted revenue significantly. But ex Russia, the company's growing and that's awesome. The pandemic kind of slowed down the growth trajectory a little bit, but based on the company's guidance and targets they're looking for 25% store count growth over the next few years. A lot of that growth is going to be in international and Emerging Markets, which puts Domino's in a pretty good position over the next year as far as its growth outlook. Analysts and institutions are ordering up some Domino's Pizza; they favor it for the growth in the capital returns. The company is growing and it's on track to continue growing. It pays a solid dividend and has a robust trajectory for dividend growth. There are 24 analysts covering it, which is a significantly high number, and they rated it a moderate buy. The consensus rating is firm and the price target is moving higher; they see about 15% upside at the midpoint of the range, which is pretty decent given the dividend and the dividend growth over the long term. I think that consensus target will move higher and provide much greater than 15% return. Institutions are also buying the stock, so when they're buying, stock prices may fall but they won't fall too far. On to the technical outlook, Domino's is pulling back to critical support, the bottom is in. The Post Release action has been a little bit mixed; the stock price corrected, it bounced. There's still some resistance up here at these moving averages, but we're also clearly above this critical support line. The 325 level has been support for this stock for many years; it's been tested five times. It's likely going to confirm that support a sixth time, and when it does, I think that will be the opportune time for investors to get into this stock. That's a wrap on our deep dive into Domino's stock; we've unfolded the story here behind their recent financial performance, the growth trajectory, and the opportunities that lie ahead for them.",1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,y9Zw3YjPbiE,2023-10-23T11:18:49Z,"Tesla Stock Down, Not Out",Tesla,Tesla earnings are in and a big Miss has shares pulling back in a big way let's talk about it Thomas perhaps some were surprised when Tesla earnings fell short of the expectations after the Bell on Wednesday bears were happy Bulls of course tried to spin the news but you had wrote an article on markip beat called Tesla hits the skids and you had pointed out five takeaways from a less than Stellar report here so let's run through those right now are there any positives to consider yeah there are there's several the number one is that despite the headwinds the company is growing and it makes profits profitability is hurting because of the price reductions but volume is still sound the volume growth is key to dominating the evb market um the analysts were expecting some weakness due to the price reductions but the outlook for the year is still okay regarding volume and over the long term it's the volume that's going to support the business and not the margin per car now ultimately the balance sheet is still in fine shape they leaned into some debt over the last quarter but debt is relatively flat year-over-year the takeaway is that the company is well capitalized in fine shape and can continue to follow through on its plans well Elon Musk on the call said that the long awaited cyber truck will debut in late November and I want to read a quote here um from the call so he had tempered Financial expectations for the vehicle saying that it's going to require a immense work to reach volume production and cash flow positive at a price that people can actually afford um with the Cyber truck and he also emphasized that um he had said I just want to temper expectations for cybertruck it's a great product um but financially it will take a year to 18 months before it sees a significant positive cash flow contributor um so Thomas help me understand here investors have been anxiously awaiting news from the Cyber truck and now is he the captain of cold water briag on the news yeah right I don't know if I'd call it cold water so much as foresightful caution we are talking about the stock market the stock market is driven by fear and greed when Elon Musk announced they were're going to have a new product the market immediately prices in every potential gain that they can see coming from that new product we've seen the same thing happen in cannabis stocks in the EV Market back when uh the spack attack was going on just about any stock that in viia you know priced in lots of gains for that new a the new AI demand boom right so lot of uh overe expectations so what I would say is that elon's comments about the cybertruck are more cautionary trying to keep the market uh more realistic But ultimately it is a good product and the Outlook is for positive cash flow it's just a matter of time all right well Thomas we've said on this channel many times Elon Musk talks and the stock moves um but do you think inv vors have had enough of Tesla I doubt it Tesla is a great company with more going for it than cars there's solar there's energy storage starlink AI robotics there's too much going on to give up on them right now um too many potential catalysts to drive Revenue over the coming years I think ultimately this stock could split into several companies over the coming years so yeah really Tesla is one of those stocks that you got to watch you've got to pick some price points you got to be ready to buy it when the stock is down build a position over time all right one thing that I do want to mention here is Tesla has been dropping the prices of their vehicles we're talking about a 25% reduction in the third quarter um Tesla used to boast that it was the king of margins in the Auto industry and while it's still more profitable than traditional auto makers um is this going to play out to be a large concern I don't think so the price drop is too is too encourage enourage more buyers to buy the cars and that's good volume is good long term all of those buyers will be reing new Teslas they'll also be buying additional Tesla products including charging Services uh near-term it's a headwind long-term it could be a catalyst I mean look at Ford they made their name making affordable cars for the masses that's what Elon Musk is trying to do he wants to bring his cars price point down to where everybody can buy one when everybody can buy one Tesla will be as popular as the Ford Escort used to be they'll be everywhere and that is good news for investors all right well the stock is down 8% the time of this taping Thomas um downgrades have already started so is there an entry point where we could feel good about buying shares of Tesla well yeah the analyst activity is relative so far I've seen two price Target reductions both of those price targets come with an overweight equivalent rating and both of the reductions are to above the consensus level so near-term headwind yes Weighing on the stock price yes longer term once the bottom of this current correction is found the stock should rebound and it looks like it's got a solid double digit upside potential all right Thomas I'm not letting you go without an entry point I need to know others do too so give it to us right here right so it looks to me like the $200 level give or take is a pretty good entry point um let's check out the chart and I'll show you why right so uh Tesla big boom EV boom hit a peak in 2021 stock price corrected we confirmed support here at the 180 level since we confirmed this support the Market's reversed and we're showing some pretty solid support at these moving averages stock price is moving back to the moving averages now but I would expect to see support kick in again somewhere in this region around $200 we may get a move down below support may be found above but we're looking at this line as a region for where the next signal will occur uh the only question now is if that signal will be a rebound or potentially confirm resistance at 180 which I don't think will happen all right so Tesla faces short-term challenges post Q3 earnings but its long-term prospects remain strong despite margin pressures Tesla's profitability is set to continue so of course we're going to be keeping an eye on that right here on this channel go

Chris you have three picks here for investors who want to manage the current volatility in the oil markets and to start you had mentioned Exxon Mobile as a safe bet, can you elaborate a little bit on why this is considered a safe investment at the moment, you had specifically mentioned that they have cash on their balance sheets so how does this play into the strategy of share BuyBacks and dividends. Sure so Exon Mobile is as you just said it's one of the safest bets in the oil sector right now it's trading at about 10 times forward earnings and that's despite the growth it's already had this year is still only trading at 10 times forward earnings so it's a very it's valued very attractively for investors it pays a safe and growing dividend. Right now oil companies are starting to generate that strong Revenue it's going to lead to strong profits and this is an area where it can be a little bit some investors don't like to hear about it but this is where you get those profits that companies like Exon Mobile have plowed into share BuyBacks and dividends it's shareholder capitalism it's rewarding your shareholders and Exon Mobile is one of the companies that does this very well. I would expect to see more share BuyBacks more dividend increases as a way for them to allocate this windfall of cash that they have at a time when it it's sort of prohibitive for them to be drilling and starting new projects. Thomas I think that you also have a positive outlook on Exxon so what makes it stand out to you. I think Exxon Mobile might be the best single stock play in the SE I mean it's the world's largest integrated oil company outside of China or Saudi Arabia they're growing they're cheap they've got a great dividend my only real problem with them is the dividend is below The XLE the sector average but that's offset by a robust outlook for dividend growth. The company's cash balance is phenomenally large compared to historical levels, cash flow is growing so I see some pretty nice dividend increases over the next year or two. The XLE ETF of course owns Exxon Mobile as part of their Holdings.",1.0,0.9

Chris you had also highlighted total energies and their commitment to paying out cash flow from operations to shareholders, can you explain to us maybe why this commitment is so significant to investors. Yeah, I hinted at it a little bit when I talked about Exon Mobile it's the fact of so what do these companies do when they have this revenue and this profit and that what really impressed me when I looked at total energy is what you just said they are committed to paying out at least 40% of their cash from operations to shareholders and as a shareholder that's what you want to see. The price of oil is cyclical but dividend payments and share BuyBacks are the type of things that make oil stocks worth holding on to for the Long Haul. Thomas, do you have your eye on this stock at all. I actually had never heard of this stock before but I'm glad that Chris brought it up. I did check it out it's got a pretty nice dividend, dividend Outlook is pretty nice and I don't know that Chris saw this but just this past week they increased their dividend Outlook target to 44 45% of cash flow so I see some more substantial dividend increases with this stock.",1.0,0.9

My only real problem with them is the dividend is below The XLE the sector average but that's offset by a robust outlook for dividend growth. Chris you would also have the XLE on your list and this is the choice for investors that are seeking broad exposure, explain your reasoning behind this one and the placement on the list. Sure, the placement is actually pretty easy Lacy I chose three stocks from my article at this point in time I could probably have chosen 30 when it comes to energy stocks it's just a ripe sector but the XLE is the type of sector that gives investors broad exposure to the entire sector. Of course they own Exxon Mobile, they own Chevron as part of their Holdings, they own Occidental, I mean all of the stocks that you would want them to hold, they and they own others that we've talked about on this channel, Schlumberger. The point of The XLE is it gives investors broad exposure to the entire sector. Now having said that, you could make the argument that investors might be just they could look at investing in a couple of the stocks or two or three of the stocks that are in The XLE fund itself and they might just be better off investing in those stocks by themselves but there's no issue with just investing in the fund. Well that's my thought exactly, The XLE gives pretty good broad exposure to the sector as far as an ETF goes I think it's got better allocation than some of the other spdrs some of those things are 25 or 30% One stock XLE I think the biggest holding is 10% but also like Chris says you can go in there and cherry pick a few names and get 100 200 basis point better dividend then with the the fund itself.",1.0,0.8

the Right video PepsiCo stock is down 20% from recent Highs but it's trading in deep value high yield territory and we're here to break it down welcome back everyone today we are discussing PepsiCo over the past few months this stock has seen some significant moves it's down approximately 20% since May and that's something we simply can't ignore here um but before the investors hit the panic button let's talk about what this decline really means um so we're not hitting the panic button here but if someone does want a button to hit um you can text marketbeat to 6828 and you will get free stock market alerts right on your phone um back to the important discussion here though a 20% drop that does sound a little alarming so what are we looking at here Thomas and what factors are causing this yeah right so 20% is a pretty big decline I'm sure lots of investors are scared but I think investors looking to get out before it's too late or too late the stock is corrected and now there's a bigger picture a bigger story at play uh the correction took the market down to a major uptrend line we're seeing some solid support at that uptrend line I think we're seeing a pretty nice Trend following signal that should uh lead this stock higher over time and ultimately this correction was caused by a sentiment It Was Fear of slowing growth and underperformance due to Consumer shifting down and the Q3 results totally blew that idea out of the water Chris Thomas say that investors U might want to stay in this market why is it an appealing consideration exactly so Pepsi's really at a place that most investors should really be very optimistic um yes the stock is still down 10% for the year and that's you know concerning but you have to put that in the context of what Thomas just said they delivered earnings earnings are up about 10% the dividends also up about 10% and that should give investors the confidence to say that the pullback was really just the market doing what the market does and Pepsi was dragged down along with the General market but there's really nothing fundamentally wrong with the business and that's something that you're looking for with a defensive stock is a company that's going to deliver strong revenue and strong earnings over time all right so Thomas if you would tell me more about the dividend situation here how does Pepsi's dividend uh compare to other investment options and why is this important for income investors specifically all right so Pepsi's dividend isn't some ridiculously high yield but uh this correction has shaved about five handles off the value and put the dividend above 3% which makes Pepsi a deep value and a high yield relative to itself now that by itself also isn't isn't really a great reason to buy but Pepsi Co is a market leader um uh uh an industry leader it's growing it's got a healthy balance sheet it's got the solid dividend support of the analyst and the institutions so I think that uh this pullback really is just another like Chris said a natural market U function and the uptrend will resume can one of you explain a little bit more to me about how we can maybe a different create um a market correction and a bare Market Chris do you maybe want to explain that yeah so the the textbook definition has to do with um percentage and um and the scope I guess I'd say um Market Corrections are generally seen as when an asset or an equity drops 10% in in price and it becomes a bare Market when it drops about 20% price so like Thomas was saying at the beginning um Pepsi's down about 20% from its peak but once it dropped 20% the stock went back up so it didn't really ever get into that bare Market uh territory bare markets are um less common but they're obviously more scary for investors and they also tend to be a little bit more short-lived Market Corrections on the other hand those are relatively frequent um and we're seeing in 2023 it's kind of like whack-a-mole they're just happening all the time I mean one stock goes down another stock goes up one sector goes down another one's going up and I think again um investors were looking for reasons to kind of take profits off the table rebalance their portfolios and a stock like Pepsi is kind of easy to do that with because you kind of have the expectation that earnings are going to go up and then eventually the stock price is going to go back up let's touch on their Q three results here a little bit um PepsiCo reported a solid quarter so what are the highlights here Thomas well so like the revenue was only as expected which is really the worst that can be said because that means High single digits uh that was offset by margin strength uh the companies's growing in all segments widening margins produce better than expected bottomline results and also guided favor favorably for next year they're looking for growth to be at the high end of their target range which is above the current consensus that should lead sentiment and the market higher did anything specific catch your attention here Chris you know not really um like Thomas said you know they reported about what I think it was 6% year-over-year Revenue growth and that's the kind of performance you expect from a blue chip defensive stock like Pepsi they make products and that consumers are going to need um all the time so you know regardless of what's happening in the economy they may be cons you know they may be u considered boring compared to like AI stocks but in times like these we talk about Pepsi a lot on this channel we talk about stocks like Pepsi at times like this that's why we talk about it because sometimes you don't really have to go hunting for growth it's hiding right there in plain sight and this is one of those examples for sure all right um Thomas if you would talk to us a little bit about pepsico's guidance for the future how does this impact the company's Outlook yeah so you know Pepi targets a five to six% long-term Revenue growth range and right now they're looking for growth to be at the high end of that range I think that they could possibly exceed that range given their brand strength and their lean into International markets um International markets and Emerging Markets are supposed to outperform next year so I see that as a Pepsi as a pretty solid play on that um at the same time margins are also expected to expand um earnings growth well almost uh double Revenue growth um I see this leading the market higher or at least uh helping the market sustain its current price levels all right and let's leave our viewers with this what do investors need to keep their eye on in the coming months regarding pepsic Co stock right so I think that pepsic co could raise their guidance again uh they might not do it before the next quarterly report but they might uh provide some pretty solid guidance for next year when they report Q4 results um so I'll be looking for that in the next the next report anything you want to add to that Chris you know not really again I think Pepsi is going to do what they do and that they they remind me of just one of those stocks they just do what they do uh as I agree with Thomas I wouldn't be surprised at all if they come in in the first part of next year and start raising that guidance a little bit more perfect well thank you so much for joining me on this latest PepsiCo update Chris and Thomas we appreciate you digging into the details so that we can report on this for our viewers,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,sjqAWzUu2mQ,2023-10-16T10:51:34Z,Rivian Stock Shows Strong Buy Factors Amid Shifting Investor Sentiment,Rivian,today we're diving into a conversation about rivan the electric vehicle company has been making headlines recently with its stock taking a hit but is this drop an opportunity for Savvy investors stick around to find out uh rivan doesn't seem to have many investors that are staying in the Middle Lane some people think that this company is on the FasTrack to bankruptcy others are thinking it's another Tesla there just doesn't seem to be many people who are kind of neutral on this stock um but Thomas you wrote an article that stirred up chatter on social media and you had talked about why you thought rivan was a good buy um so I kind of want to talk about that further here in fact you had listed five reasons why you thought investors should take a look at rivan um and that's because shares of rivian have plummeted more than 20% um following a debt offering announcement and a 30% drop from its 2023 highs um and so many investors are kind of wondering if this is the right time to get in so Thomas if you would please just I'm going to stop talking here and I want you to fill us in um for those that haven't had a chance to look at this article yet um which I'll link down below tell us about what's going on right so I think a lot of this decline is an overreaction um Short Selling certainly has played a part in it sentiment also plays a part but there's really been no fundamental change in the company's Outlook uh the debt offering was expected I think the worst that can be said was um a lack of tact uh the company has been criticized for just kind of blurting it out there announcing it sooner than expected and uh that took a toll on sentiment the market had a knee-jerk reaction and now we're looking at a buying opportunity rivan recently announced a 1.5 billion green debt offering many saw this coming I mean considering the financial demands of scaling up vehicle production um but tell us more about this if you would and uh even if investors were aware of this um and that this could happen what does it mean for the stock what this means for the stock is is a discounted price um the debt offering includes a chance for dilution but that dilution won't come for seven or eight years I believe and uh the 1.5 reduction in market cap if we do get delusion is more than three times the drop that we saw on the stock price so I think that the the chance of delusion which is slim has been more than priced into this market so what is the latest update on rivian's production performance then I mean particularly in Q3 and how does that compare to the analyst expectations all right so Q3 was better than expected and they only reaffirm guidance for the year in the eyes of the analyst that means that Q4 could be weaker than expected but I think that what this really means is that Q4 guidance is cautious if the company remains on track it should be able to exceed the now lowered analyst expection expectations for Q4 and outperform and that should be a catalyst for the market so and then this brings up the United Auto worker strike um you're saying that this could be an opportunity for rivan because smaller companies like rivan can become more popular and sell more cars when others aren't um is there anything else worth mentioning with that well yeah this is some chatter that I've been hearing from the analyst community and that's just uh the UAW strike is is about uh maintaining Workforce in hours and it's really targeted towards EV production the oems are leaning into EVS they're looking at Automation and AI uh reducing workforces and efficiency and that's really against the uaw's Mandate which is to ensure employment and hours worked so what I see happening and what the analysts see happening is the oem's kind of scaling back on their EV plans which opens the door for Ev automakers like rivan uh because rivan's already got production underway it's got a good chance to gain market share what can you tell our viewers um who are wanting to know more about the technical outlook for rivian are there expectations for a rebound in the near future the charts look good for a rebound uh the market started putting in a firm bottom I mean late last year it moved higher it's corrected and it's retested that bottom it's retesting support again um at a higher level um I think all we need are some posit positive Catalyst that help get the uh the market sentiment back in gear and that'll help get the market price to start moving higher again okay so Thomas all in all you think it might be a good time to load up on a few more shares of rivan am I correct I think now would be a decent time to buy a few more shares um the Outlook and the charts do look positive but I want to point out that there is no guarantee this stock will move higher it is an evem it is labor and cash intensive there are still hurdles to overcome uh but for investors with some risk tolerance I think that this is a viable uh stock opportunity all right so as rivan a Buy on shaken investor sentiment the answer isn't clearly cut um but it's essential to consider the long-term potential of the company so keep an eye out on upcoming developments especially their Q3 results due in early November,1.0,0.7

MarketBeat,hHC8PsDsKtE,2023-10-13T13:07:50Z,3 Quality Stocks On Track for Significant Dividend Increases,Schlumberger,today we're going to talk about three stocks that are paying you more than ever to own them we're talking about craft Hines Slumber and ocidental petroleum. Let's start with an oil services stocks that's seven out of 10 people mispronounce the name is Slumber there you go I'm not going to be one of the seven people that pronounce it wrong. Comment Slumber J down below if you're one of the seven or not. I think Slumber is a great pick for aggressive dividend growth. The company cut its dividend during the pandemic to preserve Capital nothing wrong with that lots of companies did it. They've been raising the dividend since then also good news but they haven't brought the dividend back to its previous Glory. Right now it's about 50% of what they were paying in 2019 which suggests a potential of 100% dividend growth. Right now Slumber J's Revenue into of its business has stabilized at the pre-pandemic level with margins that are about double so I see this company maybe not making a really huge increase but making some substantial increases over the next couple of years to get it back up to that previous level. Yeah I like I like Thomas's pick of of Slumber J. I think Slumber J might have a little bit of better valuation than Slumber but you know SLB is a good pick anyway. Yeah I think the whole oil fill Services sector is pretty good right now but SLB definitely stands out for the dividend growth perspective. I hope our viewers got a lot out of this video I mean if anything they know how to pronounce Slumber now right.,1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,hHC8PsDsKtE,2023-10-13T13:07:50Z,3 Quality Stocks On Track for Significant Dividend Increases,Occidental Petroleum,today we're going to talk about three stocks that are paying you more than ever to own them we're talking about craft Hines Slumber and ocidental petroleum. Our next stock is again another oil um and energy sector and it's a Warren Buffett favorite here it's ocidental petroleum guys why oxy is is there a theme here with oil stocks yeah right there is many reasons to want to buy ocidental right now. Warren bucklet is only one of them he's buying the stock for all the reasons that we're going to talk about today and more but mostly what that is is uh cash flow um debt reduction and capital returns. The spike and oil prices provided oxy with some serious cash flow. They had cut their dividend also to preserve Capital they haven't brought it back all the way yet they're using that that cash flow to pay down their debt they bought back a double digit amount of their preferred stock um and that spurred Warren Buffett to start buying. So the cash flow and the debt reduction suggest that oxy could absolutely increase its dividend back to the previous level I think they're probably going to focus on that debt for a little while first but over the next couple of years I would expect to see some pretty aggressive dividend increases. Chris do you have any extra thoughts on oxy here no not not really I mean Thomas hit it this isn't we've talked about oxy a lot but I think there's a reason for that and that's people get confused and they think that oxy is just a a buffet stock and it's not this is a valuation story what I particularly like about oxidal right now is that it's undervalued in relation to the sector it's not just undervalued Rel in relative Rel relative to the broader market like some other oil stocks and that's I think where the real opportunity lies along with the dividend increases of course.,1.0,0.95
MarketBeat,hHC8PsDsKtE,2023-10-13T13:07:50Z,3 Quality Stocks On Track for Significant Dividend Increases,Kraft Heinz,today we're going to talk about three stocks that are paying you more than ever to own them we're talking about craft Hines Slumber and ocidental petroleum. All right well moving on this third one is not an oil stock we'll switch it up here a little bit um it's a consumer staples pick so we have discussed it before um that's craft hindes Thomas I know you love this stock so much so that whenever I hear news about this stock I think what would Thomas do. Well craft hindes has been an interesting story for many years I love it because of the turnaround aspect of the valuation and the yield I see this stock producing a significant um multiple expansion as well as already paying almost 5% with an outlook for a res resumption of dividend growth so right now uh I mean really everywhere I look is a reason to buy craft the value the dividend the analysts are buying it institutions are buying it there is an outlook for growth and margin expansion all suggest that it it it's a viable stock now in terms of the dividend and dividend growth they haven't been increasing their distribution since 2018 I think when they cut it during the reason why is so cheap right now um but the Outlook is for the dividend dividend increases to come back maybe beginning next year uh the Outlook right now is for only a penny increase but I think that would be a big sign a big vote of confidence in favor of um of management and the company's turnaround um and so even even without balance sheet Improvement the company's earnings have been growing the payout ratio is coming down uh there definitely is a possibility an opportunity for craft to increase its dividend in the next year and that will be a catalyst uh to unlock that price multiple expansion. Chris you and I actually spoke about this stock um recently on one of our videos talking about some Warren Buffett stocks so do you have anything to add with that um you know this is a stock where and Thomas alluded to this you see this stock and you say there's some things that investors can look at and they can say I'm not really that excited about it but there's a reason why analysts are recommending it there's a reason why institutions are buying it not just Warren Buffett but overall institutions are buying it and it's one of those opportunities where you know I kind of feel like it's Our obligation to point investors in a certain direction we're saying there's a reason why they're doing that and this is an opportunity that you might not want to pass up while it's here and it's it's trading at a pretty attractive valuation.,1.0,0.95
MarketBeat,hHC8PsDsKtE,2023-10-13T13:07:50Z,3 Quality Stocks On Track for Significant Dividend Increases,Halliburton,I like Halbert in this sector they're a company that has recently announced that they're using digital and Automation Services to lower their capex spend and increase their free cash flow which will mean Ching they'll probably be increasing their own dividend in the next quarter or two. I think Slumber J might have a little bit of better valuation than Slumber but you know SLB is a good pick anyway.,0.8,0.7
MarketBeat,PuCPc3IcKmg,2023-10-08T20:58:40Z,Stock Market Update 10/9/23 | Higher Interest Rates for a Longer Time,PepsiCo,First one I want to talk about um coming this week is one that I know you love uh PepsiCo um you know the trend line on Pepsi or PepsiCo uh is up up up although the the prices recently have pulled back to that trend line what are you expecting there what do you expect to see uh and our PepsiCo shareholders going to be happy uh come Tuesday morning I think that they will be happy come Tuesday Morning uh so Pepsi stock has corrected about 20% over the last two month that's pretty pretty huge that's driven by you know fears of slowing demand uh fears of consumers shifting down to cheaper products but what's happened is that the uh analysts have lowered their estimates the bar is set really low we're still looking for growth there is a high possibility for outperformance in a company that's still growing and is a healthy dividend payer uh Pepsi's trading at the lowest p&amp; in years while also paying the highest yield in years so I don't think that it will take very much for a bottom to get put into place if we get a solid report we may see a pretty vigorous rebound,1.0,0.7
MarketBeat,PuCPc3IcKmg,2023-10-08T20:58:40Z,Stock Market Update 10/9/23 | Higher Interest Rates for a Longer Time,Delta,Delta's coming this week... let's go with Delta first this is one that we did a video on previously uh we liked Delta back uh when we did the video based on uh the fact that uh they were selling more premium seats uh upping that Revenue but now we've got fuel cost cost involved and and Delta could you know go down right now based on just the the cost of fuel what do you got on that the Delta also corrected pretty severely since we did that video and that's because right after we published a video oil prices started to spike and soon after that Delta warned about margins so now in the report we're looking for another solid gain in revenue and a gain in earnings as well but the question is uh how how has oil cut into margins and what's the Outlook um it's possible that Delta will outperform and reinvigorate the market but it's equally possible that Rising inflation and um margin pressure will keep the stock down,1.0,-0.1

You're going to write about dominoes this week at least that's what you put in your uh uh submissions uh to write about this week [Music] um is is Domino something that that people follow um uh widely follow to get a gauge on what's going on uh inside the markets yeah I don't know about that but Domino's is a pretty healthy uh food company um they're still growing they have good margins that pays a pretty sizable dividend um but right now the concern with that one is the these new diet drugs like wovi um it's possible I think there's some evidence that uh eating habits are shifting and it's possible that fast food like Domino's could could suffer for it,1.0,-0.2

MarketBeat,y9a9dsn7uFU,2023-10-05T12:30:39Z,Warren Buffett Stocks Moving into the Buy Zone,Kraft Heinz,those are Kraft Heinz Coca-Cola and Capital One so everyone watching you're going to want to stick around as we're going to provide insights on each of these stocks so let's Jump Right In so Warren Buffett didn't build his portfolio through a rags to riches story of picking a lucky penny stock his strategy more so involves buying and holding stocks for the long term I don't even know where to start on this Chris maybe we should make Thomas proud and start with craft Heinz that guy just loves that stock um but fill me in here if you would in your recent article for Market B you had mentioned that craft is in the middle of an aggressive turnaround so what indicators suggest that it might be moving in the right direction okay so thanks for fallacy thanks for having me on um so craft Heinz the story here is price versus value um and in this case um there's been some concern among investors that they're not getting the value for the price they're paying for the stock which the price isn't necessarily that high uh the stock doesn't look to be extremely overvalued but the stock has been trading sideways for about two years and investors are starting to get a little bit frustrated about that um the company recently beat analyst estimates for revenue and for earnings and that's good uh however some people are commenting that that was due to um consumers paying higher prices for the goods that they bought not that they were buying more Goods so and that's kind of a story you see playing out in some of the consumer areas where you're seeing that higher volumes but you're seeing they're paying more for the items they're paying for that's due to inflation so there's also concern that the company's not paying down their debt quite quickly enough which is holding back earnings and even Warren Buffett has commented that he may have overpaid for Kraft Heinz even though he helped engineer the merger between the two companies having said that um I'm always more interested in what investors do more than what investors say and in this case Warren Buffett has not uh has not shown any inclination to decrease the stake in Kraft Heinz certainly not to dissolve it so he seems to be a firm hold on the stock believing that there's better days ahead I think that where the stock is settling in right now it's an attractive point for investors to consider the stock,0.95,0.2
MarketBeat,y9a9dsn7uFU,2023-10-05T12:30:39Z,Warren Buffett Stocks Moving into the Buy Zone,Coca-Cola,those are Kraft Heinz Coca-Cola and Capital One so everyone watching you're going to want to stick around as we're going to provide insights on each of these stocks so let's Jump Right In so Warren Buffett didn't build his portfolio through a rags to riches story of picking a lucky penny stock his strategy more so involves buying and holding stocks for the long term all right so now let's talk about one of the one of the Coca-Cola course so I was looking around on Market beat this morning checking out the stock profile for this and I noticed that the stock is down 11 year to date as we're recording which I'd like you to touch on but this is a true dividend King I mean they have raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years so clearly it's rewarding investors um but what else do you see when you look at the stock you know I think I think you've pretty much nailed it Lacey um there's just not a lot not to like about Coca-Cola um you know it's one of those stocks that you always say when in doubt zoom out and if you just look at the stock over the years it just the trend is up and I know some investors hate to hear that I know a lot of Traders hate to hear that but when you're thinking about buying into Warren Buffett stocks Blue Chip stocks you're not looking for the stocks that are the moon shots you're looking at the steady Eddies the reliables the ones that you say the stock is here and in five years I expect it to be here and in 10 years I expect to be here that's what you're getting with Coca-Cola to me the Stock's trading on 23 times earnings that could be considered a little high but not overly concerning it's a stock that deserves a premium valuation because it's a premium brand so I think you if you're an investor you look at a 10 to 12 pullback on the stock that's a buying opportunity especially with the dividend it's as reliable as Coca-Cola's when in doubt zoom out I like that Chris I'll be keeping that in mind,0.98,0.8
MarketBeat,y9a9dsn7uFU,2023-10-05T12:30:39Z,Warren Buffett Stocks Moving into the Buy Zone,Capital One,those are Kraft Heinz Coca-Cola and Capital One so everyone watching you're going to want to stick around as we're going to provide insights on each of these stocks so let's Jump Right In so Warren Buffett didn't build his portfolio through a rags to riches story of picking a lucky penny stock his strategy more so involves buying and holding stocks for the long term so then there's Capital One Chris this is kind of a difficult time to invest in financial stocks isn't it um but even with that being the case investors are um and with investors that were fleeing the bank stocks earlier this year um Buffett was still buying shares despite all that so I mean as we know interest rates are at a 40-year high so Capital One earnings are um while there are being down year over year that doesn't really come as a shock so what can we look at um for investors what are we looking ahead to yeah so you're you're again at least you you nailed it you know I try I'm learning from you guys there's a there's a clear Trend you see in the company's earnings reports as interest rates want higher the company was missing on earnings they weren't just missing on earnings by a little bit they were missing on it by a pretty hefty margin uh and that was a case for about four consecutive quarters they reversed that a little bit in the last quarter um here's another example of don't listen to necessarily what investors are saying look at what they're doing and I didn't I I'll be honest um before I really wrote My article I wasn't familiar with Capital One as a Warren Buffett stock and there's a reason for that he didn't actually initiate his position until the first part of 2023. so right when Bank stocks were getting whacked at their hardest that's when he decided to um enter a position initiate a position in Capital One um and he did that at the same time that he upped his stake in Bank of America and then in the second quarter he increased his stake in Capital One so again I think this is a situation where that tells me Buffett believes that the company has a good balance sheet it trades it about eight times earnings it pays a good dividend and all those things you start checking off the boxes of yeah that's why Warren Buffett buys stocks because they fundamentally sound they pay a strong dividend they and he expects to see earnings growth um obviously there's some risks in this sector potential uh charge offs as consumers May default on their credit card payments but I believe Buffett's signaling that he believes Capital One has the type of balance sheet they can weather that stocks looks very intriguing to me good to know,0.97,0.7
MarketBeat,CcujKhGYjFs,2023-10-04T12:30:07Z,Top 5 Pharmaceutical Stocks for Your Watchlist,Bristol Myers Squibb,first on our list is Bristol Myers Squibb and not really making me take notice with this one but maybe you can change my attention towards that what do you have for us okay so I'll kick this off uh you know there's there are reasons why some investors are hesitant to invest in Bristol-Myers squibbs stocks down about 19 this year some of that has to do with the fact that they've got some drugs with expiring patents the last earnings report was kind of a clunker fair enough uh but we're looking at 2023 and in 2023 drug Discovery is really the name of the game uh AI is going to be a big part of that as pharmaceutical companies are looking to make the drug Discovery faster and more efficient without compromising on safety and that's where Bristol Myers and their partnership with Schrodinger comes in uh the company has a a number of drugs in their pipeline this is going to theoretically this will uh in speed up that process of getting those drugs through the clinical trial phase it doesn't mean they don't do the clinical trials it just means they can get the drugs into the clinical trial phases faster that allows investors to start looking at some attractive fundamentals it trades at just eight times forward earnings um and it has an attractive dividend with a yield around 3.8 percent you know right now I would probably think of Bristol Myers as a hold uh particularly if you already you know if you own the stock and you're collecting that dividend but I also think that investors should have this on their watch list as a potential Buy okay fine Chris maybe you did push my attention towards it just a little bit I'll be keeping an eye on that one thanks to you,1.0,0.4

MarketBeat,CcujKhGYjFs,2023-10-04T12:30:07Z,Top 5 Pharmaceutical Stocks for Your Watchlist,Johnson & Johnson,but next up is jnj I've seen many articles on J J written for um Market beads by you Chris um and I know you like it but it's not a recent development as we know so tell us why are you so bullish on J J yeah I mean Johnson Johnson I I guess you'd say I mean it's not a hill I'm dying on but I continue to believe that the stock is a buy or at least it certainly it belongs on a list of pharmaceutical stocks that should be on the top of investors watch lists um the company continues to beat on earnings and revenue not only sequentially but year over year um and it's got a dividend that yields about three percent right now analysts are lukewarm on it stocks down about 10 for the year um one of the things that's concerning investors is now that there has been a resolution to the long-running talc lawsuit uh how is the company going to pay for that and there's concerns that there could be a dividend cut coming down the pipe in the future so far there's nothing about the company's earnings and revenue again that suggests that's imminent that is a concern though that's hanging over the stock I'll also grant you that the stock looks a little expensive right now it's trading at about 31 times earnings at a time when the s p is trading around 20 to 22 times earnings so that's a little expensive but if you look at the forward earnings it's down around 15 and that's a lot more attractive as far as investors go great insights on that one uh thanks for sharing about Johnson and Johnson,1.0,0.5
MarketBeat,CcujKhGYjFs,2023-10-04T12:30:07Z,Top 5 Pharmaceutical Stocks for Your Watchlist,Pfizer,Thomas I think most of our viewers would have guessed Pfizer would be on this list the vaccine was a catalyst obviously but that Revenue has now come down so what can you tell us about this yeah right Pfizer Pfizer is another great name in Pharma and right now it's a value compared to its peers it trades about 10 times earnings and it's yielding above five percent like with the other Pharma companies it's facing a patent Cliff too but its pipeline is robust and it's got a fair number of new products coming out that should help to offset that um as you mentioned the real concern now is the coveted Cliff uh covet sales dropped significantly revenues down about 50 percent year over year but better than expected uh within that um the non-covered business is still growing so that fundamental aspect is in is in good shape um the stock is trading at a multi-year low and well below the analysts low price Target so I think there's nothing but upside uh Pfizer is a buy,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,CcujKhGYjFs,2023-10-04T12:30:07Z,Top 5 Pharmaceutical Stocks for Your Watchlist,Merck,all right last name on this list that we're talking about today is Merrick um it's an old established name that never seems to go out of favor or does it uh Chris why don't you fill us in on this uh so again yes Works an established name for for Merc uh it's all or at least mostly about katruda which is its Blockbuster oncology drug um there's good news and bad news here the good news is um Katrina continues to be approved for different types of cancers which is good because we've been talking about a patent Cliff well this extends the patents for katruda into different categories longer that means more exclusive opportunities for revenue and earnings for Merck the bad news is right now uh I suppose is that katruda's kind of under the watchful eyes of regulators who are looking to limit the amount that they can charge or that they can charge for Medicare patients so there could be some cost pressures coming in that regard uh bigger picture with Mark what I'm seeing is they've got I think 30 drugs that are in phase three clinical trials I think they've got a total of 80 drugs that are in phase two clinical trials that's an enormous enormous Pipeline and that means they've got a pretty much steady stream of drugs that are going to be coming online within the next year two years to me Merc just looks like a buy right now there's just so much opportunity here with the stock and like I said keytruda it's an oncology drug at a time when um the current administration's making a big push as a moon shot to find a cure for cancer kind of a no-brainer one here all right Merck great insights I had to say that one again because I think I pronounced it Merrick and we know that people are going to come for me in the comments for that one so my apologies,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,heJCRBLaK3E,2023-10-02T12:49:42Z,Cintas is a Quality Buy and Hold Forever Stock at Any Price,Cintas,if you've been looking for a high quality dividend growth stock that can weather Market storms you've come to the right place Cintas is a true Powerhouse in the investment world and we're about to uncover why let's get into it welcome back Thomas you had just released a article for markipee all about Cintas so that's what we're going to talk about today you're claiming it as a quality buy and hold forever stock at any price and it's a high quality dividend growth stock so I just took a quick glance at the chart that was posted in that article and I wanted to jump on a video as soon as possible and discuss it so tell us more yeah right that chart really says it all as far as the Buy and Hold quality of the stock and we'll look at that in a little bit but I've been interested in Cintas for like 20 years or more ever since my days as a chef it's a Well entrenched player in business services and as far as Hospitality goes it's the people that does your laundry and brings you towels and brings you Band-Aids and burn cream now the company is among the best run on Wall Street management has been incredibly foresightful in its pursuit of growth while maintaining the balance sheet um part of the growth includes uh robust Capital returns in the forms of dividends and share repurchases as far as the pandemic goes the pandemic was a real boost for this company and the entire labor Services industry because there was a lot of consolidation not only with the labor services companies but also with the employers who are doing the hiring so what happened for Centos is they increased the number of clients they have and their clients have since then increased the number of employees they've had which provided a double Tailwind for business growth yeah so regarding the dividend this company is a dividend Aristocrat with 40-year history of increases and the power to continue increasing its dividend for at least another decade or two well back to your Chef days Thomas that might have to be a new segment on Market beat recipes cooking with Thomas we'll see about that um but can you highlight um some things about their recent report and along with that Thomas you have mentioned that this is one of the stocks that you can buy at any price and so typically that means that it's a good long-term investment regardless of market price um but surely that doesn't mean that people really do feel comfortable purchasing at any price so can you just kind of tell us how can investors navigate that we'll right this stock is unlikely to produce a significant correction so really any pullback in price action is good um so what investors are going to want to do is just wait and look for any time that the price does pull back like you don't want to buy at the Peaks that's going to whittle away your your cost savings but if you continue to buy this stock periodically in small amounts when there are prices Corrections and price weaknesses you will be a winner over time all right that's very helpful thanks for explaining that for us now tell us a little bit more about that report yeah so the results were a little mixed the top line was only as expected but it did show nine percent growth uh the best news of the report were that margins expanded more than expected and produced a solid beat on the bottom line um so the cat the results aren't really a catalyst for a rally but there are no reason to shed the stock so the price weakness after the report looks like a buying opportunity are an analysts and institution are backing this stock so why is this significant so analysts and institutions represent the bulk of invested money in the stock market where they go the market follows and prices rise both the analysts and institutions have been buying this stock for years uh the post-released activity includes one price Target reduction but three price Target increases and even the price Target reduction is above the current consensus what this is telling me is that the uptrend in Centos will continue and that it is likely to set another new high this year all right let's take a look at the technical outlook here Thomas that's your expertise but what is happening on the charts you had mentioned that Cintas experienced a pullback so can you explain to us what does that mean for investors and is this a cause for concern well let's look at the chart and what I will say is that this price pullback is absolutely not a cause for concern to investors what we have here is a periodic correction within a strong uptrend that should result in another buying opportunity I don't think we're going to get a 10 or a 20 correction but we could get a five to ten percent correction that puts the stock price down around the 420 to 430 level and I think that would be a good Target entry point for new money fantastic insights today Thomas it's clear that Cintas is a company with a solid track record and a promising future thank you so much for joining us today we're going to catch you in the next one thanks Thomas,1.0,0.85

MarketBeat,z7hepoXI4ss,2023-09-19T10:54:19Z,GameStop: Reasons to Buy or Sell? What You Need to Know,GameStop,"let's talk GameStop today there's reasons to buy of course reasons to sell comment down below let us know which one you're leaning towards let's get started guys welcome back today we're discussing one of the most popular names in the industry game stock it's a stock that started the meme stock craze back in 2021 and after that suddenly the term short squeeze was in play everywhere. Thomas you had wrote an article recently where you outlined reasons GameStop could pop and reasons why it wouldn't and I want to get into some of that today with our viewers. The results were pretty decent we had top and bottom line up performance driven by the company's diversification and efforts for efficiency. Margins widened on efficiency a little bit of sales leverage most importantly the company's loss narrowed from over a hundred million dollars to under 5 million dollars which is a significant change and puts them dangerously close to profitability. Chris, I'm gonna go out on a limb here but GameStop is a stock you watch for entertain purposes only right? I have concerns about the company just from a kind of how are they going to make money sort of perspective. The best thing and the worst thing that happened in GameStop was the short squeeze back in 2021, and there's some traders that are very addicted to it and believe that that's going to happen again for them with GameStop. That legendary short squeeze wasn't the company's fault, wasn't it based on the company's fundamentals? Not totally, analysts were souring on the stock because of the company's business model but the whole short squeeze took on a life of its own and that was completely disconnected from the business. The problem for me is when I look at the company just from a standpoint of how do they make money, how are they going to make money in the future, I don't see a really strong story. They're trying to make a difficult pivot and I give them credit for that it's just not going quite the way they planned. I'm not suggesting that the company is going to go bankrupt; when I look at their earnings results I do see that the revenue is improving and the earnings are getting very close to profitability and with fruit management they may even get there. But I just don't see it, there's nothing with GameStop right now that I see that makes me say that's something that they do better than any other competitor. Thomas, why don't you talk to us about the balance sheet here, you had said it's still in solid condition with no immediate danger of collapse but that's not promising is it? The company's not in danger of any kind of immediate collapse or going bankrupt but there are some problems cash burn can't go on forever if they don't regain profitability there is an end in sight to the business. Assets are becoming impaired while liabilities incrementally increase and that puts the company in a bad position as far as the mix goes. Hardware sales were flat, software sales are up, Collectibles being down that's a really bad sign, Collectibles are supposed to be the company's growth Avenue and it ain't growing. A lot of the bottom line strength was due to inventory reduction. Chris, so it seems that the analysts have no love for GameStop, why are they so hesitant to jump on board? It's not only that the analysts have no love for GameStop, there's just very few analysts that even cover the stock anymore which is telling in itself. All of them give the stock either a sell or a strong sell rating. The Company's trying to make a difficult pivot at a time when technology is LeapFrog of the company and they're trying to catch up in an era that they just it's going to be very hard for them to establish themselves. To me this just looks like a stock that should be a penny stock, analysts kind of agree with that, they have a price target of about six dollars as a high target. Directors at GameStop are buying back shares, but it seems The Insider executives are selling, so there's a balance here, directors see something execs don't so there's no conviction in that market that I can tell. GameStop sent out a letter to shareholders encouraging board members and executives to buy shares, which isn't the same as buying because they're convinced of the company's fundamentals. It seems that this legendary meme stock continues to be the subject of Fascination in the market today and while there may be some positive indicators it's pretty clear that we are remaining cautious on this one.",1.0,-0.5

Thomas another stock that seemingly always on the trending stock list is meta probably there's some people watching that love some that don't um but give us the news you have a minute starting now. all right so meta to me is kind of an Underdog Story if you remember a year or two ago they were struggling with user growth and AD growth and consumer confidence uh since then they came out swinging and really koed the naysayers though started with the year of efficiency um they got the analyst back involved with the market since then they've cut cost they've improved margins they've seen user growth return they've seen ad metrics improved significantly it launched a new project uh threads and the analysts are loving it I think all else aside right now it's the analysts that are driving this stock higher it's seeing a steady series of price Target increases new uh new coverage and upgrade since the spring um the next Catalyst will be the Q3 earnings I think that the stock is definitely a buy but the risk I see right now is that because there's so much expectation we could see an oracle like event where the stock sells off significantly before it continues higher so I'm going to say buy but it's a risky buy and you might want to wait for the next dip.,1.0,0.8

Thomas next up is Microsoft just a guess here but AI is involved here right tell us what you know. right so Microsoft is another great story in Tech this is a blue chip tech company that's been shifting its focus from Old School tradition traditional Tech to the modern new school Tech which is the cloud and AI uh not only is Microsoft working to advance the AI industry but it's also working to embed AI across its own infrastructure uh platforms and services are being rolled out pretty regularly uh the company has a clear path forward and it's planning to ramp spending over the next four to five quarters and I think that's really where the opportunity is uh so the long-term opportunity is not so much this the ramp in spending now but how that ramp and spending will start bearing fruit over the next year or so um the analysts also like Microsoft they see it moving higher it's one of our top rated stocks on the on the platform my market platform um I think it's definitely a buy but I have the same reservations as I do with with meta and that's just that with expectations so high even with a solid report in Q3 there could be a selloff before the stock moves higher.,1.0,0.8

We told you over the weekend that we would be here to cover the latest Oracle earnings report. Don mentioned Oracle would be a good buy by the dip candidate. Oracle grows almost nine percent led by the cloud. While that sounds good, the stock fell in after-hours trading and again this morning. This fall is good news because it's shaving 10 off the price of a high quality Blue Chip Tech stock. This company is growing by double digits and it's emerged as a central figure in the AI Revolution. Let's move on to margins and cash flow for jumping into Oracle. The Legacy businesses contracted by 10 but the whole Enterprise grew by nine percent led by the cloud, and within that, margins and cash flow improved. Right now in AI, Oracle is making money. New apps and new services will drive another wave of spending and revenue growth for Oracle. Analysts are still on board with Oracle. Oracle is riding a wave above new coverage, boosted price targets, and upgrades that has the stock trading at a new high. Oracle has sold off ten percent on that dubiously bad news but it's already showing signs of support at these long-term moving averages. The Oracle Market gapped up after q1 when it became apparent that Oracle was going to be an AI leader. This sell-off is nothing more than a consolidation of this move. I see the stock moving Sideways from here and regaining the uptrend fairly soon. There are several compelling reasons to view Oracle as a buying opportunity: the nearly nine percent growth led by the cloud sector, strong margin expansion, improved free cash flow all indicate the potential for long-term success.",1.0,0.85

There is a lot of competition here and one of the things that's been weighing on pins price action over the last year is that it's lean into the sports book basically failed um I forget the name of of what they call it now but it's been losing market share to DraftKings so the recent announcement is that uh Penn is going to team up with Disney and Rebrand its Sportsbook to ESPN and that should be a driver of business and help them regain market share in this event. well there you have it these companies May face some headwinds and hurdles but to our viewers keep on season these opportunities in the market um the stocks may just hold the key to promising returns so don't forget to like And subscribe for stock market updates as always check out the resources I've linked for you down below and it includes our latest new and free report seven AI stocks to invest in leave us a comment down below let us know what you'd like us to discuss next and until then we'll chat soon thanks guys thank you,1.0,0.3

MarketBeat,G3CdNgI3F1I,2023-09-07T12:30:08Z,3M Stock | Ready for a Rebound,3M,today we're diving into 3M as an investment opportunity despite the challenges it's been facing there's a buzz of excitement in the market stick around as we explore key factors that make 3M an exciting speculation the risks it's tackling and why now might be the time to invest let's get into it let's Jump Right In Here and discuss the news around 3M so legal issues seem to be a recurring theme with them there's been years of litigation going on I believe they recently reached a settlement the board I think still has to approve the settlement for forever chemicals but it the settlement for the the earplugs lawsuit was settled and the key takeaway from that settlement is that the damages are about half what the market was expecting uh taken together it removes a large amount of uncertainty from the stock uh regarding future future profitability and the dividend now analysts can start to evaluate 3M stock based on what the profits are going to be going forward and like Thomas said the settlement came in for significantly less than what people were expecting so that should be good news it's important to note that I think in addition to what Thomas said about the board I think there are 22 states that are challenging the courts ruling on the forever chemical settlement so that may turn out to be Much Ado About Nothing but it's something that the company's litigation may not be over quite yet on that point Dividends are always a Hot Topic among investors um Thomas what's 3m's dividend situation can investors count on consistent payouts I'm just kind of curious how sustainable this dividend growth might be given all these settlements well you know there is some concern that the payout will be affected by the settlements but the company has been preparing for this for years it's got cash reserves and the cash flow is sufficient for now I don't think that there's a really a near-term risk of a cut and that is backed up by the chatter I'm hearing from the analyst you know I'm not ruling a cut out it is very possible uh but it looks pretty safer now but even with a 50 cut the payout would still be nearly three percent which is pretty high for a dividend King and it's trading at only 12 times earnings I mean it wouldn't be a king with a cut but it's got a pretty fair substantial history of consistent payments and I think that goes a long way yeah I mean I agree with Thomas that three of them has mostly positive fundamentals when you look at things my concern is that the company is already showing declining income growth and analysts are revising their estimates lower and none of that has to do with the lawsuits especially on the income side it has everything to do with the economy and the direction the economy is going in the dividend is what's kept a lot of investors interested in the stock over the time of the period of this litigation I agree with Thomas that any potential dividend cut shouldn't be a big deal but Dividends are psychologically important to investors and it may make some income-oriented investors a little skittish and start to look for other options if that does happen but I agree with Thomas I don't think anything is imminent on that but it's something to watch for down their own so as we know value is a crucial aspect of investing um what sets 3M apart in terms of value how does that compare to other companies we might be looking at Thomas well you know value is a consideration and uh 3M right now is a pretty interesting speculation on valuation and yield within that you do have to assume there's not going to be a dividend cut but 3M pays uh six percent right now when it's trading about 12 times earnings that's a substantial discount compared to the broad market and to your average dividend Kings so looking at this from the perspective that 3M might be turning a corner the stock could be looking at a multiple expansion uh just based on more clarity and lack of uncertainty yeah one thing Thomas has always known in the past that a stock chart tells a story and when 3M started their litigation this was around 2018 and the stock's down over 50 over that time and that tells me that investors only have so much patience for 3M as a value stock they're looking for a little bit more growth than what they're seeing once again though the known is better than the unknown uh that's the good news I think the bad news is the 2023 economy is different than the 2018 economy it's going to be interesting to see if 3M can now make that you know make that pivot and show that now that this is in the rear view mirror they can become a company that delivers both the dividend growth and the share price growth further further investors touch on something else that um I've been seeing in the news and Thomas you wrote about this in your article that I'll of course link down below but I hear a spin-off is in the works can you tell me more about that um what's the potential impact of that yeah 3M is spinning off its med tech unit uh the unit is worth about 8.5 billion in annual revenue which is low for that group that suggests a growth opportunity that a standalone company could focus on and then there is also the value proposition you know 3M is trading at 12 times earnings and most of the med techs trade at least four handles higher than that so the spin-off should be able to unlock value for um for shareholders but also it will help the company raise Capital boost up the balance sheet and help ensure the dividend safety Chris do you think that 3M can expect a bump from that um I I'm not sure uh and my the reason why I would Express caution on that is is again Johnson and Johnson that we talked about um I was excited about Johnson Johnson clearing up their litigation earlier this year because I thought yeah that's going to give the stock a lift but then they were spinning off Kent View and their stocks done kind of a whole lot of nothing can View's done pretty well but Jonathan Johnson hasn't done that well so I don't know it might be good for whatever the spin-off unit is for 3M whether or not it's good for 3M that maybe yeah right you wait for a couple of quarters here it should be good for 3M shareholders though and I hear you on the J J and J angle but Jonathan and Johnson trades It 33 times earnings compared to you know 3m's 12 times earnings so looking at this thing from the perspective that 3M is trying to turn a corner and trying to pinpoint a bottom I think that that now is a as good a time as any for investors interested in 3M to start nibbling on the stock all right well as we discussed in this video 3M is navigating challenging Waters with confidence and the market is showing signs of a rebound here,1.0,0.6

The leader right now in computer vision really is amberella. amberella came to the spotlight many years ago uh riding the the coattails of GoPro their chips are awesome for cameras they were uh really dedicated to um to imagery but but they've shifted from Imaging to Edge Computing and Ai and computer vision um so it's really like a dual or a triple play on advancing the technology the mass Market embedding of AI into consumer products and the iot the iot will be a tremendous source of demand for CV product and appliances because all those connected devices are going to need to be able to see to some degree. now amberella Q2 results were mixed and the guidance was weak but normalization within the market is at hand and growth is expected to return next year. amberella already has an entrenched business with industrial and Automotive in markets which is the long-term play. right now the stock is down on those results but analysts and institutions are buying the dip and it seems like the bottom is in. Chris what are you looking at with amella? you know I was looking at uh some interesting data on the company and it recently so as Thomas was talking about how it's changing and redesigning its cameras it recently replaced some of its traditional cameras with AI enabled cameras and those are already being used by over like a hundred of its customers and so I think that just goes to illustrate how quickly this sector is going to take off because of AI it's just int it's giving these companies like amberella a reason to go back to their customer base and say here's something that we're offering that has AI that these customers right now are showing a willingness to pay for. great insights on amella,0.95,0.7
MarketBeat,yftR67H977E,2023-09-05T12:30:26Z,5 Computer Vision Stocks | The Next Phase of AI,CEVA,we'll be discussing ambrella CA cognex light path and highmax. what's the next one here on your list CA it's another computer vision AI Focus company what do we need to know here Thomas? yeah well CA develops and licenses uh semiconductor and related Technologies one of the areas that it focuses on is AI um and computer vision. the products that it supplies are architecture Frameworks for other companies to build up their own AI Network works and so that's the the play with this stock. it's trying to monetize the development of AI more so than AI itself. Chris do you have anything else to add for this stock? yeah I mean the company licens basically licenses intellectual property in a cyclical market like semiconductors it's going to grow the most at the beginning of a cycle and since we could be entering the beginning of one now CA would be one to watch,0.95,0.6
MarketBeat,yftR67H977E,2023-09-05T12:30:26Z,5 Computer Vision Stocks | The Next Phase of AI,Cognex,we'll be discussing ambrella CA cognex light path and highmax. well let's take a closer look at cognic uh Thomas recent results have been week so why is this one on your list I mean I trust you I usually do um but I'm looking forward to your explanation here. right so cognex is a manufacturer of computer vision sensing devices it's already got established uh business with things like barcode scanners so uh it's just a matter of developing and advancing the technology U they're already embedding AI into some of their Frameworks. right and so like some some weakness this year but business has normalized above 2019 levels I see this one uh gaining momentum over the next year as more and more companies lean into Ai and AI applications. chis what are your thoughts on like the stock versus the company here I know you always have great insights on that comparison see see see Lacy this is where you're leaning into the caution see that's I'm cautious and you're leaning into that I like that see this is one where I like the company right now a little bit more than I like the stock the company's revenues earnings are down year-over-year for the last several quarters I'd like to see that turn around before I get too excited but yes this is one that you're going to be watching in this space,0.95,0.2
MarketBeat,yftR67H977E,2023-09-05T12:30:26Z,5 Computer Vision Stocks | The Next Phase of AI,LightPath,we'll be discussing ambrella CA cognex light path and highmax. so then there's light path a penny stock Thomas um Revenue doesn't seem to stick out to me here so what makes this one worth a look? yeah light path is certainly one of the riskier plays in this group it is a penny stock and like all of them none of them are really blue chip Tech plays they are working on The Cutting Edge of Technology uh but light path makes Optical components and lenses so so once the technology has advanced it will be one of the companies that is embedding it into into products that we use on a day-to-day basis um it's not a big company now it is kind of a swing for the fences play but it is a growth opportunity once computer vision begins to advance and gain traction. Chris what are your thoughts on the risk here? you know Thomas said life Pat's risky that's sure I mean just because it's a penny stock doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in it but it does mean that there's certain more risk involved than there would be if it wasn't. I really like some of the sectors that the company's involved in it's involved in the defense sector it's involved in healthcare and those are going to be very sticky sectors in terms of demand so I like that and if computer vision is going to have the the kind of explosive growth that we think it will those are the sectors that investors would be wanting to look at for where that growth will be,0.95,0.3
MarketBeat,yftR67H977E,2023-09-05T12:30:26Z,5 Computer Vision Stocks | The Next Phase of AI,Himax,we'll be discussing ambrella CA cognex light path and highmax. Last one on your list here Thomas is highmax technology this one has a dividend so of course I'm interested in learning more um what can you share about this high yield opportunity? yeah and this is a Semiconductor Company with an established business so it's a bit of a safer play on CV than some of these other stocks. its products include uh display and CV processors and they're included in things like smart doorbells people counters and other automated counting devices. as for the dividend it can be a high yield but it's erratic uh they pay out once a year and the board decides each year how much of earnings to pay based on the economic Outlook this year the payout ratio was a bit lower than usual but it's still a high uh a mid to high single digit distribution. Chris do you have anything to add on this company? you know as as we were just sitting here I was just thinking I mean this is sort of like your your um your alternative to light path it's almost like the exact opposite this is one where again growth slowing but like like Thomas said this isn't a new company it's a trade-off for investors you know you're going to um if you want the chance for Market beating growth you might have to go to a penny stock if you're going to have the risk that comes with you know if you're looking for a safer option himx may do that for you but it might not again have that same growth potential,0.95,0.1

MarketBeat,r6qgEPmXvME,2023-08-31T20:35:46Z,"Salesforce Earnings Unveiled: Surging Stock, Soaring Expectations",Salesforce,"Salesforce was expected to report a double-digit increase in year-over-year Revenue did they accomplish that they just released earnings last night let's dive in and take a look Chris Thomas welcome back so we were waiting for Salesforce to report last night let's discuss the results apparently investors in the market liked what they saw the stock is up in early trading today as we're recording. Well to me the report was a best case scenario for the company and for the stock, the report was fantastic. We've got top and bottom line beats, margin was better than expected, all driven by recent price increases, new products and penetration. Gross margin is up on Leverage spending is down, guidance was raised; everything about this aligns with Trends in the enterprise software group and it's coming from the industry leader. I think that CRM should have no problems sustaining its valuation over the next few years and I see it easily regaining all-time high price levels. I mean what a comeback story here, Salesforce. Investors hated Salesforce last year. It was down from whatever 300 a share in late November of 2021 and it fell all the way into like the 120s. It's up over 60 percent this year. A lot of Salesforce's growth this year to this point was due to the fact that the company was getting its costs under control. For now Salesforce is delivering on that, they're showing the fact that they've got products that customers want and are willing to pay for. The story is really coming down to the valuation. It's trading at evaluation that's a lot lower than some of the other Blue Tech Blue Chip tech companies and that earnings growth is growing at a rate above 10 if it can continue to do that getting back to where it was at the end of 2021 seems pretty likely so it's trading at 225 as we speak 300 over the next three years enough is what do you think about that right so I think that's a cautious estimate that's the fundamental Outlook and when you add that fundamental Outlook to the news and the market participation I think that 300 could be hit possibly by the end of the year early next year so as far as a trade goes there's a trade aspect to this play but also a long-term Outlook that kind of gives you a little bit of safety you know it might not go up as fast as you might think it will but over time the valuation Outlook certainly suggests that new all-time Highs are possible. Chris what about you again on that you know and that is that the 300 estimate may be too low it may be conservative I was looking at what some of the analyst sentiment was immediately after the earnings report right now everybody's boosting their price targets nobody's really boosting their price Target all the way to 300 so that's suggesting that next year or so they're not expecting it maybe to get all the way back up to 300 but you know that's that remains to be seen. Investors that bought the dip on Salesforce earlier this year Bravo. Is it a good buy already up 62? I think that depends to what Thomas just said if you believe that 300 price Target is Conservative then certainly you should be getting in right now if you think that maybe that's where it tops out I'm not sure if I like that as much as a long-term investor but as Thomas said there's probably a trade in there somewhere. Well like Chris was saying the analysts they haven't really put their targets up to 300 just yet but you have to look at the trend of results in the trend and sentiment. The analysts are leading the stock higher because Salesforce is leading the analysts Higher by outperforming expectations so if we assume that this trend continues there could be a catalyst in the next earnings report and then the next earnings report that gets the analysts to continue boosting their price targets and that would get the price up above 300 in the sooner case sooner stock the sooner scenario rather than the later scenario.",1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,14j0LhgJxE4,2023-08-24T14:21:29Z,Retail Earnings Point to More Economic Discomfort,Home Depot,what I find interesting about two of the stocks towns talked about Target and Home Depot um you know these were two of the the companies that were you know the Omni Channel Darlings of 2020 and 2021 and now they're struggling and I think it just goes to show you that when the economy gets tough you know having that tech only gets you so far I mean the Target stock price started falling for reasons that we don't need to get into here um but I think it did expose the fact that there was underlying problems in the business and that's what's showing up in the last two earnings reports they can't you know the the initial problems that might have led to the initial drop in the stock those will fade in time but it's revealed the fact that there are some problems in the underlying business and I think the stock is trying to get properly valued but I don't think it's there yet I don't I certainly don't think it's a buy yet and I think you know Home Depot as Thomas said it's been lagging behind lows all year and it's been sort of a head scratcher for me I'm like Lowe's is doing pretty well and Home Depot is just not it doesn't seem to be able to get out of its own way Home Depot to me it was pretty disappointing I mean they they contracted and they had mixed results um posted some strength in the bottom line right but they just reaffirmed guidance for the year so that means their strength has already been seen second half we couldn't expect it and I think that we're going to see a lot of that from a lot of the pure discretionary names so like winners are going to be non-discretionary players and off-price retailers but the pure discretionary names are going to suffer do you feel like uh Home Depot is going to behind Lo be behind Lowe's yet again yeah a Home Depot um I I think honestly it will because Lowe's presents a better value um and it's got a better exposure to the DIY in the consumer market and so people pulling back on those big tickets and on building and buying houses uh Lowe's is the one that will will benefit in that and that's an area Chris you've done uh more than one video I think,1.0,-0.7

MarketBeat,xs_UpxiVnVs,2023-08-10T20:49:30Z,Evolv | Under-The-Radar AI Stock Worth a Look,Evolv Technology,today we're talking about the groundbreaking world of evolved Technologies get ready because this under the radar AI Superstar is reshaping safety measures and redefining investment opportunities let's Dive In all right guys I'm excited to talk about evolve Technologies today Chris you're actually the one that brought this stock up the other day when we were discussing what video topics we wanted to do on the channel for the week um so of course I'm looking to you on this I'm curious to know how did you find this stock where did it come from what do investors need to know I started diving deeper into it and I realized there's a story here um that are investors might want to know about because it could be an under the radar AI play if you're a risk tolerant investor okay so it's an AI stock you're saying let me just stop for a moment and ask Chris we're recording this video now it's about 10 o'clock here and I've already heard the term AI over 25 times I mean clearly everyone can't be an AI winner here in my view um so why this one Chris okay so yes I will agree with you um the company has an AI driven solution um and I also agree with you that not every AI stock is going to be a winner I think right now there's going to be a um a thinning out and one of the things that I'm looking for is companies that are actually having a use case for AI that makes a lot of sense and in this case with evolve they have a first mover advantage in using AI to help detect hidden weapons let me explain that a little bit more um what the Company's trying to do is solve the problem maybe it's not a problem or maybe it's just an inconvenience of how to move people efficiently through metal detectors because right now the current metal detectors that are in use can't Dell a set of keys from a cell phone or a weapon and um as I started learning about this company I realized that there's a reason for that and that's many of the metal detectors that you see in place today aren't really metal detectors they're what they call millimeter wave scanners that look through clothing for metallic objects and however in order for these devices to get a really good look people have to follow certain procedures and we all know this from airports or courthouses or even stadiums empty in your pockets taking off your shoes putting the hands over the head all those kinds of things right do away with that and I'll be good exactly and that's evolves products are using AI to analyze radio frequency waves RF waves at sensor Gates and because they're using AI they're smart enough to distinguish between a weapon and other metallic devices and also because they're using AI they process this information 10 times faster than metal detectors so people can walk through their gates at full speed which is really intriguing that is intriguing for sure Thomas I kind of want you to jump in here I want to know more about your thoughts on this what do you think about evolve I mean have you heard about the company before we did a video on it I know I hadn't you're a little bit deeper into the stocks than I am though so I want to hear from you I hadn't heard about it until Chris brought it up and it certainly is interesting I mean the use case scenarios for this are near Limitless if they can prove to be effective and people can walk through at a pretty brisk Pace we can see these things on street corners around the world just you know protecting people's well-being but the thing is I think it might be easy to come up with a cheat um if that's possible they're going to go nowhere but if they prove effective it could be really huge for the company and for the industry I I agree with what Thomas is saying you know the company you talk about the total addressable market and investors speak the Tam and the company sees a 20 billion dollar market potentially in annual spending and they could be right I mean like Thomas saying you can look at airports you can look at stadiums you can unfortunately you have to include schools in there as well in fact one of the company's biggest contracts is with the Atlanta Public Schools they're using their screening solution in 15 middle schools and 21 high schools so this is potentially just a a huge Market I want to pause for just a second here um Thomas looking at you for some um more analysis on this but it sounds like it's a little bit too good to be true in my opinion I mean we have a groundbreaking technology here that can be useful in many cases we have a promising Market but the stock is trading around six dollars so what am I missing well right now we're still talking about a super small startup company it's technology has proven and there are some great examples of how it's being used today but there still isn't really widespread adoption I stress yet that could happen uh the company could blow up uh right now the revenue is below 100 million so there is potential for it to double multiple times based on the potential addressable Market however what I really see in this company is a potential takeover Target for a larger AI or security company sure kind of jumping back um to evolve here I kind of want to talk about the potential hurdles that we might face when we're gaining widespread adoption on this for this Innovative solution but Thomas what are the challenges that they need to overcome to achieve projected growth in Market presence well they really have to prove that they can stop bad things from happening like the current system isn't awesome but it stops weapons from getting where they shouldn't um I don't think like I said before I don't think it'll be hard for the bad guys to come up with some kind of a cheat uh just like with cyber security the bad guys are working just as hard as the good guys possibly harder to work around these security things so they can do their their bad things to society um if we can really get a good proven case but we're really stopping bad things from happening it'll be a huge boost for the company you're kind of making it sound like a superhero villain type story here Thomas it almost is that I mean it's a fight the good guys versus the bad guys right now it looks like the good guys have made an advanced step forward but it's a challenge to the bad guys what can we do to get around it sure all right well stay tuned this could be the start of something big we're going to be keeping our eyes on this hidden

MarketBeat,JAu72FqsozM,2023-08-01T12:30:11Z,3 Stocks Primed for Growth...Again,Nvidia,we'll discuss checkpoint software Technologies Nvidia and Qualcomm we'll even have a bonus pick at the end of the video so stay tuned for that let's Dive In Chris and Thomas great to have you back today I was chatting with our team the other day and we were discussing interests surrounding growth stocks again some of the bigger names we've seen have reversed and they're getting investors excited again so we have three on the list today that we're going to talk about we're talking about checkpoint software Nvidia and Qualcomm so these are stocks that are backed by solid fundamentals innovative business models and strong growth prospects as we know so to our viewers whether you're an experienced investor or you're just starting out these growth stocks should be on your radar so no worries there if you don't know what you're getting yourself into we're here to help all right let's get into the fun details now Thomas let's start start with checkpoint software so this one might be a surprise to some people but if you would just tell us what they do and what you're kind of seeing with this stock yeah right uh this isn't really a high growth company like some of the other cyber security stocks but it is a steady Growth Company uh they've been around for quite a while more than 30 years so it's not one of those Fly by Night up and coming like startup um on the some of the primary highlights of the Q2 report that I saw were um widening margins and share repurchases The Top Line Resorts the Top Line results were solid we have a small year-over-year growth but it was The Wider margins that led to better than expected earnings and checkpoint really is the leader amongst cyber security stocks for profitability and it uses its money to pay its shareholders uh the new repurchases or the repurchases during the quarter were worth two percent of the market cap and um Shares are down more than six and a half percent year over year that's pretty significant all right so Thomas let's assume that I want to be in on cyber security stocks why am I choosing checkpoint I mean you said yourself there's other names out there right well cyber security is pretty hot you know the cloud is getting bigger digital is getting bigger so the bigger that gets the more demand there's going to be for cyber security uh but checkpoint is amongst or is possibly the lowest value to other cyber security stocks and I think that it might experience a price multiple expansion you know cyber security cyber security is in demand but the spending's kind of been pushed off because of the economic environment but checkpoint is still set up to continue growing and it may be at an inflection point um within the results the drivers of growth or security subscriptions but product licenses fell uh security subscriptions are supposed to remain steady and product license is supposed to begin picking back up again so that should help reinvigorate the growth um now what kind of sets them apart from some of the other companies are the um the infinity platform and Harmony email which are productivity and security enhancing features that help kind of tie all the security monitoring into one place um and it it works well with Microsoft 360 Google workspace and all of the collaborative um you know internet apps so I think that it's going to have pretty pretty solid demand this year thanks for explaining all that to us Thomas so would you say this is a Buy Low candidate uh yeah that's the way that I see it awesome all right well Chris first of all I really enjoy your articles on Market beat as you know I invite everyone to follow Chris Along on Market beats I'll link that in the comments he has some great articles with great insights um but another pic I didn't expect when we were talking about doing this video is Qualcomm Chris is it a time for Qualcomm reversal well first of all thank you Lacey for those kind words um depending on how you look at it Qualcomm might have already reversed it's uh it's kind of a half empty half full situation uh stocks up about 12 for the year but it's still down about 19 over the last 12 months and even in 2023 um much of its gains have come in the last three months so before that it was kind of struggling a little bit um so Qualcomm is known primarily in the chip sector for being part of the 5G growth uh it's known especially because of its contract with Apple to produce chips for their iPhones uh but the company's moving beyond that in ways that are just starting to get recognized by institutional investors um for example they just launched a partnership with meta platforms and they're helping run the company's llama to large language model and that'll be on mobile device um I also wrote recently about the company launched its Snapdragon platform back in January this is um a tool for that facilitates autonomous driving they launched that in January they already have Partnerships set up with several auto manufacturers so there's a story here that's bubbling that's going Beyond just the 5G story all right so it seems as Apple goes so does Qualcomm are there any concerns that we need to be looking out for in the future yeah I mean the biggest concern that investors would have right now is Apple's talking about bringing their chips in-house and making their own chips that doesn't seem like it's an imminent threat to Qualcomm and because they're working to grow out their revenue in other areas I don't think investors need to be too concerned about it but it certainly is a risk because the next wave called 6G isn't going to be on the horizon for several years right now so Qualcomm is right now still heavily dependent on 5G but they're branching out that could be a threat all right so risk to revenue and earnings it sounds like Chris I'm gonna put you on the spot you know that's what I have to do but where is Qualcomm headed by the end of the year always you know I love making price predictions um so as I told you before the Stock's really been all over the map it's been it's if you look at over 12 months um it's still down about 19 but it's been rallying recently I'm thinking uh personally that more money is going to be entering the market this fall uh that's something I was talking about with Thomas and Don earlier um so I think you could look at 135 which is about right where the stock was in February that's a gain of about eight percent from its current price so you're getting a good you're getting a good dividend and you're getting a dividend so you know eight percent in a dividend looks like a pretty good buying opportunity for me right now with Qualcomm well we'll keep an eye on that price prediction well it brings us to Nvidia who doesn't want to talk Nvidia I want both your opinions on this one of course Thomas you're up let me know how you feel about this stock all right well Nvidia is certainly leading the AI craze with chips uh the guidance last quarter was draw dropping When I Was preparing for this uh video I read that many times on several different articles jaw dropping it was huge um and the opportunity right here is that Nvidia could smash its own Guidance the demand for AI is outrageous I mean I don't think any company has said anything other than that it's really high and so I believe that there's a really strong possibility that Nvidia could impress with results and also impress with guidance again and uh you know among the things that kind of Stand Out is just that Nvidia has too many Partnerships to name it's become the go-to source for just about everything AI it's got new offerings that is kind of um compounded into this full stack AI Superstore where they've got uh you know services for uh just for data services and infrastructure services and also services for developing your own apps I mean it's just it's nuts how much that Nvidia has really leaned into AI Thomas I don't know if anyone else is picking up on this but to me it sounded like you're saying Nvidia is the best in this space is that fair to say Nvidia is certainly the leader they have the largest market share for these ships by far it's like 80 percent but I think AMD is the risk I don't think Nvidia is going to get pushed out of its number one spot anytime soon but uh AMD certainly stands to gain some market share even if they can pull five percent market share that would be a huge game-changing event for them it might not move the needle much for NVIDIA but it would certainly move the needle for AMD Chris are you as bullish as Thomas is on Nvidia I mean I'm not sure anyone is but honestly what are your thoughts oh well my thought is initially I wish I would have been on a video at the beginning of the year exactly but I wasn't um and so here's here's what I look at when I see Nvidia um once again I wrote a piece about autonomous driving and you know it probably shouldn't surprised me but it didn't it did surprise a little bit how in how integrated into autonomous driving Nvidia already is that's like just when you think they couldn't have any more catalysts they another one um people that I've looked at and read that are probably about as bullish on Nvidia as Thomas some people are saying a 575 to 600 price Target is realistic and that just seems stunning to me until I look at the company's um projections for earnings growth and I saw 44 projections for year you know full year earnings growth I mean it's hard to believe that that could happen from where they've already been but it's also possible if you pull that off I mean 575 and 600 is not hard to see as far as a share price so it sounds to me like we're picking an entry enjoying the ride on that one guys.,1.0,0.9

MarketBeat,JAu72FqsozM,2023-08-01T12:30:11Z,3 Stocks Primed for Growth...Again,Delta,all right well as promised I do have one bonus pick so here we go let's talk about Delta it was pointed out to me under thirty dollars per share and as of this morning it's trading at 45.86 we did do a recent video on this I'll go ahead and Link that down below um but Thomas what can you tell our viewers about Delta growth prospects I mean it's up big from where it was but is there still room for more growth I mean Delta's benefiting from multiple Tailwinds uh there's industry normalization pent-up demand from the pandemic return of business travel and then just plain old operational Improvement uh it's got clear momentum and it's results um it issued favorable guidance at the end of q1 it raised the guidance for Q2 before the earnings were released it beat its own guidance and then raised guidance for the rest of the year um it's operating above pre-pandemic levels um but the dividend is not back there yet and I think that's going to be a big Catalyst for the share price later on um and that's a sign of how well the company's doing now is that it brought the dividend back uh the dividend it's well below the pre-pandemic levels but I believe as the debt comes down that it will boost the dividend back to pre-pandemic levels and as the dividend Rises so will the stock Chris are you in on Delta uh I don't own it no but um I agree with Thomas especially with this what he said in that last part about the company's debt um like a lot of the Airlines Delta took on a lot of debt at the start of the pandemic because they knew they had to get through that very acute phase where they weren't able to fly planes at all and now they're paying down that debt and as Thomas said they've reinstated the dividend it's about I think it's I think I was looking at it before we came on things around 10 cents and it was like around 40 cents yeah I think 25 of the free pandemic yeah so I mean but like Thomas said it at least they've got one and as they keep paying down that debt you would have to start thinking they're going to reward shareholders by increasing that dividend it might not go back up to 40 cents per share anytime soon but you know it will it will start to go up right now analysts have a Target on the stock about 56 dollars that would be in the next 12 to 18 months I think that's reasonable because again right now you don't see that slow down in consumer demand and business travel is starting to flow back into this equation as well yeah I think that 56 Target is cautious I mean that's the consensus Target but a lot of the freshest estimates are above that so I think that the analysts will probably lead the market up to 56 and then as the year wears on it the results continue to impress will go above that level yeah.,1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,XIFpoGd4HFc,2023-07-30T20:30:02Z,Stock Market Update 7/17/23 | Inflation is Cooling and the Market is Rallying,Apple,apple is it's almost like oil for me as far as the market goes all right you know as Apple goes so goes the market it's it's the Bellwether it's the stock everybody owns it's a stock everybody right hopes to hate and loves to love what are you seeing there as far as uh as as apple is concerned and do you think we get another kind of a market rally out of Apple earnings yeah I don't know man Apple's been rallying pretty strong lately so there is a pretty high expectation built into the results I think that they could outperform but really what we want to see with apple is like you say the indications for the rest of the market how's the consumer doing and really like how is the Apple supply chain doing because Apple supports the market because of how large its supply chain is so that will certainly be a big report for the market if Apple can't sustain the rally then the odds of the S P 500 topping out soon will grow,1.0,0.4

MarketBeat,Nc721-rUcfQ,2023-07-28T12:30:15Z,The Time for Plug Power Stock May be Now,Plug Power,today we're discussing Plug Power a company gaining momentum as a global player in the green hydrogen space let's dive in and uncover the latest insights on plug power's Journey towards success. Let's talk about The Latest Buzz around Plug Power it seems that this company is on the brink of something big what's the potential here dare I say a short squeeze. I think the plug power is on the verge of a short screens in a reversal the short interest was running over 20 at the last report which is more than sufficient for a squeeze given the right Catalyst and I believe there is a catalyst Brewing right now. The company is building momentum with several projects that have come online and that are about to come online and a pipeline of new projects that is going to be even larger and this means that revenue is going to start ramping dramatically in the next quarter or two from nearly no Revenue to you know small small cap small cap Revenue probably. What do you think about plug power now? It's a heavily shorted stock and that you know if you're if you're somebody that's looking at this as a long-term investment that's something you have to think about but what I'm seeing is volume is increasing in the last month. What's going on with plug power right now is they've actually got actual projects that are moving on this isn't just like some of the meme stocks in 2021 that were just moving forward because retail investors decided that the price was going to be higher this is just something that's being based on some fundamental projects that are happening. I'm still looking at it right now as a watchless stock for long-term investors. Hydrogen stocks in general have been something I've stayed away from because it's been something where the hype seemed a little bit bigger than the industry's ability to deliver it hydrogen is still an expensive way of doing renewable energy but I have to admit that you know from what I'm seeing out of plug power it's one that it's on my watch list as far as stocks I might be interested in the renewable energy sector. Plug is nearing a bottom but it hasn't really bottomed yet there may be a short squeeze there'll be some more action to the side I I bought them we'll get hammered out and that'll be a good time for investors like investors not Traders investors to start you know nibbling on the stock. One project that stands out right now is with energy Vault. The deal with them is to build out what is going to be the largest hydrogen fuel cell backup system in existence in a town in California. The deal by itself is good money for the company but it will help prove the use case on the municipal level and open up and accelerate Revenue stream. Also some other projects there are some large-scale facilities facilities in the EU specifically in Finland to generate power for the population and there are a few other deals in the EU to supply hydrogen for some industrial facilities that make glass aluminum and steel which are also some good use case scenarios. You name a plug power as a stock to watch did these contracts factor into your pick as a player on the space? Absolutely it did. Green hydrogen is the only truly clean form of hydrogen and plug power is the only Pure Play company in that space. It's got an end-to-end green hydrogen ecosystem. In the article I wrote that the Biden Administration set aside a very specific 9.5 billion dollar line item in the inflation reduction act that is specifically targeted for green hydrogen projects. One of those projects looks like it's in California. Plug power is helping to build a hydro green hydrogen production plant that's going to act as a tertiary Water Treatment Plant. Plug Powers essentially taking that water and it's converting it into green hydrogen or one of the purposes it's using it for is to Green hydrogen production. I believe that those types of projects will start popping up in other areas as the green hydrogen movement moves on. The analysts are a bit mixed but there has been an interesting change recently that I think plays into the short squeeze scenario. The analysts rate the stock of moderate buy so they're interested and they think their client should own it but the price target has been trending solidly lower for the last year and that's helped the stock Trend lower but the consensus is still about 70 above the price action and there have been some positive revisions lately. Since the last report came out there have been a couple of booth in price targets that upgrade at least one new initiated coverage up by and the chatter is that there's a new clear path to cash flow and that operation should reach break even by the end of the year that's huge. These compounding opportunities are piling up revenue is going to ramp and profitabilities at hand the analysts have started to see that and I think that we're seeing a bottom and analyst sentiment which will probably Mark a bottom for the stock. Institutional ownerships right around 50 which is it's not it's either good or bad but when it comes to institutional ownerships it this is one of those situations where you have to watch what they do not what they say and in the last couple of quarters you're seeing a lot more buying than selling and plug power so that's saying that the big money is betting that the Stock's going to go higher and that feeds into everything we've been talking about not just the short squeeze possibility but just that fundamentally institutional investors are seeing a reality to the stock that maybe they didn't see before. Plug power is certainly making strides as we've discussed in this video. We're going to be keeping an IM plug power as they continue their path as a sector leader who knows I might just become the next big breakthrough in renewable energy.,1.0,0.7

welcome back Chris and Thomas today we're talking about Good Old Tesla of course but before we get started I just want to play a quick video clip of something I said a few weeks back me it's Tesla Tesla is one of those picks I think you could easily trade or it could be a long-term investment for some I mean I'm looking at the daily price swings it really makes it easy to trade if you don't get too greedy that's important thing to note um but the reason is easy here Elon Musk is polarizing as we know so that makes Tesla volatile day to day he talks the stock moves he doesn't talk the stock still moves so pick an entry point and just wait um like we like to say so it's pretty easy to sculpt five to seven percent over a few days just based on a news cycle so from an investment standpoint Tesla looks high at the moment 224 which by the way I've watched that move up from the 180s recently um and that's where the trades will come in but 300 a share I think that's likely to be seen in the next few months so here was saying that Tesla could reach 300 before the end of the year we got close in July here earnings came out and while they weren't bad they weren't blowout and for Tesla we know that that's just not enough um so a pullback is inevitable but how much of one are we looking at is my call of 300 in danger here oh you're saying I shouldn't count you as a Tesla bull Thomas I mean you don't seem to have the confidence like I do right so I'm a Tesla bull but I definitely see a pullback happening and because this is Tesla the pullback could gain a lot of momentum you just got momentum Traders and swing Traders trying to get into it but I think that uh there is an opportunity here the market will bottom soon How deep the correction gets really is anybody's guess because even the analysts don't really know what the stock is worth I mean the consensus is 25 below the current action but the range of targets is from like 35 to 350. that's that's humongous somewhere in the middle is reality the market will figure that out it'll show a bottom then and then it'll be time to buy some more all right well Thomas if Tesla Falls 25 I'll be buying you can count on that uh Chris are you in agreement with Thomas I'm looking for you to provide some balance between this well I don't own Tesla but if Tesla Falls 25 I may change my mind on that don't hold me to it but uh 25 below you know where it was before that's pretty tempting look the Market's been unpredictable even irrational by most investors um feelings but if there's one thing that's predictable as that Tesla was looking a little Toppy and so unless they hit a grand slam or drop the mic or however you want to say it that unless they had that kind of an earnings report the stock was going to fall and so to me I think what's going on this morning is pretty predictable um it's bold of Elon Musk to have the strategy where he's saying he's deliberately willing to sacrifice margin for volume but this is Elon Musk and it's not the first time he's made statements like that and as they say it's not bragging if you can back it up and so far the pricing strategy appears to be working in terms of what musk wants it to do musk is saying he's doing it to drive volume and right now volume is accelerating but Thomas said something that's really super important and that's that most analysts don't know how to price Tesla stock because they're still looking at it as just a car company well Chris right they aren't just a car company we've mentioned that many times here on the channel yeah I know Thomas has mentioned this before I've mentioned this before you know the long-term story with Tesla's about energy it's about energy trading it's about charging networks it's about power production and then you know just for good measure musk threw in that little blurb about they're going to be investing a billion dollars into what what they have their code name is Project Dojo which is um committed to ramp up their development of autonomous driving software um and that's actually another reason why the Stock's getting beaten down a little bit today because analysts don't like to hear about companies spending a billion dollars at a time when their profit margins are getting lower for sure yeah but Tesla's gonna become an AI play self-driving cars autonomous vehicles a billion dollars of cloud infrastructure that's a huge AI play for Tesla so that's part of why it's hard for the analysts to to Value it there's always the must Factor this isn't GM this isn't Ford this is like an oem combined with apple I mean it's like it's it's hard it's hard it's hard to Value it right right well back to Tesla there you have it we'll of course be keeping an eye on Tesla right here at Market B but we want to know what you think about Tesla I'm not sure the three of us are quite in agreement here as you can see but leave us a comment down below what you think start your comment with I agree with

MarketBeat,jzeZWB-_Wv8,2023-07-19T12:30:32Z,Delta Earnings Signal Pivot For Economy?,Delta Airlines,Delta Airlines had a blowout earnings report have we reached the pivot point for the economy are we going back the other direction now let's talk about it. we're going to talk about Delta Airlines and the focus is going to be what uh their earnings report which was very very strong means for the economy going forward. Hey Thomas uh Delta Airlines had earnings this week you wrote about it uh you're calling for if I remember right a double-digit upside might be in sight for Delta even now um very very strong report and and I'm curious about this and this is the reason I want to do this video because the economy as as we we all know uh you know suffering from high inflation High interest rates and all the rest yet Delta claims they're making more money selling their premium seats uh whether that be first class or their business class or or whatever it is and by the way I fly Delta almost exclusively and I do the same thing I always choose those thesis I like the the the experience of it all. Delta's numbers were really really strong and they were surprisingly strong because they had just they didn't call it a pre-release or preliminary results they kind of guided for the quarter just a few weeks before the quarter was over and they beat their guidance and then they guided higher so that's like a triple strong report within two weeks strong guidance outperformance new higher stronger guidance so I think that Delta really could fly higher. now we got companies like Delta coming out and saying it's it's all peaches and cream. could that bring Delta back to Earth. I think that the oil oil price is the biggest risk for a lot of things not just Delta. okay I want to talk about Delta's chart just for a minute then we're going to let you go but Thomas call if you would pull up the Delta chart and show us what you saw here right this is Delta you can see the big major correction we've had a rebound we did not recover the pre-pandemic levels more correction just driven by fear of economic slowing and high oil prices We got a nice bottom earlier in the year the company started revealing some better metrics and gave some better guidance and the stock has only been moving higher since then. uh I think this candle right here is when they put the guidance out a few weeks ago uh the stock price surged after the new report but it has corrected some. we'll probably get a nice little Trend following signal somewhere towards the end of the year and Delta could move up above 52 and start heading back towards its pre-pandemic levels. wouldn't have to base a little bit before it to become you know like you said get some support there before it took the next leg up because right now it kinds of looks like a not a jet or a Delta jet kind of looks like a rocket uh right so we've got a nice little um like a bull flagpole forming right direction. Delta was one that that caught my eye when I when I saw it come across uh the dashboard earlier this week. I want to thank you for for joining us uh for this bonus video on Delta Airlines and a look at the economy.,1.0,0.7

MarketBeat,1iY5ErjzKak,2023-07-17T12:00:01Z,"3 Stocks on the Move in July: Adobe, Salesforce, Enovix",Adobe,"All right Thomas, the hype of AI it spilled over into Adobe. We see this company allowing its users to tap into the latest technology here, so investors are getting excited about this potential. Yeah, Adobe kind of came out of nowhere as an AI play, it was unexpected. The Q2 result, the Q2 earnings report, was really a blowout and that's because Adobe is about data. AI is all about data, they need data to train all the models, and Adobe is where you go to make media pictures and images. They even got video and sound, so there's lots of opportunity for the AI Market to want to use Adobe. But to take that a step further, Adobe their CEO used the word ubiquitous, that means it's everywhere, everybody can connect to Adobe. So that makes Adobe an immediate part of the AI infrastructure. That's definitely a win, but Adobe also uses AI on its own platform and offers AI services to its clients, which is another bonus. So Adobe is basically a trifecta, a three-way play on AI, so the analysts are loving it. I think that it would still be a good stock but it would not have the revenue and earnings Outlook that it does right now because the reason why it emerged as that sleeper play was because the expectation for business spending in general was kind of soft and consumer spending as well. So AI is definitely juiced the Outlook as it has for a lot of the tech space. The analysts are really loving the stock, it's had at least 25 upgrades or price Target increases since the results are released. The consensus has it price about fair value, but the new range is above 500 to 550 and it's certainly supporting the stock and I would say the chart looks fantastic. You can see Adobe put its bottom in at the end of 2022 and start to drift higher, starts to put in some higher support here in early 2023 and then when AI starts to really grab a hold of Rocket's attention we start to have this nice rally. That's a pretty strong rally and we have a nice little bullish flag that formed after the earnings release earnings report was released. Since then we've got a nice surge in prices, this is a continuation signal that suggests this rally is going to continue and extend possibly up to the 680 region. I would say that Adobe will probably rally into the end of the year. I certainly lean towards Adobe and Salesforce, the charts look so much better, they've got better established businesses, outlook for growth outperformance, profits.",1.0,0.8
MarketBeat,1iY5ErjzKak,2023-07-17T12:00:01Z,"3 Stocks on the Move in July: Adobe, Salesforce, Enovix",Salesforce,"All right Thomas, let's talk about Salesforce. Salesforce they issued their first price increase in years and shares surged on that news. They're up about 70% from the first of the year and you're saying another double digit gain is in store. I think that this stock is definitely moving higher. This is another like Trifecta play, Salesforce was already leading the CRM Market that was supporting the price. Then you had the AI play, Salesforce is leaning hard into AI services for its employees and for its clients. But then they raise prices, they're going to raise prices an average of nine percent, that means that we can look for at face value at least a high single digit increase to the guidance and if the mix is good it could be a low double digit increase. So you add the price increase into the company's already its momentum and there is an opportunity for growth to accelerate. Now the analysts here they're supporting the stock but they're kind of lagging the market a little bit so I see a potential Catalyst in that angle. I think the analysts will probably start raising their targets if not now because of the price Target increases then after the next earnings report which is due out fairly soon. The price increases aren't going to show up in the current report but they will absolutely show up in the guidance and the guidance is what's going to move this stock. I think the guidance is going to be really impressive. This chart is really similar to Adobe, we've got a bottom but in the 2022 we've got a little bit of an AI spurred rally going on right here but Salesforce has already broken above its critical resistance point. It's already in a reversal, it's already got a consolidation in bull flag and it's already broken out to the upside. This is a very strong continuation signal, I think Salesforce could easily get up to 300 by the end of the year. I certainly lean towards Adobe and Salesforce, the charts look so much better, they've got better established businesses, outlook for growth outperformance, profits. But Salesforce is already breaking out, Adobe's still lagging a little bit so I think Salesforce is going to be the winner for this month. They both look like winners to me but yes I think Salesforce is is where I would where I put my money today. All right well there you have it, Thomas is saying Salesforce.",1.0,0.9
MarketBeat,1iY5ErjzKak,2023-07-17T12:00:01Z,"3 Stocks on the Move in July: Adobe, Salesforce, Enovix",Enovix,"All right Thomas, let's talk Enovix. Resistance for the stock was about fifteen dollars per share, since then news broke out of a government contract, shares of course took off. But new price targets were published and the new resistance looks to be around 20 per share. Enovix they make lithium ion batteries, they have some exposure to the EV Market but really it's a story about batteries in general. They've got exposure to most industries and verticals if not all of them, most use cases for the batteries. The chart this is okay, there's a near-term updraft, it's supported by analyst upgrades. The stock could be a winner because we know lithium batteries are definitely big, there's no doubt about that. They recently got a government contract, that's always good news, that's guaranteed revenue for the company. It could be the start of a bigger move, a bigger business with the government. I think starting a position isn't a bad idea but I would want to look for pullbacks to build that position, start off pretty cautiously and build with small buys over time. This one's showing a similar bottom to Adobe and Salesforce here late 2022, we've got a little bit of a rally starting to form and then the updraft starts to gain momentum here as the results are coming out and the government contract is released. Resistance might be around twenty dollars, it's kind of breaking through that level right now but I think that it could go higher. My caution here is that this is a pretty fresh off its IPO and there's some pretty strong resistance up here at this level. I think that this level could catch gains, best case scenario we'll see a pullback for a possible entry point, maybe a consolidation and then a breakout. A bull will really want to see the stock break above this level, in that scenario it could probably go from 24 to 36 which is about a 33% gain.",1.0,0.6

Delta's doing fantastic. I mean, they've raised prices, increased efficiency, they've got more seats and more planes in the air, and they're doing great. They're paying down their debt. I think they're hit record levels for business, but I think there's going to be a top to that rebound as well.

MarketBeat,lx9L7-NzCQ0,2023-07-13T18:04:07Z,Rivian Stock Soars and May Go Higher,Rivian,Ravine has experienced a significant surgeon at stock price with shares up over 36 percent in the last month today we're here to take a closer look let's get into it glad to have you back for some more analysis today Thomas so as you know we're talking about rivian which has been on an impressive run lately several days ago the stock was negative year to date but now with this recent surge it's put shares up around six percent year to date so what we're looking at here is this something that investors should jump into or do we need to wait for further confirmation here um further price stability Thomas or is this a case of another EV company writing the coattails of Tesla well you know to a degree they're all writing the cocktails of Tesla because Tesla is the The Cutting Edge the Leading Edge of the EV market and it did report some pretty stunning delivery numbers but rivian is moving up on production gonna produce more cars and deliver more cars than expected uh proving that there's demand for the vehicles and that the company can scale that's important for the EB oems and the outlook for profitability I mean they have to be able to scale to meet their margin goals uh compared to the other evoems rivian is the leader um outside of Tesla as far as uh scaling production ramping production and being able to deliver cars now remember ribbian makes an unusual lineup with its two I'll call them Adventure vehicle is it the truck and an SUV but they're not really part of the mainstream SUV or truck Market they're operating in a niche environment and they've also got their Amazon contract which is a large part of their business and that accounts for about 20 of production right now all right so of course we reported on ribbian on Market beat this week and we can't go out we can't go without mentioning that they Crush their Q2 delivery estimates that's always a hot question around companies like this one Thomas are they producing are they delivering or is it just talk um for rivian they for sure are delivering um this company was off to a slow start as we've seen But The Growing Pains that are paying off is there anything investors need to note here Thomas well they're they're scaling well and there's there's demand for the car so that's that's really good um but I think the really big opportunity right now is um is the van business you know Amazon is a big part of rubian's business they're working on a hundred thousand ban order uh that should keep them busy for quite a few years but the question really is if Amazon will let that Deal expand to other to other businesses uh the Amazon deals exclusive they can only sell these Vans to Amazon um if they're able to open up the van to other other end markets it would be a huge boost to their revenue and you got to think that there is a huge demand for Ev delivery vehicles um we're talking about a 20 compound annual growth rate expected for Ev Vans over the next few years and I think that that could be a really low estimate once the Vans start ramping production because uh the companies like Walmart and Amazon who have these huge fleets FedEx UPS they all want to Electrify well those Amazon cars those vans are going to be busy sure around the prime days for sure but what are the analysts saying about rivian well the analysts have started to raise their targets uh the word on the street The Whisper is that the company is at an inflection point production is expected to continue ramping and drive Top Line results margin Improvement should come with scale profitability is getting closer um so analysts are raising their price targets for the first time in several quarters that's very significant because it's marking a bottom in the sentiment and you can see that in the in the chart well speaking of charts you know I was going to ask this but can you pull up your chart and show us what you're seeing on a technical basis here I really wouldn't call this a solid bottom yet but the stock is absolutely showing some signs of life um what we want to see now is for the price action to continue moving higher and then spark a correction the correction will show us where the market really is where solid support can be found and that will give us our next clue and our entry point uh for the market if the market can make a higher low or reconfirmed support at the current lows we can start talking about a bottom and then uh the next question will be when will the reversal happen Thomas I was eavesdropping on our internal editorial channel the other day lurking I guess not listening um but it seems most of our contributors think at the end of the day there's going to be a handful of EV companies that make it obviously those that that won't make it um where do you put rivien between all that well I think that's a good call um the evoems are working hard and rivien may come out on top the catch is that the car market is dominated by the big players who will likely scoop up the small EV startups once they prove they can produce cars I mean think about this how many Boutique automakers exist in the ice Market there aren't very many so we really can't expect these EV OBM Boutique automakers to continue to operate independently they're going to reach a point where they have to get bought up in order to uh to get the skill they need but the other option which is probably the more likely outcome is that the big oems will choose to out-compete the smaller players uh four GM Toyota all the big boys are leaning hard in the EVs and Ford especially is spending billions on big plans that could lead to a spin-off of their EV segment even though the company says that's not really an option I see it as a possibility well certainly competitive landscape out there Thomas rivien has made impressive strides but the challenge of going up against established Automotive Giants that can't be ignored but it's going to be interesting to see how they navigate this evolving Market,1.0,0.8

MarketBeat,lx9L7-NzCQ0,2023-07-13T18:04:07Z,Rivian Stock Soars and May Go Higher,Amazon,now remember ribbian makes an unusual lineup with its two I'll call them Adventure vehicle is it the truck and an SUV but they're not really part of the mainstream SUV or truck Market they're operating in a niche environment and they've also got their Amazon contract which is a large part of their business and that accounts for about 20 of production right now you know Amazon is a big part of rubian's business they're working on a hundred thousand ban order uh that should keep them busy for quite a few years but the question really is if Amazon will let that Deal expand to other to other businesses uh the Amazon deals exclusive they can only sell these Vans to Amazon um if they're able to open up the van to other other end markets it would be a huge boost to their revenue and you got to think that there is a huge demand for Ev delivery vehicles um we're talking about a 20 compound annual growth rate expected for Ev Vans over the next few years and I think that that could be a really low estimate once the Vans start ramping production because uh the companies like Walmart and Amazon who have these huge fleets FedEx UPS they all want to Electrify well those Amazon cars those vans are going to be busy sure around the prime days for sure,0.9,0.4
