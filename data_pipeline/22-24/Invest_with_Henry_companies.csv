I've learned a lot of this stuff from Goldman saxs from working in the industry and from getting a degree in this and I want to say that asset allocation is something that's very overload looked from an investor standpoint a lot of investors just completely overlook this and I think it's one of the biggest mistakes because look asset location means how much money you have in each position which means that asset allocation is really your risk management it's really how much risk you have on each position."",",,,

Invest with Henry,BfZjRQ6k49E,2024-12-27T21:16:52Z,Selling Put Options for Beginners FULL FREE COURSE (2+ Hours),"""excerpt"": ""over the past 10 years selling listed one month at the money puts in S&P 500 stocks allowed investors to collect 3.4% per month in premiums and showed a 7.1% annualized return with a 12% stand deviation let me explain to you what all of this means and how I've been able to actually beat this return by a lot so so basically if you had invested in the S&P 500 you would have made 7.3% with an 18% standard deviation however selling puts at 1 month actually had a 12% standard deviation so it was a lot lower risk in fact it was roughly 33% lower risk than holding stocks so selling puts is safer however the returns are not that appetizing but I found a way around that and how to make a lot more money put selling offers the same return as equities with lower draw down risk that means that during 2008 when the market went down over 30% put selling actually only went down 20% however you can see in this chart something that is actually unusual which is put selling under the S&P 500 raw return that means the S&P 500 usually performs better but selling puts is safer the way I've gone around this is by just not selling puts on S&P 500 the reason why this is not a good strategy on S&P 500 is because that's S&P 500 has very very low volatility you'll see how later when I do single stock put selling I'll be making way more than 7% per year which is pretty ridiculous that's like nothing right I'm making around four or even 5% per month by selling puts. I think it's just stick to top S&P 500 stocks if you want consistent cash flow and you want retirement income otherwise you're going to experience more volatility."",",,,

So apple is just slightly down it's down 20 bucks which it's good when you're just winning and you're coaching a lot of people and everyone's just winning around you it's just the most satisfying feeling I love that but this is kind of like the only losing I wouldn't even call it losing I'm kind of just flat on this sell putut right here what I would do is let's say that I don't know why you would be worried about Apple going down to 235 when it's at 247 especially cuz this option expires like in 30 days or so however I'll show you what a role looks like I don't have the best rolling example since I'm successful on every trade at the moment but let's just say hypothetically that the stock was approaching 235 which is my strike price right here okay I have a 235 put option and let's say that Apple went down to 235 and you said to yourself well I'm a little bit nervous I'm not sure if I want to get the stock at 235 I want to reduce my cost cost I don't want to purchase it yet there's multiple reasons why you wouldn't want to right in most cases I do want to but what you would do is you would simply just find a different expiration date and then you would roll down I'll show you what that looks like right now and it doesn't matter what brokerage you're using you can use this on any brokerage the whole the whole point is you're increasing length of time because time for options is the most important thing like more time means more value for the option so it you know it allows you to collect income it gives you a net credit or even if you pay a debit it significantly lowers your price so I'll show you an example of both all right so look 235 I can easily just go down to well this is this is going to be super profitable no matter what as you can see I increase the time by 63 days and I'm getting a total credit of $2,900 that's because well these $63 days mean a lot for for options so it's pretty crazy actually you can see here how I'm moving from 235 down to 230 I'm literally saving $5 I'm going down by $5 and I get paid to go down $5 this is why rolling is super super good. for example let's say that Apple crashed for for whatever reason they had a bad iPhone release and the stock went down to 200 okay so first of all that would be like an extreme extreme event right if it went down that much it would be crazy however even if it did go down that much you can see here how you can roll from 235 down to 205 so you would still be at a loss if if Apple went down to 200 but you would go from 235 down to 205 with just 63 days you can give it 63 extra days see what happens and then you can roll again nothing stopping you from from Rolling once twice three times and so on and so forth so you can roll and effectively get your average cost down to zero which is pretty crazy right obviously you need a long length of time but imagine that every single you know 60 days or 90 days I could roll my position down lower and lower and lower for a you know credit or a small debit you can get the cost down to absolutely nothing. companies like apple Microsoft and Google actually offer a bit of both okay they are Brands they're big Brands but they're also Tech right they're Tech they're software they're consumer I really really like those type of companies so companies like apple Microsoft and Google are well known for their growth potential they have very strong balance sheets and they're also relatively lowrisk long-term companies so they're they're very good to have in your portfolio to continuously sell puts. we all know Apple goes for that yearly iPhone release right the iPhone 16 and during those times there is a little bit High tend volatility because the the market could um you know not take that with good graces for example maybe an iPhone it has a has a delay I mean there's always a little chance of something happening and option Market will adjust for that and they will price that in so if you're selling options you will get a little bit more money during those types of periods. I mean if you're trading Apple and apple falls down 10% you'd be kind of out of your mind to say oh Apple's going to go bankrupt I mean it's not right it's going to be it's going to be fine so when you're in high quality companies you don't really have to worry about that."",",,,

GET READY,Palantir,"we have the opportunity to make a ton of money on paler right now as paler reaches all-time highs record high over and over again paler is up 400% year to date in 2024 and going into 2025 you can absolutely take advantage of the stock using options to make a ton of money and in this video I'm going to keep it as short as possible I respect your time I'm going to reveal to you new information my updated price Target on paler stock what I'm seeing in the market overall because obviously that's going to impact paler a lot so let's not waste any time here's a short summary if you don't have time you just want to enjoy the holidays with your family totally understand merry Christmas and happy holidays here's a short summary I think small cap and midcap stocks are going to outperform in the market I'm pretty clear on that and also that's going to translate into the tech sector uh the tech sector is going to blow up in terms of AI having a really powerful year in 2025 as we Skyrocket and compounding interest and compounding Innovation hits more of Palance here it's already innovating like crazy but this is going to become a mega cap stock 2025 will be the year of tech as well as cyclicals Tech specifically um I think we're going to get a 25% return in 2025 but obviously the leap option that I'm going to recommend you in this video the leap option uh to be specific is 75 leap option this is not in the money as much as I usually recommend however I think this is really interesting opportunity for two reasons uh there's this interesting strategy it's called a synthetic long stock position tell you a little bit later but essentially 75 buy leaps 75 sell puts you can buy leaps for September 2025 and you can sell 75 puts for January or March expiration that's the summary if you need to bounce have fun with your family or just enjoy the holidays go for it all right and here is the longer summary before I jump into longer summary I just want to say that one quick mention I am running a webinar on January 9th this webinar will talk about the Trump trade I'll also talk about option strategies and leaps for 2025 to double your money I think 2025 there's a lot of urgency to make a lot of money you can reach retirement literally in one year one year can change your life it has for me so during this webinar I going to uh talk about how to double up how to look at leaps uh everything there's going to be so much stuff there you can watch a six minute clip of of me actually explaining all of that in the first link in description hit the first link and you'll see you know little six minute video of me talking more about this webinar for January 9th okay it's going to be all the details will be on the page all right so let's jump into what's going on in the market real quick and then how that translates into Palance here looking at the market it's kind of interesting because I see a lot of talk about animal spirits and I've been telling you guys momentum is in the market I've been telling you investor psychology is really important to understand and now in 2025 the animal spirits so to say will definitely push up the market 2025 I'm a bull I'm a perll I'm a mega Bull and there's a lot of money on the sidelines that's going to enter the market in 2025 and we're going to continue to see Market rally and momentum especially in this lower interest rate environment and all the cash on the sides it's pretty obvious and paler is going to be the top stock paler uh you know you guys know I have Tesla Nvidia but paler to be specific we just hit an alltime high it's pretty clear that we're going to hit another all-time high in next couple of weeks here if you're not invested you're you're just missing out all right I'm just being honest with you listen here's here's a Quick 90c Clip I want you to watch this about animal spirits it sounds funny like animal spirits you're like well who cares about spirits and animals I just want to make money Henry well the thing is these Animal Spirits are just like another word for investor psychology momentum and what's going on with investors emotions and emotions are extremely important so watch this 9 clip on what you can expect when it comes to emotions because this is going to move the market I want to ask you about the Animal Spirits because I was reading in the producers notes that you believe they come back next year what species of animals come back uh and were they hibernating this year because we saw some species out in full force in 2024 so I'm curious which ones you think will be uh in full force in 2025 um thank the what I'm thinking about with animal spirits and it's Milton fredman reference is the ism's been below 50 for almost 3 years meaning companies have been cautious their visibility hasn't been great but finally the FED is cutting and we have an incoming Administration that's seen as very business friendly and so I think companies for for the first time in a long time are going to be expansionary feel confident doing mergers I think this is a very good environment for small caps midcaps the financials and cyclical broadly like in just so I I think it's going to feel a lot like the market broadens in 2025 um even as Tech sort of keeps up with the market all right so what we saw there let me quickly recap is essentially we have Tom Lee who is a you know a market leader he's been right on so many plays and I really respect the man he has a very similar view to me and I think it's a pretty obvious view it's similar because it's obvious um I like to be very original and make unique content and have UniQue Ideas because I believe that if you're using the same ideas as everyone else you're going to get the same results with everyone else and that's the defin of you know being average and I am not here to be average guys I'm here to be the absolute number one best I want to have the highest returns for the given level of risk that I take and I think pal here is going to be uh is that stock to do that all right so look I'm going to read off my research real quick here I'm going to go f as I can small midcap stocks are going to outperform in the market that's obvious to me because there's going to be a lot of mergers and Acquisitions mergers and Acquisitions I almost worked in mergers Acquisitions but I did not want to work at Goldman Sachs a lot of people say you know couldn't work there I could work there for the rest of my life but I would be miserable I was coming to work 6:00 in the morning doing things that I don't really enjoy I just want to trade options so that's why I also left Goldman Sachs but it's pretty clear I was going to work in merges and Acquisitions the way it works is companies that see synergies will buy other companies that they synergize with it's as simple as that okay bigger companies buy smaller companies because they are first of all buying competition and second of all they have Synergy third of all they can fire people that's what Synergy is you know you have one CEO buy another company that's the other CEO you can cut cost you don't need as many employees you have systems in place to scale operations it's pretty simple and um we're going to see a lot of that in 2025 I'm really excited about that because that's going to be huge opportunities in the market um and that's going to be a really big bullish event now I also think that tech stocks are going to do extremely well um because AI is is here and AI is super exciting just understanding AI in general you can just tell that it's just early Innings and we've seen folks like Dan IES say that you know we're 10: p.m. and the party goes until 4:00 a.m. uh guys we're going to be partying we're going to be making money and I'm not a big partyer I don't drink I don't do drugs I don't do any of that stuff guys I just hit the gym try to be a good person have fun eat I love eating and traveling so I'm in Dubai for the holidays so look um when it comes to mergers this is going to be interesting for paler because paler is going to be gaining under the same laws they're not they're probably not going to buy anything in 2025 but when you have a hot Market where you know there's mergers and Acquisitions stock market is going up Al is going to be a beneficiary because economies do the the economy doing well look means governments will have more money from tax dollars more projects to fund more Wars Etc you know that's kind of where a lot of tax dollars go Healthcare Wars and pal going to make money off of all that they're going to make money from Healthcare they're going to make money from war this stock is going to go up because they're just making money they're making money hand over fist I've been saying bicep over tricep I got to work on my tricep a little bit but bicep over tricep guys we're getting big gains for 2025 and I'm telling you this is going to be a lifechanging year mark my words at the end of 2025 I'm already getting all these success stories for my students lawyers doctors Engineers Etc you know my Spiel I'm getting a lot of high results but in 2025 I'm bullish we're going to continue to get richer all right and I look at Alex karp his demeanor this man's like this okay when he talks he's like a champion all right he's like got I don't know he's got so much confidence and this gives me confidence guys it's all about confidence and that's kind of funny but something so simple like that you look at the CEO you know he knows what he's talking about so Alex carp the volume is also really good on Palance here and uh you know I do see some unusual option activity which I'm going to show you I just want to give you the full Insight of how I feel how I think and the facts okay it's not about feelings feelings actually are important for the market because you guys are all feeling let me tell you many of you guys are making emotional decisions you're not putting money into certain stocks look at yourself around the hard mirror tell me do you know why you hold every single stock if you can't explain it to me you're doing it based on feel all right that's what I work with a lot of my clients on is understanding why we hold things asset allocation diversification you know my one-on-one coaching is full that's why I'm doing a webinar I'm just focusing on giving value through that for the next couple weeks until I open up more spots now look we have earnings in March all right earnings in March for paler means that right now we're going to get some upward you know we're going to have an upward slope where the stock continues to go up and hit alltime Highs but once earnings hits it's going to hit all right it's going to hit like a freaking truck all right we're either going to get get some some big news that the stock is continuing to have record after record Revenue profit Innovation or the market could be disappointed I am in that first camp where I think P um palen here we're going to get Alex harp that's going to hit us with the secret sauce he's going to hit us with the good news and um pretty obvious I I think it's a 90% chance that paler beats earnings mark my words we have a lot of time until earnings but I'm early I'm early you know people are going to talk about earnings a week before earnings I'm already thinking about earnings in the holiday season Merry Christmas to you and merry you know Christmas to everyone happy holidays I'm thinking about making money I'm also very excited and thankful and blessed for what had God has given me and what I've been able to do for our community and if you're not subscribe Please Subscribe that's all I ask I don't need anything else have enough finances I have enough everything I just need health happiness you guys to be healthy and happy and cross all to make money that's it I don't really have any other goals other than that that's what life's about happiness health family Rel relationships and just understanding like right now we're in Christmas time and I'm just thinking how blessed I'm opportunity paler has been in 2024 and I don't think the blessings sto you know I think in 2025 around this time in the year I hope to be here on YouTube telling you that we have had a 100% return and we have taken our portfolios from you know 100K to 200 maybe some of you guys will go from 100K to 300K with the leap strategies that I put out nothing is out of the question now nothing is out of the ordinary with this Market okay i'd put in a mill into Tesla and I'm at 1.5 mil and it's been six weeks it's been seven weeks okay so it's not out of the question to get a 200 300% return in 2025 if it's a good time if it's a good year listen I'm a perable guys why am I per perable because I actually have an education and I understand Finance on a deeper level and I worked at Goldman Sachs and I understand that the Market's up like 86% of the time since like the the cold war or whatever since 1929 right the Market's up 86% of the time so if you're a bearer and you're trying to time the market you are playing in the 14% of you know situations where it's just it's dumb all right don't be like Michael bur don't predict 17 in the last two crashes I was like um always joke with with clients and and friends and and everyone that anyone who's bearish just hasn't been investing long enough just don't have enough experience I feel like the white hairs that I have right here have the experience that I have it's I'm a bull and I and I'm a bull because I'm logical if you're not a bull you're just not logical so you know we we've been waiting for a recession by the way for some time and I don't see any recession coming we've been waiting and we've been predicting oh market crash you guys see all the videos on YouTube market crash or buy this and do this and oh my goodness you know what drives me nuts I see guys posting titles that says $25 in this stock or $50 in this stock or $100 into this stock will make you 25,000 H let's I don't know I'm trying to be a little bit realistic here guys P here is going to go up but a $10 is not going to become a million you got to be realistic and that's why I like to work with folks that have 50,000 Plus in their portfolios because it's easier to scale big money like it's not it's not easy to scale smaller money look to wrap it up before I go into the option positions here you know sometimes just go into the option positions right away and I'm just testing out this theory of giving you guys a full picture of my thoughts and the psychology behind why I'm doing things because a lot of you guys ask why I'm doing things when I give you the trades up front people say well you're just giving me trades why are you doing it and then when I say why I'm doing it you're like you're not giving me trades so I'm just making it up I hope I'm respecting your time I hope you feel respected that I you know take this very seriously um maybe Ram a little bit extra in this video but I just feel really blessed and happy and I want to share H how I'm thinking about you know holiday season going into 2025 so let me uh finish off this video with the actual trades let me type in pltr right now let's look at paler as a stock and let's talk about the two option positions that that I think are going to be really smart that I think are going to make a ton of money so I'm up 280% on Palance here in this portfolio Alan I bought it at $21 I've obviously traded it since IPO I have some covered calls which I had to roll up but overall holding shares and I have a lot of shares that are uncovered and what I'm thinking right now is I've been on the sidelines a little bit on adding my to two Palance here a lot of it is because I just don't have any cash I just did clear up some buying power because January is going to be a big year and the webinar that I talked about I'm going to make a lot of Trades and a lot of positions that are going to be new so I did clear up some cash um just because I see a lot of opportunities so as you can see $21 average cost 5,000 shares and now that I have some more cash available this is the trade that I'm going to do I'm going going to go to trade pound your options I didn't do this trade yet I'm going to open it up when the Market opens up I think that during the holidays on the market just a little bit uh lower volume and um I don't really see a point of investing during this time but planning planning reason why I've been so successful actually is sometimes I take a whole week where I just walk around go to the beach and I think about ideas and one idea sometimes can make me a quar million $500,000 so that's why I try not to be too busy I try to be free and available so I can innovate and do things that no one else can because everyone's on that hamster wheel I'm trying to be Innovative and for me that means that uh doing less is more so I'm going to look at buy call 75 here I'm telling you this right here is a genius play um it's better than holding paler stock because with paler stock you have to tie up $88,000 by having 100 shares here I'm tying up $2,300 and I get the same benefit I'm going for 75 it's even breaking some of my rules because I usually go oh actually it's not breaking my rules it's interesting because I usually go for a 70 Delta and I thought this would be a little bit lower so that's how bullish the market is this option is barely in the money but the Delta is still 70 so shoot I don't even have to break any rules in this video my intuition has has been on point so hopefully the audio was good there look the next thing that I'm going to do is I'm telling you selling puts is also no-brainer I would sell shortterm puts so you can sell puts for March 21st a lot of people ask me like why are you trading options that are three months out what are you going to do in the meantime well if you got $10,000 in a month or $30,000 in three months it's like the same thing so like I don't understand when people say like what are you going to do during the meantime well the whole point of investing for me is to create passive income which is why I don't really work with people who are like trying to swing trade or Daye trade or do the zero DT options I mean I've made plenty of money by just selling puts covered calls going bull call spreads doing the wheel and I'm not really trading weekly I'm Trading monthly but for selling puts on Palance here you can go really simple and add to your position cuz obviously you guys already have a position most likely'been watching my videos I've only been talking about P here since IPO only since IPO it's been years so if you want to add more to the position you should add more by selling puts I don't know if I would buy more shares at 82 you know I'd rather just jump in and and get forced dollar cost averaging okay this is an interesting topic I'm going to reveal to you because I used to just cover this in my boot camp but I told a lot of my students that the reason why we sell puts is because selling puts is actually like back door to dollar cost averaging dollar cost averaging means that you're buying stock on a frequent basis at Highs at lows over time right and you're putting in a consistent amount of money there and that's dollar cost averaging you can dollar cost average up or you can dollar cost average down both are fine right when it comes to selling puts you when you get a sign you're forced into buying so I'm forcing you to dollar cost average so that's like an invisible hand that I've been playing on you guys to make you richer which people don't realize is selling puts I'm forcing you to buy good stock good high quality stock for a cheaper price so it's a easy play March 2175 sell put do the trade get some entry into paler and and enjoy it's pretty simple that's it I'll stop rambling hope you guys have happy holidays Merry Christmas Happy New Year's and see you guys soon",1.0,1.0

I worked at Goldman Sachs and I understand that the Market's up like 86% of the time since like the the cold war or whatever since 1929 right the Market's up 86% of the time so if you're a bearer and you're trying to time the market you are playing in the 14% of you know situations where it's just it's dumb all right don't be like Michael bur don't predict 17 in the last two crashes.,0.9,-0.1
Invest with Henry,RfHcqSqrsUs,2024-12-21T16:58:24Z,URGENT: WATCH BEFORE MONDAY 930am! #SOFI #SPY #TSLA #PLTR #NVDA #AMD,Sofi Technologies,Sofi let's go into Sofi first so look Sofi right now is in a really interesting position. Sofi Technologies is a really powerful stock and I'm telling you right now I recommended last week to sell a put option this week I'm still recommending selling a put option because it was actually very very profitable to sell $15 puts. Selling $15 puts on Sofi is an absolute no-brainer. You sell 15 puts because it's an optimal entry the stock is over $15 so even if the market pulls Back 2 3% you're still going to be profitable and at worst you get to purchase Sofi and you get to hold it and I think this stock is honestly a Millionaire Maker. If I scroll down here you can see that the market cap is $16.67 billion this stock can be a $50 billion market cap if it 3x's and it's not that huge so having a 3X return Isn't unreasonable in the next several years. So far for me is an absolute hold this is the easiest hold and even if the stock goes to a market valuation of $34 billion that's still a 2X in your money so you're looking at 2x or 3x return in 2025 I would say that we can see this stock at $25 per share. Why am I believer in Sofi it's because of innovation and disruption. They essentially are developing a comprehensive mobile app right this mobile app allows customers to manage various Financial products and services all in one place. Sofi is exactly that it's like the fast food of banking and by combining technological payments by combining banking businesses into one agile model Sofi is challenging the standard banking structure they're challenging these old Banks. When you take a look at Sofi it's basically just like a no-brainer Play Because banks are dinosaurs and Sofi is an obvious play because they're innovating and disrupting that's why you see some of the top investors jumping into this company. In terms of what's going to happen this week I think it's a really crucial time for you to sell put options if you have cash sell put options on Sofi I would go for the 15 sell put and I would do that for January expiration. Sofi is set to benefit from falling interest rates that's another big benefit. As interest rates fall lower Sofi is going to benefit. The regulatory environment is going to be better and I that's a benefit for Tesla and that's a benefit for Sofi. This is going to help Sofi compete very heavily against the traditional Banks so I expect them to continue to take share and I reiterate a $15 entry into this stock by selling puts.,1.0,0.9

Do we still see a bull market and for me the answer is yes we're still in a bull market and just giving you my three points real fast about spy looking at reduced Market liquidity as we head into the holiday season is actually an issue because there's a reduction of trading volume. I expect the bullish move on Monday and I think going into Christmas this is going to be a really optimistic time for a lot of investors despite the volatility typically what happens is we have a Santa Claus rally also what happens in January there's typically a January effect where the stock market pumps up so this is like the best time to be bullish even though we've had a little bit of short-term pain here with a little bit of an overreaction. There's a lot of optimism in the market and I would say that we're still on the optimistic track to have a 25% return in tech stocks in 2025 and for the next 9 days of this year we're going to have success and I think that we are going to see a Santa Claus rally. I'm bullish on the market.,0.9,0.8

Paler is trying for $80 per share paler wants to hit 80 okay I'm telling you guys I'm super pumped up palen here to hit $80 per share. I'm buying this stock hand over fist and that's because I believe in it it's a no-brainer. Paler is trying for $80 per share and they have surged 350% this year. They have surged because people understand that this is an obvious play they just recently had a $400 million partner extension. To extend a contract is way better than a new person. That's easy money for palen here to just make a lot of money and a lot of money on the Top Line. This is actually by the way higher profit margin. The application of paler AI it has so many vast ways of being applied we don't even you guys don't even understand I'm telling you this stuff actually blows my mind when I research into paler and I look at Aerospace when I look at defense I'm shocked because paler it's a company that I want to own. When I look at palen here when I look at the body languages of Alex scarp I'm telling you don't miss out and right now we have a really awesome opportunity. I'm clearly making money made $300,000 on paler every time you guys look at my paler position I'm profiting not just from the stock but from the options. I'm still bullish I think the stock is heading towards $85 per share and I don't see any changes with with modern warfare stopping unfortunately I I continue to see a shift in cyber and AI driven strategies which paler positioned extremely well for and they're a leader and they're transforming how Wars are are fought right.

At one point I made over 400k on Tesla and just one of my portfolios now I'm I have 200k in this portfolio on a gain. I still see $500 per share in 2025. Selling premium is wise right now since we did get an interruption. I'm still holding the 330 a leap option. I'm still bullish but I'm becoming a little bit down to neutral and I'm becoming a little bit more relaxed where we are in the market cycle. When it comes to Tesla take some profit off the table take some money off the 350 leap and do like a 50% reduction. Taking a look at Tesla we've had a huge pullback but I think it's going to be business as usual as I said in the beginning of this video we're going to still be in a uptrend market so this week I expect the prices to stabilize. I personally think that we're going to have repricing just for one day I honestly think we're back to a bull market. If I'm looking at Tesla I would say I'm going to keep holding shares. Hold Tesla keep holding Tesla take some profits on your 330 and 350 leap call options which I recommended if you have shares then go ahead and sell the 475 covered call option collect some premium make some gains and you're good.,1.0,0.6

I am the most bullish on Nvidia right now because I said sell 130 puts and that was a really good decision because we're hovering right around 130. 129 sell put is easy 130 sell put is easy this is easy money. Nvidia has a hard floor it has a hard support. Nvidia has some of the best technicals I has some of the best fundamentals it's an AI play. This is a no-brainer it has a very reasonable valuation and the floor is here. This is the number one safe stock that I have in this market right now.

Just in general AMD and Nvidia are the top two plays and AMD specifically they intend to provide some of the competition for AI chips that the market really desperately wants right. The market really does need some competition so AMD I'm looking at it and this stock is just way too cheap it's just way too cheap it continues to go down and this is like a really strong value play. This stock was over $140 and in the past one year the stock is down 133% in a bull market. I'm going to be selling right at the money puts 120 sell puts for January 17 expiration I see a really strong support I see a very strong bounce coming from AMD at some point I don't know if it's going to be this week but I'm telling you we're going to have a strong balance.

If you're selling off and you're panicking from Nvidia or AMD that's a huge mistake and based on my research right here AMD and envid my top two plays. What I want you to understand is that AMD I said is a fantastic leap opportunity play what you want to do is you want to purchase some leap options on AMD now be smart you guys need proper risk management you can't just dump all your money into leap option and think okay my portfolio is going to go to the moon no what you have to do is put 3 to 5% of your money in AMD or into Nvidia you need to have proper risk management.

We're not necessarily at a 52e low for NVIDIA but Nvidia has pulled back and at the price level that I'm seeing it right now anything under 135 is a fantastic buying opportunity for me in fact I think that Nvidia is easily going to be a $180 stock in the next 6 to 12 months both AMD and Nvidia are fantastic AI plays guys. If you're selling off and you're panicking from Nvidia or AMD that's a huge mistake and based on my research right here AMD and envid my top two plays. Now look when it comes to Nvidia I want to point out something super important because some people say NV video is going to pull back further I will tell you what I'm seeing right now in terms of a floor okay this is what I'm referring to as a floor floor is basically a support level those two things are synonyms floor and support okay now understanding where floor is we're at a much lower multiple for NVIDIA versus other AI peers guys this is a relative game if you want to understand how to actually invest there's actually no absolute numbers okay on an absolute level yes Nvidia has you know good PE ratio but it's all about what is it compared to others in this market that's what we want to understand on a deeper level and when I look at AIP peers versus Nvidia the AIP peers are more expensive than Nvidia Nvidia is going for very reasonable levels and I want you to understand this through this short clip that I want to show you from a Morgan Stanley analyst this Morgan Stanley analyst explains why Nvidia is a good opportunity right now so watch this Quick Clip it's only going to be 90 seconds uh where's the floor where's uh where's the bottom here is there is there one and uh what do you think the fair value of this company really is hi good morning um so I think we're wrestling with a couple of things um we have this transition to Blackwell and so your product Hopper which still driving you majority of revenues is starting to slow down as you would expect to see and there's a lot of enthusiasm now for custom so we can or as6 as we've seen with broadcom and Marell I think those things are weighing on the stock I still think when you think about 2025 and AI the story is Blackwell the product cycle that IND India has I think they're going to have a huge second half of the year and I think we do have these transitional issues as we're moving there but I think the stock is very attractive at this level uh I'm not going to say absolute bottom because it's volatile but you know as very attractive at this level I think you're you're trading at a much lower multiple than some of the AIP peers and I really believe that they actually gain share versus custom silicon in 2025 I'm very excited for this custom silicon Trend but I still think Nvidia can gain share relative to that in 2025 and has a very strong product cycle um you know we think the stock trades well north of 150 uh as we sort of move into that back half 150 end of the year meaning if if if we do the holidays again together Joseph that uh we're 150 then or 150 6 months out no sorry 12 months out yeah we're we're uh our forecast our our price targets are high 150s I think uh 12 months out 15 what kind of multiple what kind of multiple are you you putting on that 12 months out relative and how would you compare that to the to maybe the whatever you think the best comps are at this moment yeah I think we have a mid four number in 2025 we think north of $ five doll in 2026 I think those numbers are very conservative and we've seen the stock in the low3s kind of multiple range when there's periods of strong growth ahead of us and I think we have that uh the peers are now trading kind of more like high 30s uh when you look at the you know where the brcs and Marvels are trading on our estimat so I think that's that's a very reasonable multiple now they have high margins and they're again they have these transitional issues that you're wrestling with all of that can continue to weigh on the stock we may continue to hear some data points about the the older Products Manufacturing starting to slow down but but black was really robust and the demand they have uh is is very strong yes all right so what we just saw from this clip is basically 2025 is trending for an up Market that was the analyst's opinion um from Morgan Stanley he says 2025 is going to be fire we've seen that from multiple analysts and by the way this is not rocket science guys the higher the stock goes the better it performs other analyst realize that they are stupid for not being bullish on the stock so I'm planning to see more and more analysts come out and say hey I'm also bullish because it's kind of like a cycle all right so when a bunch of analysts have a price Target on Nvidia 80 bucks 75 bucks and Nvidia is at 1 30 they have to change their price Target otherwise they look dumb so they need to go up and as more analysts go up they start to copy each other so this is a cycle and I expect this to continue to happen in 2025 now we also saw the Morgan Stanley analyst mention that the product cycle for NVIDIA is a little bit difficult with Blackwell however they do have a strong product cycle in general so in 2025 we should see a lot more of that come to fruition now the Morgan Stanley analyst did see the stock above 150 I think that is way too conservative for me I see the stock at $180 per share. What you have to do is put 3 to 5% of your money in AMD or into Nvidia you need to have proper risk management.

In my research what I did was I looked at AMD CEO and I decided to purchase AMD shares today because I'm bullish on the CEO I'm bullish on the fundamentals they have really low RSI the RSI is absolutely ridiculous when I see RSI this low that typically means that the stock is completely oversold and I'm recommending two option trades here okay one is going to be publicly the $130 buy leap option for September 2025 okay that's going to give you time for that upside it's also going to give you multiple earnings quarters because I think AMD is going to continue taking share from Intel and it's going to compete effectively with Nvidia. My price target for AMD is $175 per share in 6 months so there you go if you have to bounce off the video buy the leap option take a look at AMD invest wisely and I'll see you in the next one but now if you do have time let's get that money guys I'm pum pump up I'm really pumped up because I'm telling you this thing makes a lot of sense like you you crazy right now if you investing all your money in all the stocks that are at 52 we highs guys we are making money right now instead AMD right now AMD is time to buy and there's this weird completely really weird dynamic guys I'm doing this video in the morning and I'm telling you I I was just thinking about it AMD has a really weird dynamic where if other Tech giants like Nvidia do well AMD goes down so there's like this reverse correlation stock goes up on you know Nvidia AMD goes down that doesn't make sense to me because yeah I get it they're playing in the same space they're not directly oneto one proportional it's not like Nvidia does well AMD is going to zero guys that's that's like the weirdest thing that I'm seeing right now. AMD look this stock is a no-brainer okay this is a cheap stock if you look at the six-month return just take a look we're at 52 we low we're at 126 we're under $127 that's insane under $127 this stock not that long ago was well it was $27 right uh actually one year ago if I go to the one year chart this stock was over $200 per share so a stock that was over $200 per share in the AI space in the AI space like seriously this company is innovating. Tech giants like Amazon like Microsoft like alphabet are leaning towards you know going for NVIDIA chips heavily and that's signaling a strong risk for AMD and they can lose market share guys they've already been losing market share it's already priced in like this is already priced in I'm telling you what's already priced in to AMD is priced in because it's at a 52e low you think this is something new you think this analy just came out oh there's a lot of competition and the stock crashed the 52 we lows does that make sense to you do you think there's that many stupid people that have basically not thought that there's competition they thought okay AMD is the only company in the space that's been the case so now an analyst just emphasizes the point hey there there's some competition going on and people are like okay let me sell off the stock to a 52 we low that's actually why I decided to pick up this stock. I caught Nvidia now AMD is is the next stock that I'm going to throw $75,000 into it. A lot of Chip buyers they want to see more competition amongst AI chip makers and AMD they intend to provide chips to the entire industry they don't just have applications to you know just self-driving cars they have many applications. AMD CEO Lisa Sue she's focusing on Innovation efficiency and identifying markets where AMD could Excel. Honestly AMT is the only company that is actually has a real shot at competing with Nvidia they actually have a real shot at competing with Nvidia who else has a real shot you think a company can just you know get out of nowhere and just start competing with Nvidia no but amd's been in the game for a very long time they have a good CEO I get it the CEO is not as good as Jensen hung but the valuation is also super super cheap like I can go over the valuation a bit more actually with you guys like the valuation just makes a lot of sense like the price earnings ratio very reasonable price of sales ratio very reasonable growth rate is still there 52 low RSI is low I mean AMD is constantly taking market share by the way from Intel 2o so even if they never end up beating Nvidia it's still a great company to bet on especially at the valuation that they're at right now like you would be silly not to honestly invest in this company. I think investing just like $500 $1,000 or just the $2,000 leap options that I'm recommending you're going to see so much growth in your portfolio it's going to be insane.",1.0,0.9

I have students that they put in like $10,000 into leap options on Tesla on the 330 call that I actually put up on YouTube that $10,000 became over $50,000 like it's crazy it became well over $50,000 depending on when you know some of you guys jumped in and when people take profit but at this point people have made more off of just one Tesla leite play than they make as a doctor as a dentist like it's more lucrative to trade options than the root canals that my dentists are doing so it's like we're in a bull market take advantage of it make as much money as possible.",1.0,0.95

Invest with Henry,p3gMXWKtP-M,2024-12-14T15:30:22Z,If You Hold TESLA STOCK (TSLA) ... GET READY,Tesla,"Tesla stock is up over 70% and at an all-time high since November election and a lot of my students are asking me if this stock is still okay to buy and my answer is yes my price target for Tesla is $500 per share in mid 20202 and I'm going to explain to you in this video using research and very important new information that I have just gotten on why my price Target is 500 and I am going to move up my price Target to $525 and why I put a million dollars into Tesla you can actually see my position right here I'm about $29,000 I have a th000 shares in this portfolio and in this portfolio my other portfol have 3,000 shares and I am up $281,000 in just a very short amount of time so I have some really important information I'm going to keep this video short as possible let's start by talking about my future Revenue expectations and why Tesla is going to exceed them. I think Tesla with their capabilities around full self-driving those will get better and better ultimately though it's about creating value for customers it's about creating new profit pools. We've listened to that short clip my future expectations for Tes is that each and every single quarter we're going to get $30 billion of Revenue and in 2025 we're going to easily exceed $100 billion now look the reason why I put a million dollars into Tesla it is very clear to me that we're going to go to $500 per share and that's going to happen in a very short amount of time we have very high momentum and I telling you that this is a stock that you don't want to miss. I believe that the profit margin on Tesla is going to increase not just the revenue which is going to grow in 2025 to over you know 100 billion but also the profit itself. Dan flax let me explain what he said he basically says that Tesla still has to perform on unit growth in the main side of the business right which is their car business selling cars all right and that is true Tesla still has to create value for their shareholders and they're going to do so with full self-driving technology and based on my research by 2025 its plausible Tesla will have significantly Advanced FSD reliability and Regulatory approvals offering true autonomy and that's going to happen in many regions now even if they don't have 100% execution this is exactly why Dan fla said they still have to have a good strong core units business which is just Tesla's vehicle sales now I think those vehicle sales are going to do very well because you will notice that Elon Musk continues to innovate and continues to to drop the price of Tesla for every single vehicle he sells now this is genius because when you sell more Vehicles you can also tap into other things within those vehicles to create profit pools. The first one is a supercharge uh Network Tesla profits from its supercharger Network which charges you know basically Tesla's Vehicles all over you know the world and those generate a lot of recurring revenue for Tesla which is actually a huge profit pool for Tesla itself and creates that recurring Revenue a really strong even second profit pool is their High margins of software so Tesla earns additional Revenue through software subscriptions and upgrades such as you know full self-driving that's going to be so freaking huge I'm super super pumped up guys I'm buying this stock hand over fist bicep over tricep you already know we're trying to make all kinds of money and we're scaling this portfolio very fast and we're going to scale very quick in 2025 so I'm telling you last thing that I want to say or last three things I want to say I'm going to give you one more thing then I'm going to give you two plays okay first of all let me give you the plays real quick if you don't have time you're in a rush right I'm I'm making this video fast the 330 leap call option that I recommended for September I would say you can still hold that right now because every single day Tesla is going up like this is a $427 stock right now in the past one week alone it's up 15% and in the past 1 month we're up 33% I'm up 96% in this portfolio and this port I'm actually not sure what the return I'm up on but I bought the stock at $332 and now we're almost up a4100 that's in a short amount of time I do think that we're still going to have more room to run and that's essentially why I still recommend that right now you hold Tesla stock do not take profit yet I'm going to be running on Tesla I'm not taking profit too early that's that's some weak stuff if you take profit too early I mean you can listen if you have bills to pay you want to take the money out go for it but I'm holding 330 leap option that I recommended on YouTube and I'm holding the 350 leap option so congratulations I'm super excited and that's why we keep growing our positions here guys and we keep reinvesting back into the portfolio and one really important thing that I see happening with Tesla is their data First Advantage right they have more data than all the competitors so this company is going to continue to grow and and even Dan fla said that there's actually opportunities across the the whole Automotive Market things are changing really fast Tesla is going to benefit off of that now look in this portfolio I have Tesla at $218 per share makes up 10% of my portfolio and the other portfolio makes up a a much larger chunk of my personal worth in that other portfolio so I have a big bet on Tesla I say exactly what it is I'm sharing you exactly what I think I have the 300 cellp put I have the 220 cellp put these two things are pretty much useless and then the 420 call I made a mistake a little bit because you should be uncovered right now you should just be riding the profits continue to hold this 420 honestly I might even have to close this out right now I'm going to show you what a roll looks like real quick because you know I don't I do not want to lose Tesla absolutely not.

they still have some more room to run but you should also be in the high quality other tech companies we have snow we have mongod DB we have apple this is not as popular there's many stocks that you should be investing in because right now we're in a tech bull market.\nwhen I have high conviction you guys have seen I put a million dollars into Tesla this portfolio right here actually I'm going to scroll down I have a th000 shares of Tesla you saw that I had 3,000 shares in my other portfolio I put a million dollars into Tesla.\nI would actually run leaps and the wheel on Tesla on Nvidia on paler I would also diversify and do some of the more boring stuff I don't put out everything on on YouTube I do have some stuff that I do in my Discord as well as my one-on-one coaching some of the more boring stuff but I'll give you an example okay.\nI want to put some emphasis on on Tesla guys if you want to make $10,000 a month is super freaking easy right now in this market I have students that are making 50k 70k just everyday lawyers you know everyday doctors I get these are high paid professions but I have tons of Engineers that are not even high-end Engineers they're just regular computer programmers working yeah I get in California but after taxes yeah they make six figures but you know it's 100K 1 15K these are good salaries but they're making more off of options right now because in a bull run you can make 20 30k on a sixf figureure portfolio and I see it every single day it's actually life-changing money and if you can squeeze out this money in this bull market fantastic you're going to get to retirement soon and that's why I put a million into Tesla that's actually why I have $1.5 million in Tesla that was two days ago video I made I put 3,000 shares and 1,000 shares I had the 1,000 for a long time and 3,000 was a new addition to my portfolio and I don't have covered calls guys pay attention to that the number one option coach in the world is telling you not to do covered calls I love covered calls I'm always trying to generate income but I'm actually telling you right now focus on stocks focus on stocks not just option because okay leaps definitely but if you have stock leave your shares uncovered leave your shares uncovered what don't you understand this is a bull market covered calls will underperform in a bull market they they don't make sense that's why right now I'm pound here I don't have covered calls okay I don't have covered calls on Tesla I don't have covered calls on Nvidia like if I show you Nvidia position I have some sell puts right here on Tesla I just have straight up shares I've also sold puts I have Leaps uh on actually on Nvidia excuse me I do have well that's because my other positions on covers this portfolio has 500 shares and I have 148 covered call 146 which actually is going well these are out of the money options and I did make $111,000 so you know covered calls are okay but at least if you're going to do covered calls leave yourself some upside okay.\nI would do Tesla not I would I am I am guys I am I'm doing it I'm showing you everything TLA is going to be a $2 trillion company we have so much going on we have Robo taxis we have Elon musk's relationship with Donald Trump we have uh the you know Optimus stuff coming the robots we have vehicles I'm I'm in Dubai right now and I actually saw a cyber uh the Cyber truck okay I was I was blown back I'm like this design looks amazing actually I should have taken a picture of it but I was like blowing back I see McLaren's everywhere I see Rolls-Royce I see everything but I don't see any Bugattis in in Dubai actually I've been here for a few days I see the Cyber truck I'm like wow and actually you know what's interesting I see people in a parking lot taking pictures of the cybertruck not taking pictures of the McLaren because there is quite a lot of supercars here and it just it just proves the point that the unique design the unique approach the competitive advantage that Tesla has is still here okay and we also saw that with one of the analysts you guys got to pay attention if you want to really scale your portfolio right now use the option strategies to get to six figures seven Figures it's not just the option strategies themselves it's the stock selection and it's why you're choosing the stocks okay why have I picked so many winners cuz I pay attention and I do my research properly You see analysts right now completely flipping 180 degrees on Tesla like there was an analyst that said this is this is this is insane this is absolutely insane he said that Tesla doesn't is the same thing as Toyota they don't have any extra technology than Toyota has I'm like dude you kidding me Tesla has tons of data data that no other company has they have in-house basically insurance right they can give Insurance you know how profitable insurance is guys insurance is one of the most profitable businesses Tesla can ensure people themselves Tesla has way more technology they have oh my goodness I I don't even want to I don't I can talk about it too long listen let me keep going with the video I don't want to ramble here.\nI think there's many stupid analysts on Wall Street that haven't understood Tesla from the very beginning they were super wrong I've always been saying this on this channel when it comes to Tesla since 2021 that this is one of the biggest opportunities because it's an AI play and right now we're seeing the Tech Market uh that's Rising finally give Tesla the value that it's worth and I still think it's going to be a $500 stock in 2025.\nI would do a Tesla call option the leap option that I showed you guys in the uh two two days ago at the 350 strike price uh for September expiration okay.\nI'm up 81% on Tesla.\nwhen I told my parents to by Tesla back in the day they didn't listen to me and they bought it at like the top and then they didn't dollar cost average Tesla went down and they've been they've been like holding like bag holding essentially waiting for Tesla to rise up finally Tesla rose up and then they just sold it and they didn't I like I told them like just hold hold for like a decade I told my dad hold for a decade and AD doesn't listen to me I can't do anything everyone that joins me that listens to me scales 100K to 500k 500k to a million become people make $10,000 a month $20,000 a month with me but if they don't listen to me they they pay for the program they invest in my coaching they don't listen to me and it's very sometimes that happens you know and that's the only times I see students not succeeding because not everyone succeeds but the there's only one thing in common with everyone that doesn't succeed they start to follow their own stuff they start to ignore my time tested like tips like it's time I'm time tested guys I've done this for 10 years I have so much money I can't spend it financially I have other things in my life that I'm working on health relationships Faith other things that I'm working on right but when it comes to money if you're not listening to me you don't follow me I I know exactly what I'm doing it's silly not to in many ways so when I see students kind of going off the deep end getting really crazy about buying options or making risky plays into stocks that I don't like I hate to see it I hate to see it so and same thing with my parents like my dad just waited and then Tesla he broke even he made $10,000 he sold it like I made $10,000 but in the past few days he would have been up a lot more so you can't sell early that's the most important thing that's why I think having a mentor is so so important as well.\nyou can dollar cost average into the high quality stocks that I cover and you should be in in in pound here in Tesla and my number one rule is pick stocks that are rising right now because we're in such a bull market that you got to pick stocks that are rising and number two volatility is your friend my voice is given out so I actually had a lot more stuff that I'm going to cover but I'll cover it in the next video uh subscribe and uh I'm going to have a lot more fire and a lot more money that's going to flood your pockets with just cash coming so let's get that money invest safe let's be smart and I'll catch you guys in the next video so I'll see you thanks for watching"", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.9}, {""company"": ""Palantir"", ""excerpt"": ""I was early on Tesla early on paler early on Nvidia they still have some more room to run but you should also be in the high quality other tech companies we have snow we have mongod DB we have apple this is not as popular there's many stocks that you should be investing in

everything on on YouTube I do have some stuff that I do in my Discord as well as my one-on-one coaching some of the more boring stuff but I'll give you an example okay.\nPaler and Nvidia have also very strong fundamentals Paler experienced 30% Revenue growth and 44% us commercial growth in the last quarter which blew me back and I've been in this stock early okay so the strategies that I'm going to use you know I said three strategies I hope you don't mind I'm going to give you an extra strategy as well to make 10,000 or way more per month 10,000 just for the title I think you can do 20,000 30 ,000 depends on your personal portfolio I work with students typically at in the bottom end 50k but I typically do prefer you know 100K 150 20000 that's when you get the really awesome size portfolio and that's basically we just scale it's easy to scale at that point easy 50k is where you're just starting to be able to scale 100K it's like we're in full scaling mode and that's why a lot of a lot of my folks even Pilots you guys save good money it's easy to scale that it's actually easier than working at a job actively it's crazy because in a bull market your passive income were what should should be passive exceeds the active income and that's all through leap options because they give you that leverage with wheel options so with the wheel strategy I focus on going for higher Delta and really selling put options at that 40 Delta Mark and then three when it comes to really scaling using call options especially for earnings okay when we see a good earnings event or when we see a company about to report earnings yes there's High implied volatility and the IV is very high and after earnings there's typically an IV Crush but look the best strategy is being in the right stock using the right option strategy and the right option strategy which gives you the most upside is a call option okay so right now I'm going to show you something kind of interesting I could take a look at uh Nike I can also take a look at Nvidia Palance here Tesla snow um Sofi let's take a look at Sofi I have several other companies that I'm covering that I'm also really interested in I've been making a lot of money on look Sofi something like a Sofi right they're going to have earnings here they're going to report earnings on January 27th so there's some time however you can jump in with a call option early okay this will kind of be uh a call option that's a little bit shorter term it's not that short term but it doesn't qualify as a leap option either you can do February 21st expiration here now listen I think Sofi once they report earnings they end up blowing the earnings out of out of the water right they have good earnings expectations good guidance and CEO is confident then this stock can go way past $20 per share so check it out if you buy a call option like right here at the 16 strike you're going to pay $2 now your break even here is going to be about $18.16 so if Sofi ends up going to $20 per share after earnings you're going to double your money okay so $20 is only about 25% higher from Sofi right now because we're at 164 of 16 is four okay so 25% on Sofi will be $20 per share now look this call option at 16 will double so if you if you buy Sofi shares you know you get a 25% return but on a call option you will actually get 200% almost a 10 times difference it's an 8 times difference actually so you get an 8X leverage Factor you get 8X The Return by buying a call option on Sofi now I wouldn't dump all my money in this because you have to pay attention to risk management you have to be smart I would say you can just put in 2% of your money in this position so if you have 100K portfolio you know go ahead and buy $33,000 worth of call options maybe even $22,000 you know you go very conservative here but this is going to be a much smarter play especially in a bull market because if you can squeeze out 200% in just a couple months just think about it you take 100K to 200k or you take 200k to 400k in a short amount of time and that's just a short amount of time in in a bull market look you guys always wonder how did I scale so fast it's because I did take risk in 2021 I scaled 100K portfolio to $700,000 I used Tesla I use call options I use debit spreads I said I hope you don't mind I'm going to cover one more strategy it's going to be a debit spread so check out what a debit spread is okay so on Sofi I said that we can buy the 16 call option now look you can buy the 16 call option but if you think it's going to go up to 20 why not sell the $20 call option right so you buy the 16 but then you go ahead and sell the 20 and then there you go you get a subsidy you get your cost reduction right there because when you sell the $20 call option you get $89 in collected premium so you buy it for you know $216 then you get a rebate kind of I call it a rebate of $89 and all of a sudden here we get a call debit spread which gives us exactly what we think is going to happen which I think SOI is going to be a $20 stock post earnings there you go you have the 16 call option that you're long then you have a $20 call option that you sold and you get you get that upside with a lot lower cost so here essentially your maximum gain is $4 um but you're going to put up a total cost of $127 so if you think about the risk and return here you're risking about 127 bucks and you're total return here is about four is 400 exactly okay it's exactly 400 so you know that's over a 3X return okay I was talking about a 2X return now this is a 3X return where you take $125 into 400 so if you ask me even a smaller portfolio with 50k as a smaller portfolio or you know even 30k you have you have a small portfolio you you invest into this position you put up like $1,000 you do 10 10 contracts you put up $1,200 that 1,200 can go to $4,000 okay so that's something that I would do with the portion of my portfolio for sure now in 2021 when I was really scaling up I used a bit more for sure I had a little bit more risk but I also was very confident so it's kind of funny now because I'm kind of taking it full circle in 2021 I turned 100K into 700 and I just showed you guys in 2024 you know I started off the year I don't know in January I was around you know maybe 2.2 million now I'm at 4.2 so I definitely I'm over 50% return this year and that's all because I'm taking calculated risk I'm in the right stocks I'm I'm in Palance here I should have had a higher return because I picked pal here properly I picked Nvidia I'm actually disappointed with my return I beat S&amp;P 500 I've done very well and I made students tons of money I have doctors that don't want to be doctors anymore they don't want to work in the ER they don't want to I have nurses that are like ah I'm just too tired and and these are I have physician assistants these guys make a lot of money or nurse practitioners I have Engineers that are working in Silicon Valley and they're like I don't want to work anymore I actually hit some of my financial figures that I didn't think I was going to hit for a few years they hit it early with with the plays that I'm putting out and you know on Discord we're just having we're having a big celebration but I'm actually a little bit disappointed I actually have to admit to myself that I could have done better and that's that's just how trading is I can always do better there's always things that I'm learning all right so when I'm looking at call debit spreads what I just showed you right here you know this is a no-brainer this is a no-brainer play with part of my money I would definitely do this I would do a Tesla call option the leap option that I showed you guys in the uh two two days ago at the 350 strike price uh for September expiration okay.\nI'm up 256% on palen here these are positions the Walmart position is a bit more boring but guys boring can make money listen don't just Chase hype if you really want to scale from 100K to 200k you have to actually have diversity in your portfolio because it is about risk management what good is it if you scale 100K to even 500k if you five extra money what good is it if you go down from 500 all the way down to 200 or 100 okay you have to scale properly you have to scale using wisdom you have to learn I'm telling you in a good Market you guys you don't learn that much people unfortunately learn in a bad Market learn from me take the opinions the advice I'm giving you I'm obviously not a financial adviser I'm not licensed I enjoy being a coach I enjoy helping people one-on-one so I'm just a guy in the internet that's really achieved a lot very fast when it comes to trading because of my strategy my hard work intelligence whatever you want to call it right but I'm telling you be smart and scale properly because there's no good scaling if it's inconsistent scale okay so stocks Amazon I'm up good money on Amazon on PayPal 38% uh Target I I made a mistake however I did point out in my Discord and I actually ignored my own advice I said buy a call option on target at0 that call option more than tripled in value I really regret not taking my own trade so 99% of the time I eat my own cooking but sometimes on Discord I said hey guys here's my opinion this is a good idea I have like on Archer one of you guys actually emailed me and gave me a tip on Archer so thank you to that person this is the only stock I actually invested in that was not my own research Archer someone told me about it and I guess they were watch I guess that trade may have came from Kathy Wood I'm not sure but I do read your guys emails I will leave my email down below if you're interested in joining 101 coaching um you can email me as well we do have 10 spots right now that we have open American Airlines we got the 35 I have 35% but this is not even representative because what I've been doing in American Airlines and the way I've actually made $10,000 a month I scaled my portfolio is also with American Airlines it might seem funny to you you're like he it's just an Airlines it goes up and down you will be shocked by how much money you can make by selling puts and covered calls and just running the wheel strategy on American Airlines I'm sorry this video is getting long but I hope I'm dropping so many knowledge bombs for you I hope I'm dropping so many gold nuggets for you that make you realize that the money is so abundant in this market and not just in this market American Airlines let me actually finish off with these three Square Chipotle have spy and Nvidia let actually go into American Airlines because I'm going to show you that you can print money with leaps actually leaps has been good on American Airlines too lately because uh the three month chart is absolutely ridiculous okay now um my community and I we bought American Airlines at$ 12289 but we've been selling we've been selling puts and calls for a long time 13 puts 14 puts as you can see here this is exactly what I've been recommending to like literally everybody as well as covered calls so I have 10 covered calls I have 1 th000 shares I'm a little bit silly here on American Airlines because right now I'm actually not making money I'm going to have to roll this position higher to make more money and I'm I'm fully invested in my portfolio and other picks so on American Airlines I really should I'm going to add to my position I'm going to add to my position this week and I'm going to have to be very smart about this because as you can see we actually have like sideways action on American Airlines so the big question and what I'm going to try to figure out this week is is this sideways action something that's going to be sustained this is something that I'm going to have to do some qualitative and quantitative analysis on and try to understand for myself are we going to to run the wheel strategy selling puts covered calls Etc cuz direction is very important you get direction right in this market you can become a millionaire like we actually are making millionaires right now because a lot of folks that come to me have bigger size portfolios of folks have 500k they start with 500k basically like I started with 2 mil now they're at a million I'm at 4 mil okay it's it's scaling guys it's all about scaling whatever you think is uh not possible it's absolutely possible you just have to have the right strategy and you have to understand how the market works you pick the right stocks some stocks go up 10x 20x right it really depends and the reason why I don't have 10x returns is because I'm extremely conservative but even in a conservative even me being conservative I still done fantastically well so this strategy of momentum is really important to understand with leaps with covered calls and with buying options buying options especially if you can buy some call options and momentum is on your side you're going to print money you're going to make you're going to make some some real paper I I got some durhams here for for my taxi I'm going out to dinner soon so you can make you can literally print money print money like these guys in Dubai who have oil money you know they make a million dollars a day some of these people here right they're not my clients they already have so much money they're only focused on spending money if you want to get to that point I'm telling you first of all subscribe because everything I've been putting out here has been fired I've been more fire and Dan Hive crazy actually I'm really proud of myself and I want to stay humble because you know it's not me you know it's it's because of God I'm blessed I'm happy that I have this opportunity to do my passion and in contribute to the world so I'm happy that I can financially benefit and also financially just create opportunities for other people it's you know although I'm being cocky I also want to tell myself that I'm grateful I'm grateful for what I have and I'm I'm very grateful for you guys as well now look let me get to a little bit more of the knowledge and the value you want to diversify beyond the main stock picks that I have it's important to manage your position sizes it's also really important to avoid overly aggressive tactics you guys that are getting overly cocky I do get some of these calls um my team helps me with uh many of my calls right because I like being a coach when it comes to learning about my program it's free to to have a consultation and we do get some people that say I'm very confident right now I I made a million dollars because of Henry's pick what else is there left well there's a lot of things left first of all I do have I tell them there's plays that you're making uh that I'm making that you're not aware of that's one number two it's all about risk management it's all about protecting your wealth if you're already making 10 to 20% a month right now in this market congratulations but you also have to prepare to protect yourself when the when the times get tough and that's you can't get overly aggressive you can't start using tactics like just buying call options getting overly leveraged into them that's very bad okay so you want to stay safe you want to stay consistent and you can Skyrocket your portfolio a lot you can make $10,000 a month you can easily scale six figures to you know from 100K to 500k in this market you know my parents they've actually done kind of a bad job in this market it's because um my parents like hard assets more so my mom and my dad they believe more in like real estate and having hard assets and when I told my parents to by Tesla back in the day they didn't listen to me and they bought it at like the top and then they didn't dollar cost average Tesla went down and they've been they've been like holding like bag holding essentially waiting for Tesla to rise up finally Tesla rose up and then they just sold it and they didn't I like I told them like just hold hold for like a decade I told my dad hold for a decade and AD doesn't listen to me I can't do anything everyone that joins me that listens to me scales 100K to 500k 500k to a million become people make $10,000 a month $20,000 a month with me but if they don't listen to me they they pay for the program they invest in my coaching they don't listen to me and it's very sometimes that happens you know and that's the only times I see students not succeeding because not everyone succeeds but the there's only one thing in common with everyone that doesn't succeed they start to follow their own stuff they start to ignore my time tested like tips like it's time I'm time tested guys I've done this for 10 years I have so much money I can't spend it financially I have other things in my life that I'm working on health relationships Faith other things that I'm working on right but when it comes to money if you're not listening to me you don't follow me I I know exactly what I'm doing it's silly not to in many ways so when I see students kind of going off the deep end getting really crazy about buying options or making risky plays into stocks that I don't like I hate to see it I hate to see it so and same thing with my parents like my dad just waited and then Tesla he broke even he made $10,000 he sold it like I made $10,000 but in the past few days he would have been up a lot more so you can't sell early that's the most important thing that's why I think having a mentor is so so important as well I have mentors I have tons of mentors that I paid for I paid over a million dollars I sent out Anil email I recently sent an email you guys can join the free email list I just said thanks I was just grateful and and I just said Thank you guys and I sent a long email about my values and what I believe in and why I'm doing this why I I think this is my mission my calling to help people trade options and get financially free I sent out an email so you can join that free email list in the description I have a first link for coaching second link is um my uh my free email list that's that's it I don't have sponsors or anything like that I just I don't do this for the money I do get paid from coaching I have a team they have families to feed but this is is absolutely not about money it's nice I like money but I like helping people more you know there if I got offered $100 million to become CEO of Microsoft I would decline I don't need the money I'm doing what I love I'm doing what I enjoy and I when I see you guys getting results I see people scaling there's nothing better than that when I see people scaling there's nothing better than that I feel like that gives a lot of people freedom and freedom and and having more finances improves your family life it can improve your health it can improve your time management it gives you more time to do what you want to do and not be dependent on on having a boss so I really I really realized that that I became a better option Trader actually uh and this is kind of like a catch 22 but I realized that I became a better option Trader when I had enough money that I wasn't really concerned about it anymore which actually allowed me to take on more risk so you know look I don't blame you guys when um sometimes uh people take it too easy on the trades and sometimes people take it too hard on the trades and they say they just buy a lot of options and they they want to go to the Moon too fast it's all about balance guys you can't be you can't be too safe if you're trying to be too safe sure you're going to get the S&P 500 return I mean we're not here to get S&P 00 return guys we're here to beat the S&P we're here to scale we're here to do things in the market that are unimaginable we're here to get 1% results you know I'm probably like 0.1% results and it's not easy you know it honestly does take a toll on me to always research these stocks and to bring these videos to you guys but listen the reason I work so hard is because I believe in this stuff and I eat my own cooking this is the reason why I work so hard and I show everything every single opportunity every single trade I basically have I I share it live like my Monday and Wednesday calls I do everything live it's all posted live like this is the trade that I made my Discord soon say thanks they take it so one thing that I the reason why I brought up my dad is because he made the mistake of not dollar cost averaging and I think a lot of you guys need to understand that you can dollar cost average with options you can dollar cost average into the high quality stocks that I cover and you should be in in in pound here in Tesla and my number one rule is pick stocks that are rising right now because we're in such a bull market that you got to pick stocks that are rising and number two volatility is your friend my voice is given out so I actually had a lot more stuff that I'm going to cover but I'll cover it in the next video uh subscribe and uh I'm going to have a lot more fire and a lot more money that's going to flood your pockets with just cash coming so let's get

""I was early on Tesla early on paler early on Nvidia they still have some more room to run but you should also be in the high quality other tech companies we have snow we have mongod DB we have apple this is not as popular there's many stocks that you should be investing in because right now we're in a tech bull market.\nI put a million into Nvidia I put a million dollars on Apple I have quite a lot of money right now at stake and I'm being 100% transparent on what I have and I want to tell you that the fastest way to scale from six figures or let's say you got $100,000 you want to scale it to 250k 500k and eventually seven figures all this really involves is having a lot of your money in wheel some of your money in leaps okay.\nI'll go to Nvidia because I do think Nvidia is a good opportunity right now for doing a leap option The stocks at $141 $142 per share I do have a decent Siz position in this portfolio I have a million dollars in my other portfolio in Nvidia as well so look September is the expiration so I'm going to go for September 19 202 25 that gives you a lot of uh time a leap options a one-ear option typically but 9 months is Leap to me okay leap is just a long-term call option it's just a definition so don't worry about it too much so look I actually have the 130 um leap actually so it ends that's 69 Del so this is perfect the volatility here is 49% the volume is 88 that's really good uh that's a good volume and open interest is very huge actually this leap call option on Nvidia is fantastic okay this right here means that if Nvidia were to go up let's say by September remember Nvidia went up to $240 per share okay that's a bit of a stretch okay but I'm just giving you an example here my price target for NVIDIA is like 180 all right so let's just say we went to $240 went up to by $100 the stock going up $100 is roughly like a 70% return or so from the stock perspective if you were to be a shareholder in in just a stock okay however if the option the way it would behave if the stock went up $100 is the option would go up by $70 and that's because this zela right here is 69 the option would be roughly you know give or take there is some differences as as the um as the price goes up the Delta will also increase but roughly it'll go up by about $70 as well which actually on the stock going up $100 that's a 70% return but the option will move by 70 however this is the crazy part I really want you to think about this the premium that you pay is 32 so 32 will turn to 100 you will triple your money okay the stock goes up 70% % the leap call option goes up 300% 70% equals 300% that is why a leap option is so powerful it gives you that leverage.\nI would actually run leaps and the wheel on Tesla on Nvidia on paler I would also diversify and do some of the more boring stuff I don't put out everything on on YouTube I do have some stuff that I do in my Discord as well as my one-on-one coaching some of the more boring stuff but I'll give you an example okay Apple right big company most people are not paying too much close attention to it Google Google I just showed you I'm up a ton of money on Google Chipotle is another really big play that I made money but look I'm I don't want to talk about single stocks too much what I want to talk about is how to actually make $10,000 per month what strategies do we use how do we manage those strategies and you'll talk a little bit about stocks as well here's what I want to cover a long-term leap option is what you should focus on right now long-term leaps are the number one strategy in this market environment because it allows you to control 100 shares for a fraction of the cost and it gives you massive upside guys you want that massive massive upside in this market that's that's where it's all at now look when I go for a leap option what I'm trying to do is I'm going to tell you a secret the leap Delta should be 70 Delta okay not 80 not 90 although my mentor says 90 have a mentor on Walsh stre I'm still in touch with he likes 90 I'll tell you why he likes 90 I'll tell you why I like 70 all right I like 70 personally because the 70 Delta means that when the stock goes up a dollar your option goes up 70 all right let me show you an example actually I'll go to Nvidia because I do think Nvidia is a good opportunity right now for doing a leap option The stocks at $141 $142 per share I do have a decent Siz position in this portfolio I have a million dollars in my other portfolio in Nvidia as well so look September is the expiration so I'm going to go for September 19 202 25 that gives you a lot of uh time a leap options a one-ear option typically but 9 months is Leap to me okay leap is just a long-term call option it's just a definition so don't worry about it too much so look I actually have the 130 um leap actually so it ends that's 69 Del so this is perfect the volatility here is 49% the volume is 88 that's really good uh that's a good volume and open interest is very huge actually this leap call option on Nvidia is fantastic okay this right here means that if Nvidia were to go up let's say by September remember Nvidia went up to $240 per share okay that's a bit of a stretch okay but I'm just giving you an example here my price target for NVIDIA is like 180 all right so let's just say we went to $240 went up to by $100 the stock going up $100 is roughly like a 70% return or so from the stock perspective if you were to be a shareholder in in just a stock okay however if the option the way it would behave if the stock went up $100 is the option would go up by $70 and that's because this zela right here is 69 the option would be roughly you know give or take there is some differences as as the um as the price goes up the Delta will also increase but roughly it'll go up by about $70 as well which actually on the stock going up $100 that's a 70% return but the option will move by 70 however this is the crazy part I really want you to think about this the premium that you pay is 32 so 32 will turn to 100 you will triple your money okay the stock goes up 70% % the leap call option goes up 300% 70% equals 300% that is why a leap option is so powerful it gives you that leverage.\nI don't have covered calls on Nvidia like if I show you Nvidia position I have some sell puts right here on Tesla I just have straight up shares I've also sold puts I have Leaps uh on actually on Nvidia excuse me I do have well that's because my other positions on covers this portfolio has 500 shares and I have 148 covered call 146 which actually is going well these are out of the money options and I did make $111,000 so you know covered calls are okay but at least if you're going to do covered calls leave yourself some upside okay.\nPaler and Nvidia have also very strong fundamentals Paler experienced 30% Revenue growth and 44% us commercial growth in the last quarter which blew me back and I've been in this stock early okay so the strategies that I'm going to use you know I said three strategies I hope you don't mind I'm going to give you an extra strategy as well to make 10,000 or way more per month 10,000 just for the title I think you can do 20,000 30 ,000 depends on your personal portfolio I work with students typically at in the bottom end 50k but I typically do prefer you know 100K 150 20000 that's when you get the really awesome size portfolio and that's basically we just scale it's easy to scale at that point easy 50k is where you're just starting to be able to scale 100K it's like we're in full scaling mode and that's why a lot of a lot of my folks even Pilots you guys save good money it's easy to scale that it's actually easier than working at a job actively it's crazy because in a bull market your passive income were what should should be passive exceeds the active income and that's all through leap options because they give you that leverage with wheel options so with the wheel strategy I focus on going for higher Delta and really selling put options at that 40 Delta Mark and then three when it comes to really scaling using call options especially for earnings okay when we see a good earnings event or when we see a company about to report earnings yes there's High implied volatility and the IV is very high and after earnings there's typically an IV Crush but look the best strategy is being in the right stock using the right option strategy and the right option strategy which gives you the most upside is a call option okay so right now I'm going to show you something kind of interesting I could take a look at uh Nike I can also take a look at Nvidia Palance here Tesla snow um Sofi let's take a look at Sofi I have several other companies that I'm covering that I'm also really interested in I've been making a lot of money on look Sofi something like a Sofi right they're going to have earnings here they're going to report earnings on January 27th so there's some time however you can jump in with a call option early okay this will kind of be uh a call option that's a little bit shorter term it's not that short term but it doesn't qualify as a leap option either you can do February 21st expiration here now listen I think Sofi once they report earnings they end up blowing the earnings out of out of the water right they have good earnings expectations good guidance and CEO is confident then this stock can go way past $20 per share so check it out if you buy a call option like right here at the 16 strike you're going to pay $2 now your break even here is going to be about $18.16 so if Sofi ends up going to $20 per share after earnings you're going to double your money okay so $20 is only about 25% higher from Sofi right now because we're at 164 of 16 is four okay so 25% on Sofi will be $20 per share now look this call option at 16 will double so if you if you buy Sofi shares you know you get a 25% return but on a call option you will actually get 200% almost a 10 times difference it's an 8 times difference actually so you get an 8X leverage Factor you get 8X The Return by buying a call option on Sofi now I wouldn't dump all my money in this because you have to pay attention to risk management you have to be smart I would say you can just put in 2% of your money in this position so if you have 100K portfolio you know go ahead and buy $33,000 worth of call options maybe even $22,000 you know you go very conservative here but this is going to be a much smarter play especially in a bull market because if you can squeeze out 200% in just a couple months just think about it you take 100K to 200k or you take 200k to 400k in a short amount of time and that's just a short amount of time in in a bull market look you guys always wonder how did I scale so fast it's because I did take risk in 2021 I scaled 100K portfolio to $700,000 I used Tesla I use call options I use debit spreads I said I hope you don't mind I'm going to cover one more strategy it's going to be a debit spread so check out what a debit spread is okay so on Sofi I said that we can buy the 16 call option now look you can buy the 16 call option but if you think it's going to go up to 20 why not sell the $20 call option right so you buy the 16 but then you go ahead and sell the 20 and then there you go you get a subsidy you get your cost reduction right there because when you sell the $20 call option you get $89 in collected premium so you buy it for you know $216 then you get a rebate kind of I call it a rebate of $89 and all of a sudden here we get a call debit spread which gives us exactly what we think is going to happen which I think SOI is going to be a $20 stock post earnings there you go you have the 16 call option that you're long then you have a $20 call option that you sold and you get you get that upside with a lot lower cost so here essentially your maximum gain is $4 um but you're going to put up a total cost of $127 so if you think about the risk and return here you're risking about 127 bucks and you're total return here is about four is 400 exactly okay it's exactly 400 so you know that's over a 3X return okay I was talking about a 2X return now this is a 3X return where you take $125 into 400 so if you ask me even a smaller portfolio with 50k as a smaller portfolio or you know even 30k you have you have a small portfolio you you invest into this position you put up like $1,000 you do 10 10 contracts you put up $1,200 that 1,200 can go to $4,000 okay so that's something that I would do with the portion of my portfolio for sure now in 2021 when I was really scaling up I used a bit more for sure I had a little bit more risk but I also was very confident so it's kind of funny now because I'm kind of taking it full circle in 2021 I turned 100K into 700 and I just showed you guys in 2024 you know I started off the year I don't know in January I was around you know maybe 2.2 million now I'm at 4.2 so I definitely I'm over 50% return this year and that's all because I'm taking calculated risk I'm in the right stocks I'm I'm in Palance here I should have had a higher return because I picked pal here properly I picked Nvidia I'm actually disappointed with my return I beat S&amp;P 500 I've done very well and I made students tons of money I have doctors that don't want to be doctors anymore they don't want to work in the ER they don't want to I have nurses that are like ah I'm just too tired and and these are I have physician assistants these guys make a lot of money or nurse practitioners I have Engineers that are working in Silicon Valley and they're like I don't want to work anymore I actually hit some of my financial figures that I didn't think I was going to hit for a few years they hit it early with with the plays that I'm putting out and you know on Discord we're just having we're having a big celebration but I'm actually a little bit disappointed I actually have to admit to myself that I could have done better and that's that's just how trading is I can always do better there's always things that I'm learning all right so when I'm looking at call debit spreads what I just showed you right here you know this is a no-brainer this is a no-brainer play with part of my money I would definitely do this I would do a Tesla call option the leap option that I showed you guys in the uh two two days ago at the 350 strike price uh for September expiration okay.\nAmerican Airlines let me actually finish off with these three Square Chipotle have spy and Nvidia let actually go into American Airlines because I'm going to show you that you can print money with leaps actually leaps has been good on American Airlines too lately because uh the three month chart is absolutely ridiculous okay now um my community and I we bought American Airlines at$ 12289 but we've been selling we've been selling puts and calls for a long time 13 puts 14 puts as you can see here this is exactly what I've been recommending to like literally everybody as well as covered calls so I have 10 covered calls I have 1 th000 shares I'm a little bit silly here on American Airlines because right now I'm actually not making money I'm going to have to roll this position higher to make more money and I'm I'm fully invested in my portfolio and other picks so on American Airlines I really should I'm going to add to my position I'm going to add to my position this week and I'm going to have to be very smart about this because as you can see we actually have like sideways action on American Airlines so the big question and what I'm going to try to figure out this week is is this sideways action something that's going to be sustained this is something that I'm going to have to do some qualitative and quantitative analysis on and try to understand for myself are we going to to run the wheel strategy selling puts covered calls Etc cuz direction is very important you get direction right in this market you can become a millionaire like we actually are making millionaires right now because a lot of folks that come to me have bigger size portfolios of folks have 500k they start with 500k basically like I started with 2 mil now they're at a million I'm at 4 mil okay it's it's scaling guys it's all about scaling whatever you think is uh not possible it's absolutely possible you just have to have the right strategy and you have to understand how the market works you pick the right stocks some stocks go up 10x 20x right it really depends and the reason why I don't have 10x returns is because I'm extremely conservative but even in a conservative even me being conservative I still done fantastically well so this strategy of momentum is really important to understand with leaps with covered calls and with buying options buying options especially if you can buy some call options and momentum is on your side you're going to print money you're going to make you're going to make some some real paper I I got some durhams here for for my taxi I'm going out to dinner soon so you can make you can literally print money print money like these guys in Dubai who have oil money you know they make a million dollars a day some of these people here right they're not my clients they already have so much money they're only focused on spending money if you want to get to that point I'm telling you first of all subscribe because everything I've been putting out here has been fired I've been more fire and Dan Hive crazy actually I'm really proud of myself and I want to stay humble because you know it's not me you know it's it's because of God I'm blessed I'm happy that I have this opportunity to do my passion and in contribute to the world so I'm happy that I can financially benefit and also financially just create opportunities for other people it's you know although I'm being cocky I also want to tell myself that I'm grateful I'm grateful for what I have and I'm I'm very grateful for you guys as well now look let me get to a little bit more of the knowledge and the value you want to diversify beyond the main stock picks that I have it's important to manage your position sizes it's also really important to avoid overly aggressive tactics you guys that are getting overly cocky I do get some of these calls um my team helps me with uh many of my calls right because I like being a coach when it comes to learning about my program it's free to to have a consultation and we do get some people that say I'm very confident right now I I made a million dollars because of Henry's pick what else is there left well there's a lot of things left first of all I do have I tell them there's plays that you're making uh that I'm making that you're not aware of that's one number two it's all about risk management it's all about protecting your wealth if you're already making 10 to 20% a month right now in this market congratulations but you also have to prepare to protect yourself when the when the times get tough and that's you can't get overly aggressive you can't start using tactics like just buying call options getting overly leveraged into them that's very bad okay so you want to stay safe you want to stay consistent and you can Skyrocket your portfolio a lot you can make $10,000 a month you can easily scale six figures to you know from 100K to 500k in this market you know my parents they've actually done kind of a bad job in this market it's because um my parents like hard assets more so my mom and my dad they believe more in like real estate and having hard assets and when I told my parents to by Tesla back in the day they didn't listen to me and they bought it at like the top and then they didn't dollar cost average Tesla went down and they've been they've been like holding like bag holding essentially waiting for Tesla to rise up finally Tesla rose up and then they just sold it and they didn't I like I told them like just hold hold for like a decade I told my dad hold for a decade and AD doesn't listen to me I can't do anything everyone that joins me that listens to me scales 100K to 500k 500k to a million become people make $10,000 a month $20,000 a month with me but if they don't listen to me they they pay for the program they invest in my coaching they don't listen to me and it's very sometimes that happens you know and that's the only times I see students not succeeding because not everyone succeeds but the there's only one thing in common with everyone that doesn't succeed they start to follow their own stuff they start to ignore my time tested like tips like it's time I'm time tested guys I've done this for 10 years I have so much money I can't spend it financially I have other things in my life that I'm working on health relationships Faith other things that I'm working on right but when it comes to money if you're not listening to me you don't follow me I I know exactly what I'm doing it's silly not to in many ways so when I see students kind of going off the deep end getting really crazy about buying options or making risky plays into stocks that I don't like I hate to see it I hate to see it so and same thing with my parents like my dad just waited and then Tesla he broke even he made $10,000 he sold it like I made $10,000 but in the past few days he would have been up a lot more so you can't sell early that's the most important thing that's why I think having a mentor is so so important as well I have mentors I have tons of mentors that I paid for I paid over a million dollars I sent out Anil email I recently sent an email you guys can join the free email list I just said thanks I was just grateful and and I just said Thank you guys and I sent a long email about my values and what I believe in and why I'm doing this why I I think this is my mission my calling to help people trade options and get financially free I sent out an email so you can join that free email list in the description I have a first link for coaching second link is um my uh my free email list that's that's it I don't have sponsors or anything like that I just I don't do this for the money I do get paid from coaching I have a team they have families to feed but this is is absolutely not about money it's nice I like money but I like helping people more you know there if I got offered $100 million to become CEO of Microsoft I would decline I don't need the money I'm doing what I love I'm doing what I enjoy and I when I see you guys getting results I see people scaling there's nothing better than that when I see people scaling there's nothing better than that I feel like that gives a lot of people freedom and freedom and and having more finances improves your family life it can improve your health it can improve your time management it gives you more time to do what you want to do and not be dependent on on having a boss so I really I really realized that that I became a better option Trader actually uh and this is kind of like a catch 22 but I realized that I became a better option Trader when I had enough money that I wasn't really concerned about it anymore which actually allowed me to take on more risk so you know look I don't blame you guys when um sometimes uh people take it too easy on the trades and sometimes people take it too hard on the trades and they say they just buy a lot of options and they they want to go to the Moon too fast it's all about balance guys you can't be you can't be too safe if you're trying to be too safe sure you're going to get the S&P 500 return I mean we're not here to get S&P 00 return guys we're here to beat the S&P we're here to scale we're here to do things in the market that are unimaginable we're here to get 1% results you know I'm probably like 0.1% results and it's not easy you know it honestly does take a toll on me to always research these stocks and to bring these videos to you guys but listen the reason I work so hard is because I believe in this stuff and I eat my own cooking this is the reason why I work so hard and I show everything every single opportunity every single trade I basically have I I share it live like my Monday and Wednesday calls I do everything live it's all posted live like this is the trade that I made my Discord soon say thanks they take it so one thing that I the reason why I brought up my dad is because he made the mistake of not dollar cost averaging and I think a lot of you guys need to understand that you can dollar cost average with options you can dollar cost average into the high quality stocks that I cover and you should be in in in pound here in Tesla and my number one rule is pick stocks that are rising right now because we're in such a bull market that you got to pick stocks that are rising and number two volatility is your friend my voice is given out so I actually had a lot more stuff that I'm going to cover but I'll cover it in the next video uh subscribe and uh I'm going to have a lot more fire and a lot more money that's going to flood your pockets with just cash coming so let's get that money invest safe let's be smart and I'll catch you guys in the next video so I'll see you thanks for watching"", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.8}, {""company"": ""Snowflake"", ""excerpt"": ""I was

""excerpt"": ""we have apple this is not as popular there's many stocks that you should be investing in because right now we're in a tech bull market.\nI put a million dollars on Apple I have quite a lot of money right now at stake and I'm being 100% transparent on what I have and I want to tell you that the fastest way to scale from six figures or let's say you got $100,000 you want to scale it to 250k 500k and eventually seven figures all this really involves is having a lot of your money in wheel some of your money in leaps okay leaps on the high quality companies with high momentum okay you already know what's high momentum I covered that on this channel and then buying call options because in a bull run what happens is I okay look it's kind of like if you drop an apple from the 30th floor right as soon as you drop it it's not really moving that fast but as it keeps falling it increases and increases and then at the very end it's going fast as heck right because gravity is pulling it and it's increasing in speed okay that's the same thing with the stock market it's kind of like math okay as it goes up it goes up slowly but then at the bull market we get a really big upward swing okay that's what's happening right now we're in this big upward swing a lot of people are very cautious and they're asking me you know are we going to pull back the thing is we will pull back I don't know when I'm not going to be like pretending that I'm know but what I do know is we can squeeze out another 10 15 or 20% profit in this bull market you must do that because if you don't do that when the pullback happens you don't have enough gains to even protect yourself if you double your money right you go from 100K to 200 or let's say 250k in a year in a big bull market and then the market pulls back 20% you go from a quarter mil down to 200 and you basically call it quits you get out of all these stocks you get out of some option positions and you close properly and you adapt to the market you go into defensive plays I have a lot of stuff that I'm going to cover here with managing leaps and stuff but let's just say you adjust you lost 50k you might say oh well Henry's not that good you just can't predict when the market will pull back when it does you can't you can't immediately react to it you have to understand why it's why it's going to go down and look if you went from 100K to 250k you can afford a 50k loss and then you basically call it you know basically go to defensive sector when we get a pullback I don't think it's going to happen though up up until maybe later in 2025 but definitely not in the first quarter I think we're going to have a continued bull market so when you go to from 100 to 250 go back down to 200 that's cool you just doubled your money that's basically what I'm trying to go after right now I went from three to four I'm at 4.2 I'm trying to get to five I'm trying to get to 5 million and honestly this only involves the wheel and jumping into leaps and leaps don't have to be aggressive okay I'm going to show you several leaps several plays actually this Google uh call option right here is something really interesting because Google isn't like the sexiest Company on YouTube a lot of people you know you guys want me to cover the sexiest companies but I want to tell you that the boring stuff can also make a lot of money like Google let me show you actually bought October 21st so this is like 6 weeks week ago I actually dumped $20,000 into this position and so far this position is worth $33,000 I'm up a lot of money the reason why this MAF doesn't actually check out it's 20K was because I actually did a poor man's covered call but in this market I'm not even recommending Poor Man's covered calls guys you want to be in leaps you want to go full betting mode where you bet that the stock will go up you don't want to do poor man's covered calls this is not a market for covered calls either this is a market to be long this is a market where you make money hand over fist like I've been saying that's what we've been doing we're trying to reap as much as possible possible look when it comes to like a long-term call option what I would do right now is I would go for September expiration so essentially a long-term leap option I'll let me show you a quick example and this is actually the perfect example on Google you can still take notes here you can still copy this trade it's not too late now obviously I put out this trade in my Discord Community early when I first opened it up back in October but this trade right here I'm up about 10K because I did sell um covered calls actually on the leap uh to begin with I would still say this is a good position so so take some notes Here the bid ass spread is is good obviously I'm recording this on on the weekend the Market's not open right now but come Monday I'm going to probably be buying some more leap options you know Google is a really good one Google's a fantastic one I made a lot of money on several different plays here as you can see on my screen uh Chipotle is another really big play that I made money but look I'm I don't want to talk about single stocks too much what I want to talk about is how to actually make $10,000 per month what strategies do we use how do we manage those strategies and you'll talk a little bit about stocks as well here's what I want to cover a long-term leap option is what you should focus on right now long-term leaps are the number one strategy in this market environment because it allows you to control 100 shares for a fraction of the cost and it gives you massive upside guys you want that massive massive upside in this market that's that's where it's all at now look when I go for a leap option what I'm trying to do is I'm going to tell you a secret the leap Delta should be 70 Delta okay not 80 not 90 although my mentor says 90 have a mentor on Walsh stre I'm still in touch with he likes 90 I'll tell you why he likes 90 I'll tell you why I like 70 all right I like 70 personally because the 70 Delta means that when the stock goes up a dollar your option goes up 70 all right let me show you an example actually I'll go to Nvidia because I do think Nvidia is a good opportunity right now for doing a leap option The stocks at $141 $142 per share I do have a decent Siz position in this portfolio I have a million dollars in my other portfolio in Nvidia as well so look September is the expiration so I'm going to go for September 19 202 25 that gives you a lot of uh time a leap options a one-ear option typically but 9 months is Leap to me okay leap is just a long-term call option it's just a definition so don't worry about it too much so look I actually have the 130 um leap actually so it ends that's 69 Del so this is perfect the volatility here is 49% the volume is 88 that's really good uh that's a good volume and open interest is very huge actually this leap call option on Nvidia is fantastic okay this right here means that if Nvidia were to go up let's say by September remember Nvidia went up to $240 per share okay that's a bit of a stretch okay but I'm just giving you an example here my price target for NVIDIA is like 180 all right so let's just say we went to $240 went up to by $100 the stock going up $100 is roughly like a 70% return or so from the stock perspective if you were to be a shareholder in in just a stock okay however if the option the way it would behave if the stock went up $100 is the option would go up by $70 and that's because this zela right here is 69 the option would be roughly you know give or take there is some differences as as the um as the price goes up the Delta will also increase but roughly it'll go up by about $70 as well which actually on the stock going up $100 that's a 70% return but the option will move by 70 however this is the crazy part I really want you to think about this the premium that you pay is 32 so 32 will turn to 100 you will triple your money okay the stock goes up 70% % the leap call option goes up 300% 70% equals 300% that is why a leap option is so powerful it gives you that leverage.\nApple right big company most people are not paying too much close attention to it Google Google I just showed you I'm up a ton of money on Google Chipotle is another really big play that I made money but look I'm I don't want to talk about single stocks too much what I want to talk about is how to actually make $10,000 per month what strategies do we use how do we manage those strategies and you'll talk a little bit about stocks as well here's what I want to cover a long-term leap option is what you should focus on right now long-term leaps are the number one strategy in this market environment because it allows you to control 100 shares for a fraction of the cost and it gives you massive upside guys you want that massive massive upside in this market that's that's where it's all at now look when I go for a leap option what I'm trying to do is I'm going to tell you a secret the leap Delta should be 70 Delta okay not 80 not 90 although my mentor says 90 have a mentor on Walsh stre I'm still in touch with he likes 90 I'll tell you why he likes 90 I'll tell you why I like 70 all right I like 70 personally because the 70 Delta means that when the stock goes up a dollar your option goes up 70 all right let me show you an example actually I'll go to Nvidia because I do think Nvidia is a good opportunity right now for doing a leap option The stocks at $141 $142 per share I do have a decent Siz position in this portfolio I have a million dollars in my other portfolio in Nvidia as well so look September is the expiration so I'm going to go for September 19 202 25 that gives you a lot of uh time a leap options a one-ear option typically but 9 months is Leap to me okay leap is just a long-term call option it's just a definition so don't worry about it too much so look I actually have the 130 um leap actually so it ends that's 69 Del so this is perfect the volatility here is 49% the volume is 88 that's really good uh that's a good volume and open interest is very huge actually this leap call option on Nvidia is fantastic okay this right here means that if Nvidia were to go up let's say by September remember Nvidia went up to $240 per share okay that's a bit of a stretch okay but I'm just giving you an example here my price target for NVIDIA is like 180 all right so let's just say we went to $240 went up to by $100 the stock going up

also increase but roughly it'll go up by about $70 as well which actually on the stock going up $100 that's a 70% return but the option will move by 70 however this is the crazy part I really want you

option is so powerful it gives you that leverage.\nI'm up 256% on palen here these are positions the Walmart position is a bit more boring but guys boring can make money listen don't just Chase hype if you really want to scale from 100K to 200k you have to actually have diversity in your portfolio because it is about risk management what good is it if you scale 100K to even 500k if you five extra money what good is it if you go down from 500 all the way down to 200 or 100 okay you have to scale properly you have to scale using wisdom you have to learn I'm telling you in a good Market you guys you don't learn that much people unfortunately learn in a bad Market learn from me take the opinions the advice I'm giving you I'm obviously not a financial adviser I'm not licensed I enjoy being a coach I enjoy helping people one-on-one so I'm just a guy in the internet that's really achieved a lot very fast when it comes to trading because of my strategy my hard work intelligence whatever you want to call it right but I'm telling you be smart and scale properly because there's no good scaling if it's inconsistent scale okay so stocks Amazon I'm up good money on Amazon on PayPal 38% uh Target I I made a mistake however I did point out in my Discord and I actually ignored my own advice I said buy a call option on target at0 that call option more than tripled in value I really regret not taking my own trade so 99% of the time I eat my own cooking but sometimes on Discord I said hey guys here's my opinion this is a good idea I have like on Archer one of you guys actually emailed me and gave me a tip on Archer so thank you to that person this is the only stock I actually invested in that was not my own research Archer someone told me about it and I guess they were watch I guess that trade may have came from Kathy Wood I'm not sure but I do read your guys emails I will leave my email down below if you're interested in joining 101 coaching um you can email me as well we do have 10 spots right now that we have open American Airlines we got the 35 I have 35% but this is not even representative because what I've been doing in American Airlines and the way I've actually made $10,000 a month I scaled my portfolio is also with American Airlines it might seem funny to you you're like he it's just an Airlines it goes up and down you will be shocked by how much money you can make by selling puts and covered calls and just running the wheel strategy on American Airlines I'm sorry this video is getting long but I hope I'm dropping so many knowledge bombs for you I hope I'm dropping so many gold nuggets for you that make you realize that the money is so abundant in this market and not just in this market American Airlines let me actually finish off with these three Square Chipotle have spy and Nvidia let actually go into American Airlines because I'm going to show you that you can print money with leaps actually leaps has been good on American Airlines too lately because uh the three month chart is absolutely ridiculous okay now um my community and I we bought American Airlines at$ 12289 but we've been selling we've been selling puts and calls for a long time 13 puts 14 puts as you can see here this is exactly what I've been recommending to like literally everybody as well as covered calls so I have 10 covered calls I have 1 th000 shares I'm a little bit silly here on American Airlines because right now I'm actually not making money I'm going to have to roll this position higher to make more money and I'm I'm fully invested in my portfolio and other picks so on American Airlines I really should I'm going to add to my position I'm going to add to my position this week and I'm going to have to be very smart about this because as you can see we actually have like sideways action on American Airlines so the big question and what I'm going to try to figure out this week is is this sideways action something that's going to be sustained this is something that I'm going to have to do some qualitative and quantitative analysis on and try to understand for myself are we going to to run the wheel strategy selling puts covered calls Etc cuz direction is very important you get direction right in this market you can become a millionaire like we actually are making millionaires right now because a lot of folks that come to me have bigger size portfolios of folks have 500k they start with 500k basically like I started with 2 mil now they're at a million I'm at 4 mil okay it's it's scaling guys it's all about scaling whatever you think is uh not possible it's absolutely possible you just have to have the right strategy and you have to understand how the market works you pick the right stocks some stocks go up 10x 20x right it really depends and the reason why I don't have 10x returns is because I'm extremely conservative but even in a conservative even me being conservative I still done fantastically well so this strategy of momentum is really important to understand with leaps with covered calls and with buying options buying options especially if you can buy some call options and momentum is on your side you're going to print money you're going to make you're going to make some some real paper I I got some durhams here for for my taxi I'm going out to dinner soon so you can make you can literally print money print money like these guys in Dubai who have oil money you know they make a million dollars a day some of these people here right they're not my clients they already have so much money they're only focused on spending money if you want to get to that point I'm telling you first of all subscribe because everything I've been putting out here has been fired I've been more fire and Dan Hive crazy actually I'm really proud of myself and I want to stay humble because you know it's not me you know it's it's because of God I'm blessed I'm happy that I have this opportunity to do my passion and in contribute to the world so I'm happy that I can financially benefit and also financially just create opportunities for other people it's you know although I'm being cocky I also want to tell myself that I'm grateful I'm grateful for what I have and I'm I'm very grateful for you guys as well now look let me get to a little bit more of the knowledge and the value you want to diversify beyond the main stock picks that I have it's important to manage your position sizes it's also really important to avoid overly aggressive tactics you guys that are getting overly cocky I do get some of these calls um my team helps me with uh many of my calls right because I like being a coach when it comes to learning about my program it's free to to have a consultation and we do get some people that say I'm very confident right now I I made a million dollars because of Henry's pick what else is there left well there's a lot of things left first of all I do have I tell them there's plays that you're making uh that I'm making that you're not aware of that's one number two it's all about risk management it's all about protecting your wealth if you're already making 10 to 20% a month right now in this market congratulations but you also have to prepare to protect yourself when the when the times get tough and that's you can't get overly aggressive you can't start using tactics like just buying call options getting overly leveraged into them that's very bad okay so you want to stay safe you want to stay consistent and you can Skyrocket your portfolio a lot you can make $10,000 a month you can easily scale six figures to you know from 100K to 500k in this market you know my parents they've actually done kind of a bad job in this market it's because um my parents like hard assets more so my mom and my dad they believe more in like real estate and having hard assets and when I told my parents to by Tesla back in the day they didn't listen to me and they bought it at like the top and then they didn't dollar cost average Tesla went down and they've been they've been like holding like bag holding essentially waiting for Tesla to rise up finally Tesla rose up and then they just sold it and they didn't I like I told them like just hold hold for like a decade I told my dad hold for a decade and AD doesn't listen to me I can't do anything everyone that joins me that listens to me scales 100K to 500k 500k to a million become people make $10,000 a month $20,000 a month with me but if they don't listen to me they they pay for the program they invest in my coaching they don't listen to me and it's very sometimes that happens you know and that's the only times I see students not succeeding because not everyone succeeds but the there's only one thing in common with everyone that doesn't succeed they start to follow their own stuff they start to ignore my time tested like tips like it's time I'm time tested guys I've done this for 10 years I have so much money I can't spend it financially I have other things in my life that I'm working on health relationships Faith other things that I'm working on right but when it comes to money if you're not listening to me you don't follow me I I know exactly what I'm doing it's silly not to in many ways so when I see students kind of going off the deep end getting really crazy about buying options or making risky plays into stocks that I don't like I hate to see it I hate to see it so and same thing with my parents like my dad just waited and then Tesla he broke even he made $10,000 he sold it like I made $10,000 but in the past few days he would have been up a lot more so you can't sell early that's the most important thing that's why I think having a mentor is so so important as well I have mentors I have tons of mentors that I paid for I paid over a million dollars I sent out Anil email I recently sent an email you guys can join the free email list I just said thanks I was just grateful and and I just said Thank you guys and I sent a long email about my values and what I believe in and why I'm doing this why I I think this is my mission my calling to help people trade options and get financially free I sent out an email so you can join that free email list in the description I have a first link for coaching second link is um my uh my free email list that's that's it I don't have sponsors or anything like that I just I don't do this for the money I do get paid from coaching I have a team they have families to feed but this is is absolutely not about money it's nice I like money but I like helping people more you know there if I got offered $100 million to become CEO of Microsoft I would decline I don't need the money I'm doing what I love I'm doing what I enjoy and I when I see you guys getting results I see people scaling there's nothing better than that when I see people scaling there's nothing better than that I feel like that gives a lot of people freedom and freedom and and having more finances improves your family life it can improve your health it can improve your time management it gives you more time to do what you want to do and not be dependent on on having a boss so I really I really realized that that I became a better option Trader actually uh and this is kind of like a catch 22 but I realized that I became a better option Trader when I had enough money that I wasn't really concerned about it anymore which actually allowed me to take on more risk so you know look I don't blame you guys when um sometimes uh people take it too easy on the trades and sometimes people take it too hard on the trades and they say they just buy a lot of options and they they want to go to the Moon too fast it's all about balance guys you can't be you can't be too safe if you're trying to be too safe sure you're going to get the S&P 500 return I mean we're not here to get S&P 00 return guys we're here to beat the S&P we're here to scale we're here to do things in the market that are unimaginable we're here to get 1% results you know I'm probably like 0.1% results and it's not easy you know it honestly does take a toll on me to always research these stocks and to bring these videos to you guys but listen the reason I work so hard is because I believe in this stuff and I eat my own cooking this is the reason why I work so hard and I show everything every single opportunity every single trade I basically have I I share it live like my Monday and Wednesday calls I do everything live it's all posted live like this is the trade that I made my Discord soon say thanks they take it so one thing that I the reason why I brought up my dad is because he made the mistake of not dollar cost averaging and I think a lot of you guys need to understand that you can dollar cost average with options you can dollar cost average into the high quality stocks that I cover and you should be in in in pound here in Tesla and my number one rule is pick stocks that are rising right now because we're in such a bull market that you got to pick stocks that are rising and number two volatility is your friend my voice is given out so I actually had a lot more stuff that I'm going to cover but I'll cover it in the next video uh subscribe and uh I'm going to have a lot more fire and a lot more money that's going to flood your pockets with just cash coming so let's get that money invest safe let's be smart and I'll catch you guys in the next video so I'll see you thanks for watching"", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.5}, {""company"": ""Google"", ""excerpt"": ""Google uh call option right here is something really interesting because Google isn't like the sexiest Company on YouTube a lot of people you know you guys want me to cover the sexiest companies but I want to tell you that the boring stuff can also make a lot of money like Google let me show you actually bought October 21st so this is like 6 weeks week ago I actually dumped $20,000 into this position and so far this position is worth $33,000 I'm up a lot of money the reason why this MAF doesn't actually check out it's 20K was because I actually did a poor man's covered call but in this market I'm not even recommending Poor Man's covered calls guys you want to be in leaps you want to go full betting mode where you bet that the stock will go up you don't want to do poor man's covered calls this is not a market for covered calls either this is a market to be long this is a market where you make money hand over fist like I've been saying that's what we've been doing we're trying to reap as much as possible possible look when it comes to like a long-term call option what I would do right now is I would go for September expiration so essentially a long-term leap option I'll let me show you a quick example and this is actually the perfect example on Google you can still take notes here you can still copy this trade it's not too late now obviously I put out this trade in my Discord Community early when I first opened it up back in October but this trade right here I'm up about 10K because I did sell um covered calls actually on the leap uh to begin with I would still say this is a good position so so take some notes Here the bid ass spread is is good obviously I'm recording this on on the weekend the Market's not open right now but come Monday I'm going to probably be buying some more leap options you know Google is a really good one Google's a fantastic one I made a lot of money on several different plays here as you can see on my screen.\nApple right big company most people are not paying too much close attention to it Google Google I just showed you I'm up a ton of money on Google Chipotle is another really big play that I made money but look I'm I don't want to talk about single stocks too much what I want to talk about is how to actually make $10,000 per month what strategies do we use how do we manage those strategies and you'll talk a little bit about stocks as well here's what I want to cover a long-term leap option is what you should focus on right now long-term leaps are the number one strategy in this market environment because it allows you to control 100 shares for a fraction of the cost and it gives you massive upside guys you want that massive massive upside in this market that's that's where it's all at now look when I go for a leap option what I'm trying to do is I'm going to tell you a secret the leap Delta should be 70 Delta okay not 80 not 90 although my mentor says 90 have a mentor on Walsh stre I'm still in touch with he likes 90 I'll tell you why he likes 90 I'll tell you why I like 70 all right I like 70 personally because the 70 Delta means that when the stock goes up a dollar your option goes up 70 all right let me show you an example actually I'll go to Nvidia because I do think Nvidia is a good opportunity right now for doing a leap option The stocks at $141 $142 per share I do have a decent Siz position in this portfolio I have a million dollars in my other portfolio in Nvidia as well so look September is the expiration so I'm going to go for September 19 202 25 that gives you a lot of uh time a leap options a one-ear option typically but 9 months is Leap to me okay leap is just a long-term call option it's just a definition so don't worry about it too much so look I actually have the 130 um leap actually so it ends that's 69 Del so this is perfect the volatility here is 49% the volume is 88 that's really good uh that's a good volume and open interest is very huge actually this leap call option on Nvidia is fantastic okay this right here means that if Nvidia were to go up let's say by September remember Nvidia went up to $240 per share okay that's a bit of a stretch okay but I'm just giving you an example here my price target for NVIDIA is like 180 all right so let's just say we went to $240 went up to by $100 the stock going up $100 is roughly like a 70% return or so from the stock perspective if you were to be a shareholder in in just a stock okay however if the option the way it would behave if the stock went up $100 is the option would go up by $70 and that's because this zela right here is 69 the option would be roughly you know give or take there is some differences as as the um as the price goes up the Delta will also increase but roughly it'll go up by about $70 as well which actually on the stock going up $100 that's a 70% return but the option will move by 70 however this is the crazy part I really want you to think about this the premium that you pay is 32 so 32 will turn to 100 you will triple your money okay the stock goes up 70% % the leap call option goes up 300% 70% equals 300% that is why a leap option is so powerful it gives you that leverage.\nI'm up 256% on palen here these are positions the Walmart position is a bit more boring but guys boring can make money listen don't just Chase hype if you really want to scale from 100K to 200k you have to actually have diversity in your portfolio because it is about risk management what good is it if you scale 100K to even 500k if you five extra money what good is it if you go down

exactly what I'm doing it's silly not to in many ways so when I see students kind of going off the deep end getting really crazy about buying options or making risky plays into stocks that I don't like I hate to see it I hate to see it so and same thing with my parents like my dad just waited and then Tesla he broke even he made $10,000 he sold it like I made $10,000 but in the past few days he would have been up a lot more so you can't sell early that's the most important thing that's why I think having a mentor is so so important as well I have mentors I have tons of mentors that I paid for I paid over a million dollars I sent out Anil email I recently sent an email you guys can join the free email list I just said thanks I was just grateful and and I just said Thank you guys and I sent a long email about my values and what I believe in and why I'm doing this why I I think this is my mission my calling to help people trade options and get financially free I sent out an email so you can join that free email list in the description I have a first link for coaching second link is um my uh my free email list that's that's it I don't have sponsors or anything like that I just I don't do this for the money I do get paid from coaching I have a team they have families to feed but this is is absolutely not about money it's nice I like money but I like helping people more you know there if I got offered $100 million to become CEO of Microsoft I would decline I don't need the money I'm doing what I love I'm doing what I enjoy and I when I see you guys getting results I see people scaling there's nothing better than that when I see people scaling there's nothing better than that I feel like that gives a lot of people freedom and freedom and and having more finances improves your family life it can improve your health it can improve your time management it gives you more time to do what you want to do and not be dependent on on having a boss so I really I really realized that that I became a better option Trader actually uh and this is kind of like a catch 22 but I realized that I became a better option Trader when I had enough money that I wasn't really concerned about it anymore which actually allowed me to take on more risk so you know look I don't blame you guys when um sometimes uh people take it too easy on the trades and sometimes people take it too hard on the trades and they say they just buy a lot of options and they they want to go to the Moon too fast it's all about balance guys you can't be you can't be too safe if you're trying to be too safe sure you're going to get the S&P 500 return I mean we're not here to get S&P 00 return guys we're here to beat the S&P we're here to scale we're here to do things in the market that are unimaginable we're here to get 1% results you know I'm probably like 0.1% results and it's not easy you know it honestly does take a toll on me to always research these stocks and to bring these videos to you guys but listen the reason I work so hard is because I believe in this stuff and I eat my own cooking this is the reason why I work so hard and I show everything every single opportunity every single trade I basically have I I share it live like my Monday and Wednesday calls I do everything live it's all posted live like this is the trade that I made my Discord soon say thanks they take it so one thing that I the reason why I brought up my dad is because he made the mistake of not dollar cost averaging and I think a lot of you guys need to understand that you can dollar cost average with options you can dollar cost average into the high quality stocks that I cover and you should be in in in pound here in Tesla and my number one rule is pick stocks that are rising right now because we're in such a bull market that you got to pick stocks that are rising and number two volatility is your friend my voice is given out so I actually had a lot more stuff that I'm going to cover but I'll cover it in the next video uh subscribe and uh I'm going to have a lot more fire and a lot more money that's going to flood your pockets with just cash coming so let's get that money invest safe let's be smart and I'll catch you guys in the next video so I'll see you thanks for watching"", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.8}, {""company"": ""Chipotle"", ""excerpt"": ""Google Google I just showed you I'm up a ton of money on Google Chipotle is another really big play that I made money but look I'm I don't want to talk about single stocks too much what I want to talk about is how to actually make $10,000 per month what strategies do we use how do we manage those strategies and you'll talk a little bit about stocks as well here's what I want to cover a long-term leap option is what you should focus on right now long-term leaps are the number one strategy in this market environment because it allows you to control 100 shares for a fraction of the cost and it gives you massive upside guys you want that massive massive upside in this market that's that's where it's all at now look when I go for a leap option what I'm trying to do is I'm going to tell you a secret the leap Delta should be 70 Delta okay not 80 not 90 although my mentor says 90 have a mentor on Walsh stre I'm still in touch with he likes 90 I'll tell you why he likes 90 I'll tell you why I like 70 all right I like 70 personally because the 70 Delta means that when the stock goes up a dollar your option goes up 70 all right let me show you an example actually I'll go to Nvidia because I do think Nvidia is a good opportunity right now for doing a leap option The stocks at $141 $142 per share I do have a decent Siz position in this portfolio I have a million dollars in my other portfolio in Nvidia as well so look September is the expiration so I'm going to go for September 19 202 25 that gives you a lot of uh time a leap options a one-ear option typically but 9 months is Leap to me okay leap is just a long-term call option it's just a definition so don't worry about it too much so look I actually have the 130 um leap actually so it ends that's 69 Del so this is perfect the volatility here is 49% the volume is 88 that's really good uh that's a good volume and open interest is very huge actually this leap call option on Nvidia is fantastic okay this right here means that if Nvidia were to go up let's say by September remember Nvidia went up to $240 per share okay that's a bit of a stretch okay but I'm just giving you an example here my price target for NVIDIA is like 180 all right so let's just say we went to $240 went up to by $100 the stock going up $100 is roughly like a 70% return or so from the stock perspective if you were to be a shareholder in in just a stock okay however if the option the way it would behave if the stock went up $100 is the option would go up by $70 and that's because this zela right here is 69 the option would be roughly you know give or take there is some differences as as the um as the price goes up the Delta will also increase but roughly it'll go up by about $70 as well which actually on the stock going up $100 that's a 70% return but the option will move by 70 however this is the crazy part I really want you to think about this the premium that you pay is 32 so 32 will turn to 100 you will triple your money okay the stock goes up 70% % the leap call option goes up 300% 70% equals 300% that is why a leap option is so powerful it gives you that leverage.\nAmerican Airlines let me actually finish off with these three Square Chipotle have spy and Nvidia let actually go into American Airlines because I'm going to show you that you can print money with leaps actually leaps has been good on American Airlines too lately because uh the three month chart is absolutely ridiculous okay now um my community and I we bought American Airlines at$ 12289 but we've been selling we've been selling puts and calls for a long time 13 puts 14 puts as you can see here this is exactly what I've been recommending to like literally everybody as well as covered calls so I have 10 covered calls I have 1 th000 shares I'm a little bit silly here on American Airlines because right now I'm actually not making money I'm going to have to roll this position higher to make more money and I'm I'm fully invested in my portfolio and other picks so on American Airlines I really should I'm going to add to my position I'm going to add to my position this week and I'm going to have to be very smart about this because as you can see we actually have like sideways action on American Airlines so the big question and what I'm going to try to figure out this week is is this sideways action something that's going to be sustained this is something that I'm going to have to do some qualitative and quantitative analysis on and try to understand for myself are we going to to run the wheel strategy selling puts covered calls Etc cuz direction is very important you get direction right in this market you can become a millionaire like we actually are making millionaires right now because a lot of folks that come to me have bigger size portfolios of folks have 500k they start with 500k basically like I started with 2 mil now they're at a million I'm at 4 mil okay it's it's scaling guys it's all about scaling whatever you think is uh not possible it's absolutely possible you just have to have the right strategy and you have to understand how the market works you pick the right stocks some stocks go up 10x 20x right it really depends and the reason why I don't have 10x returns is because I'm extremely conservative but even in a conservative even me being conservative I still done fantastically well so this strategy of momentum is really important to understand with leaps with covered calls and with buying options buying options especially if you can buy some call options and momentum is on your side you're going to print money you're going to make you're going to make some some real paper I I got some durhams here for for my taxi I'm going out to dinner soon so you can make you can literally print money print money like these guys in Dubai who have oil money you know they make a million dollars a day some of these people here right they're not my clients they already have so much money they're only focused on spending money if you want to get to that point I'm telling you first of all subscribe because everything I've been putting out here has been fired I've been more fire and Dan Hive crazy actually I'm really proud of myself and I want to stay humble because you know it's not me you know it's it's because of God I'm blessed I'm happy that I have this opportunity to do my passion and in contribute to the world so I'm happy that I can financially benefit and also financially just create opportunities for other people it's you know although I'm being cocky I also want to tell myself that I'm grateful I'm grateful for what I have and I'm I'm very grateful for you guys as well now look let me get to a little bit more of the knowledge and the value you want to diversify beyond the main stock picks that I have it's important to manage your position sizes it's also really important to avoid overly aggressive tactics you guys that are getting overly cocky I do get some of these calls um my team helps me with uh many of my calls right because I like being a coach when it comes to learning about my program it's free to to have a consultation and we do get some people that say I'm very confident right now I I made a million dollars because of Henry's pick what else is there left well there's a lot of things left first of all I do have I tell them there's plays that you're making uh that I'm making that you're not aware of that's one number two it's all about risk management it's all about protecting your wealth if you're already making 10 to 20% a month right now in this market congratulations but you also have to prepare to protect yourself when the when the times get tough and that's you can't get overly aggressive you can't start using tactics like just buying call options getting overly leveraged into them that's very bad okay so you want to stay safe you want to stay consistent and you can Skyrocket your portfolio a lot you can make $10,000 a month you can easily scale six figures to you know from 100K to 500k in this market you know my parents they've actually done kind of a bad job in this market it's because um my parents like hard assets more so my mom and my dad they believe more in like real estate and having hard assets and when I told my parents to by Tesla back in the day they didn't listen to me and they bought it at like the top and then they didn't dollar cost average Tesla went down and they've been they've been like holding like bag holding essentially waiting for Tesla to rise up finally Tesla rose up and then they just sold it and they didn't I like I told them like just hold hold for like a decade I told my dad hold for a decade and AD doesn't listen to me I can't do anything everyone that joins me that listens to me scales 100K to 500k 500k to a million become people make $10,000 a month $20,000 a month with me but if they don't listen to me they they pay for the program they invest in my coaching they don't listen to me and it's very sometimes that happens you know and that's the only times I see students not succeeding because not everyone succeeds but the there's only one thing in common with everyone that doesn't succeed they start to follow their own stuff they start to ignore my time tested like tips like it's time I'm time tested guys I've done this for 10 years I have so much money I can't spend it financially I have other things in my life that I'm working on health relationships Faith other things that I'm working on right but when it comes to money if you're not listening to me you

but in the past few days he would have been up a lot more so you can't sell early that's the most important thing that's why I think having a mentor is so so important as well I have mentors I have

that money invest safe let's be smart and I'll catch you guys in the next video so I'll see you thanks for watching"", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.7}, {""company"": ""Cava Group"", ""excerpt"": ""I have many different name Sofi Sofi is freaking going to the Moon Sofi increased in value so much and that's the only stock that I was not early on guys I was early admit that on Sofi I was I didn't I don't have much of a big position in Sofi so I want to be honest about that I wish I had more in in it but right now I have started to jump into it at $15 per share and I think Sofi is going to be a really good bet and I've already mentioned uh in my yesterday's video that I said you have to watch that video before 9:30 a.m. I mentioned Sofi first because I think Sofi is a really interesting opportunity with some urgency right now I just see a lot of urgency with Sofi I'm I'm going to keep moving on with this video but it's kind of revolutionizing traditional Finance in a way if you take a look at these Banks they have a lot of retail stores that's a lot of money guys you have employees you have Breck and mortar you have rent to pay you have lights to keep on you have utility bills etc etc when you have more of a online banking approach higher margins all about margins because margin it to be honest guys it doesn't matter how much revenue you make if you don't bring home any money right it doesn't matter if you have a business that makes a million dollar a year if your expenses are also $1 million you made zero okay so it's all about net margin for these businesses okay and Sofi I think is going to be really strong as well as I want to put some emphasis on on Tesla guys if you want to make $10,000 a month is super freaking easy right now in this market I have students that are making 50k 70k just everyday lawyers you know everyday doctors I get these are high paid professions but I have tons of Engineers that are not even high-end Engineers they're just regular computer programmers working yeah I get in California but after taxes yeah they make six figures but you know it's 100K 1 15K these are good salaries but they're making more off of options right now because in a bull run you can make 20 30k on a sixf figureure portfolio and I see it every single day it's actually life-changing money and if you can squeeze out this money in this bull market fantastic you're going to get to retirement soon and that's why I put a million into Tesla that's actually why I have $1.5 million in Tesla that was two days ago video I made I put 3,000 shares and 1,000 shares I had the 1,000 for a long time and 3,000 was a new addition to my portfolio and I don't have covered calls guys pay attention to that the number one option coach in the world is telling you not to do covered calls I love covered calls I'm always trying to generate income but I'm actually telling you right now focus on stocks focus on stocks not just option because okay leaps definitely but if you have stock leave your shares uncovered leave your shares uncovered what don't you understand this is a bull market covered calls will underperform in a bull market they they don't make sense that's why right now I'm pound here I don't have covered calls okay I don't have covered calls on Tesla I don't have covered calls on Nvidia like if I show you Nvidia position I have some sell puts right here on Tesla I just have straight up shares I've also sold puts I have Leaps uh on actually on Nvidia excuse me I do have well that's because my other positions on covers this portfolio has 500 shares and I have 148 covered call 146 which actually is going well these are out of the money options and I did make $111,000 so you know covered calls are okay but at least if you're going to do covered calls leave yourself some upside okay.\nAmerican Airlines let me actually finish off with these three Square Chipotle have spy and Nvidia let actually go into

much of a big position in Sofi so I want to be honest about that I wish I had more in in it but right now I have started to jump into it at $15 per share and I think Sofi is going to be a really good bet and I've already mentioned uh in my yesterday's video that I said you have to watch that video before 9:30 a.m. I mentioned Sofi first because I think Sofi is a really interesting opportunity with some urgency right now I just see a lot of urgency with Sofi I'm I'm going to keep moving on with this video but it's kind of revolutionizing traditional Finance in a way if you take a look at these Banks they have a lot of retail stores that's a lot of money guys you have employees you have Breck and mortar you have rent to pay you have lights to keep on you have utility bills etc etc when you have more of a online banking approach higher margins all about margins because margin it to be honest guys it doesn't matter how much revenue you make if you don't bring home any money right it doesn't matter if you have a business that makes a million dollar a year if your expenses are also $1 million you made zero okay so it's all about net margin for these businesses okay and Sofi I think is going to be really strong as well as I want to put some emphasis on on Tesla guys if you want to make $10,000 a month is super freaking easy right now in this market I have students that are making 50k 70k just everyday lawyers you know everyday doctors I get these are high paid professions but I have tons of Engineers that are not even high-end Engineers they're just regular computer programmers working yeah I get in California but after taxes yeah they make six figures but you know it's 100K 1 15K these are good salaries but they're making more off of options right now because in a bull run you can make 20 30k on a sixf figureure portfolio and I see it every single day it's actually life-changing money and if you can squeeze out this money in this bull market fantastic you're going to get to retirement soon and that's why I put a million into Tesla that's actually why I have $1.5 million in Tesla that was two days ago video I made I put 3,000 shares and 1,000 shares I had the 1,000 for a long time and 3,000 was a new addition to my portfolio and I don't have covered calls guys pay attention to that the number one option coach in the world is telling you not to do covered calls I love covered calls I'm always trying to generate income but I'm actually telling you right now focus on stocks focus on stocks not just option because okay leaps definitely but if you have stock leave your shares uncovered leave your shares uncovered what don't you understand this is a bull market covered calls will underperform in a bull market they they don't make sense that's why right now I'm pound here I don't have covered calls okay I don't have covered calls on Tesla I don't have covered calls on Nvidia like if I show you Nvidia position I have some sell puts right here on Tesla I just have straight up shares I've also sold puts I have Leaps uh on actually on Nvidia excuse me I do have well that's because my other positions on covers this portfolio has 500 shares and I have 148 covered call 146 which actually is going well these are out of the money options and I did make $111,000 so you know covered calls are okay but at least if you're going to do covered calls leave yourself some upside okay.\nI have like on Archer one of you guys actually emailed me and gave me a tip on Archer so thank you to that person this is the only stock I actually invested in that was not my own research Archer someone told me about it and I guess they were watch I guess that trade may have came from Kathy Wood I'm not sure but I do read your guys emails I will leave my email down below if you're interested in joining 101 coaching um you can email me as well we do have 10 spots right now that we have open American Airlines we got the 35 I have 35% but this is not even representative because what I've been doing in American Airlines and the way I've actually made $10,000 a month I scaled my portfolio is also with American Airlines it might seem funny to you you're like he it's just an Airlines it goes up and down you will be shocked by how much money you can make by selling puts and covered calls and just running the wheel strategy on American Airlines I'm sorry this video is getting long but I hope I'm dropping so many knowledge bombs for you I hope I'm dropping so many gold nuggets for you that make you realize that the money is so abundant in this market and not just in this market American Airlines let me actually finish off with these three Square Chipotle have spy and Nvidia let actually go into American Airlines because I'm going to show you that you can print money with leaps actually leaps has been good on American Airlines too lately because uh the three month chart is absolutely ridiculous okay now um my community and I we bought American Airlines at$ 12289 but we've been selling we've been selling puts and calls for a long time 13 puts 14 puts as you can see here this is exactly what I've been recommending to like literally everybody as well as covered calls so I have 10 covered calls I have 1 th000 shares I'm a little bit silly here on American Airlines because right now I'm actually not making money I'm going to have to roll this position higher to make more money and I'm I'm fully invested in my portfolio and other picks so on American Airlines I really should I'm going to add to my position I'm going to add to my position this week and I'm going to have to be very smart about this because as you can see we actually have like sideways action on American Airlines so the big question and what I'm going to try to figure out this week is is this sideways action something that's going to be sustained this is something that I'm going to have to do some qualitative and quantitative analysis on and try to understand for myself are we going to to run the wheel strategy selling puts covered calls Etc cuz direction is very important you get direction right in this market you can become a millionaire like we actually are making millionaires right now because a lot of folks that come to me have bigger size portfolios of folks have 500k they start with 500k basically like I started with 2 mil now they're at a million I'm at 4 mil okay it's it's scaling guys it's all about scaling whatever you think is uh not possible it's absolutely possible you just have to have the right strategy and you have to understand how the market works you pick the right stocks some stocks go up 10x 20x right it really depends and the reason why I don't have 10x returns is because I'm extremely conservative but even in a conservative even me being conservative I still done fantastically well so this strategy of momentum is really important to understand with leaps with covered calls and with buying options buying options especially if you can buy some call options and momentum is on your side you're going to print money you're going to make you're going to make some some real paper I I got some durhams here for for my taxi I'm going out to dinner soon so you can make you can literally print money print money like these guys in Dubai who have oil money you know they make a million dollars a day some of these people here right they're not my clients they already have so much money they're only focused on spending money if you want to get to that point I'm telling you first of all subscribe because everything I've been putting out here has been fired I've been more fire and Dan Hive crazy actually I'm really proud of myself and I want to stay humble because you know it's not me you know it's it's because of God I'm blessed I'm happy that I have this opportunity to do my passion and in contribute to the world so I'm happy that I can financially benefit and also financially just create opportunities for other people it's you know although I'm being cocky I also want to tell myself that I'm grateful I'm grateful for what I have and I'm I'm very grateful for you guys as well now look let me get to a little bit more of the knowledge and the value you want to diversify beyond the main stock picks that I have it's important to manage your position sizes it's also really important to avoid overly aggressive tactics you guys that are getting overly cocky I do get some of these calls um my team helps me with uh many of my calls right because I like being a coach when it comes to learning about my program it's free to to have a consultation and we do get some people that say I'm very confident right now I I made a million dollars because of Henry's pick what else is there left well there's a lot of things left first of all I do have I tell them there's plays that you're making uh that I'm making that you're not aware of that's one number two it's all about risk management it's all about protecting your wealth if you're already making 10 to 20% a month right now in this market congratulations but you also have to prepare to protect yourself when the when the times get tough and that's you can't get overly aggressive you can't start using tactics like just buying call options getting overly leveraged into them that's very bad okay so you want to stay safe you want to stay consistent and you can Skyrocket your portfolio a lot you can make $10,000 a month you can easily scale six figures to you know from 100K to 500k in this market you know my parents they've actually done kind of a bad job in this market it's because um my parents like hard assets more so my mom and my dad they believe more in like real estate and having hard assets and when I told my parents to by Tesla back in the day they didn't listen to me and they bought it at like the top and then they didn't dollar cost average Tesla went down and they've been they've been like holding like bag holding essentially waiting for Tesla to rise up finally Tesla rose up and then they just sold it and they didn't I like I told them like just hold hold for like a decade I told my dad hold for a decade and AD doesn't listen to me I can't do anything everyone that joins me that listens to me scales 100K to 500k 500k to a million become people make $10,000 a month $20,000 a month with me but if they don't listen to me they they pay for the program they invest in my coaching they don't listen to me and it's very sometimes that happens you know and that's the only times I see students not succeeding because not everyone succeeds but the there's only one thing in common with everyone that doesn't succeed they start to follow their own stuff they start to ignore my time tested like tips like it's time I'm time tested guys I've done this for 10 years I have so much money I can't spend it financially I have other things in my life that I'm working on health relationships Faith other things that I'm working on right but when it comes to money if you're not listening to me you don't follow me I I know exactly what I'm doing it's silly not to in many ways so when I see students kind of going off the deep end getting really crazy about buying options or making risky plays into stocks that I don't like I hate to see it I hate to see it so and same thing with my parents like my dad just waited and then Tesla he broke even he made $10,000 he sold it like I made $10,000 but in the past few days he would have been up a lot more so you can't sell early that's the most important thing that's why I think having a mentor is so so important as well I have mentors I have tons of mentors that I paid for I paid over a million dollars I sent out Anil email I recently sent an email you guys can join the free email list I just said thanks I was just grateful and and I just said Thank you guys and I sent a long email about my values and what I believe in and why I'm doing this why I I think this is my mission my calling to help people trade options and get financially free I sent out an email so you can join that free email list in the description I have a first link for coaching second link is um my uh my free email list that's that's it I don't have sponsors or anything like that I just I don't do this for the money I do get paid from coaching I have a team they have families to feed but this is is absolutely not about money it's nice I like money but I like helping people more you know there if I got offered $100 million to become CEO of Microsoft I would decline I don't need the money I'm doing what I love I'm doing what I enjoy and I when I see you guys getting results I see people scaling there's nothing better than that when I see people scaling there's nothing better than that I feel like that gives a lot of people freedom and freedom and and having more finances improves your family life it can improve your health it can improve your time management it gives you more time to do what you want to do and not be dependent on on having a boss so I really I really realized that that I became a better option Trader actually uh and this is kind of like a catch 22 but I realized that I became a better option Trader when I had enough money that I wasn't really concerned about it anymore which actually allowed me to take on more risk so you know look I don't blame you guys when um sometimes uh people take it too easy on the trades and sometimes people take it too hard on the trades and they say they just buy a lot of options and they they want to go to the Moon too fast it's all about balance guys you can't be you can't be too safe if you're trying to be too safe sure you're going to get the S&P 500 return I mean we're not here to get S&P 00 return guys we're here to beat the S&P we're here to scale we're here to do things in the market that are unimaginable we're here to get 1% results you know I'm probably like 0.1% results and it's not easy you know it honestly does take a toll on me to always research these stocks and to bring these videos to you guys but listen the reason I work so hard is because I believe in this stuff and I eat my own cooking this is the reason why I work so hard and I show everything every single opportunity every single trade I basically have I I share it live like my Monday and Wednesday calls I do everything live it's all posted live like this is the trade that I made my Discord soon say thanks they take it so one thing that I the reason why I brought up my dad is because he made the mistake of not dollar cost averaging and I think a lot of you guys need to understand that you can dollar cost average with options you can dollar cost average into the high quality stocks that I cover and you should be in in in pound here in Tesla and my number one rule is pick stocks that are rising right now because we're in such a bull market that you got to pick stocks that are rising and number two volatility is your friend my voice is given out so I actually had a lot more stuff that I'm going to cover but I'll cover it in the next video uh subscribe and uh I'm going to have a lot more fire and a lot more money that's going to flood your pockets with just cash coming so let's get that money invest safe let's be smart and I'll catch you guys in the next video so I'll see you thanks for watching"", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.3}, {""company"": ""SoFi Technologies"", ""excerpt"": ""many different name Sofi Sofi is freaking going to the Moon

SOI I would do Tesla not I would I am I am guys I am I'm doing it I'm showing you everything TLA is going to be a $2 trillion company we have so much going on we have Robo taxis we have Elon musk's relationship with Donald Trump we have uh the you know Optimus stuff coming the robots we have vehicles I'm I'm in Dubai right now and I actually saw a cyber uh the Cyber truck okay I was I was blown back I'm like this design looks amazing actually I should have taken a picture of it but I was like blowing back I see McLaren's everywhere I see Rolls-Royce I see everything but I don't see any Bugattis in in Dubai actually I've been here for a few days I see the Cyber truck I'm like wow and actually you know what's interesting I see people in a parking lot taking pictures of the cybertruck not taking pictures of the McLaren because there is quite a lot of supercars here and it just it just proves the point that the unique design the unique approach the competitive advantage that Tesla has is still here okay and we also saw that with one of the analysts you guys got to pay attention if you want to really scale your portfolio right now use the option strategies to get to six figures seven Figures it's not just the option strategies themselves it's the stock selection and it's why you're choosing the stocks okay why have I picked so many winners cuz I pay attention and I do my research properly You see analysts right now completely flipping 180 degrees on Tesla like there was an analyst that said this is this is this is insane this is absolutely insane he said that Tesla doesn't is the same thing as Toyota they don't have any extra technology than Toyota has I'm like dude you kidding me Tesla has tons of data data that no other company has they have in-house basically insurance right they can give Insurance you know how profitable insurance is guys insurance is one of the most profitable businesses Tesla can ensure people themselves Tesla has way more technology they have oh my goodness I I don't even want to I don't I can talk about it too long listen let me keep going with the video I don't want to ramble here.\nSofi let's take a look at Sofi I have several other companies that I'm covering that I'm also really interested in I've been making a lot of money on look Sofi something like a Sofi right they're going to have earnings here they're going to report earnings on January 27th so there's some time however you can jump in with a call option early okay this will kind of be uh a call option that's a little bit shorter term it's not that short term but it doesn't qualify as a leap option either you can do February 21st expiration here now listen I think Sofi once they report earnings they end up blowing the earnings out of out of the water right they have good earnings expectations good guidance and CEO is confident then this stock can go way past $20 per share so check it out if you buy a call option like right here at the 16 strike you're going to pay $2 now your break even here is going to be about $18.16 so if Sofi ends up going to $20 per share after earnings you're going to double your money okay so $20 is only about 25% higher from Sofi right now because we're at 164 of 16 is four okay so 25% on Sofi will be $20 per share now look this call option at 16 will double so if you if you buy Sofi shares you know you get a 25% return but on a call option you will actually get 200% almost a 10 times difference it's an 8 times difference actually so you get an 8X leverage Factor you get 8X The Return by buying a call option on Sofi now I wouldn't dump all my money in this because you have to pay attention to risk management you have to be smart I would say you can just put in 2% of your money in this position so if you have 100K portfolio you know go ahead and buy $33,000 worth of call options maybe even $22,000 you know you go very conservative here but this is going to be a much smarter play especially in a bull market because if you can squeeze out 200% in just a couple months just think about it you take 100K to 200k or you take 200k to 400k in a short amount of time and that's just a short amount of time in in a bull market look you guys always wonder how did I scale so fast it's because I did take risk in 2021 I scaled 100K portfolio to $700,000 I used Tesla I use call options I use debit spreads I said I hope you don't mind I'm going to cover one more strategy it's going to be a debit spread so check out what a debit spread is okay so on Sofi I said that we can buy the 16 call option now look you can buy the 16 call option but if you think it's going to go up to 20 why not sell the $20 call option right so you buy the 16 but then you go ahead and sell the 20 and then there you go you get a subsidy you get your cost reduction right there because when you sell the $20 call option you get $89 in collected premium so you buy it for you know $216 then you get a rebate kind of I call it a rebate of $89 and all of a sudden here we get a call debit spread which gives us exactly what we think is going to happen which I think SOI is going to be a $20 stock post earnings there you go you have the 16 call option that you're long then you have a $20 call option that you sold and you get you get that upside with a lot lower cost so here essentially your maximum gain is $4 um but you're going to put up a total cost of $127 so if you think about the risk and return here you're risking about 127 bucks and you're total return here is about four is 400 exactly okay it's exactly 400 so you know that's over a 3X return okay I was talking about a 2X return now this is a 3X return where you take $125 into 400 so if you ask me even a smaller portfolio with 50k as a smaller portfolio or you know even 30k you have you have a small portfolio you you invest into this position you put up like $1,000 you do 10 10 contracts you put up $1,200 that 1,200 can go to $4,000 okay so that's something that I would do with the portion of my portfolio for sure now in 2021 when I was really scaling up I used a bit more for sure I had a little bit more risk but I also was very confident so it's kind of funny now because I'm kind of taking it full circle in 2021 I turned 100K into 700 and I just showed you guys in 2024 you know I started off the year I don't know in January I was around you know maybe 2.2 million now I'm at 4.2 so I definitely I'm over 50% return this year and that's all because I'm taking calculated risk I'm in the right stocks I'm I'm in Palance here I should have had a higher return because I picked pal here properly I picked Nvidia I'm actually disappointed with my return I beat S&amp;P 500 I've done very well and I made students tons of money I have doctors that don't want to be doctors anymore they don't want to work in the ER they don't want to I have nurses that are like ah I'm just too tired and and these are I have physician assistants these guys make a lot of money or nurse practitioners I have Engineers that are working in Silicon Valley and they're like I don't want to work anymore I actually hit some of my financial figures that I didn't think I was going to hit for a few years they hit it early with with the plays that I'm putting out and you know on Discord we're just having we're having a big celebration but I'm actually a little bit disappointed I actually have to admit to myself that I could have done better and that's that's just how trading is I can always do better there's always things that I'm learning all right so when I'm looking at call debit spreads what I just showed you right here you know this is a no-brainer this is a no-brainer play with part of my money I would definitely do this I would do a Tesla call option the leap option that I showed you guys in the uh two two days ago at the 350 strike price uh for September expiration okay.\nAmerican Airlines let me actually finish off with these three Square Chipotle have spy and Nvidia let actually go into American Airlines because I'm going to show you that you can print money with leaps actually leaps has been good on American Airlines too lately because uh the three month chart is absolutely ridiculous okay now um my community and I we bought American Airlines at$ 12289 but we've been selling we've been selling puts and calls for a long time 13 puts 14 puts as you can see here this is exactly what I've been recommending to like literally everybody as well as covered calls so I have 10 covered calls I have 1 th000 shares I'm a little bit silly here on American Airlines because right now I'm actually not making money I'm going to have to roll this position higher to make more money and I'm I'm fully invested in my portfolio and other picks so on American Airlines I really should I'm going to add to my position I'm going to add to my position this week and I'm going to have to be very smart about this because as you can see we actually have like sideways action on American Airlines so the big question and what I'm going to try to figure out this week is is this sideways action something that's going to be sustained this is something that I'm going to have to do some qualitative and quantitative analysis on and try to understand for myself are we going to to run the wheel strategy selling puts covered calls Etc cuz direction is very important you get direction right in this market you can become a millionaire like we actually are making millionaires right now because a lot of folks that come to me have bigger size portfolios of folks have 500k they start with 500k basically like I started with 2 mil now they're at a million I'm at 4 mil okay it's it's scaling guys it's all about scaling whatever you think is uh not possible it's absolutely possible you just have to have the right strategy and you have to understand how the market works you pick the right stocks some stocks go up 10x 20x right it really depends and the reason why I don't have 10x returns is because I'm extremely conservative but even in a conservative even me being conservative I still done fantastically well so this strategy of momentum is really important to understand with leaps with covered calls and with buying options buying options especially if you can buy some call options and momentum is on your side you're going to print money you're going to make you're going to make some some real paper I I got some durhams here for for my taxi I'm going out to dinner soon so you can make you can literally print money print

scales 100K to 500k 500k to a million become people make $10,000 a month $20,000 a month with me but if they don't listen to me they they pay for the program they invest in my coaching they don't listen to me and it's very sometimes that happens you know and that's the only times I see students not succeeding because not everyone succeeds but the there's only one thing in common with everyone that doesn't succeed they start to follow their own stuff they start to ignore my time tested like tips like it's time I'm time tested guys I've done this for 10 years I have so much money I can't spend it financially I have other things in my life that I'm working on health relationships Faith other things that I'm working on right but when it comes to money if you're not listening to me you don't follow me I I know exactly what I'm doing it's silly not to in many ways so when I see students kind of going off the deep end getting really crazy about buying options or making risky plays into stocks that I don't like I hate to see it I hate to see it so and same thing with my parents like my dad just waited and then Tesla he broke even he made $10,000 he sold it like I made $10,000 but in the past few days he would have been up a lot more so you can't sell early that's the most important thing that's why I think having a mentor is so so important as well I have mentors I have tons of mentors that I paid for I paid over a million dollars I sent out Anil email I recently sent an email you guys can join the free email list I just said thanks I was just grateful and and I just said Thank you guys and I sent a long email about my values and what I believe in and why I'm doing this why I I think this is my mission my calling to help people trade options and get financially free I sent out an email so you can join that free email list in the description I have a first link for coaching second link is um my uh my free email list that's that's it I don't have sponsors or anything like that I just I don't do this for the money I do get paid from coaching I have a team they have families to feed but this is is absolutely not about money it's nice I like money but I like helping people more you know there if I got offered $100 million to become CEO of Microsoft I would decline I don't need the money I'm doing what I love I'm doing what I enjoy and I when I see you guys getting results I see people scaling there's nothing better than that when I see people scaling there's nothing better than that I feel like that gives a lot of people freedom and freedom and and having more finances improves your family life it can improve your health it can improve your time management it gives you more time to do what you want to do and not be dependent on on having a boss so I really I really realized that that I became a better option Trader actually uh and this is kind of like a catch 22 but I realized that I became a better option Trader when I had enough money that I wasn't really concerned about it anymore which actually allowed me to take on more risk so you know look I don't blame you guys when um sometimes uh people take it too easy on the trades and sometimes people take it too hard on the trades and they say they just buy a lot of options and they they want to go to the Moon too fast it's all about balance guys you can't be you can't be too safe if you're trying to be too safe sure you're going to get the S&P 500 return I mean we're not here to get S&P 00 return guys we're here to beat the S&P we're here to scale we're here to do things in the market that are unimaginable we're here to get 1% results you know I'm probably like 0.1% results and it's not easy you know it honestly does take a toll on me to always research these stocks and to bring these videos to you guys but listen the reason I work so hard is because I believe in this stuff and I eat my own cooking this is the reason why I work so hard and I show everything every single opportunity every single trade I basically have I I share it live like my Monday and Wednesday calls I do everything live it's all posted live like this is the trade that I made my Discord soon say thanks they take it so one thing that I the reason why I brought up my dad is because he made the mistake of not dollar cost averaging and I think a lot of you guys need to understand that you can dollar cost average with options you can dollar cost average into the high quality stocks that I cover and you should be in in in pound here in Tesla and my number one rule is pick stocks that are rising right now because we're in such a bull market that you got to pick stocks that are rising and number two volatility is your friend my voice is given out so I actually had a lot more stuff that I'm going to cover but I'll cover it in the next video uh subscribe and uh I'm going to have a lot more fire and a lot more money that's going to flood your pockets with just cash coming so let's get that money invest safe let's be smart and I'll catch you guys in the next video so I'll see you thanks for watching"", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.9}, {""company"": ""Toyota"", ""excerpt"": ""You see analysts right now completely flipping 180 degrees on Tesla like there was an analyst that said this is this is this is insane this is absolutely insane he said that Tesla doesn't is the same thing as Toyota they don't have any extra technology than Toyota has I'm like dude you kidding me Tesla has tons of data data that no other company has they have in-house basically insurance right they can give Insurance you know how profitable insurance is guys insurance is one of the most profitable businesses Tesla can ensure people themselves Tesla has way more technology they have oh my goodness I I don't even want to I don't I can talk about it too long listen let me keep going with the video I don't want to ramble here."", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": -0.5}, {""company"": ""Nike"", ""excerpt"": ""I could take a look at uh Nike I can also take a look at Nvidia Palance here Tesla snow um Sofi let's take a look at Sofi I have several other companies that I'm covering that I'm also really interested in I've been making a lot of money on look Sofi something like a Sofi right they're going to have earnings here they're going to report earnings on January 27th so there's some time however you can jump in with a call option early okay this will kind of be uh a call option that's a little bit shorter term it's not that short term but it doesn't qualify as a leap option either you can do February 21st expiration here now listen I think Sofi once they report earnings they end up blowing the earnings out of out of the water right they have good earnings expectations good guidance and CEO is confident then this stock can go way past $20 per share so check it out if you buy a call option like right here at the 16 strike you're going to pay $2 now your break even here is going to be about $18.16 so if Sofi ends up going to $20 per share after earnings you're going to double your money okay so $20 is only about 25% higher from Sofi right now because we're at 164 of 16 is four okay so 25% on Sofi will be $20 per share now look this call option at 16 will double so if you if you buy Sofi shares you know you get a 25% return but on a call option you will actually get 200% almost a 10 times difference it's an 8 times difference actually so you get an 8X leverage Factor you get 8X The Return by buying a call option on Sofi now I wouldn't dump all my money in this because you have to pay attention to risk management you have to be smart I would say you can just put in 2% of your money in this position so if you have 100K portfolio you know go ahead and buy $33,000 worth of call options maybe even $22,000 you know you go very conservative here but this is going to be a much smarter play especially in a bull market because if you can squeeze out 200% in just a couple months just think about it you take 100K to 200k or you take 200k to 400k in a short amount of time and that's just a short amount of time in in a bull market look you guys always wonder how did I scale so fast it's because I did take risk in 2021 I scaled 100K portfolio to $700,000 I used Tesla I use call options I use debit spreads I said I hope you don't mind I'm going to cover one more strategy it's going to be a debit spread so check out what a debit spread is okay so on Sofi I said that we can buy the 16 call option now look you can buy the 16 call option but if you think it's going to go up to 20 why not sell the $20 call option right so you buy the 16 but then you go ahead and sell the 20 and then there you go you get a subsidy you get your cost reduction right there because when you sell the $20 call option you get $89 in collected premium so you buy it for you know $216 then you get a rebate kind of I call it a rebate of $89 and all of a sudden here we get a call debit spread which gives us exactly what we think is going to happen which I think SOI is going to be a $20 stock post earnings there you go you have the 16 call option that you're long then you have a $20 call option that you sold and you get you get that upside with a lot lower cost so here essentially your maximum gain is $4 um but you're going to put up a total cost of $127 so if you think about the risk and return here you're risking about 127 bucks and you're total return here is about four is 400 exactly okay it's exactly 400 so you know that's over a 3X return okay I was talking about a 2X return now this is a 3X return where you take $125 into 400 so if you ask me even a smaller portfolio with 50k as a smaller portfolio or you know even 30k you have you have a small portfolio you you invest into this position you put up like $1,000 you do 10 10 contracts you put up $1,200 that 1,200 can go to $4,000 okay so that's something that I would do with the portion of my portfolio for sure now in 2021 when I was really scaling up I used a bit more for sure I had a little bit more risk but I also was very confident so it's kind of funny now because I'm kind of taking it full circle in 2021 I turned 100K into 700 and I just showed you guys in 2024 you know I started off the year I don't know in January I was around you know maybe 2.2 million now I'm at 4.2 so I definitely I'm over 50% return this year and that's all because I'm taking calculated risk I'm in the right stocks I'm I'm in Palance here I should have had a higher return because I picked pal here properly I picked Nvidia I'm actually disappointed with my return I beat S&amp;P 500 I've done very well and I made students tons of money I have doctors that don't want to be doctors anymore they don't want to work in the ER they don't want to I have nurses that are like ah I'm just too tired and and these are I have physician assistants these guys make a lot of money or nurse practitioners I have Engineers that are working in Silicon Valley and they're like I don't want to work anymore I actually hit some of my financial figures that I didn't think I was going to hit for a few years they hit it early with with the plays that I'm putting out and you know on Discord we're just having we're having a big celebration but I'm actually a little bit disappointed I actually have to admit to myself that I could have done better and that's that's just how trading is I can always do better there's always things that I'm learning all right so when I'm looking at call debit spreads what I just showed you right here you know this is a no-brainer this is a no-brainer play with part of my money I would definitely do this I would do a Tesla call option the leap option that I showed you guys in the uh two two days ago at the 350 strike price uh for September expiration okay.\nAmerican Airlines let me actually finish off with these three Square Chipotle have spy and Nvidia let actually go into American Airlines because I'm going to show you that you can print money with leaps actually leaps has been good on American Airlines too lately because uh the three month chart is absolutely ridiculous okay now um my community and I we bought American Airlines at$ 12289 but we've been selling we've been selling puts and calls for a long time 13 puts 14 puts as you can see here this is exactly what I've been recommending to like literally everybody as well as covered calls so I have 10 covered calls I have 1 th000 shares I'm a little bit silly here on American Airlines because right now I'm actually not making money I'm going to have to roll this position higher to make more money and I'm I'm fully invested in my portfolio and other picks so on American Airlines I really should I'm going to add to my position I'm going to add to my position this week and I'm going to have to be very smart about this because as you can see we actually have like sideways action on American Airlines so the big question and what I'm going to try to figure out this week is is this sideways action something that's going to be sustained this is something that I'm going to have to do some qualitative and quantitative analysis on and try to understand for myself are we going to to run the wheel strategy selling puts covered calls Etc cuz direction is very important you get direction right in this market you can become a millionaire like we actually are making millionaires right now because a lot of folks that come to me have bigger size portfolios of folks have 500k they start with 500k basically like I started with 2 mil now they're at a million I'm at 4 mil okay it's it's scaling guys it's all about scaling whatever you think is uh not possible it's absolutely possible you just have to have the right strategy and you have to understand how the market works you pick the right stocks some stocks go up 10x 20x right it really depends and the reason why I don't have 10x returns is because I'm extremely conservative but even in a conservative even me being conservative I still done fantastically well so this strategy of momentum is really important to understand with leaps with covered calls and with buying options buying options especially if you can buy some call options and momentum is on your side you're going to print money you're going to make you're going to make some some real paper I I got some durhams here for for my taxi I'm going out to dinner soon so you can make you can literally print money print money like these guys in Dubai who have oil money you know they make a million dollars a day some of these people here right they're not my clients they already have so much money they're only focused on spending money if you want to get to that point I'm telling you first of all subscribe because everything I've been putting out here has been fired I've been more fire and Dan Hive crazy actually I'm really proud of myself and I want to stay humble because you know it's not me you know it's it's because of God I'm blessed I'm happy that I have this opportunity to do my passion and in contribute to the world so I'm happy that I can financially benefit and also financially just create opportunities for other people it's you know although I'm being cocky I also want to tell myself that I'm grateful I'm grateful for what I have and I'm I'm very grateful for you guys as well now look let me get to a little bit more of the knowledge and the value you want to diversify beyond the main stock picks that I have it's important to manage your position sizes it's also really important to avoid overly aggressive tactics you guys that are getting overly cocky I do get some of these calls um my team helps me with uh many of my calls right because I like being a coach when it comes to learning about my program it's free to to have a consultation and we do get some people that say I'm very confident right now I I made a million dollars because of Henry's pick what else is there left well there's a lot of things left first of all I do have I tell them there's plays that you're making uh that I'm making that you're not aware of that's one number two it's all about risk management it's all about protecting your wealth if you're already making 10 to 20% a month right now in this market congratulations but you also have to prepare to protect yourself when the when the times get tough and that's you can't get overly aggressive you can't start using tactics like just buying call options getting overly leveraged into them that's very bad okay so you want to stay safe you want to stay consistent and you can Skyrocket your portfolio a lot you can make $10,000 a month you can easily scale six figures to you know from 100K to 500k in this market you know my parents they've actually done kind of a bad job in this market it's because um my parents like hard assets more so my mom and my dad they believe more in like real estate and having hard assets and when I told my parents to by Tesla back in the day they didn't listen to me and they bought it at like the top and then they didn't dollar cost average Tesla went down and they've been they've been like holding like bag holding essentially waiting for Tesla to rise up finally Tesla rose up and then they just sold it and they didn't I like I told them like just hold hold for like a decade I told my dad hold for a decade and AD doesn't listen to me I can't do anything everyone that joins me that listens to me scales 100K to 500k 500k to a million become people make $10,000 a month $20,000 a month with me but if they don't listen to me they they pay for the program they invest in my coaching they don't listen to me and it's very sometimes that happens you know and that's the only times I see students not succeeding because not everyone succeeds but the there's only one thing in common with everyone that doesn't succeed they start to follow their own stuff they start to ignore my time tested like tips like it's time I'm time tested guys I've done this for 10 years I have so much money I can't spend it financially I have other things in my life that I'm working on health relationships Faith other things that I'm working on right but when it comes to money if you're not listening to me you don't follow me I I know

with my parents like my dad just waited and then Tesla he broke even he made $10,000 he sold it like I made $10,000 but in the past few days he would have been up a lot more so you can't sell early that's the most important thing that's why I think having a mentor is so so important as well I have mentors I have tons of mentors that I paid for I paid over a million dollars I sent out Anil email I recently sent an email you guys can join the free email list I just said thanks I was just grateful and and I just said Thank you guys and I sent a long email about my values and what I believe in and why I'm doing this why I I think this is my mission my calling to help people trade options and get financially free I sent out an email so you can join that free email list in the description I have a first link for coaching second link is um my uh my free email list that's that's it I don't have sponsors or anything like that I just I don't do this for the money I do get paid from coaching I have a team they have families to feed but this is is absolutely not about money it's nice I like money but I like helping people more you know there if I got offered $100 million to become CEO of Microsoft I would decline I don't need the money I'm doing what I love I'm doing what I enjoy and I when I see you guys getting results I see people scaling there's nothing better than that when I see people scaling there's nothing better than that I feel like that gives a lot of people freedom and freedom and and having more finances improves your family life it can improve your health it can improve your time management it gives you more time to do what you want to do and not be dependent on on having a boss so I really I really realized that that I became a better option Trader actually uh and this is kind of like a catch 22 but I realized that I became a better option Trader when I had enough money that I wasn't really concerned about it anymore which actually allowed me to take on more risk so you know look I don't blame you guys when um sometimes uh people take it too easy on the trades and sometimes people take it too hard on the trades and they say they just buy a lot of options and they they want to go to the Moon too fast it's all about balance guys you can't be you can't be too safe if you're trying to be too safe sure you're going to get the S&P 500 return I mean we're not here to get S&P 00 return guys we're here to beat the S&P we're here to scale we're here to do things in the market that are unimaginable we're here to get 1% results you know I'm probably like 0.1% results and it's not easy you know it honestly does take a toll on me to always research these stocks and to bring these videos to you guys but listen the reason I work so hard is because I believe in this stuff and I eat my own cooking this is the reason why I work so hard and I show everything every single opportunity every single trade I basically have I I share it live like my Monday and Wednesday calls I do everything live it's all posted live like this is the trade that I made my Discord soon say thanks they take it so one thing that I the reason why I brought up my dad is because he made the mistake of not dollar cost averaging and I think a lot of you guys need to understand that you can dollar cost average with options you can dollar cost average into the high quality stocks that I cover and you should be in in in pound here in Tesla and my number one rule is pick stocks that are rising right now because we're in such a bull market that you got to pick stocks that are rising and number two volatility is your friend my voice is given out so I actually had a lot more stuff that I'm going to cover but I'll cover it in the next video uh subscribe and uh I'm going to have a lot more fire and a lot more money that's going to flood your pockets with just cash coming so let's get that money invest safe let's be smart and I'll catch you guys in the next video so I'll see you thanks for watching"", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.7}, {""company"": ""PayPal"", ""excerpt"": ""so stocks Amazon I'm up good money on Amazon on PayPal 38% uh Target I I made a mistake however I did point out in my Discord and I actually ignored my own advice I said buy a call option on target at0 that call option more than tripled in value I really regret not taking my own trade so 99% of the time I eat my own cooking but sometimes on Discord I said hey guys here's my opinion this is a good idea I have like on Archer one of you guys actually emailed me and gave me a tip on Archer so thank you to that person this is the only stock I actually invested in that was not my own research Archer someone told me about it and I guess they were watch I guess that trade may have came from Kathy Wood I'm not sure but I do read your guys emails I will leave my email down below if you're interested in joining 101 coaching um you can email me as well we do have 10 spots right now that we have open American Airlines we got the 35 I have 35% but this is not even representative because what I've been doing in American Airlines and the way I've actually made $10,000 a month I scaled my portfolio is also with American Airlines it might seem funny to you you're like he it's just an Airlines it goes up and down you will be shocked by how much money you can make by selling puts and covered calls and just running the wheel strategy on American Airlines I'm sorry this video is getting long but I hope I'm dropping so many knowledge bombs for you I hope I'm dropping so many gold nuggets for you that make you realize that the money is so abundant in this market and not just in this market American Airlines let me actually finish off with these three Square Chipotle have spy and Nvidia let actually go into American Airlines because I'm going to show you that you can print money with leaps actually leaps has been good on American Airlines too lately because uh the three month chart is absolutely ridiculous okay now um my community and I we bought American Airlines at$ 12289 but we've been selling we've been selling puts and calls for a long time 13 puts 14 puts as you can see here this is exactly what I've been recommending to like literally everybody as well as covered calls so I have 10 covered calls I have 1 th000 shares I'm a little bit silly here on American Airlines because right now I'm actually not making money I'm going to have to roll this position higher to make more money and I'm I'm fully invested in my portfolio and other picks so on American Airlines I really should I'm going to add to my position I'm going to add to my position this week and I'm going to have to be very smart about this because as you can see we actually have like sideways action on American Airlines so the big question and what I'm going to try to figure out this week is is this sideways action something that's going to be sustained this is something that I'm going to have to do some qualitative and quantitative analysis on and try to understand for myself are we going to to run the wheel strategy selling puts covered calls Etc cuz direction is very important you get direction right in this market you can become a millionaire like we actually are making millionaires right now because a lot of folks that come to me have bigger size portfolios of folks have 500k they start with 500k basically like I started with 2 mil now they're at a million I'm at 4 mil okay it's it's scaling guys it's all about scaling whatever you think is uh not possible it's absolutely possible you just have to have the right strategy and you have to understand how the market works you pick the right stocks some stocks go up 10x 20x right it really depends and the reason why I don't have 10x returns is because I'm extremely conservative but even in a conservative even me being conservative I still done fantastically well so this strategy of momentum is really important to understand with leaps with covered calls and with buying options buying options especially if you can buy some call options and momentum is on your side you're going to print money you're going to make you're going to make some some real paper I I got some durhams here for for my taxi I'm going out to dinner soon so you can make you can literally print money print money like these guys in Dubai who have oil money you know they make a million dollars a day some of these people here right they're not my clients they already have so much money they're only focused on spending money if you want to get to that point I'm telling you first of all subscribe because everything I've been putting out here has been fired I've been more fire and Dan Hive crazy actually I'm really proud of myself and I want to stay humble because you know it's not me you know it's it's because of God I'm blessed I'm happy that I have this opportunity to do my passion and in contribute to the world so I'm happy that I can financially benefit and also financially just create opportunities for other people it's you know although I'm being cocky I also want to tell myself that I'm grateful I'm grateful for what I have and I'm I'm very grateful for you guys as well now look let me get to a little bit more of the knowledge and the value you want to diversify beyond the main stock picks that I have it's important to manage your position sizes it's also really important to avoid overly aggressive tactics you guys that are getting overly cocky I do get some of these calls um my team helps me with uh many of my calls right because I like being a coach when it comes to learning about my program it's free to to have a consultation and we do get some people that say I'm very confident right now I I made a million dollars because of Henry's pick what else is there left well there's a lot of things left first of all I do have I tell them there's plays that you're making uh that I'm making that you're not aware of that's one number two it's all about risk management it's all about protecting your wealth if you're already making 10 to 20% a month right now in this market congratulations but you also have to prepare to protect yourself when the when the times get tough and that's you can't get overly aggressive you can't start using tactics like just buying call options getting overly leveraged into them that's very bad okay so you want to stay safe you want to stay consistent and you can Skyrocket your portfolio a lot you can make $10,000 a month you can easily scale six figures to you know from 100K to 500k in this market you know my parents they've actually done kind of a bad job in this market it's because um my parents like hard assets more so my mom and my dad they believe more in like real estate and having hard assets and when I told my parents to by Tesla back in the day they didn't listen to me and they bought it at like the top and then they didn't dollar cost average Tesla went down and they've been they've been like holding like bag holding essentially waiting for Tesla to rise up finally Tesla rose up and then they just sold it and they didn't I like I told them like just hold hold for like a decade I told my dad hold for a decade and AD doesn't listen to me I can't do anything everyone that joins me that listens to me scales 100K to 500k 500k to a million become people make $10,000 a month $20,000 a month with me but if they don't listen to me they they pay for the program they invest in my coaching they don't listen to me and it's very sometimes that happens you know and that's the only times I see students not succeeding because not everyone succeeds but the there's only one thing in common with everyone that doesn't succeed they start to follow their own stuff they start to ignore my time tested like tips like it's time I'm time tested guys I've done this for 10 years I have so much money I can't spend it financially I have other things in my life that I'm working on health relationships Faith other things that I'm working on right but when it comes to money if you're not listening to me you don't follow me I I know exactly what I'm doing it's silly not to in many ways so when I see students kind of going off the deep end getting really crazy about buying options or making risky plays

Invest with Henry,Qy1Uzkk4q0M,2024-12-08T14:15:01Z,WATCH BEFORE MONDAY 930am! #SOFI #TSLA #PLTR #NVDA #SPY #SMCI,Sofi,"I'm making plays on Sofi I'm going to cover all of these stocks as well as some others in this video and I have some big news and updates as well as some plays so look I respect your time let's jump into the first play of how we can make money I'm going to talk about Sofi but first my portfolio is at $4.2 million basically and last week when I made this video it was around $4 million we are scaling very fast and this is the best Market that I have seen to make money hand over fist bicep over trip I'm loving this market and I'm loving how my students are getting results look I'm going to show you Sofi right now because Sofi is a very interesting fintech stock and specifically what I see with Sofi is this stock is ready to explode the technical analysis on this stock is absolutely insane if I look at the past 3 months this stock has reached over $15 per share as it started around $7 so it has more than doubled now listen momentum is a really important factor and I want to talk about momentum because this stock keeps hitting new highs every single day so should you jump into it well the thing is I have discussed Sofi in my video on Monday last week and the stock has been doing actually some sideways action I've discussed Sofi in my last video last week when I said watch before 9:30 am and this stock is actually trending a little bit sideways so we have had a peak and actually a double top pattern around $16 per share now the stock has retracted just a little bit but to me it's looking like it's going to go back to $16 and Beyond due to momentum the three-month chart here is really clear and not just from the technical standpoint also from a fundamental standpoint I'm looking at my notes here I would do a sell put 15 strike price I would do that for January expiration the reason why is you can collect a very juicy premium by selling the 15 put option on Sofi and getting a good entry as the stock continues to move up I would actually do two strategies I would sell a $15 put option and I would actually buy a call option as well at the 16 strike for January expiration now I've been an option Sol for a very long time but in this market I'm also buying options I'm showing this as fast as I can on YouTube but obviously I'm doing everything live in my Discord community and on my one-on-one coaching I send out text messages so look the reason why Sofi is such a powerful stock is because they're disrupting in Industry okay I have quite a lot of research here I'm going to try to move through it as fast as possible while also making it simple to understand look trading is all about momentum it's like dropping a ball from the 30th floor I'm in Dubai right now I'm on a high floor if you were to drop an apple right it starts off very slow but as it falls down it accelerates accelerates and really fast okay the same thing is with stocks as they're going up you really want to catch that upside all right as the stock goes up you know like SOI over 100% it's really easy to go from 100 to 120 so you can capture that 20% move in a month that's why my portfolio was just like $3 million literally like 2 3 months ago now it's at over $4.2 million I've been printing money and that's because I'm following Trends and I'm showing you the stocks that I'm trading personally so Sofi I like that they have rapid growth and more important than rapid growth okay rapid growth is cool Amazon had rapid growth Tesla had rapid growth even more cool is not just rapid growth but profitability this is a big sign for me because like palen here palen here reached profitability finally after scaling and then they were put into the S&P 500 right they have S&P 500 inclusion same thing can happen with Sofi Sofi has demonstrated all right very impressive growth and looking at my notes here they added 756 th000 new members in Q3 2024 alone achieving four consecutive quarters of profitability four consecutive quarters of profitability means that they're going to enter into the index and once they enter into the index just like pound here this Stock's going to fly up okay this Stock's going to go up a lot it could be a $20 stock a $25 stock easily now I can't predict the future I don't know exactly when that's going to happen but in 2025 I'm telling you this stock is going to perform very well especially for the rest of December so this week you better be looking at making some plays and being smart with the stock because there's there's so much money to be made and right now i' I've said this in a couple of my videos now now is the time to reap all the fruits and vegetables that you have planted and harvested over you know it's summertime right we have planted fruits and veggies we we've taken care of them for months now it's time to reap what we have swn okay guys that now this Market is as it's peaking as the high momentum is coming in you want to take all this money and produce as much as possible you need it right now because when we get a pullback which I don't know what's going to happen but when we get a pullback we need to have so much money saved up we need to have loads of cash in our pocket that you know hey if you make 100 Grand in the next 3 months you lose 20 uh down the road it's okay because you're going to go back up losing 20 grand out of 100 Grand totally okay right because we can't predict when the market is going to come down when when the market shifts you know I can't predict that in a day but once it's shifting for about a week I know I know when it's shifting then I'll switch up my strategy I'll start to hedge stuff like that but I never prepare for a bare Market or crash ahead of time so right now what I'm doing my strategy is I'm going to get so rich I'm going to make so much money in in a short amount of time that when the bare Market comes I don't really care well when I say 100K I mean for you guys for me I'm going to make a few million I'm going make a few million I might reach eight figures here in the portfolio I don't know it's going to take some time but my next goal is $5 million and probably next 3 to 6 months and I've been very conservative but you know I have to kind of tell myself hey Henry it's not time to be conservative it's time to make money hand over fist and get rich because right now I'm I'm going to just get to the facts I I want to I'm just being hyped right now I'm just way too excited I'm way too excited to share this profits with you guys in my opinion here look the impact of S&P 500 inclusion with Sofi boom baby it's going to be like fire the Stock's going to Skyrocket like paler did and this is also going to cause increased liquidity it's going to cause attraction of institutional investors and number three it's going to cause a positive price impact due to index tracking funds automatically purchasing this stock what happens is when a stock enters the S&P 500 boom all the index funds have to buy the stock because they must the definition of an ETF of an S&P 500 ETF is it's supposed to have the 500 companies that the S&P 500 has right that's the whole goal of an ETF it tracks an index right so if the index has Sofi for example then the index month's purchase soofi as well right because they have to have the shares and that's what you're investing in so that's going to increase liquidity and institutional investors many of them actually have rules and one of their rules is the stock must be in the S&P 500 right they don't trade a liquid stocks which is what I tell you guys all the time if if you're looking at trading options better be a tight bit ask spread there better be a lot of volume I can show you what that looks like actually let me go here and let me show you a trade SOI put option here I just wanted to give you guys the understanding here I'm spending extra time because this is something new that I'm putting out on YouTube I'm going to go over my Tesla position guys real quick check it out I have Tesla 3,000 shares okay I bought at $332 some people said oh you're crazy it's peing no it's not no it's not I'm going to talk about Tesla in just a moment but I just want to point out that I already made $169,000 I just posted this week this video last week and I have more Tesla shares in my in my Robin Hood as well so I'm telling you guys I've been at this game for 10 years I worked at Goldman Sachs I know exactly what I'm doing to make money in a bull market and the bare Market I'm not scared of bare markets at all look for Sofi what I would do is I would go to January 17th give yourself some time I like 30-day options cuz then you can you know put in a little bit less work and get that passive income this is fairly passive but really high return okay here's what I would do this is going to be something new I'm going explain right now all right you can sell the 15 right here okay sell the 15 this will give you $87 that's heck of a lot of money $87 on ,400 excuse me because when you sell a put option the maximum profit is 8 is 87 in this example and it reduces the capital that you have to put up instead of putting up $1,500 you're basically putting up about $1,400 so this this return is very high we have a very high return in in a month but look the real money is made when you also buy a call option here so let's say that Sofi goes up to like $17 which with this momentum it's very possible I would also look at buying a 16 call option I'm going to show you a very interesting strategy right now very interesting nobody talks about this one nobody talks about this one they don't have the experience that I have listen if you sell a 15 put right you get 87 now if you buy a call it's pretty it's it's fairly cheap you only have $61 here right so look your break even right here is going to be about $658 so if this stock Sofi goes to $17 per share all right what's going to happen is you're going to make about $42 but you're only putting up$ 661 so if you put up $61 and you make basically you know $42 in profit that's like a 67% return right this doesn't seem like a lot obviously don't do 100 shares I'm just I'm just showing you how high of a return this is you still need safe and proper risk management and also because you're selling a put option this can be a fairly Capital intensive strategy but if you did a 100 here I mean you can see how you can make thousands of dollars this is not like a crazy big siized position but obviously you don't want to make a crazy big siized position so you want to go ahead and do like say 10 contracts here also what you can do let me just give you a little bit of another perspective what you can do to reduce the cost even more is you have sold a put option you have bought a call option you can also sell another call option don't get confused basically this right here is going to be a very similar position to owning stock you can see how you get upside you also do get downside if the stock ends up falling there's no perfect strategy but you can also sell a call option right here let's say we we think it's going to go to 17 but not that much higher so now if I sell a 17 now these returns are going to look a lot better they're going to look a lot better in our uh we actually get a total credit here which is pretty crazy so essentially you're selling a put option and then you're doing a bull call spread Okay a bull call spread I am doing more bull call spreads and leaps in my community right now with my one-on-one students even the lawyers the doctors the the I work with some Pilots right now even with these guys that have bigger portfolios you know we got of 300K 500k 800k we're still doing leaps because in this market you can print a lot of money and if you can use a leap option and put up onethird of the capital why not scale your portfolio even if it is a big portfolio 500k 800k right I I'm seeing guys that are producing 50k a month right now on portfolios that are you know 400k 500k we're seeing some big results and that's fantastic a lot of my guys are telling me I got lawyers that are like y I don't want to be a lawyer no more I don't want to work for a contract basis and maybe I win a case maybe I don't they're making more option trading right now the same with doctors they're really busy I get it you guys are super busy I see so many profits coming in with options they're like you know I don't know maybe I should uh do a part-time schedule you know we got some guys in the ER room stuff like that um nurses everything Engineers I see Engineers are like man I don't want to work for uh for meta no more I don't want to work for snow no more this job isn't for me I want to trade options and that's it is possible especially if you have a sixf figureure portfolio you can you can look at retirement in this bull market if you can go from 500K to a million and I was saying in a in a in a recent video how you can scale at 500k if you're at 100K in this market you can scale so fast you can reach retirement in a much shorter time if you play your cards right that's why right now it's such an urgent time I need you to really pay attention and really just capitalize so anyways I spent a lot of time on Sofi this is a strategy that I would run right now and I just think that you know Sofi based on their their revenue streams as well the company has mul multifaceted business model right they're looking at making money from banking services they're looking at making money from a growing deposit base they're looking at Fint infrastructure offerings and they provide multiple avenues for Revenue growth which makes me really bullish when I was working out Goldman Sachs and I was looking at their systems their technology guys it was so outdated I was like this is a multi-billion dollar company these advisers they're managing billions of dollars but they're using like some dinosaur technology right and a lot of banks nowadays they have high expenses they have lots of branches sofa is rethinking things it's like the future it's fintech right I really like fintech because it's Finance which makes a lot of money but it's technology as as well so look the Strategic Partnerships that they have are really strong so they launched the robo advisor platform with the partnership with black rock and this demonstrates to me that Sofi has the ability to form strategic alliances that expand its service offerings Partnerships are very powerful of done right especially when you look at Partnerships on a on a big company level right I don't personally you know so so look make that Sofi play and uh let's move on to the second stock which is going to be Tesla",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,Qy1Uzkk4q0M,2024-12-08T14:15:01Z,WATCH BEFORE MONDAY 930am! #SOFI #TSLA #PLTR #NVDA #SPY #SMCI,Tesla,"I'm making plays on Tesla paler Nvidia and I'm going to cover all of these stocks as well as some others in this video and I have some big news and updates as well as some plays so look I respect your time let's jump into the first play of how we can make money I'm going to talk about Sofi but first my portfolio is at $4.2 million basically and last week when I made this video it was around $4 million we are scaling very fast and this is the best Market that I have seen to make money hand over fist bicep over trip I'm loving this market and I'm loving how my students are getting results look I'm going to show you Sofi right now because Sofi is a very interesting fintech stock and specifically what I see with Sofi is this stock is ready to explode the technical analysis on this stock is absolutely insane if I look at the past 3 months this stock has reached over $15 per share as it started around $7 so it has more than doubled now listen momentum is a really important factor and I want to talk about momentum because this stock keeps hitting new highs every single day so should you jump into it well the thing is I have discussed Sofi in my video on Monday last week and the stock has been doing actually some sideways action I've discussed Sofi in my last video last week when I said watch before 9:30 am and this stock is actually trending a little bit sideways so we have had a peak and actually a double top pattern around $16 per share now the stock has retracted just a little bit but to me it's looking like it's going to go back to $16 and Beyond due to momentum the three-month chart here is really clear and not just from the technical standpoint also from a fundamental standpoint I'm looking at my notes here I would do a sell put 15 strike price I would do that for January expiration the reason why is you can collect a very juicy premium by selling the 15 put option on Sofi and getting a good entry as the stock continues to move up I would actually do two strategies I would sell a $15 put option and I would actually buy a call option as well at the 16 strike for January expiration now I've been an option Sol for a very long time but in this market I'm also buying options I'm showing this as fast as I can on YouTube but obviously I'm doing everything live in my Discord community and on my one-on-one coaching I send out text messages so look the reason why Sofi is such a powerful stock is because they're disrupting in Industry okay I have quite a lot of research here I'm going to try to move through it as fast as possible while also making it simple to understand look trading is all about momentum it's like dropping a ball from the 30th floor I'm in Dubai right now I'm on a high floor if you were to drop an apple right it starts off very slow but as it falls down it accelerates accelerates and really fast okay the same thing is with stocks as they're going up you really want to catch that upside all right as the stock goes up you know like SOI over 100% it's really easy to go from 100 to 120 so you can capture that 20% move in a month that's why my portfolio was just like $3 million literally like 2 3 months ago now it's at over $4.2 million I've been printing money and that's because I'm following Trends and I'm showing you the stocks that I'm trading personally so Sofi I like that they have rapid growth and more important than rapid growth okay rapid growth is cool Amazon had rapid growth Tesla had rapid growth even more cool is not just rapid growth but profitability this is a big sign for me because like palen here palen here reached profitability finally after scaling and then they were put into the S&P 500 right they have S&P 500 inclusion same thing can happen with Sofi Sofi has demonstrated all right very impressive growth and looking at my notes here they added 756 th000 new members in Q3 2024 alone achieving four consecutive quarters of profitability four consecutive quarters of profitability means that they're going to enter into the index and once they enter into the index just like pound here this Stock's going to fly up okay this Stock's going to go up a lot it could be a $20 stock a $25 stock easily now I can't predict the future I don't know exactly when that's going to happen but in 2025 I'm telling you this stock is going to perform very well especially for the rest of December so this week you better be looking at making some plays and being smart with the stock because there's there's so much money to be made and right now i' I've said this in a couple of my videos now now is the time to reap all the fruits and vegetables that you have planted and harvested over you know it's summertime right we have planted fruits and veggies we we've taken care of them for months now it's time to reap what we have swn okay guys that now this Market is as it's peaking as the high momentum is coming in you want to take all this money and produce as much as possible you need it right now because when we get a pullback which I don't know what's going to happen but when we get a pullback we need to have so much money saved up we need to have loads of cash in our pocket that you know hey if you make 100 Grand in the next 3 months you lose 20 uh down the road it's okay because you're going to go back up losing 20 grand out of 100 Grand totally okay right because we can't predict when the market is going to come down when when the market shifts you know I can't predict that in a day but once it's shifting for about a week I know I know when it's shifting then I'll switch up my strategy I'll start to hedge stuff like that but I never prepare for a bare Market or crash ahead of time so right now what I'm doing my strategy is I'm going to get so rich I'm going to make so much money in in a short amount of time that when the bare Market comes I don't really care well when I say 100K I mean for you guys for me I'm going to make a few million I'm going make a few million I might reach eight figures here in the portfolio I don't know it's going to take some time but my next goal is $5 million and probably next 3 to 6 months and I've been very conservative but you know I have to kind of tell myself hey Henry it's not time to be conservative it's time to make money hand over fist and get rich because right now I'm I'm going to just get to the facts I I want to I'm just being hyped right now I'm just way too excited I'm way too excited to share this profits with you guys in my opinion here look the impact of S&P 500 inclusion with Sofi boom baby it's going to be like fire the Stock's going to Skyrocket like paler did and this is also going to cause increased liquidity it's going to cause attraction of institutional investors and number three it's going to cause a positive price impact due to index tracking funds automatically purchasing this stock what happens is when a stock enters the S&P 500 boom all the index funds have to buy the stock because they must the definition of an ETF of an S&P 500 ETF is it's supposed to have the 500 companies that the S&P 500 has right that's the whole goal of an ETF it tracks an index right so if the index has Sofi for example then the index month's purchase soofi as well right because they have to have the shares and that's what you're investing in so that's going to increase liquidity and institutional investors many of them actually have rules and one of their rules is the stock must be in the S&P 500 right they don't trade a liquid stocks which is what I tell you guys all the time if if you're looking at trading options better be a tight bit ask spread there better be a lot of volume I can show you what that looks like actually let me go here and let me show you a trade SOI put option here I just wanted to give you guys the understanding here I'm spending extra time because this is something new that I'm putting out on YouTube I'm going to go over my Tesla position guys real quick check it out I have Tesla 3,000 shares okay I bought at $332 some people said oh you're crazy it's peing no it's not no it's not I'm going to talk about Tesla in just a moment but I just want to point out that I already made $169,000 I just posted this week this video last week and I have more Tesla shares in my in my Robin Hood as well so I'm telling you guys I've been at this game for 10 years I worked at Goldman Sachs I know exactly what I'm doing to make money in a bull market and the bare Market I'm not scared of bare markets at all look for Sofi what I would do is I would go to January 17th give yourself some time I like 30-day options cuz then you can you know put in a little bit less work and get that passive income this is fairly passive but really high return okay here's what I would do this is going to be something new I'm going explain right now all right you can sell the 15 right here okay sell the 15 this will give you $87 that's heck of a lot of money $87 on ,400 excuse me because when you sell a put option the maximum profit is 8 is 87 in this example and it reduces the capital that you have to put up instead of putting up $1,500 you're basically putting up about $1,400 so this this return is very high we have a very high return in in a month but look the real money is made when you also buy a call option here so let's say that Sofi goes up to like $17 which with this momentum it's very possible I would also look at buying a 16 call option I'm going to show you a very interesting strategy right now very interesting nobody talks about this one nobody talks about this one they don't have the experience that I have listen if you sell a 15 put right you get 87 now if you buy a call it's pretty it's it's fairly cheap you only have $61 here right so look your break even right here is going to be about $658 so if this stock Sofi goes to $17 per share all right what's going to happen is you're going to make about $42 but you're only putting up$ 661 so if you put up $61 and you make basically you know $42 in profit that's like a 67% return right this doesn't seem like a lot obviously don't do 100 shares I'm just I'm just showing you how high of a return this is you still need safe and proper risk management and also because you're selling a put option this can be a fairly Capital intensive strategy but if you did a 100 here I mean you can see how you can make thousands of dollars this is not like a crazy big siized position but obviously you don't want to make a crazy big siized position so you want to go ahead and do like say 10 contracts here also what you can do let me just give you a little bit of another perspective what you can do to reduce the cost even more is you have sold a put option you have bought a call option you can also sell another call option don't get confused basically this right here is going to be a very similar position to owning stock you can see how you get upside you also do get downside if the stock ends up falling there's no perfect strategy but you can also sell a call option right here let's say we we think it's going to go to 17 but not that much higher so now if I sell a 17 now these returns are going to look a lot better they're going to look a lot better in our uh we actually get a total credit here which is pretty crazy so essentially you're selling a put option and then you're doing a bull call spread Okay a bull call spread I am doing more bull call spreads and leaps in my community right now with my one-on-one students even the lawyers the doctors the the I work with some Pilots right now even with these guys that have bigger portfolios you know we got of 300K 500k 800k we're still doing leaps because in this market you can print a lot of money and if you can use a leap option and put up onethird of the capital why not scale your portfolio even if it is a big portfolio 500k 800k right I I'm seeing guys that are producing 50k a month right now on portfolios that are you know 400k 500k we're seeing some big results and that's fantastic a lot of my guys are telling me I got lawyers that are like y I don't want to be a lawyer no more I don't want to work for a contract basis and maybe I win a case

retirement in this bull market if you can go from 500K to a million and I was saying in a in a in a recent video how you can scale at 500k if you're at 100K in this market you can scale so fast you

know so so look make that Sofi play and uh let's move on to the second stock which is going to be Tesla I'm going to try to go over this a lot faster I showed you my position here on Tesla at 169 ,000 in gains I put a million dollar I got $1.2 million I made a video yesterday on my Tesla position I'm also going to show you my Tesla position in my Robinhood portfolio my other portfolio I'm using some more interesting strategies I only cover that in my one-on-one coaching because some of the strategies I do are more more aggressive higher growth and uh you know I I can only put out so much free content here on YouTube so look Tesla all right I got another 400k so I actually have 1 point over $1.5 million on Tesla right now I have two positions on Tesla one in my other portfolio one in my in my public portfolio here for the YouTube and uh I'm buying this stock hand over fist and I've been 100% right on this stock 100% correct I said this going to be a $500 stock you can watch yesterday's uh video that I posted but I'm going to recap real fast what I did in that video was I recommended buying a 350 leap option on Tesla you want leaps I recommended previously at 330 we doubled our money on the 330 now I'm recommending to do 350 the 350 gives you upside on Tesla all right that was in yesterday's video so after you watch this video you can check it out I'm going to go quickly here just to recap 350 buy leap option the expiration I post I posted in that video and the reasoning for it was I think Tesla's undervalued because Robo taxis are not fully priced in in the last video I also showed what Elon Musk said about Robo taxis and the economics of it guys economics is the most important thing humans we do things that make sense for us economically we're all making economic decisions even often times with love okay even often times with our friends we are making economic decisions humans we naturally are trying to see what is a good opportunity what is a good decision for us to make you call it you know whatever you want to call it right I have faith but at the same time humans are going to be humans so when you look at Tesla and what Elon mus said about economics that fired me up that changed how I thought about Tesla I've been bullish on Tesla since 2021 I've been bullish on paler since 2021 we're going to go over paler next but for Tesla the picture is clear the tech market right now we got fire Tesla Elon Musk buddy buddy like buddy buddy with Donald Trump this is going to be huge for Tesla regulations look trying to make this video quick watch other one if you want Tesla 350 buy call",1.0,0.9

I've been bullish on paler since 2021 we're going to go over paler next but for Tesla the picture is clear the tech market right now we got fire Tesla Elon Musk buddy buddy like buddy buddy with Donald Trump this is going to be huge for Tesla regulations look trying to make this video quick watch other one if you want Tesla 350 buy call now the next stock I want to go into is paler I also made a recent video on paler let me give you the the the summary of paler real fast palen's current PE ratio looks excessive it looks extreme it looks crazy palen PE ratio makes no sense guess what guys PE ratios don't matter on high innovation high quality tech stocks they don't matter okay people that talk about PE ratio on a tech stock I know they don't know what they're talking about I know they don't understand at all because it's not about the PE Ratio first of all PS ratio is more important for palen here PS ratio is pretty reasonable all right but I'm looking if Palance here is overvalued and I would say no it's not overvalued on a long-term basis okay I'm going to go to my paler position I'm going to show you my position guys it's all about transparency for me right I want to show you everything I'm doing I show you my $1.5 million position on Tesla I'm going show you my paler position my Nvidia position I show you every single position I'm not one of these guys on YouTube like all all my other competitors who show you an XL sheet who make the same videos as me with the same titles the same thumbnails everything I'm showing you guys cuz to me it's important I want you to see that I I'm eating my own cooking guys I eat my own cooking to me it's the most important thing I'm not going to cover a stock I don't personally believe in I'm not going to cover anything for the views I'm going to cover what I personally believe in and pal here is something that I absolutely believe in $775 I've covered this stock since it was $21 .71 there's proof on the screen right there 5,000 shares I'm up $284,000 guys I can't spend the money I'm in Dubai and I'm still creating more passive income from my portfolio than I could spend even if I wanted to live a lavish life which I don't I don't need any fancy stuff I'm just telling you this game is a lot easier then you think if you have the right Mentor the right tools the right knowledge and you can take action okay I can help you with action if you want my one-onone students I tell them listen you got to do this this is what I believe to be right I can't pull the trigger for them they got to make the trade but I say like this is my opinion opion you've hired me this is what I think you should do we've been making money hand over fist that way so I'm telling you Palante here I have high belief in I do have some covered calls I'm rolling up I got a little bit of hot water here with the covered calls I'm down $44,000 I'm just being honest I'm not perfect I did covered calls and I've been telling you know I don't want to call it advice because I'm not a financial adviser I'm just you know lots of experience here and I'm just sharing my knowledge here I've said on this YouTube channel right now we don't want to be in covered calls we want to let our shares ride I'm telling all my one-onone soon as I said listen I have have this business owner right now who has a marketing agency and I have a lot of business owners and he has a lot of covered calls I said man you don't want them right now we're in a bull market take it easy just let your shares ride all right so I given him that tip and it's it's made a difference it's made a difference because as our covered calls go to the money you got to roll them not ideal in this market so I'm in a little bit of hot water but I'm not in hot water on a lot of my positions cuz I'm letting them ride even my boring positions on Apple I'm I'm going to show you some more stuff look since 21 I've been in palen here and this stock I'm going to continue to stay in it okay it's at $775 I'm up almost $250 something perc paler solutions by the way guys they've been proven they're I would say they're time tested at this point paler is essential to the economy um you know unfortunately paler is fantastic for for Wars we got the Ukraine and Russia you know conflict I'm not too far from that's kind of my roots around that area myself and we got some conflicts there okay we got we got conflicts in the Middle East you know we got the whole situation in the Middle East won't even get into the politics of that but listen Palante here they're going to make a lot of money because listen when there's Wars happening Modern Warfare right now it's shifting to cyber guys the Warfare isn't about you know like in the old days where you got guns and knives and stuff like that uh right now it's cyber warfare it's cyber security it's AI driven strategies it's Fierce out there and it's all about technology right we're going into the tech we've been in we've been in the tech age right so Palante here with the Modern Warfare they're going to be making a lot of money fortunately or unfortunately however you want to look at that situation I wish we didn't have any wars um but listen you know whatever there people are making money you know we got to follow where the money goes obviously I'd love to not have any wars but paler is making a lot of money and they're going to continue to make money off of that now analysts like Dan IES they describe paler and they call it like the Messi of AI right Dan I is like it's like the messy stock and that's because it kind of is right when you look at defense uh paler is using AI the software everything that I see with paler I made a video recently guys I've been right on the money trust Uncle

in a day but once it's shifting for about a week I know I know when it's shifting then I'll switch up my strategy I'll start to hedge stuff like that but I never prepare for a bare Market or crash ahead of time so right now what I'm doing my strategy is I'm going to get so rich I'm going to make so much money in in a short amount of time that when the bare Market comes I don't really care well when I say 100K I mean for you guys for me I'm going to make a few million I'm going make a few million I might reach eight figures here in the portfolio I don't know it's going to take some time but my next goal is $5 million and probably next 3 to 6 months and I've been very conservative but you know I have to kind of tell myself hey Henry it's not time to be conservative it's time to make money hand over fist and get rich because right now I'm I'm going to just get to the facts I I want to I'm just being hyped right now I'm just way too excited I'm way too excited to share this profits with you guys in my opinion here look the impact of S&P 500 inclusion with Sofi boom baby it's going to be like fire the Stock's going to Skyrocket like paler did and this is also going to cause increased liquidity it's going to cause attraction of institutional investors and number three it's going to cause a positive price impact due to index tracking funds automatically purchasing this stock what happens is when a stock enters the S&P 500 boom all the index funds have to buy the stock because they must the definition of an ETF of an S&P 500 ETF is it's supposed to have the 500 companies that the S&P 500 has right that's the whole goal of an ETF it tracks an index right so if the index has Sofi for example then the index month's purchase soofi as well right because they have to have the shares and that's what you're investing in so that's going to increase liquidity and institutional investors many of them actually have rules and one of their rules is the stock must be in the S&P 500 right they don't trade a liquid stocks which is what I tell you guys all the time if if you're looking at trading options better be a tight bit ask spread there better be a lot of volume I can show you what that looks like actually let me go here and let me show you a trade SOI put option here I just wanted to give you guys the understanding here I'm spending extra time because this is something new that I'm putting out on YouTube I'm going to go over my Tesla position guys real quick check it out I have Tesla 3,000 shares okay I bought at $332 some people said oh you're crazy it's peing no it's not no it's not I'm going to talk about Tesla in just a moment but I just want to point out that I already made $169,000 I just posted this week this video last week and I have more Tesla shares in my in my Robin Hood as well so I'm telling you guys I've been at this game for 10 years I worked at Goldman Sachs I know exactly what I'm doing to make money in a bull market and the bare Market I'm not scared of bare markets at all look for Sofi what I would do is I would go to January 17th give yourself some time I like 30-day options cuz then you can you know put in a little bit less work and get that passive income this is fairly passive but really high return okay here's what I would do this is going to be something new I'm going explain right now all right you can sell the 15 right here okay sell the 15 this will give you $87 that's heck of a lot of money $87 on ,400 excuse me because when you sell a put option the maximum profit is 8 is 87 in this example and it reduces the capital that you have to put up instead of putting up $1,500 you're basically putting up about $1,400 so this this return is very high we have a very high return in in a month but look the real money is made when you also buy a call option here so let's say that Sofi goes up to like $17 which with this momentum it's very possible I would also look at buying a 16 call option I'm going to show you a very interesting strategy right now very interesting nobody talks about this one nobody talks about this one they don't have the experience that I have listen if you sell a 15 put right you get 87 now if you buy a call it's pretty it's it's fairly cheap you only have $61 here right so look your break even right here is going to be about $658 so if this stock Sofi goes to $17 per share all right what's going to happen is you're going to make about $42 but you're only putting up$ 661 so if you put up $61 and you make basically you know $42 in profit that's like a 67% return right this doesn't seem like a lot obviously don't do 100 shares I'm just I'm just showing you how high of a return this is you still need safe and proper risk management and also because you're selling a put option this can be a fairly Capital intensive strategy but if you did a 100 here I mean you can see how you can make thousands of dollars this is not like a crazy big siized position but obviously you don't want to make a crazy big siized position so you want to go ahead and do like say 10 contracts here also what you can do let me just give you a little bit of another perspective what you can do to reduce the cost even more is you have sold a put option you have bought a call option you can also sell another call option don't get confused basically this right here is going to be a very similar position to owning stock you can see how you get upside you also do get downside if the stock ends up falling there's no perfect strategy but you can also sell a call option right here let's say we we think it's going to go to 17 but not that much higher so now if I sell a 17 now these returns are going to look a lot better they're going to look a lot better in our uh we actually get a total credit here which is pretty crazy so essentially you're selling a put option and then you're doing a bull call spread Okay a bull call spread I am doing more bull call spreads and leaps in my community right now with my one-on-one students even the lawyers the doctors the the I work with some Pilots right now even with these guys that have bigger portfolios you know we got of 300K 500k 800k we're still doing leaps because in this market you can print a lot of money and if you can use a leap option and put up onethird of the capital why not scale your portfolio even if it is a big portfolio 500k 800k right I I'm seeing guys that are producing 50k a month right now on portfolios that are you know 400k 500k we're seeing some big results and that's fantastic a lot of my guys are telling me I got lawyers that are like y I don't want to be a lawyer no more I don't want to work for a contract basis and maybe I win a case maybe I don't they're making more option trading right now the same with doctors they're really busy I get it you guys are super busy I see so many profits coming in with options they're like you know I don't know maybe I should uh do a part-time schedule you know we got some guys in the ER room stuff like that um nurses everything Engineers I see Engineers are like man I don't want to work for uh for meta no more I don't want to work for snow no more this job isn't for me I want to trade options and that's it is possible especially if you have a sixf figureure portfolio you can you can look at retirement in this bull market if you can go from 500K to a million and I was saying in a in a in a recent video how you can scale at 500k if you're at 100K in this market you can scale so fast you can reach retirement in a much shorter time if you play your cards right that's why right now it's such an urgent time I need you to really pay attention and really just capitalize so anyways I spent a lot of time on Sofi this is a strategy that I would run right now and I just think that you know Sofi based on their their revenue streams as well the company has mul multifaceted business model right they're looking at making money from banking services they're looking at making money from a growing deposit base they're looking at Fint infrastructure offerings and they provide multiple avenues for Revenue growth which makes me really bullish when I was working out Goldman Sachs and I was looking at their systems their technology guys it was so outdated I was like this is a multi-billion dollar company these advisers they're managing billions of dollars but they're using like some dinosaur technology right and a lot of banks nowadays they have high expenses they have lots of branches sofa is rethinking things it's like the future it's fintech right I really like fintech because it's Finance which makes a lot of money but it's technology as as well so look the Strategic Partnerships that they have are really strong so they launched the robo advisor platform with the partnership with black rock and this demonstrates to me that Sofi has the ability to form strategic alliances that expand its service offerings Partnerships are very powerful of done right especially when you look at Partnerships on a on a big company level right I don't personally you know so so look make that Sofi play and uh let's move on to the second stock which is going to be Tesla I'm going to try to go over this a lot faster I showed you my position here on Tesla at 169 ,000 in gains I put a million dollar I got $1.2 million I made a video yesterday on my Tesla position I'm also going to show you my Tesla position in my Robinhood portfolio my other portfolio I'm using some more interesting strategies I only cover that in my one-on-one coaching because some of the strategies I do are more more aggressive higher growth and uh you know I I can only put out so much free content here on YouTube so look Tesla all right I got another 400k so I actually have 1 point over $1.5 million on Tesla right now I have two positions on Tesla one in my other portfolio one in my in my public portfolio here for the YouTube and uh I'm buying this stock hand over fist and I've been 100% right on this stock 100% correct I said this going to be a $500 stock you can watch yesterday's uh video that I posted but I'm going to recap real fast what I did in that video was I recommended buying a 350 leap option on Tesla you want leaps I recommended previously at 330 we doubled our money on the 330 now I'm recommending to do 350 the 350 gives you upside on Tesla all right that was in yesterday's video so after you watch this video you can check it out I'm going to go quickly here just to recap 350 buy leap option the expiration I post I posted in that video and the reasoning for it was I think Tesla's undervalued because Robo taxis are not fully priced in in the last video I also showed what Elon Musk said about Robo taxis and the economics of it guys economics is the most important thing humans we do things that make sense for us economically we're all making economic decisions even often times with love okay even often times with our friends we are making economic decisions humans we naturally are trying to see what is a good opportunity what is a good decision for us to make you call it you know whatever you want to call it right I have faith but at the same time humans are going to be humans so when you look at Tesla and what Elon mus said about economics that fired me up that changed how I thought about Tesla I've been bullish on Tesla since 2021 I've been bullish on paler since 2021 we're going to go over paler next but for Tesla the picture is clear the tech market right now we got fire Tesla Elon Musk buddy buddy like buddy buddy with Donald Trump this is going to be huge for Tesla regulations look trying to make this video quick watch other one if you want Tesla 350 buy call listen next stock I want to cover is going to be Nvidia I'm going to go into my Nvidia position Nvidia has had a move so I want to give you an update on what I see happening with Nvidia stock listen the stock I have an average cost at 137 I want to buy more Nvidia stock I got some options here as well that are up about $1,000 I got covered calls I would say we still want to go covered calls I would do a simple 150 covered call honestly for March expiration 2025 you can also do the positions that I have right here this is still a good position for 1220 for this month you can do a covered call at 148 you can do a covered call at 146 both of these positions are going to be completely okay and you can collect some income on Nvidia and I would say Nvidia is a fantastic AI play You can sell puts to enter the stock or you can do covered calls to generate some income on the shares that you already have either way guys selling puts and covered calls is very similar because you're tying up about the same amount of capital to make about the same amount of Premium so the only Advantage is when you do a covered call you get the dividend but Nvidia really has a few pennies of of dividends it's really not that much so it's really not something that is a concern to me I would actually do both this is something that I call the coverage strangle strategy I know I'm hitting you guys with a lot of content here making content e even I'm on vacation I'm traveling but I'm still dedicated it's my mission I sent out an email by the way you can join my free email list I sent out email sometimes with plays or just yesterday I sent out an

Invest with Henry,eVifPL2xAPM,2024-12-07T16:00:36Z,"I JUST Invested $1.5 MILLION in Tesla Stock (TSLA), Here's Why",Tesla,"I just put $1 million into Tesla stock very recently and as you can see I'm up $116,000 in the past few days and I just added more to my position in this video I'm going to explain to you why I'm buying Tesla stock what I'm doing with Tesla stock and an option trade that's going to make you a lot of money so let's jump into the video analysts are likely to revise Tesla's price Target up but not because the Stock's actually good but it's still a good reason the reason why they actually will revise their price Target up is because as Tesla surges these analysts feel stupid they feel dumb right because as Tesla goes up and they have a price target of 150 they have to raise their price Target which creates kind of like that spiraling effect okay as analysts are like wait I'm way too far from Tesla I look stupid let me raise my price Target up more analysts copy each other it's a copying game guys you think these analysts are not looking at each other they're just copying each other all right so when the company surges in value like Tesla has and it reflects in the company's growth the analysts are like well duh this was an obvious play so they start raising their price targets and that's actually going to help Tesla's price per share maintain its value I have $1 million in Tesla stock I have 3,000 shares as you can see here I bought this just a few days ago and I made a video on it but at the same time I also have more more shares in Tesla in my other portfolio my main portfolio that you guys usually see and I up $153,000 on Tesla stock here with 1,000 shares so it's safe to say that I have a ton of Tesla stock Let me explain the reason why I put $1 million more into Tesla stock is it is clear to me that this stock is going to $500 per share and it will hit $500 per share in 2025 I have high confidence in that and I'm sure of this because Elon musk's announcement of Robo taxi event the tech bull market and um the tech bull market that will increase demand for Tesla stock recent analyst upgrades switching from bearish to bullish and my new reason Bank of America Securities they have a bullish outtake after a giga Austin Factory visit so that's your answer those are my reasons why Tesla is going to $500 per share past few days when I bought Tesla to begin with and I started that $1 million position I had $1.3 million in it I had 1 mil and then 300,000 now is basically I had 1.5 mil that's because of analyst upgrading as well as other reasons I'm going to get into in this video they see Tesla going up they're completely changing their mind one of those analysts is Roth capitals Craig Irvin this guy for years and years actually he said that Tesla has no technological advancement compared to Toyota what a crazy statement this guy literally said that toota and Tesla same thing same thing they don't have a technology Advantage which is absolutely absurd technology is obviously the biggest thing that Tesla has they have the biggest Advantage with data with technology with AI you think Elon Musk isn't better than toota you got to be kidding me absolutely it's a joke so this guy finally realized he's finally jumped off of his Looney Tunes bandwagon and he finally switched 180° which I think is also a big contributor why the stock has popped a few percentage points we also know from other analysts like Dan IES he mentioned how regulations are about to get a lot better for Tesla and with Elon Musk in the White House essentially that Tesla is going to do very well in 2025 and 2026 I've been telling you guys paler Tesla and Nvidia these are the powerful stocks that you have to be in right now just because I'm looking at Craig Irving I'm looking at Dan IES and I'm looking at other analysts from Bank of America which I'm about to get into it doesn't mean that I'm not doing my own analysis at the end of the day I trust myself more than I trust anybody else I'm only looking at these clips and I'm showing you guys a clip I'm going to show you one more real fast for 40 seconds I'm only showing this to support my thesis as well as when I'm looking at other research online it is really important because there's something called social velocity guys social velocity is essentially when other retail investors are looking at news and they're piling into the company because of the news going on news is a very big important piece of the stock market because it's a psychological game and volume does Drive price okay listen volume drives price so when there's high volume and the stock is going up that means kind of like a herd of sheep everyone is running in One Direction that's actually a good thing and you want to hop on on that Trend that's how you squeeze out an extra 10 15 20% in this bull market if you can make 20% in the next three months what would that be for your portfolio if you have six figures that's like multiple five figures that's 20K 50K there's a lot of money to be made right now here's also my opinion I'm looking at my research right here we have two backto back 20% years and investors are wondering how much more can the stock market go up are we at the peak is it like going to be game over are we're going to get a big pullback are we going to get a crash I'm afraid you know I get a lot of my students saying I'm afraid right now you know what do I do I have some other students that are not afraid at all they're saying we're going to go up 50% 100% more I think that's too extreme okay so what's the actual answer well the actual answer is it doesn't really matter if we get more good news on Tesla and the company keeps delivering on revenue and high performance earnings on the bottom end and the revenue actually reaches the bottom end we see more news coming from Robo Vans Robo taxis the robots that Elon Musk has going on it doesn't really matter even if we're at a market Peak because Tesla itself is going to do really well okay Tesla itself is going to grow and even if the stock market pulls back just a little bit we're still going to see a really good performance on Tesla on a relative scale but I'm telling you on an absolute scale this company is going to $500 per share in 2025 and that's why I put a large chunk of my own net worth and my own wealth on this company as a big bet Elon musk's announcement of Robo taxi event was very good news and the economics are absolutely insane it is so compelling the economics are so strong and I'm convinced that Tesla is going to be over $2 trillion in market cap in 2025 because economics make sense you should be uh buying a Tesla Robo taxi because it's way cheaper than mass transit it's way way cheaper and you know what Elon said honestly actually blew my mind so I want you to watch this really quick 40 seconds about Elon Musk and what he said about the economics and the economies of scale that Tesla is going to achieve with the robo taxis I think the the cost of autonomous transport will be so low that you can think of it like individualized mass transit um the like the average cost of of a bus per mile for a city um not not the ticket price cuz that is idiz but the average price is about a dollar a mile whereas the cost of uh cyber cab uh we think probably over time from the operating cost is probably going to be around 20 cents a mile um and price including taxes and and everything else probably ends up being 30 or 40 cents a mile can we buy one so yes and you will be able to buy one cheaper and better mass transit are you you kidding me cheaper and better this is going to be a no-brainer for Tesla this is going to be a no-brainer for the entire population of folks because why would you take a bus why would you take a taxi with the actual human when Elon just said that it's cheaper to go into Robo taxi and it's more luxurious so when it comes to mass transit there's going to be a revolution and that's all going to go to Tesla's pockets that's a big reason why this stock is going to $500 per share that's a big reason why I put a million dollar into it and I also have another half a million dollar in it that's why analysts are raising their price targets as well there's a lot of smart money in Tesla as well we got ETFs in Tesla obviously they have to be in Tesla right S&P 500 obviously has to put a certain amount in Tesla we have institutional investors we have a lot of smart money guys in Tesla and I'm following this trend very closely because if the smart money is not in there I don't want to be with the dumb money after visiting the gigafactory in Austin Bank of America said this they said the trip gave us increased confidence that Tesla is well positioned to grow in 2025 be and Beyond with its core EV business and launch of its Robo taxi offering and longer term from its Investments and Optimus this was all said by lead analyst John Murphy Murphy reiterated that his buy rating for Tesla and he upped his price Target to $400 per share from $350 Tesla's a great stock I picked Nvidia early I picked pounds here for you guys Tesla's market cap it went up $330 billion following Donald Trump's election in the us right so with media and analysts they speculated that the implications for this kind of partnership it kind of looks like a partnership guys have you noticed that Elon Musk and Donald Trump kind of looks like a partnership with these with these guys in the white house and having influence with Elon having influence I'm telling you it's going to be big things for Tesla it's going to be really big things and that's why I'm I'm confident to put a lot of money into this I'm telling you a million even though I have you know a big siize portfolio guys it's no joke every decision I make by the way I'm always being transparent about it and if you want to see the live trade by the way if you want to see me do it like live as I make a trade that's actually in my Discord Community I have Monday and Wednesday sessions where I show all my students everything live okay so look I want to wrap this up I want to give you a couple more things I want to show you a leap option play as well I'm giving you guys a lot of insights in this video I'm going I'm going quick so make sure that you're you're not missing out make sure you're taking notes because I'm telling you I'm about to put a lot of money in your pocket about to flood your pockets with money I've been doing that but I want to do some more of it right I want to bless you with money because money freedom that's it I don't a fancy lifestyle I don't do anything crazy I just believe in Freedom and having time for yourself time Freedom okay not having to work I have so many doctors lawyers Engineers you guys are high paid professions but you don't have freedom you're going to be working for a long time so if you want to break through from that you got to invest you got to invest properly okay that's what it's all about look to wrap up the Trump and the Elon Musk relationship here what you should be looking out for to make a lot of money is this as their relationship grows Tesla's going to get more favorable policies on manufacturing on Innovation on economic growth they're going to get more favorable relations on all of those fronts that's going to push Tesla's Revenue higher or that's going to make Tesla become a higher perceived value guys don't forget this the market isn't about how much a stock always makes it's about how it's perceived by investors all about expectations that's why I'm giving you this research is because when you understand what the expectations are you have formulated a proper opinion on the stock and you believe that it's worth more than what people expect that Delta that difference okay that's where the money is made so policies focused on reducing energy cost deregulation tax incentives the corporate tax uh reduction this is all going to benefit Tesla all of these incentives are going to make more money for Tesla as simple as that all right all right so there we go I don't want to spend any more of your time explaining why Tesla this video will serve for why I invested over a million 1.5 milli now into Tesla I'm looking at a leap option at 330 at the 330 strike for Tesla I've already mentioned that in another video I'm going to reanalyze right now and I'm going to show you a play that I'm going to do okay so I'm going to go to trade Tesla options right you can see on my screen right now and I'm actually going to go ahead and buy a call option for September now look I'm going to analyze the 330 I'm going to tell you why the 330 is good but I'm also going to show you um a little bit of variation right now all right so here's a 330 call option it's actually it's actually like perfectly ripe it's at the 70 Delta right that's really good however because Tesla continues to go up you know if I were to open up a new position I would actually go for about a 350 right now now the 350 has a little bit lower Delta all right it's not actually a huge difference but it kind of is look 350 here is worth 9 Grand whereas the 330 here it's worth 10 grand so it's $1,000 cheaper to go for 350 and to be honest this makes more sense because a Delta 66 still gives you a lot of upside Let Me Explain real quick a little bit more about leap options leap options are basically kind of like owning stock and also kind of like a call option at the same time right so a leap option is just a call option that goes out a little bit further in dates okay it could be 9 months it could be a year it could be 2 years Etc I consider 9 months a leap option I know that's not a textbook definition but that's that's Henry definition all right because it's long enough for me right so leaps allow investors to gain significant exposure to the underlying stock with less Capital than buying stock outright like why would you buy Tesla at $371 per share and put in $37,000 when you can buy and basically own a 100 shares with just $99,000 so you're putting up 13 of the capital I mean that makes a lot of sense to me and the risks are also really low all right let me explain look you can put in 1/3 of the capital so that's already onethird of the risk okay the sensitivity of this option is 66 Delta right as you can see the 66 Delta means that when the stock goes up 10 bucks this option will go up about $660 all right so that's actually really powerful because if the stock goes up by 10 bucks right 10 bucks on 371 is just like a 3% return so as a stockholder you're making about 3% but as a leap option holder right that 3% is almost 10% right because you're making $7 on $89 that's almost a 10% return so you get a huge return and you get a leverage Factor okay Leverage is where it's at if you want to make money you need leverage now I don't believe in borrowing money I don't really believe in paying interest interest but with this leap option you get strong leverage if you make good decisions and you leverage them that's where it's at that's how you make a ton of money and you have that long-term perspective I'm not a fan guys of looking at these short-term plays you know one week out two weeks out I'm looking at leap options because if I get in now and I have the right opinion the right perspective this option is going to increase 2x 3x in the next 9 months all right so this strategy is ideal for those who are bullish over the long term and expect the stock to appreciate significantly which you know I wouldn't say $500 is Extreme appreciation but if we go from Tesla hitting to $500 or even $450 okay that's going to be easy double on your money on the leap option so you can double your wealth in a single year now obviously pay attention to risk management pay attention to position sizing it's it's going to be too long for me to cover in this video I covered this in my oneone coaching and I go over your risk tolerance and I work with you Hands-On if you're interested is always the first link in the description right we still have actually eight spots we had 15 we now have eight we're getting a little bit busy but I love what I do all right I love what I do and I feel super blessed when I make other people money you know that for me I just feel blessed doing that when I look at leap options I'm looking at risk management and look your maximum loss is limited to the premium that you pay on the leap that's all you can lose you can't lose more than what you pay so this Tesla example you know the 350 that I'm recommending now I recommend the 330 by the way when I recommend the 330 it was like around 5K or so right now it's at 10 I've already du doubled the I've already doubled 330 it's been couple weeks on that that's actually a 2X return now obviously I only put in 5% on that position right on a leap option I didn't actually even put in on a leap option because I have a lot of shares guys you know but I'm recommending leaps to my community so they have 2X on their 5% position I said 5% on the 330 so you know 5% on the 330 you double that's a 5% return just from 5% of your portfolio you've made 5% in your overall portfolio that's crazy right how much money there is right now so I was selling a a lawyer a student of mine then he had a lot of money in leaps right and I was saying like listen he had a lot of leaps on a bunch of like safe stocks I said now is not the time now is the time to have Leaps on Tesla on Nvidia and when we made that shift he went from making like 3 4% a month which is great uh nothing wrong with that I'm all I'm a big fan of 3 to 4% a month returns in in in you know in regular times but we're not in regular times right now now is the time where we got to make 10 15 20% so we we shifted his strategy this was like 3 four weeks ago and it's been phenomenal we've had instead of 3 4% we we've had like literally 15% so it's been a really huge difference so I'm going to keep posting videos for you guys I want you guys make a lot of money and if you have six figures and you want to scale to seven figures I'm always open for some coaching I will spend my time I have limited time but hey you know I'm in Dubai but I still do

I can't believe what happened with Bank of America but also a be on Wall Street that turned bullish. I'm looking at other analysts from Bank of America which I'm about to get into it doesn't mean that I'm not doing my own analysis. here's a little bit more research on the Bank of America case that I mentioned in the beginning after visiting the gigafactory in Austin Bank of America said this they said the trip gave us increased confidence that Tesla is well positioned to grow in 2025 be and Beyond with its core EV business and launch of its Robo taxi offering and longer term from its Investments and Optimus this was all said by lead analyst John Murphy. Murphy reiterated that his buy rating for Tesla and he upped his price Target to $400 per share from $350 not a huge bump but it is a significant bump from 350 to 400 giving the market some confidence.,0.95,0.8

Invest with Henry,Is662tG7DzE,2024-12-05T14:30:08Z,Palantir Stock (PLTR) Unusual Options Opportunity (DO THIS NOW),Palantir,"we have a chance to make even more money on pal here the stock has been going up every single day it's over $70 per share I call this play but I'm also going to call a new play where you can make money using leaps and there's a special opportunity that's a setting up right now that I'm going to go over in this video I'm really excited because we're about to make money hand over fist bicep over tricep I'm super pumped up because what I'm seeing right now really rake in a lot of premiums and in this video I'm going to walk you through exactly how I'm going to be using options to play paler in a very smart way because it is reaching all-time highs and I am very cautious in some ways which is why I would say you should be doing leaps or nothing right now literally leaps or nothing right now I'm telling you the reason why you want to go leaps or nothing is because having your money stuck in paler right now is kind of like dead money dead money means you have a whole bunch of capital tied up but I don't think the stock is going to have too much more upside and if it does it'll have fast upside at a higher level of Risk. I think right now it's not too late to jump into leaps on Palance here and this is a very special opportunity let me show you an example of why I think this is the case and by the way I've been making over 15% per month in this market right now you guys can see that I'm up $253,000 on Palante here if I had used leap options on palen here with my entire position I would actually be up a lot more money so instead of having shares instead of having these 5,000 00 shares had I been in leaps from the very very beginning I would be up way more money probably like $750,000 that's because leaps have a leverage Factor they give you 3x the return so let me show you what I'm going to be looking at right now paler is at over $71 per share it's been up like like a complete monster this stock and there's a lot of reasons for it. what does make sense is is if you see the stock moving higher like pounds here with clear momentum like it goes up 6% in a day you can bet that that can happen again. that's what you want to do right now on pal here and you know I want to say that I'm paying very close attention to the stock and I'm actually paying attention to what the Insiders are doing. many hedge funds cut something like pound here which is a really stupid move. you should be kind of buying options on pound and by the way you can buy calls and puts let me explain. if paler goes up cut the position take profit you're out you're good I'm just trying to squeeze out as much money from the bull market as possible so we will get in get out we're good. now the next play that I would make is paler is a good long-term play let's just be honest it is it's been and I've said it's been for since iplo since IP guys since I I said that all right. so for example let's say that paler goes to $80 per share in the next two to three months all right and February it's at $80 per share and the stock went up basically $9 my option went up let's say by $6 right because the options not as sensitive as the stock it's not going to move dollar for dollar it's going to move about 71 which is the Delta right so Delta actually measures how much the option moves so the option is up so if the stock is up $10 the option would be up about $7 that's how it works that's what Delta is trying to say Delta has two definitions first definition is the sensitivity that the option has when the stock moves and the second definition is the chances that the option will expire in the money so clearly the Delta here is 71 which means that there's a high chance of it expiring in the money which is a very very good thing now what I would do in February if this option were to be up you know $6 that would give me a really good return of about 25% so in 2 or 3 months if I'm up 25% listen I'm not complaining guys I'm making money hand over fist 25% it's not bad just to take profit especially because I do think paler will be peing at some point this stock cannot just go to the Moon fundamentals do matter and stocks aren't rocket ships like Elon musk's Rockets right they have some type of center of gravity from physics perspective just when it comes to Stock Investing they have something called mean reversion which means that a stock will come back down to its mean now now the mean is just the average of What It's Worth right but pounds here continues to be worth more and more because revenues are rising so it I'm still very bullish on it don't get me wrong but we're not going to go to like you know trillion dollars overnight so it's going to take time and if you jump in with this call option the 62 and A2 I would hold it for one or two months. maybe it's on paler maybe it's something else when you have a big position use a strategy like this. what you can do instead is we're betting on pounds here going up with the leap option right but let's say that it pulls back well you also want to win on that you want to win on both sides. I don't think it's going to crash like paler could go down but you know it'll go down it'll reach a support level at 65. I already have a lot of pents here and I've been early so you know I can only open up so much of a position. now look let me wrap it up now with the explanation of you know why I think paler is a good stock and why I cover this stock so I've been covering palen here from IPO and recently they've had the best quarter ever like literally the best quarter ever and when it comes to results it is mindblowing what Palante here is doing right when I look at their commercial uh Revenue growth when I look at their government contract Revenue growth I've never seen this happen before this company is going to be a trillion dollar market cap it's just a question of when right and I think right now now it's an opportunity for leaps to jump in to get that you know growth up into the future to hold shares I do think it's still a good time to buy paler shares and hold for the long long term in the short term again we we're going to see volatility I guarantee pretty much guarantee we're going to see volatility it's unlikely that a stock is just going to go sideways paler is not a stock that likes to go sideways this stock has a personality this stock has a lot of personality. I have a very clear signal of what's going on with pal here based on the investors in my Discord Community. the government spend is also going to go to defense defense is going to go into paler pocket guys this is not even rocket science it's just pure facts. on the defense side paler is going to make money hand over fist bicep over Tri step and that's going to that's going to flood your pocket with money.",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,Ni7UeFTIDfQ,2024-12-02T16:20:26Z,"I Bought $1 Million of Tesla Stock (TSLA), Here’s Why",Tesla,"as you can see I just invested $1 million into Tesla stock and I bought 3,000 shares of this stock so why did I do this and why do I think Tesla is one of the best opportunities right now to make a ton of money I just put $1 million more dollars into Tesla and I think it's undervalued for three main reasons that I will cover in this video as quickly as possible. Dan IES mentioned that regulations are going to get a lot better for Tesla now that Elon Musk is in the white house and he is friends with Donald Trump so I have an updated price target for Tesla into 2025. One of my three reasons why I just put $1 million into Tesla stock is regulations. I put 3,000 shares more into my portfolio. I sold a put option at 235 and I also sold a put option at 300 both those options expire in December but I was tired of selling puts guys selling puts has been good but I just decided that I'm going to buy some shares I'm tired of waiting to enter Tesla stock I want to be right in Tesla stock so I bought it 3,000 shares for $332 per share dumping $1 million into the stock so far I'm up $ 36,960. The reason why I put $1 million more dollars into Tesla is it's clear to me that the stock is going to $500 per share in 2025. The valuation of Tesla looks pretty big but it is going to get bigger for some key reasons. I think that you should follow my last video where I said buy $330 call options leap options into September 2025 and just ride Tesla higher. I'm so confident I put a million dollars and I actually showed it to you here on my screen of real money not just talking like other YouTubers. With a doish Fed this is going to be very very positive for Tesla. Robo taxes aside, all the other stuff AI stuff that I'm going to cover in this video aside, this is very bullish because a doish Fed intrinsically just creates more value in the stock market. I'm making money hand over fist guys on Tesla and I've been absolutely right and I believe I'm very confident in 2025 that I'm going to be right on Tesla and I made a $1 million bet. With Tesla I think that we still have some more room to run so as we approach $500 it's not going to be smooth sailing, we're going to get some volatility along the way, that's why I'm selling puts and that's why I'm actually going to be doing leap options. Tesla's market cap increased $300 billion following Donald Trump's election as the 47th president. The stock is up a lot but please notice the stock going up $300 billion or $330 billion is not just retail investors, this stock has gained a lot of momentum because of institutional money AKA smart money. Retail investors like you and I are not really moving the stock especially not Tesla, it's a mega cap stock. Musk's close relationship with Trump will enhance Tesla's prospects through favorable policies on manufacturing, innovation and overall economic growth that could be in the form of different policies, reducing energy costs, deregulations obviously Trump is a fan of that, there could be tax incentives coming in, corporate tax reductions. All of these little benefits trust me they add up to the revenue, the top line and they also add up a lot to the bottom line of Tesla which just further increases what analysts are going to be thinking about the stock. Analysts are likely to revise Tesla's price Target up because as Tesla surges these analysts feel stupid they feel dumb, as Tesla goes up and they have a price target of 150 they have to raise their price Target which creates kind of like that spiraling effect. When the company surges in value like Tesla has and it reflects in the company's growth, the analysts are like well duh this was an obvious play so they start raising their price targets and that's actually going to help Tesla's price per share maintain its value. My parents actually bought Tesla stock and it was kind of interesting because my parents are believe more in hard assets, and now they bought Tesla a couple years ago for a really high price. As Tesla fell down I told my parents to dollar cost average and to buy more shares, but my dad said nope I have enough in it. Now that Tesla has surged back up which I was saying it would it will recover, he really kind of regrets he's like well I should have dollar cost averaged more. That's the reason why I put another million dollars into Tesla stock is because I'm just dollar cost averaging. I'm clearly up already $37,000. I put out this play in my Discord community and we're making money on it. The reason I put a million dollars into Tesla is because I believe in their mission I believe Elon Musk is going to continue executing I believe this is an AI play and uh Tesla's market cap will likely be $2 trillion in 2025. I'm going to leave you with this 3 minute example on a leap option on Tesla which I just covered a few days ago but I think it is is super valid if you don't have a big portfolio and you don't want to just buy shares of Tesla. If Tesla goes up by $50, this option increases by 33, you know as a portion to 84 so $3,300 is what you would make on $8,400, that would be like around 40% return or so, whereas if you had Tesla stock you would make about 15%. So you have almost a 3X leverage Factor here with the leap option. I appreciate my transparency of sharing my portfolio where I actually invested a million of my own dollars into Tesla stock.",1.0,0.9

in this video today that are going to make a lot of money in December and as December approaches which is right around the corner I need you to watch this video before Monday 9:30 a.m. because these stocks that I'm going to cover like Sofi I have some news and updates on these stocks and I'm holding them in my portfolio my portfolio is at $4 million and I'm going to be going over my most influential stocks so I'm holding Tesla paler I have PayPal I have American Airlines spy Nvidia let's not waste any time and let's jump right into it starting with the first stock which is Sofi I haven't covered Sofi a lot on this channel but I've done a lot of research and basically here's why I think Sofi is going to continue to rally and this is one of the most influential stocks that I plan to actually buy on Monday so the market is rallying due to a combination of doish Federal Reserve all right those policies that the FED is coming out with right now are very doish and that's actually going to be a big benefit for Sofi I'll explain in just a minute look a record $7 trillion is sideline right now and that cash is moving towards stock in a big area and fintech is where the money is moving fintech is getting a lot of cash because investors are looking for high yield and attractive opportunities this Market has tons of them but what is the most attractive Sofi is set to benefit from falling interest rates a favorable regulatory environment which is super super important we know that from Tesla regular regulatory environment is one of the most impactful things on a stock also what's impacting Sofi is tax reforms and all of this is going to give it a competitive advantage over traditional Banks now guys I worked at Goldman Sachs and when I looked at Goldman sachs's software and how traditional banks operate their business I was like are we in 1990 like is this company operating before I was even born the type of technology that you see at traditional Banks is awful and I think that's going to be a really clear disruption play and Sofi is going to benefit from disrupting these Banks I mean it's all about disruption when a new company a new competitor comes in and they actually disrupt the market that's when you get huge market share and that's when you actually Dominate and make a lot of money so Sofi it's basically going to challenge traditional and outdated Banks all right they're not going to completely wipe them out obviously that would mean that Sofi would be trillions and trillions of dollars but just looking at Sofi I'm going to pull up the stock I'm going to show you check how much the stock is up in the past 3 months I think it's finally blown going up because investors realize that this stock is a really attractive play now I have sold 14 puts and $10 puts um being honest with you guys I do not have shares but at least I show you my entire portfolio and I'm very transparent about what I have and what I don't have and I plan to buy Sofi uh on Monday I plan to buy it on Monday although I am very cautious because the price earnings ratio is very high but the market Cap's only $17 billion I think this company can be a $50 billion company in the next two years years and specifically what I think is going to make a lot of sense is that Sofi is going to dominate in terms of taking market share from some of the traditional Banks but I also think that they're going to be positioned to capitalize on regulatory modernization okay I think that a digital First Banking trend is very clear in the market a digital First Banking Trend just means that you know there's like this bank there's another bank chime there's another bank Ally some of these banks have you know store fronts and stuff but more of these banks are going digital okay that means that there is no storefront that's not like a you know a Bank of America branch where they have branches all over the United States becoming a bank that is more digital is actually a genius move because you don't have the cost of having a storefront you don't have the cost of having brick and mortar you know traditional stores where I have to pay for rent pay for more employees and this is similar to like a Robin Hood play in my opinion where Robin hood is you know it's a free app free right they have certain other costs I won't get into that in this video but Robin Hood has dominated and has democratized Finance for everyday retail investors and I think Sofi is doing something very similar because they can offer cheaper prices they can offer better Services because they don't have the brick and mortar uh you know storefronts Robin Hood doesn't have uh stores All Over America like you know the other brokerages like TDM trade or Schwab Schwab bought TDM trade so the potential for Sofi is really really big so I'm going to be buying some Sofi stock when Monday the Market opens up I'm also going to be looking at selling some more put options I have showed you here that I have the 14 put the $10 put but I'm also going to be looking at probably selling some $15 puts and in a certain way I don't want to chase the stock up but at the same time the momentum trend is so good I actually think this is a good stock to buy call options on because if Sofi goes to $20 per share let me show you the options here and then we'll move to the next stock cuz I want to be efficient in this video if you look at the expiration date and I go to let's say January 17 and I go to buying a call option you can actually get a really interesting action here on the 15 so I was looking at the 15 uh this morning it's a 67 Delta this would be an in the money call option this would be worth $2 so you would have to spend $200 but check it out if Sofi continues to move up and it goes to $20 per share you're going to have $20 minus the 15 strike price which is $5 that you're in the money so you're spending two to make five right boom right that's that's what you will do if you are also bullish on Sofi there's no need to sign up for any master classes or free webinars I'm just giving you guys all my all my ideas for free my free content is better than people's paid content so just being honest with you Sofi I'm bullish and the best way that I would play this is either buy some shares of stock and dollar cost average into it number two I would sell puts at 15 strike price for January 17 number three I would use a small amount of capital and actually buy an in the money short short-term call option which I haven't really covered on this channel much but basically that short-term call option gives you all that movement to the upside it gives you movement to the upside on a high Delta with only investing 200 bucks so that's the play."",",,,

this bank there's another bank chime there's another bank Ally some of these banks have you know store fronts and stuff but more of these banks are going digital okay that means that there is no

here I'm going to go jump back into my portfolio here guys paler its current PE ratio is freaking high it's high as my biceps right now but you know if you take a look and you try to understand paler from a business perspective look this is a side because a lot of people get this wrong paler here is really misunderstood the high PE ratio does not matter it doesn't matter because a lot of people that are skeptical and saying that it's overly expensive were those people also saying that Amazon was really expensive with that Tesla was really expensive and Nvidia was really expensive back in its growth phases maybe if those people were even investing because most of the time those people lose their shirts and quit altogether but that is the same type of person that also looks at Tesla Amazon Nvidia and says oh it's too expensive I'm going to be in my spy only which is fine spy can also make you money and I'll talk about spy and what I think the market is going to do in December uh in in a few minutes but look if you want the big results you need to go for something that has potential to give you big results which is paler paler Solutions have been also proven by the way guys I do pay attention a little bit because I'm out in Eastern Europe paler Solutions have been invaluable for Ukraine and the Middle East right the the two Wars going on the situations that you know I can't believe where the you know our world's still in war these days but the the war is happening in Ukraine Middle East and palen here you know looking at my research here they are showcasing rapid deployment capabilities in active conflict zones okay so Palance here is a big you know you can call it a help you can call it a contributor you know I don't want to get into politics and I don't really pick sides I don't care to me Democrats and Republicans are the same thing they're just both trying to get your time and your money and your attention I know they have different opinions but they're the same thing right to me because it doesn't really matter it's all we can do rather than paying all this attention to politics look without getting political paler is going to make a lot of money paler AI Solutions are going to be very helpful because I was taking a look at the research and it's it's a little bit sad but Modern Warfare is going to probably continue unfortunately there's probably going to be conflict and differing opinions you know how different cultures they don't agree with each other and there's conflicts right so what's going to happen is that there's going to be a lot of conflicts that are going to be cyber okay conflicts and warfare are shifting to Cy cber and Aid driven strategy so war is going to be kind of AI driven it's going to be more technologically driven and palen here is positioned as a leader in basically you know being a solution during these wars which is you know for better for worse or for whatever not picking a side it's going to make paler a lot of money it's going to make paler a lot of money and that's why analysts like Dan IES describe pal here as the Messi of AI all right it's the messy of AI they they are innovating they're certainly very valuable on the commercial side they're very valuable on the government side and for me Palante here is a position that I'm going to continue to hold obviously I've been early in this play and I don't want to spend too much time on it because my position is really clear let me show you what my position is actually I have I have a couple positions at palen here 45 covered call which I need to roll up if you want to watch a rolling video just type invest with Henry rolling on YouTube I have a palen here 50 covered call I also need to roll this up and then the rest of my Shares are actually uncovered uh I've been smart enough to not sell covered calls on my entire share I have 5100 shares at $65 uh the Stock's at $65 right now my average cost is 21 21 so I made $222,000 I also have more P here in my other portfolio I have two portfolios so I don't have too much in in one portfolio and I've been publicly tracking all this so if you guys appreciate all my transparency here you know all you can do is subscribe no free master classes no no Discord stuff you don't need that stuff I just I have that if you want additional help but you don't need it I'm here to give you everything for free all right."",",,,

subscribe no free master classes no no Discord stuff you don't need that stuff I just I have that if you want additional help but you don't need it I'm here to give you everything for free all right my next play is going to be Tesla I did Cover in my video two or three days ago on Tesla essentially um buying a 330 leap guys 330 leaps right now are are the move for Tesla I'm going to just say one sentence and then we're going to move on from Tesla autonomous the autonomous play I could argue guys that it's the most undervalued part of Tesla so the market isn't really pricing it in fully because there is obviously risk to autonomous not working out regulatory issues but in my opinion autonomous is the most undervalued part of Tesla's business and this week Tesla is I can't say is for sure right I don't know but I'm pretty confident that Tesla is going to pump up and the reason why I think it's going to pump up is Tesla's actually had a really interesting um move recently on the technical chart like when I was looking at Tesla after this huge rise right we had kind of like a Peak at 350 and then another Peak at like 352 we've pulled back but you can already see the Market's like nah no no I want more Tesla and I was taking a look at the volume the volume is very indicative to me and the technical analysis is very indicative to me that Tesla is going to move higher so I think that we have a little bit of a short-term dip from the 350 range down to 330 range but I can see the stock going back up to 350 so that's why I don't have any covered calls you can see here I have 300 sellp put 220 sellp put 200 sellp put um I'm up $7,800 on the options but I'm not selling covered calls cuz I am still bullish okay I am still bullish I have a th000 shares average cost of $218 per share I am still bullish 300 leap option my LEAP option will go out to September of 2025 okay so go ahead if if you want to own Tesla buy shares if you want to put money to work without having to put up a lot of capital but get upside on Tesla go with the 330 leap option just check out my channel I already went over a full video on why I'm doing the 330 leap option now let's move on."",",,,

specifically what I think is going to make a lot of sense is that Sofi is going to dominate in terms of taking market share from some of the traditional Banks but I also think that they're going to be positioned to capitalize on regulatory modernization okay I think that a digital First Banking trend is very clear in the market a digital First Banking Trend just means that you know there's like this bank there's another bank chime there's another bank Ally some of these banks have you know store fronts and stuff but more of these banks are going digital okay that means that there is no storefront that's not like a you know a Bank of America branch where they have branches all over the United States becoming a bank that is more digital is actually a genius move because you don't have the cost of having a storefront you don't have the cost of having brick and mortar you know traditional stores where I have to pay for rent pay for more employees and this is similar to like a Robin Hood play in my opinion where Robin hood is you know it's a free app free right they have certain other costs I won't get into that in this video but Robin Hood has dominated and has democratized Finance for everyday retail investors and I think Sofi is doing something very similar because they can offer cheaper prices they can offer better Services because they don't have the brick and mortar uh you know storefronts Robin Hood doesn't have uh stores All Over America like you know the other brokerages like TDM trade or Schwab Schwab bought TDM trade so the potential for Sofi is really really big so I'm going to be buying some Sofi stock when Monday the Market opens up I'm also going to be looking at selling some more put options I have showed you here that I have the 14 put the $10 put but I'm also going to be looking at probably selling some $15 puts and in a certain way I don't want to chase the stock up but at the same time the momentum trend is so good I actually think this is a good stock to buy call options on because if Sofi goes to $20 per share let me show you the options here and then we'll move to the next stock cuz I want to be efficient in this video if you look at the expiration date and I go to let's say January 17 and I go to buying a call option you can actually get a really interesting action here on the 15 so I was looking at the 15 uh this morning it's a 67 Delta this would be an in the money call option this would be worth $2 so you would have to spend $200 but check it out if Sofi continues to move up and it goes to $20 per share you're going to have $20 minus the 15 strike price which is $5 that you're in the money so you're spending two to make five right boom right that's that's what you will do if you are also bullish on Sofi there's no need to sign up for any master classes or free webinars I'm just giving you guys all my all my ideas for free my free content is better than people's paid content so just being honest with you Sofi I'm bullish and the best way that I would play this is either buy some shares of stock and dollar cost average into it number two I would sell puts at 15 strike price for January 17 number three I would use a small amount of capital and actually buy an in the money short short-term call option which I haven't really covered on this channel much but basically that short-term call option gives you all that movement to the upside it gives you movement to the upside on a high Delta with only investing 200 bucks so that's the play now the next play that I want to talk about is going to be pal here I'm going to go jump back into my portfolio here guys paler its current PE ratio is freaking high it's high as my biceps right now but you know if you take a look and you try to understand paler from a business perspective look this is a side because a lot of people get this wrong paler here is really misunderstood the high PE ratio does not matter it doesn't matter because a lot of people that are skeptical and saying that it's overly expensive were those people also saying that Amazon was really expensive with that Tesla was really expensive and Nvidia was really expensive back in its growth phases maybe if those people were even investing because most of the time those people lose their shirts and quit altogether but that is the same type of person that also looks at Tesla Amazon Nvidia and says oh it's too expensive I'm going to be in my spy only which is fine spy can also make you money and I'll talk about spy and what I think the market is going to do in December uh in in a few minutes but look if you want the big results you need to go for something that has potential to give you big results which is paler paler Solutions have been also proven by the way guys I do pay attention a little bit because I'm out in Eastern Europe paler Solutions have been invaluable for Ukraine and the Middle East right the the two Wars going on the situations that you know I can't believe where the you know our world's still in war these days but the the war is happening in Ukraine Middle East and palen here you know looking at my research here they are showcasing rapid deployment capabilities in active conflict zones okay so Palance here is a big you know you can call it a help you can call it a contributor you know I don't want to get into politics and I don't really pick sides I don't care to me Democrats and Republicans are the same thing they're just both trying to get your time and your money and your attention I know they have different opinions but they're the same thing right to me because it doesn't really matter it's all we can do rather than paying all this attention to politics look without getting political paler is going to make a lot of money paler AI Solutions are going to be very helpful because I was taking a look at the research and it's it's a little bit sad but Modern Warfare is going to probably continue unfortunately there's probably going to be conflict and differing opinions you know how different cultures they don't agree with each other and there's conflicts right so what's going to happen is that there's going to be a lot of conflicts that are going to be cyber okay conflicts and warfare are shifting to Cy cber and Aid driven strategy so war is going to be kind of AI driven it's going to be more technologically driven and palen here is positioned as a leader in basically you know being a solution during these wars which is you know for better for worse or for whatever not picking a side it's going to make paler a lot of money it's going to make paler a lot of money and that's why analysts like Dan IES describe pal here as the Messi of AI all right it's the messy of AI they they are innovating they're certainly very valuable on the commercial side they're very valuable on the government side and for me Palante here is a position that I'm going to continue to hold obviously I've been early in this play and I don't want to spend too much time on it because my position is really clear let me show you what my position is actually I have I have a couple positions at palen here 45 covered call which I need to roll up if you want to watch a rolling video just type invest with Henry rolling on YouTube I have a palen here 50 covered call I also need to roll this up and then the rest of my Shares are actually uncovered uh I've been smart enough to not sell covered calls on my entire share I have 5100 shares at $65 uh the Stock's at $65 right now my average cost is 21 21 so I made $222,000 I also have more P here in my other portfolio I have two portfolios so I don't have too much in in one portfolio and I've been publicly tracking all this so if you guys appreciate all my transparency here you know all you can do is subscribe no free master classes no no Discord stuff you don't need that stuff I just I have that if you want additional help but you don't need it I'm here to give you everything for free all right my next play is going to be Tesla I did Cover in my video two or three days ago on Tesla essentially um buying a 330 leap guys 330 leaps right now are are the move for Tesla I'm going to just say one sentence and then we're going to move on from Tesla autonomous the autonomous play I could argue guys that it's the most undervalued part of Tesla so the market isn't really pricing it in fully because there is obviously risk to autonomous not working out regulatory issues but in my opinion autonomous is the most undervalued part of Tesla's business and this week Tesla is I can't say is for sure right I don't know but I'm pretty confident that Tesla is going to pump up and the reason why I think it's going to pump up is Tesla's actually had a really interesting um move recently on the technical chart like when I was looking at Tesla after this huge rise right we had kind of like a Peak at 350 and then another Peak at like 352 we've pulled back but you can already see the Market's like nah no no I want more Tesla and I was taking a look at the volume the volume is very indicative to me and the technical analysis is very indicative to me that Tesla is going to move higher so I think that we have a little bit of a short-term dip from the 350 range down to 330 range but I can see the stock going back up to 350 so that's why I don't have any covered calls you can see here I have 300 sellp put 220 sellp put 200 sellp put um I'm up $7,800 on the options but I'm not selling covered calls cuz I am still bullish okay I am still bullish I have a th000 shares average cost of $218 per share I am still bullish 300 leap option my LEAP option will go out to September of 2025 okay so go ahead if if you want to own Tesla buy shares if you want to put money to work without having to put up a lot of capital but get upside on Tesla go with the 330 leap option just check out my channel I already went over a full video on why I'm doing the 330 leap option now let's move on next stock I want to cover that I think is going to be interesting for this week is NVIDIA Nvidia has been pulling back as well very kind of similar to Tesla where it has reached you know some really nice Highs but now the stock is pulling back towards the 135 range and I'm going to be selling 130 puts let me show you here let me show you the Nvidia chart Nvidia has pulled back from about 140s down to 135 pre-market here you know Nvidia is looking pretty good but for me I'm going to go for 130 cell put I have 132 sellp put for 1220 expiration you can actually go for 130 or 132 either way I am bullish on Nvidia and I want to look for entry into Nvidia more Nvidia shares why because Nvidia is one of the best AI plays and I've already made a lot of videos on Nvidia so we'll move on but you should probably know why I'm bullish on Nvidia."",",,,

jump right into it starting with the first stock which is Sofi I haven't covered Sofi a lot on this channel but I've done a lot of research and basically here's why I think Sofi is going to continue to rally and this is one of the most influential stocks that I plan to actually buy on Monday so the market is rallying due to a combination of doish Federal Reserve all right those policies that the FED is coming out with right now are very doish and that's actually going to be a big benefit for soof file explain in just a minute look a record $7 trillion is sideline right now and that cash is moving towards stock in a big area and fintech is where the money is moving fintech is getting a lot of cash because investors are looking for high yield and attractive opportunities this Market has tons of them but what is the most attractive Sofi is set to benefit from falling interest rates a favorable regulatory environment which is super super important we know that from Tesla regular regulatory environment is one of the most impactful things on a stock also what's impacting so far is tax reforms and all of this is going to give it a competitive advantage over traditional Banks now guys I worked at Goldman Sachs and when I looked at Goldman sachs's software and how traditional banks operate their business I was like are we in 1990 like is this company operating before I was even born the type of technology that you see at traditional Banks is awful and I think that's going to be a really clear disruption play and Sofi is going to benefit from disrupting these Banks I mean it's all about disruption when a new company a new competitor comes in and they actually disrupt the market that's when you get huge market share and that's when you actually Dominate and make a lot of money so Sofi it's basically going to challenge traditional and outdated Banks all right they're not going to completely wipe them out obviously that would mean that Sofi would be trillions and trillions of dollars but just looking at Sofi I'm going to pull up the stock I'm going to show you check how much the stock is up in the past 3 months I think it's finally blown going up because investors realize that this stock is a really attractive play now I have sold 14 puts and $10 puts um being honest with you guys I do not have shares but at least I show you my entire portfolio and I'm very transparent about what I have and what I don't have and I plan to buy Sofi uh on Monday I plan to buy it on Monday although I am very cautious because the price earnings ratio is very high

spy guys before I cover the last two spy and smci will be the last one something interesting there I'm bullish on spy because I think as uh we have a new president that's going to be entering office bullish on the Republicans doing very well um although you know we're going to get some more money printing Etc the stock market will do well mark my words we're going to have a very strong 2025 and there's a huge opportunity here in the next couple of months to make a lot of money so I'm just bullish on on spy in general and spy the market I think will go up about maybe 2 3% or so in December and then into January we're probably going to see a further rise because there's something called the January effect where stocks do tend to rise in January so look spy is good now."",",,,

Invest with Henry,BdAalfGEON8,2024-11-29T20:30:00Z,"RETIRE EARLY ON JUST $212,000 With The Wheel Strategy on THESE Stocks",SPY,"you can use spy to use the wheel strategy and sell puts and covered calls on spy on a monthly basis 30 days to expiration with a 27 Delta and that will produce about 2% per month in income now if you want a higher income you're going to use single stocks that are going to have more volatility to be specific more implied volatility those stocks are going to be ones that I covered in this channel Nvidia paler but you can also use other tech stocks so that could be meta that could be Netflix and actually any stock that has an RSI that's under about 40 is a really good candidate to begin running the wheel strategy or if the stock is towards the bottom end of the bowling or band because when you're running the wheel strategy what you want to do is you want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that is fairly cheap okay you don't want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that's at a 52 we High which is kind of difficult in this market which you know that was my short summary but if you have time let me explain to you you how to actually implement this all right so see you later if you don't have any time and now if you have some time let me go into the specifics so look I want to debunk the myth and I want to completely change the the 4% rule okay the 4% rule states this and you guys might may have heard of it the 4% rule is you can take out 4% per year in income when you're retired which is a bunch of BS to be honest if you're running the wheel strategy I can make 4% a month okay a month not a year so it doesn't make any sense to me that's that's why I like options so with the $200,000 portfolio $222,000 as I said in the title I think this is a really good position because 4% is essentially approaching the $9,000 Mark which is going to be six figures per year and I think that's a really good income Source right so you can really retire or have a full-time income or a really strong secondary source of income now I quickly want to say that in my experience I've been running the wheel strategy since I had 100K okay when I had 100K in my portfolio I I just start to really focus on the wheel strategy and I did a little bit early but I left my corporate job when I had 100K which is maybe a little bit ear um let me show you on spy I'm going to start off with the safest ETF I'm going to get riskier and riskier and then how to really capitalize and make four five even more perc per month so portfolio is at 4 million I guess our next Target is 5 million I've been doing very well and very happy and very blessed so spy all right I do have a position here I have a pretty sizable position and I um or actually running the wheel strategy as I mentioned all right so look let me explain to you what Spy is and why you would want to use it spy is going to be on the safer side of things spy is safer because it's an ETF that has 500 company companies in it essentially when I was getting my degree Finance everyone talked about beating S&P 500 and that's because this Benchmark is truly difficult to beat it is truly hard to beat for for the average investor and even many hedge funds do not beat the S&P 500 so it truly is a very interesting metric to look at now the S&P has all the sectors in it like technology consumer cyclicals consumer services consumer defensive utilities real estate energy Industrials Healthcare and financial services all right so this ETF has the top holding is Apple which I have a huge position in and I always say on this channel like you don't need to have the hottest stocks to make good money with options you don't you can make a lot of money Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta all these stocks fantastic stocks and in my video the other day I mentioned how we are in a very bullish Market there is a lot of money to be made so look with um the wheel strategy and running it on spy I said in my little short one minute summary that you can go 30 days in 27 Delta so let's go sell a put option I'm going to show you how this works so sell put let's go for 30 days right so that's going to be basically basically into January basically going into the new year so spy January okay I would let's let's take a look and see a 27 Delta here 587 27 dels okay 587 that was really close I picked 586 587 uh here has $400 now let me explain this is going to be in the lower end of returns and then I'll tell you how to get higher and higher returns with the wheel strategy on the lower end of things if you just want that safe passive income and you're kind of retired and you're just busy you won't be able to probably produce look $400 on 50 50k so on 200k you're only going to produce about $1,600 a month all right so that's on the low end of things but I will explain that when you're selling puts the put selling portion is the lower return portion on the covered calls you can make about double all right let me let me show you an example how that looks like so here you know in a month it's $400 but on 200k it'be $1,600 per month nothing really that big right nothing really that big however on the covered call side and before we get into the single stocks on the covered call side if I go to sell call let's say that you got a sign at 600 right so you got a sign for 600 if I were to sell like the 602 right here um which is very close to the money and I'll say Hey you will lose a stock or the ETF if it goes into the money but we don't really care because the whole the whole goal here right is that we're just trying to create a lot of income into retirement that that's really it guys we're trying to create income into retirement that's the goal of of this video is to show you how you can run the wheel strategy and just the wheel strategy you can literally Go 100% wheel strategy on spy or single stock so to finish up this spy example the put side of things would only create about $1,600 of income now the covered call side of things would create a little bit more income so we made about $400 un covered calls it's about 700 or so plus you get $2 of upside let's say this you know the etf's at 600 it goes to 602 so you get two plus you know about seven so it's $9 right so we got 400 to sell puts and now we get now 900 an upside for the covered call side of things right so $900 on the 50k or so you know if you multiply that by four you get at 3600 so you can make between 1,800 on the bottom end to 3600 okay so 1,800 to 3600 on just spy I think that's a pretty good monthly income for having 200k right most people can't figure out how to make income it's pretty easy on spy now if you want to create more income and you actually want to have that you know $8,000 Mark $99,000 $10,000 Mark you're going to have to use single stocks okay because you know going 30 days out in 27 Delta on spy is going to produce 2% per month in income or so 1 and a half 2% but if you want to get to the four 5% Mark or I honestly these past couple of months I'm at the 10% Mark it's it's just ridiculous I'm making money hand over fist just hand over fist and all these stocks guys you know bicep over tricep as I say but look I think that spy is an okay start if you have a bigger portfolio but if you're at 200k you're going to want to use the single stocks that I'm about to cover right now before I cover the single stocks let me just go through my notes real quick I want you to know that selling monthly options is probably the best although I have seen a lot of successful people go for two and three Monon options because they're busy professionals I work with a lot of Engineers doctors lawyers nurses accountants Etc these folks have jobs they're busy and they don't even have a lot of time to go on my live calls they don't even have a lot of time to really trade okay and that's okay because you can just set these positions and forget about them two months out three months out so I want to say that you can retire using the wheel strategy either you can create weekly income if you have more time and you have more desire or you can go for that monthly and two months out and three months out expirations right other thing I wanted to say is this strategy allows for consistent monthly income and for me that is probably my favorite right every single month I I like to get income I don't like to do weekly I also don't like to do two to three months either so I think this is a really reliable way to turn savings into cash flow into retirement so of course S&P 500 is is high quality but if you really want to get that bigger income let's go over some examples in my portfolio so um my videos are unscripted so I'm just going to go through a couple of examples here by the way let's just go to my total return I just want to show you guys that I've been doing pretty well a lot of my positions are are going for a good win right now let's go into something like a Chipotle okay I think that chipotle is going to be the next level of volatility it's not high volatility by no means like if we go look at this option right here the implied volatility is 29 so to be honest with you this is just only a little bit more I guess risky than S&P 5 00 it is a single stock so it is definitely more risky but the volatility is not that that much higher all right so if I were to go to sell put and that's how you get started in the wheel strategy real quick I have a whole wheel strategy course here my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff my free content here on YouTube is basically everything that you need to really level up your option trading my free stuff is better than people's discords it's better than people's boot camps and better than people's coaching so I try to give you guys everything as much as possible for free um because that's that's my mission that's my goal and I 100% believe in that and I've seen iten happen over and over folks are making full-time income look sell sellp put well January 17th will be 50 days out let's go for January 3rd about 30 days out and if I were to sell I would go for about a 30 Delta so let's go here that's 18 Delta that's way too low huh that's interesting okay 30 Del right here so on this position right here let's go and let's put $200,000 to work let's just say hypothetically that we want to put all $200,000 to work all right so if I go for 20 contracts here let's go for 35 contracts that's 212,000 roughly let's go for 36 contracts $212,000 here you're going to make $3,000 a month right for selling puts and then once you get assigned you can expect about double all right like I just showed you in the Spy example when you sell a covered call you typically have a bit of upside okay and the covered call can be closer to the money so here $3,000 okay let me just show you if you had already been assigned on Chipotle and it's currently at 62 you can go for something like 63 so this will give you a dollar of upside plus 145 so this right here would be a lot more attractive obviously on the cover callide because you have some upside on the stock itself so this right here would probably be $3 to $4,000 a month thereabouts right it depends on volatility depends on market conditions so that is the next level so you can go from Spy which is 1,800 to 3600 to to something like a like a Chipotle which is like fairly low low risk and that would be between like three 3 to 4K okay so that would be a bit higher there now let me go to something like a Tesla all right so now Tesla would get you a lot closer to that really big income okay and by the way I think you need to have a combination of all these things you need to have some spy you need to have some safer stocks you need to have some riskier stocks it's just a combination of things that I think is really important so let's go for January 3rd again okay and for Tesla I'm pretty bullish so if you are bullish personally like I'm bullish on Tesla you can go for a little bit higher Delta remember the Delta is just a give and take relationship the higher the Delta the higher chances are that you will get assigned okay and the lower the Delta is you know essentially the lower chance you'll get a sign however the higher the Delta the more you get paid the lower Delta the less you get so it's all about uh risk and return it's a it's a clear trade-off so 320 if I were to sell a put I'm going to go a little bit higher on the Delta all right the implied volatility volatility here is 50 so 50 is obviously better than the 29 that we just saw for Chipotle so this this position right here is going to be uh a lot more lucrative it's going to be a lot more lucrative for for selling options and running the wheel strategy so if I were to do five here that's 150k 7 this would be about 212k so you can see here how on the sell puts I would already make almost 10 ,000 okay on the covered call side of things you can make you know this strategy can produce1 to $15,000 a month obviously it depends on the market and the in the wheel strategy is not a perfectly Flawless strategy there is no such thing as a perfectly Flawless strategy but I'll tell you how to manage it all right let me go through my notes here basically the way that you would manage this strategy is first of all you have to pick stocks that you like I always say that in my videos if you're not trading stocks that you like if you don't know why you own a stock I will challenge you that you don't even know how to invest you don't know what you're doing a lot of people are into like the micro strategy or the smci stuff I believe those YouTubers that are covering these stocks are kind of on the scammy side of things because I don't like the hype the reason why YouTubers cover hype is for views I mean Everyone likes views on YouTube but I'm not going to disregard what I actually believe to be true and for me I would always recommend do not go for hype go for safe highquality companies spy would be the safest side and then the middle you know would be your craft hind would be some American Airlines it would be you know your utilities your financials like your Banks and JP Morgan and and Bank of America stuff like that and then on the higher side of things I I'll show you one more example on Nvidia it would be your your Tesla your Nvidia the Palante tier the higher risk stuff that I've covered that has absolutely paid off all right it's it's absolutely paid off we've been making money hand over fist bicep over tricep as I like to say uh we've been doing fantastic so I hope that your guys pockets is like full of money and then yeah you're just happy so look with 212,00 or you know let's say $250,000 um you can make a full-time income selling options and just looking at these positions right here on Tesla I think that it is a it's an absolute no-brainer to to run this on Tesla now you can also run this on on a stock like Nvidia Nvidia is also going to have high volatility and when you go for a higher volatility stock that's really good because it makes Financial Freedom a lot easier you can make a full-time income with 212,000 or 250,000 basically in around 200 to 300 K range because we're going to disregard you know 4% per year typical standard rule you can make 4% a month when you can make 4% a month on 2 to 300K that's what really brings you to that $10,000 a month Mark right so for my portfolio I I'm okay with even just you know a little bit less I don't even go for it's kind of hard to say because lately I've been making like 10% so in the last like month I made like $400,000 or so and that's what pushed me over the $4 million Mark so you know it just varies but I'll say that as you scale it just get it's easier and easier but don't be discouraged if you have you know 50k 100K it just takes time to scale right it's it's a journey but I want to say that the typical Financial rules out there you got to you guys got to fire a financial adviser all right I mean you can hire me as a one-on-one coach I'm going to be much better than financial adviser that just takes 1% of your money every year or you know it really is so simple or just watch my free stuff right you can make a lot of money by just running the wheel strategy and you don't need to have like this million dollar account to really hit some retirement figures right money is is actually not as hard as most people think it's it's not right so I'll talk about managing and everything like that I just want to go over Nvidia I want to show you I have you know 500 shares of Nvidia but let me just show you how I would run the wheel strategy on Nvidia so you'll go to sell put and again I'm going to go for the same for the same expiration I'm going to go for about 30 days out or so and I will go for the 130 strike that is a 31 Delta actually nvidia's implied volatility is lower than Tesla's so Tesla is going to be our highest play which makes sense like on 200,000 if you can make 10K a month you kidding me 10K a month is like more than most people make per month and $200,000 I don't think is unreasonable at all to make 10 $10,000 per month so Nvidia right now is actually lower implied volatility and therefore when I go over this example when I go over 130 if I do like uh it's actually going to be about 17 contracts yep 17 contracts um you're going to make about 4250 per month so on the covered call side let me go through the covered calls so this is about 4K and then if you already had invid and you were to do a sell call let's go for the 139 45 Delta is pretty high but again we don't care if we lose a stock this video is just going to assume that you just want High income to retire you need that income you're going to be using it for your needs right so you don't mind getting that income so the 139 strike here has a 45 Delta implied volatility here so here it is going for $5 um but you also have some upsides so we're going to go basically $4 up right nvidia's current price is 136 thereabouts so at $1 139 that's going to be $3 of upside plus $5 of Premium so that's $8 $8 you know is pretty good that's $800 on on 13 Grand so again if I go for 17 contracts here all right 17 contracts uh this will be a lot of money this will be about 8,500 plus some upside so it's 4 to 10 grand right why is it that wide guys well it's because option trading isn't like it's not a job you can't get $7,500 per month 12 months in a row some months are going to be 6K some months are going to be 10K my month's 400k as as my portfolio grows bigger I see a lot of people that say I can never get there you can get there it's just a matter of time just I'm farther along in the journey than you are that's okay it take it just takes time you'll also get there if you stick to this game so I mean the results are going to vary but give or take on $200,000 if you make 4% it's like 8 Grand and all you have to do is just sell puts to get in I would say 30 Delta and then on the covered call side you are going to go a little bit higher so you can go for 35 or 40 Delta it actually depends on on yourself like it is a case by case basis that is why I do one-on-one coaching it's because I'm not only doing my live trading and giving trades and covering questions and going over technical analysis and fundamental analysis I also do one-on-one coaching because it varies on people's situations like if you want to retire your risk level is going to be different from someone else's risk level your time Horizon is also going to be different so that's why I do one-on-one coaching obviously you can check that out if you want and if you don't want to totally fine just wanted to point that out so look a couple more tricks I want to go over before I wrap up the video adjusting your risk and reward is really easy here and I just showed you three examples spy Nvidia and Tesla look at the implied volatility pay attention to it the higher the implied volatility the riskier it is right however you also want to pay attention to RSI and the bowling band if the RSI is under 40 that's a good indicator that the stock is not necessarily oversold but it's it's much better than buying at a 52e high the lower the RSI the better all right so you want to jump in by selling puts and beginning the wheel strategy now if a stock is at a 52 we high I would honestly probably not trade that stock just because if you think about it a stock that's already expensive using the wheel strategy which is a bullish strategy can be a little bit dangerous it's not a bulletproof strategy there is no bulletproof strategy and that's a lie right every single option has its pros and has its cons all right being whatever there's everything has a pro and con in life there is no nothing is like necessarily like good and nothing's necessarily bad it's just how we think about things and there's trade-offs and everything right being rich and famous can have cons right being poor can have Pros same thing with each strategy it just you know the wheel strategy has cons the con is when the market goes down the wheel strategy suffers however it doesn't suffer more than a regular stock strategy so if you're looking to retire it's still make sense to have a 100% option portfolio that might sound crazy to you but it's actually safer than stocks so it's literally safer so having a 100% option portfolio is what I would do and I would use the wheel strategy to essentially retire and that's essentially what I've done I'm just running the wheel strategy with my positions for the most part I have some other strategies some are for fun some are for teaching but if it was up to me I could be fine with just 100% wheel right I know it's easier for me to say I get it I have a 7figure portfolio but if I had 200k I would still run majority of the portfolio in just the wheel strategy using a combination of some ETFs actually xlk and XL Y is also good xlk is the tech uh spider tech ETF and then XL Y is the consumer discretionary ETF you can look into those as well in this market there's you know I think ETFs are are good because they save you a lot of time and they have built- in diversification",1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,BdAalfGEON8,2024-11-29T20:30:00Z,"RETIRE EARLY ON JUST $212,000 With The Wheel Strategy on THESE Stocks",Nvidia,"those stocks are going to be ones that I covered in this channel Nvidia paler but you can also use other tech stocks so that could be meta that could be Netflix and actually any stock that has an RSI that's under about 40 is a really good candidate to begin running the wheel strategy or if the stock is towards the bottom end of the bowling or band because when you're running the wheel strategy what you want to do is you want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that is fairly cheap okay you don't want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that's at a 52 we High which is kind of difficult in this market which you know that was my short summary but if you have time let me explain to you you how to actually implement this all right so see you later if you don't have any time and now if you have some time let me go into the specifics so look I want to debunk the myth and I want to completely change the the 4% rule okay the 4% rule states this and you guys might may have heard of it the 4% rule is you can take out 4% per year in income when you're retired which is a bunch of BS to be honest if you're running the wheel strategy I can make 4% a month okay a month not a year so it doesn't make any sense to me that's that's why I like options so with the $200,000 portfolio $222,000 as I said in the title I think this is a really good position because 4% is essentially approaching the $9,000 Mark which is going to be six figures per year and I think that's a really good income Source right so you can really retire or have a full-time income or a really strong secondary source of income now I quickly want to say that in my experience I've been running the wheel strategy since I had 100K okay when I had 100K in my portfolio I I just start to really focus on the wheel strategy and I did a little bit early but I left my corporate job when I had 100K which is maybe a little bit ear um let me show you on spy I'm going to start off with the safest ETF I'm going to get riskier and riskier and then how to really capitalize and make four five even more perc per month so portfolio is at 4 million I guess our next Target is 5 million I've been doing very well and very happy and very blessed so spy all right I do have a position here I have a pretty sizable position and I um or actually running the wheel strategy as I mentioned all right so look let me explain to you what Spy is and why you would want to use it spy is going to be on the safer side of things spy is safer because it's an ETF that has 500 company companies in it essentially when I was getting my degree Finance everyone talked about beating S&P 500 and that's because this Benchmark is truly difficult to beat it is truly hard to beat for for the average investor and even many hedge funds do not beat the S&P 500 so it truly is a very interesting metric to look at now the S&P has all the sectors in it like technology consumer cyclicals consumer services consumer defensive utilities real estate energy Industrials Healthcare and financial services all right so this ETF has the top holding is Apple which I have a huge position in and I always say on this channel like you don't need to have the hottest stocks to make good money with options you don't you can make a lot of money Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta all these stocks fantastic stocks and in my video the other day I mentioned how we are in a very bullish Market there is a lot of money to be made so look with um the wheel strategy and running it on spy I said in my little short one minute summary that you can go 30 days in 27 Delta so let's go sell a put option I'm going're going to show you how this works so sell put let's go for 30 days right so that's going to be basically basically into January basically going into the new year so spy January okay I would let's let's take a look and see a 27 Delta here 587 27 dels okay 587 that was really close I picked 586 587 uh here has $400 now let me explain this is going to be in the lower end of returns and then I'll tell you how to get higher and higher returns with the wheel strategy on the lower end of things if you just want that safe passive income and you're kind of retired and you're just busy you won't be able to probably produce look $400 on 50 50k so on 200k you're only going to produce about $1,600 a month all right so that's on the low end of things but I will explain that when you're selling puts the put selling portion is the lower return portion on the covered calls you can make about double all right let me let me show you an example how that looks like so here you know in a month it's $400 but on 200k it'be $1,600 per month nothing really that big right nothing really that big however on the covered call side and before we get into the single stocks on the covered call side if I go to sell call let's say that you got a sign at 600 right so you got a sign for 600 if I were to sell like the 602 right here um which is very close to the money and I'll say Hey you will lose a stock or the ETF if it goes into the money but we don't really care because the whole the whole goal here right is that we're just trying to create a lot of income into retirement that that's really it guys we're trying to create income into retirement that's the goal of of this video is to show you how you can run the wheel strategy and just the wheel strategy you can literally Go 100% wheel strategy on spy or single stock so to finish up this spy example the put side of things would only create about $1,600 of income now the covered call side of things would create a little bit more income so we made about $400 un covered calls it's about 700 or so plus you get $2 of upside let's say this you know the etf's at 600 it goes to 602 so you get two plus you know about seven so it's $9 right so we got 400 to sell puts and now we get now 900 an upside for the covered call side of things right so $900 on the 50k or so you know if you multiply that by four you get at 3600 so you can make between 1,800 on the bottom end to 3600 okay so 1,800 to 3600 on just spy I think that's a pretty good monthly income for having 200k right most people can't figure out how to make income it's pretty easy on spy now if you want to create more income and you actually want to have that you know $8,000 Mark $99,000 $10,000 Mark you're going to have to use single stocks okay because you know going 30 days out in 27 Delta on spy is going to produce 2% per month in income or so 1 and a half 2% but if you want to get to the four 5% Mark or I honestly these past couple of months I'm at the 10% Mark it's it's just ridiculous I'm making money hand over fist just hand over fist and all these stocks guys you know bicep over tricep as I say but look I think that spy is an okay start if you have a bigger portfolio but if you're at 200k you're going to want to use the single stocks that I'm about to cover right now before I cover the single stocks let me just go through my notes real quick I want you to know that selling monthly options is probably the best although I have seen a lot of successful people go for two and three Monon options because they're busy professionals I work with a lot of Engineers doctors lawyers nurses accountants Etc these folks have jobs they're busy and they don't even have a lot of time to go on my live calls they don't even have a lot of time to really trade okay and that's okay because you can just set these positions and forget about them two months out three months out so I want to say that you can retire using the wheel strategy either you can create weekly income if you have more time and you have more desire or you can go for that monthly and two months out and three months out expirations right other thing I wanted to say is this strategy allows for consistent monthly income and for me that is probably my favorite right every single month I I like to get income I don't like to do weekly I also don't like to do two to three months either so I think this is a really reliable way to turn savings into cash flow into retirement so of course S&P 500 is is high quality but if you really want to get that bigger income let's go over some examples in my portfolio so um my videos are unscripted so I'm just going to go through a couple of examples here by the way let's just go to my total return I just want to show you guys that I've been doing pretty well a lot of my positions are are going for a good win right now let's go into something like a Chipotle okay I think that chipotle is going to be the next level of volatility it's not high volatility by no means like if we go look at this option right here the implied volatility is 29 so to be honest with you this is just only a little bit more I guess risky than S&P 5 00 it is a single stock so it is definitely more risky but the volatility is not that that much higher all right so if I were to go to sell put and that's how you get started in the wheel strategy real quick I have a whole wheel strategy course here my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff my free content here on YouTube is basically everything that you need to really level up your option trading my free stuff is better than people's discords it's better than people's boot camps and better than people's coaching so I try to give you guys everything as much as possible for free um because that's that's my mission that's my goal and I 100% believe in that and I've seen iten happen over and over folks are making full-time income look sell sellp put well January 17th will be 50 days out let's go for January 3rd about 30 days out and if I were to sell I would go for about a 30 Delta so let's go here that's 18 Delta that's way too low huh that's interesting okay 30 Del right here so on this position right here let's go and let's put $200,000 to work let's just say hypothetically that we want to put all $200,000 to work all right so if I go for 20 contracts here let's go for 35 contracts that's 212,000 roughly let's go for 36 contracts $212,000 here you're going to make $3,000 a month right for selling puts and then once you get assigned you can expect about double all right like I just showed you in the Spy example when you sell a covered call you typically have a bit of upside okay and the covered call can be closer to the money so here $3,000 okay let me just show you if you had already been assigned on Chipotle and it's currently at 62 you can go for something like 63 so this will give you a dollar of upside plus 145 so this right here would be a lot more attractive obviously on the cover callide because you have some upside on the stock itself so this right here would probably be $3 to $4,000 a month thereabouts right it depends on volatility depends on market conditions so that is the next level so you can go from Spy which is 1,800 to 3600 to to something like a like a Chipotle which is like fairly low low risk and that would be between like three 3 to 4K okay so that would be a bit higher there now let me go to something like a Tesla all right so now Tesla would get you a lot closer to that really big income okay and by the way I think you need to have a combination of all these things you need to have some spy you need to have some safer stocks you need to have some riskier stocks it's just a combination of things that I think is really important so let's go for January 3rd again okay and for Tesla I'm pretty bullish so if you are bullish personally like I'm bullish on Tesla you can go for a little bit higher Delta remember the Delta is just a give and take relationship the higher the Delta the higher chances are that you will get assigned okay and the lower the Delta is you know essentially the lower chance you'll get a sign however the higher the Delta the more you get paid the lower Delta the less you get so it's all about uh risk and return it's a it's a clear trade-off so 320 if I were to sell a put I'm going to go a little bit higher on the Delta all right the implied volatility volatility here is 50 so 50 is obviously better than the 29 that we just saw for Chipotle so this this position right here is going to be uh a lot more lucrative it's going to be a lot more lucrative for for selling options and running the wheel strategy so if I were to do five here that's 150k 7 this would be about 212k so you can see here how on the sell puts I would already make almost 10 ,000 okay on the covered call side of things you can make you know this strategy can produce1 to $15,000 a month obviously it depends on the market and the in the wheel strategy is not a perfectly Flawless strategy there is no such thing as a perfectly Flawless strategy but I'll tell you how to manage it all right let me go through my notes here basically the way that you would manage this strategy is first of all you have to pick stocks that you like I always say that in my videos if you're not trading stocks that you like if you don't know why you own a stock I will challenge you that you don't even know how to invest you don't know what you're doing a lot of people are into like the micro strategy or the smci stuff I believe those YouTubers that are covering these stocks are kind of on the scammy side of things because I don't like the hype the reason why YouTubers cover hype is for views I mean Everyone likes views on YouTube but I'm not going to disregard what I actually believe to be true and for me I would always recommend do not go for hype go for safe highquality companies spy would be the safest side and then the middle you know would be your craft hind would be some American Airlines it would be you know your utilities your financials like your Banks and JP Morgan and and Bank of America stuff like that and then on the higher side of things I I'll show you one more example on Nvidia it would be your your Tesla your Nvidia the Palante tier the higher risk stuff that I've covered that has absolutely paid off all right it's it's absolutely paid off we've been making money hand over fist bicep over tricep as I like to say uh we've been doing fantastic so I hope that your guys pockets is like full of money and then yeah you're just happy so look with 212,00 or you know let's say $250,000 um you can make a full-time income selling options and just looking at these positions right here on Tesla I think that it is a it's an absolute no-brainer to to run this on Tesla now you can also run this on on a stock like Nvidia Nvidia is also going to have high volatility and when you go for a higher volatility stock that's really good because it makes Financial Freedom a lot easier you can make a full-time income with 212,000 or 250,000 basically in around 200 to 300 K range because we're going to disregard you know 4% per year typical standard rule you can make 4% a month when you can make 4% a month on 2 to 300K that's what really brings you to that $10,000 a month Mark right so for my portfolio I I'm okay with even just you know a little bit less I don't even go for it's kind of hard to say because lately I've been making like 10% so in the last like month I made like $400,000 or so and that's what pushed me over the $4 million Mark so you know it just varies but I'll say that as you scale it just get it's easier and easier but don't be discouraged if you have you know 50k 100K it just takes time to scale right it's it's a journey but I want to say that the typical Financial rules out there you got to you guys got to fire a financial adviser all right I mean you can hire me as a one-on-one coach I'm going to be much better than financial adviser that just takes 1% of your money every year or you know it really is so simple or just watch my free stuff right you can make a lot of money by just running the wheel strategy and you don't need to have like this million dollar account to really hit some retirement figures right money is is actually not as hard as most people think it's it's not right so I'll talk about managing and everything like that I just want to go over Nvidia I want to show you I have you know 500 shares of Nvidia but let me just show you how I would run the wheel strategy on Nvidia so you'll go to sell put and again I'm going to go for the same for the same expiration I'm going to go for about 30 days out or so and I will go for the 130 strike that is a 31 Delta actually nvidia's implied volatility is lower than Tesla's so Tesla is going to be our highest play which makes sense like on 200,000 if you can make 10K a month you kidding me 10K a month is like more than most people make per month and $200,000 I don't think is unreasonable at all to make 10 $10,000 per month so Nvidia right now is actually lower implied volatility and therefore when I go over this example when I go over 130 if I do like uh it's actually going to be about 17 contracts yep 17 contracts um you're going to make about 4250 per month so on the covered call side let me go through the covered calls so this is about 4K and then if you already had invid and you were to do a sell call let's go for the 139 45 Delta is pretty high but again we don't care if we lose a stock this video is just going to assume that you just want High income to retire you need that income you're going to be using it for your needs right so you don't mind getting that income so the 139 strike here has a 45 Delta implied volatility here so here it is going for $5 um but you also have some upsides so we're going to go basically $4 up right nvidia's current price is 136 thereabouts so at $1 139 that's going to be $3 of upside plus $5 of Premium so that's $8 $8 you know is pretty good that's $800 on on 13 Grand so again if I go for 17 contracts here all right 17 contracts uh this will be a lot of money this will be about 8,500 plus some upside so it's 4 to 10 grand right why is it that wide guys well it's because option trading isn't like it's not a job you can't get $7,500 per month 12 months in a row some months are going to be 6K some months are going to be 10K my month's 400k as as my portfolio grows bigger I see a lot of people that say I can never get there you can get there it's just a matter of time just I'm farther along in the journey than you are that's okay it take it just takes time you'll also get there if you stick to this game so I mean the results are going to vary but give or take on $200,000 if you make 4% it's like 8 Grand and all you have to do is just sell puts to get in I would say 30 Delta and then on the covered call side you are going to go a little bit higher so you can go for 35 or 40 Delta it actually depends on on yourself like it is a case by case basis that is why I do one-on-one coaching it's because I'm not only doing my live trading and giving trades and covering questions and going over technical analysis and fundamental analysis I also do one-on-one coaching because it varies on people's situations like if you want to retire your risk level is going to be different from someone else's risk level your time Horizon is also going to be different so that's why I do one-on-one coaching obviously you can check that out if you want and if you don't want to totally fine just wanted to point that out so look a couple more tricks I want to go over before I wrap up the video adjusting your risk and reward is really easy here and I just showed you three examples spy Nvidia and Tesla look at the implied volatility pay attention to it the higher the implied volatility the riskier it is right however you also want to pay attention to RSI and the bowling band if the RSI is under 40 that's a good indicator that the stock is not necessarily oversold but it's it's much better than buying at a 52e high the lower the RSI the better all right so you want to jump in by selling puts and beginning the wheel strategy now if a stock is at a 52 we high I would honestly probably not trade that stock just because if you think about it a stock that's already expensive using the wheel strategy which is a bullish strategy can be a little bit dangerous it's not a bulletproof strategy there is no bulletproof strategy and that's a lie right every single option has its pros and has its cons all right being whatever there's everything has a pro and con in life there is no nothing is like necessarily like good and nothing's necessarily bad it's just how we think about things and there's trade-offs and everything right being rich and famous can have cons right being poor can have Pros same thing with each strategy it just you know the wheel strategy has cons the con is when the market goes down the wheel strategy suffers however it doesn't suffer more than a regular stock strategy so if you're looking to retire it's still make sense to have a 100% option portfolio that might sound crazy to you but it's actually safer than stocks so it's literally safer so having a 100% option portfolio is what I would do and I would use the wheel strategy to essentially retire and that's essentially what I've done I'm just running the wheel strategy with my positions for the most part I have some other strategies some are for fun some are for teaching but if it was up to me I could be fine with just 100% wheel right I know it's easier for me to say I get it I have a 7figure portfolio but if I had 200k I would still run majority of the portfolio in just the wheel strategy using a combination of some ETFs actually xlk and XL Y is also good xlk is the tech uh spider tech ETF and then XL Y is the consumer discretionary ETF you can look into those as well in this market there's you know I think ETFs are are good because they save you a lot of time and they have built- in diversification",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,BdAalfGEON8,2024-11-29T20:30:00Z,"RETIRE EARLY ON JUST $212,000 With The Wheel Strategy on THESE Stocks",Palantir,"those stocks are going to be ones that I covered in this channel Nvidia paler but you can also use other tech stocks so that could be meta that could be Netflix and actually any stock that has an RSI that's under about 40 is a really good candidate to begin running the wheel strategy or if the stock is towards the bottom end of the bowling or band because when you're running the wheel strategy what you want to do is you want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that is fairly cheap okay you don't want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that's at a 52 we High which is kind of difficult in this market which you know that was my short summary but if you have time let me explain to you you how to actually implement this all right so see you later if you don't have any time and now if you have some time let me go into the specifics so look I want to debunk the myth and I want to completely change the the 4% rule okay the 4% rule states this and you guys might may have heard of it the 4% rule is you can take out 4% per year in income when you're retired which is a bunch of BS to be honest if you're running the wheel strategy I can make 4% a month okay a month not a year so it doesn't make any sense to me that's that's why I like options so with the $200,000 portfolio $222,000 as I said in the title I think this is a really good position because 4% is essentially approaching the $9,000 Mark which is going to be six figures per year and I think that's a really good income Source right so you can really retire or have a full-time income or a really strong secondary source of income now I quickly want to say that in my experience I've been running the wheel strategy since I had 100K okay when I had 100K in my portfolio I I just start to really focus on the wheel strategy and I did a little bit early but I left my corporate job when I had 100K which is maybe a little bit ear um let me show you on spy I'm going to start off with the safest ETF I'm going to get riskier and riskier and then how to really capitalize and make four five even more perc per month so portfolio is at 4 million I guess our next Target is 5 million I've been doing very well and very happy and very blessed so spy all right I do have a position here I have a pretty sizable position and I um or actually running the wheel strategy as I mentioned all right so look let me explain to you what Spy is and why you would want to use it spy is going to be on the safer side of things spy is safer because it's an ETF that has 500 company companies in it essentially when I was getting my degree Finance everyone talked about beating S&P 500 and that's because this Benchmark is truly difficult to beat it is truly hard to beat for for the average investor and even many hedge funds do not beat the S&P 500 so it truly is a very interesting metric to look at now the S&P has all the sectors in it like technology consumer cyclicals consumer services consumer defensive utilities real estate energy Industrials Healthcare and financial services all right so this ETF has the top holding is Apple which I have a huge position in and I always say on this channel like you don't need to have the hottest stocks to make good money with options you don't you can make a lot of money Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta all these stocks fantastic stocks and in my video the other day I mentioned how we are in a very bullish Market there is a lot of money to be made so look with um the wheel strategy and running it on spy I said in my little short one minute summary that you can go 30 days in 27 Delta so let's go sell a put option I'm going're going to show you how this works so sell put let's go for 30 days right so that's going to be basically basically into January basically going into the new year so spy January okay I would let's let's take a look and see a 27 Delta here 587 27 dels okay 587 that was really close I picked 586 587 uh here has $400 now let me explain this is going to be in the lower end of returns and then I'll tell you how to get higher and higher returns with the wheel strategy on the lower end of things if you just want that safe passive income and you're kind of retired and you're just busy you won't be able to probably produce look $400 on 50 50k so on 200k you're only going to produce about $1,600 a month all right so that's on the low end of things but I will explain that when you're selling puts the put selling portion is the lower return portion on the covered calls you can make about double all right let me let me show you an example how that looks like so here you know in a month it's $400 but on 200k it'be $1,600 per month nothing really that big right nothing really that big however on the covered call side and before we get into the single stocks on the covered call side if I go to sell call let's say that you got a sign at 600 right so you got a sign for 600 if I were to sell like the 602 right here um which is very close to the money and I'll say Hey you will lose a stock or the ETF if it goes into the money but we don't really care because the whole the whole goal here right is that we're just trying to create a lot of income into retirement that that's really it guys we're trying to create income into retirement that's the goal of of this video is to show you how you can run the wheel strategy and just the wheel strategy you can literally Go 100% wheel strategy on spy or single stock so to finish up this spy example the put side of things would only create about $1,600 of income now the covered call side of things would create a little bit more income so we made about $400 un covered calls it's about 700 or so plus you get $2 of upside let's say this you know the etf's at 600 it goes to 602 so you get two plus you know about seven so it's $9 right so we got 400 to sell puts and now we get now 900 an upside for the covered call side of things right so $900 on the 50k or so you know if you multiply that by four you get at 3600 so you can make between 1,800 on the bottom end to 3600 okay so 1,800 to 3600 on just spy I think that's a pretty good monthly income for having 200k right most people can't figure out how to make income it's pretty easy on spy now if you want to create more income and you actually want to have that you know $8,000 Mark $99,000 $10,000 Mark you're going to have to use single stocks okay because you know going 30 days out in 27 Delta on spy is going to produce 2% per month in income or so 1 and a half 2% but if you want to get to the four 5% Mark or I honestly these past couple of months I'm at the 10% Mark it's it's just ridiculous I'm making money hand over fist just hand over fist and all these stocks guys you know bicep over tricep as I say but look I think that spy is an okay start if you have a bigger portfolio but if you're at 200k you're going to want to use the single stocks that I'm about to cover right now before I cover the single stocks let me just go through my notes real quick I want you to know that selling monthly options is probably the best although I have seen a lot of successful people go for two and three Monon options because they're busy professionals I work with a lot of Engineers doctors lawyers nurses accountants Etc these folks have jobs they're busy and they don't even have a lot of time to go on my live calls they don't even have a lot of time to really trade okay and that's okay because you can just set these positions and forget about them two months out three months out so I want to say that you can retire using the wheel strategy either you can create weekly income if you have more time and you have more desire or you can go for that monthly and two months out and three months out expirations right other thing I wanted to say is this strategy allows for consistent monthly income and for me that is probably my favorite right every single month I I like to get income I don't like to do weekly I also don't like to do two to three months either so I think this is a really reliable way to turn savings into cash flow into retirement so of course S&P 500 is is high quality but if you really want to get that bigger income let's go over some examples in my portfolio so um my videos are unscripted so I'm just going to go through a couple of examples here by the way let's just go to my total return I just want to show you guys that I've been doing pretty well a lot of my positions are are going for a good win right now let's go into something like a Chipotle okay I think that chipotle is going to be the next level of volatility it's not high volatility by no means like if we go look at this option right here the implied volatility is 29 so to be honest with you this is just only a little bit more I guess risky than S&P 5 00 it is a single stock so it is definitely more risky but the volatility is not that that much higher all right so if I were to go to sell put and that's how you get started in the wheel strategy real quick I have a whole wheel strategy course here my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff my free content here on YouTube is basically everything that you need to really level up your option trading my free stuff is better than people's discords it's better than people's boot camps and better than people's coaching so I try to give you guys everything as much as possible for free um because that's that's my mission that's my goal and I 100% believe in that and I've seen iten happen over and over folks are making full-time income look sell sellp put well January 17th will be 50 days out let's go for January 3rd about 30 days out and if I were to sell I would go for about a 30 Delta so let's go here that's 18 Delta that's way too low huh that's interesting okay 30 Del right here so on this position right here let's go and let's put $200,000 to work let's just say hypothetically that we want to put all $200,000 to work all right so if I go for 20 contracts here let's go for 35 contracts that's 212,000 roughly let's go for 36 contracts $212,000 here you're going to make $3,000 a month right for selling puts and then once you get assigned you can expect about double all right like I just showed you in the Spy example when you sell a covered call you typically have a bit of upside okay and the covered call can be closer to the money so here $3,000 okay let me just show you if you had already been assigned on Chipotle and it's currently at 62 you can go for something like 63 so this will give you a dollar of upside plus 145 so this right here would be a lot more attractive obviously on the cover callide because you have some upside on the stock itself so this right here would probably be $3 to $4,000 a month thereabouts right it depends on volatility depends on market conditions so that is the next level so you can go from Spy which is 1,800 to 3600 to to something like a like a Chipotle which is like fairly low low risk and that would be between like three 3 to 4K okay so that would be a bit higher there now let me go to something like a Tesla all right so now Tesla would get you a lot closer to that really big income okay and by the way I think you need to have a combination of all these things you need to have some spy you need to have some safer stocks you need to have some riskier stocks it's just a combination of things that I think is really important so let's go for January 3rd again okay and for Tesla I'm pretty bullish so if you are bullish personally like I'm bullish on Tesla you can go for a little bit higher Delta remember the Delta is just a give and take relationship the higher the Delta the higher chances are that you will get assigned okay and the lower the Delta is you know essentially the lower chance you'll get a sign however the higher the Delta the more you get paid the lower Delta the less you get so it's all about uh risk and return it's a it's a clear trade-off so 320 if I were to sell a put I'm going to go a little bit higher on the Delta all right the implied volatility volatility here is 50 so 50 is obviously better than the 29 that we just saw for Chipotle so this this position right here is going to be uh a lot more lucrative it's going to be a lot more lucrative for for selling options and running the wheel strategy so if I were to do five here that's 150k 7 this would be about 212k so you can see here how on the sell puts I would already make almost 10 ,000 okay on the covered call side of things you can make you know this strategy can produce1 to $15,000 a month obviously it depends on the market and the in the wheel strategy is not a perfectly Flawless strategy there is no such thing as a perfectly Flawless strategy but I'll tell you how to manage it all right let me go through my notes here basically the way that you would manage this strategy is first of all you have to pick stocks that you like I always say that in my videos if you're not trading stocks that you like if you don't know why you own a stock I will challenge you that you don't even know how to invest you don't know what you're doing a lot of people are into like the micro strategy or the smci stuff I believe those YouTubers that are covering these stocks are kind of on the scammy side of things because I don't like the hype the reason why YouTubers cover hype is for views I mean Everyone likes views on YouTube but I'm not going to disregard what I actually believe to be true and for me I would always recommend do not go for hype go for safe highquality companies spy would be the safest side and then the middle you know would be your craft hind would be some American Airlines it would be you know your utilities your financials like your Banks and JP Morgan and and Bank of America stuff like that and then on the higher side of things I I'll show you one more example on Nvidia it would be your your Tesla your Nvidia the Palante tier the higher risk stuff that I've covered that has absolutely paid off all right it's it's absolutely paid off we've been making money hand over fist bicep over tricep as I like to say uh we've been doing fantastic so I hope that your guys pockets is like full of money and then yeah you're just happy so look with 212,00 or you know let's say $250,000 um you can make a full-time income selling options and just looking at these positions right here on Tesla I think that it is a it's an absolute no-brainer to to run this on Tesla now you can also run this on on a stock like Nvidia Nvidia is also going to have high volatility and when you go for a higher volatility stock that's really good because it makes Financial Freedom a lot easier you can make a full-time income with 212,000 or 250,000 basically in around 200 to 300 K range because we're going to disregard you know 4% per year typical standard rule you can make 4% a month when you can make 4% a month on 2 to 300K that's what really brings you to that $10,000 a month Mark right so for my portfolio I I'm okay with even just you know a little bit less I don't even go for it's kind of hard to say because lately I've been making like 10% so in the last like month I made like $400,000 or so and that's what pushed me over the $4 million Mark so you know it just varies but I'll say that as you scale it just get it's easier and easier but don't be discouraged if you have you know 50k 100K it just takes time to scale right it's it's a journey but I want to say that the typical Financial rules out there you got to you guys got to fire a financial adviser all right I mean you can hire me as a one-on-one coach I'm going to be much better than financial adviser that just takes 1% of your money every year or you know it really is so simple or just watch my free stuff right you can make a lot of money by just running the wheel strategy and you don't need to have like this million dollar account to really hit some retirement figures right money is is actually not as hard as most people think it's it's not right so I'll talk about managing and everything like that I just want to go over Nvidia I want to show you I have you know 500 shares of Nvidia but let me just show you how I would run the wheel strategy on Nvidia so you'll go to sell put and again I'm going to go for the same for the same expiration I'm going to go for about 30 days out or so and I will go for the 130 strike that is a 31 Delta actually nvidia's implied volatility is lower than Tesla's so Tesla is going to be our highest play which makes sense like on 200,000 if you can make 10K a month you kidding me 10K a month is like more than most people make per month and $200,000 I don't think is unreasonable at all to make 10 $10,000 per month so Nvidia right now is actually lower implied volatility and therefore when I go over this example when I go over 130 if I do like uh it's actually going to be about 17 contracts yep 17 contracts um you're going to make about 4250 per month so on the covered call side let me go through the covered calls so this is about 4K and then if you already had invid and you were to do a sell call let's go for the 139 45 Delta is pretty high but again we don't care if we lose a stock this video is just going to assume that you just want High income to retire you need that income you're going to be using it for your needs right so you don't mind getting that income so the 139 strike here has a 45 Delta implied volatility here so here it is going for $5 um but you also have some upsides so we're going to go basically $4 up right nvidia's current price is 136 thereabouts so at $1 139 that's going to be $3 of upside plus $5 of Premium so that's $8 $8 you know is pretty good that's $800 on on 13 Grand so again if I go for 17 contracts here all right 17 contracts uh this will be a lot of money this will be about 8,500 plus some upside so it's 4 to 10 grand right why is it that wide guys well it's because option trading isn't like it's not a job you can't get $7,500 per month 12 months in a row some months are going to be 6K some months are going to be 10K my month's 400k as as my portfolio grows bigger I see a lot of people that say I can never get there you can get there it's just a matter of time just I'm farther along in the journey than you are that's okay it take it just takes time you'll also get there if you stick to this game so I mean the results are going to vary but give or take on $200,000 if you make 4% it's like 8 Grand and all you have to do is just sell puts to get in I would say 30 Delta and then on the covered call side you are going to go a little bit higher so you can go for 35 or 40 Delta it actually depends on on yourself like it is a case by case basis that is why I do one-on-one coaching it's because I'm not only doing my live trading and giving trades and covering questions and going over technical analysis and fundamental analysis I also do one-on-one coaching because it varies on people's situations like if you want to retire your risk level is going to be different from someone else's risk level your time Horizon is also going to be different so that's why I do one-on-one coaching obviously you can check that out if you want and if you don't want to totally fine just wanted to point that out so look a couple more tricks I want to go over before I wrap up the video adjusting your risk and reward is really easy here and I just showed you three examples spy Nvidia and Tesla look at the implied volatility pay attention to it the higher the implied volatility the riskier it is right however you also want to pay attention to RSI and the bowling band if the RSI is under 40 that's a good indicator that the stock is not necessarily oversold but it's it's much better than buying at a 52e high the lower the RSI the better all right so you want to jump in by selling puts and beginning the wheel strategy now if a stock is at a 52 we high I would honestly probably not trade that stock just because if you think about it a stock that's already expensive using the wheel strategy which is a bullish strategy can be a little bit dangerous it's not a bulletproof strategy there is no bulletproof strategy and that's a lie right every single option has its pros and has its cons all right being whatever there's everything has a pro and con in life there is no nothing is like necessarily like good and nothing's necessarily bad it's just how we think about things and there's trade-offs and everything right being rich and famous can have cons right being poor can have Pros same thing with each strategy it just you know the wheel strategy has cons the con is when the market goes down the wheel strategy suffers however it doesn't suffer more than a regular stock strategy so if you're looking to retire it's still make sense to have a 100% option portfolio that might sound crazy to you but it's actually safer than stocks so it's literally safer so having a 100% option portfolio is what I would do and I would use the wheel strategy to essentially retire and that's essentially what I've done I'm just running the wheel strategy with my positions for the most part I have some other strategies some are for fun some are for teaching but if it was up to me I could be fine with just 100% wheel right I know it's easier for me to say I get it I have a 7figure portfolio but if I had 200k I would still run majority of the portfolio in just the wheel strategy using a combination of some ETFs actually xlk and XL Y is also good xlk is the tech uh spider tech ETF and then XL Y is the consumer discretionary ETF you can look into those as well in this market there's you know I think ETFs are are good because they save you a lot of time

Invest with Henry,BdAalfGEON8,2024-11-29T20:30:00Z,"RETIRE EARLY ON JUST $212,000 With The Wheel Strategy on THESE Stocks",Palantir,"those stocks are going to be ones that I covered in this channel Nvidia paler but you can also use other tech stocks so that could be meta that could be Netflix and actually any stock that has an RSI that's under about 40 is a really good candidate to begin running the wheel strategy or if the stock is towards the bottom end of the bowling or band because when you're running the wheel strategy what you want to do is you want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that is fairly cheap okay you don't want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that's at a 52 we High which is kind of difficult in this market which you know that was my short summary but if you have time let me explain to you you how to actually implement this all right so see you later if you don't have any time and now if you have some time let me go into the specifics so look I want to debunk the myth and I want to completely change the the 4% rule okay the 4% rule states this and you guys might may have heard of it the 4% rule is you can take out 4% per year in income when you're retired which is a bunch of BS to be honest if you're running the wheel strategy I can make 4% a month okay a month not a year so it doesn't make any sense to me that's that's why I like options so with the $200,000 portfolio $222,000 as I said in the title I think this is a really good position because 4% is essentially approaching the $9,000 Mark which is going to be six figures per year and I think that's a really good income Source right so you can really retire or have a full-time income or a really strong secondary source of income now I quickly want to say that in my experience I've been running the wheel strategy since I had 100K okay when I had 100K in my portfolio I I just start to really focus on the wheel strategy and I did a little bit early but I left my corporate job when I had 100K which is maybe a little bit ear um let me show you on spy I'm going to start off with the safest ETF I'm going to get riskier and riskier and then how to really capitalize and make four five even more perc per month so portfolio is at 4 million I guess our next Target is 5 million I've been doing very well and very happy and very blessed so spy all right I do have a position here I have a pretty sizable position and I um or actually running the wheel strategy as I mentioned all right so look let me explain to you what Spy is and why you would want to use it spy is going to be on the safer side of things spy is safer because it's an ETF that has 500 company companies in it essentially when I was getting my degree Finance everyone talked about beating S&P 500 and that's because this Benchmark is truly difficult to beat it is truly hard to beat for for the average investor and even many hedge funds do not beat the S&P 500 so it truly is a very interesting metric to look at now the S&P has all the sectors in it like technology consumer cyclicals consumer services consumer defensive utilities real estate energy Industrials Healthcare and financial services all right so this ETF has the top holding is Apple which I have a huge position in and I always say on this channel like you don't need to have the hottest stocks to make good money with options you don't you can make a lot of money Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta all these stocks fantastic stocks and in my video the other day I mentioned how we are in a very bullish Market there is a lot of money to be made so look with um the wheel strategy and running it on spy I said in my little short one minute summary that you can go 30 days in 27 Delta so let's go sell a put option I'm going're going to show you how this works so sell put let's go for 30 days right so that's going to be basically basically into January basically going into the new year so spy January okay I would let's let's take a look and see a 27 Delta here 587 27 dels okay 587 that was really close I picked 586 587 uh here has $400 now let me explain this is going to be in the lower end of returns and then I'll tell you how to get higher and higher returns with the wheel strategy on the lower end of things if you just want that safe passive income and you're kind of retired and you're just busy you won't be able to probably produce look $400 on 50 50k so on 200k you're only going to produce about $1,600 a month all right so that's on the low end of things but I will explain that when you're selling puts the put selling portion is the lower return portion on the covered calls you can make about double all right let me let me show you an example how that looks like so here you know in a month it's $400 but on 200k it'be $1,600 per month nothing really that big right nothing really that big however on the covered call side and before we get into the single stocks on the covered call side if I go to sell call let's say that you got a sign at 600 right so you got a sign for 600 if I were to sell like the 602 right here um which is very close to the money and I'll say Hey you will lose a stock or the ETF if it goes into the money but we don't really care because the whole the whole goal here right is that we're just trying to create a lot of income into retirement that that's really it guys we're trying to create income into retirement that's the goal of of this video is to show you how you can run the wheel strategy and just the wheel strategy you can literally Go 100% wheel strategy on spy or single stock so to finish up this spy example the put side of things would only create about $1,600 of income now the covered call side of things would create a little bit more income so we made about $400 un covered calls it's about 700 or so plus you get $2 of upside let's say this you know the etf's at 600 it goes to 602 so you get two plus you know about seven so it's $9 right so we got 400 to sell puts and now we get now 900 an upside for the covered call side of things right so $900 on the 50k or so you know if you multiply that by four you get at 3600 so you can make between 1,800 on the bottom end to 3600 okay so 1,800 to 3600 on just spy I think that's a pretty good monthly income for having 200k right most people can't figure out how to make income it's pretty easy on spy now if you want to create more income and you actually want to have that you know $8,000 Mark $99,000 $10,000 Mark you're going to have to use single stocks okay because you know going 30 days out in 27 Delta on spy is going to produce 2% per month in income or so 1 and a half 2% but if you want to get to the four 5% Mark or I honestly these past couple of months I'm at the 10% Mark it's it's just ridiculous I'm making money hand over fist just hand over fist and all these stocks guys you know bicep over tricep as I say but look I think that spy is an okay start if you have a bigger portfolio but if you're at 200k you're going to want to use the single stocks that I'm about to cover right now before I cover the single stocks let me just go through my notes real quick I want you to know that selling monthly options is probably the best although I have seen a lot of successful people go for two and three Monon options because they're busy professionals I work with a lot of Engineers doctors lawyers nurses accountants Etc these folks have jobs they're busy and they don't even have a lot of time to go on my live calls they don't even have a lot of time to really trade okay and that's okay because you can just set these positions and forget about them two months out three months out so I want to say that you can retire using the wheel strategy either you can create weekly income if you have more time and you have more desire or you can go for that monthly and two months out and three months out expirations right other thing I wanted to say is this strategy allows for consistent monthly income and for me that is probably my favorite right every single month I I like to get income I don't like to do weekly I also don't like to do two to three months either so I think this is a really reliable way to turn savings into cash flow into retirement so of course S&P 500 is is high quality but if you really want to get that bigger income let's go over some examples in my portfolio so um my videos are unscripted so I'm just going to go through a couple of examples here by the way let's just go to my total return I just want to show you guys that I've been doing pretty well a lot of my positions are are going for a good win right now let's go into something like a Chipotle okay I think that chipotle is going to be the next level of volatility it's not high volatility by no means like if we go look at this option right here the implied volatility is 29 so to be honest with you this is just only a little bit more I guess risky than S&P 5 00 it is a single stock so it is definitely more risky but the volatility is not that that much higher all right so if I were to go to sell put and that's how you get started in the wheel strategy real quick I have a whole wheel strategy course here my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff my free content here on YouTube is basically everything that you need to really level up your option trading my free stuff is better than people's discords it's better than people's boot camps and better than people's coaching so I try to give you guys everything as much as possible for free um because that's that's my mission that's my goal and I 100% believe in that and I've seen iten happen over and over folks are making full-time income look sell sellp put well January 17th will be 50 days out let's go for January 3rd about 30 days out and if I were to sell I would go for about a 30 Delta so let's go here that's 18 Delta that's way too low huh that's interesting okay 30 Del right here so on this position right here let's go and let's put $200,000 to work let's just say hypothetically that we want to put all $200,000 to work all right so if I go for 20 contracts here let's go for 35 contracts that's 212,000 roughly let's go for 36 contracts $212,000 here you're going to make $3,000 a month right for selling puts and then once you get assigned you can expect about double all right like I just showed you in the Spy example when you sell a covered call you typically have a bit of upside okay and the covered call can be closer to the money so here $3,000 okay let me just show you if you had already been assigned on Chipotle and it's currently at 62 you can go for something like 63 so this will give you a dollar of upside plus 145 so this right here would be a lot more attractive obviously on the cover callide because you have some upside on the stock itself so this right here would probably be $3 to $4,000 a month thereabouts right it depends on volatility depends on market conditions so that is the next level so you can go from Spy which is 1,800 to 3600 to to something like a like a Chipotle which is like fairly low low risk and that would be between like three 3 to 4K okay so that would be a bit higher there now let me go to something like a Tesla all right so now Tesla would get you a lot closer to that really big income okay and by the way I think you need to have a combination of all these things you need to have some spy you need to have some safer stocks you need to have some riskier stocks it's just a combination of things that I think is really important so let's go for January 3rd again okay and for Tesla I'm pretty bullish so if you are bullish personally like I'm bullish on Tesla you can go for a little bit higher Delta remember the Delta is just a give and take relationship the higher the Delta the higher chances are that you will get assigned okay and the lower the Delta is you know essentially the lower chance you'll get a sign however the higher the Delta the more you get paid the lower Delta the less you get so it's all about uh risk and return it's a it's a clear trade-off so 320 if I were to sell a put I'm going to go a little bit higher on the Delta all right the implied volatility volatility here is 50 so 50 is obviously better than the 29 that we just saw for Chipotle so this this position right here is going to be uh a lot more lucrative it's going to be a lot more lucrative for for selling options and running the wheel strategy so if I were to do five here that's 150k 7 this would be about 212k so you can see here how on the sell puts I would already make almost 10 ,000 okay on the covered call side of things you can make you know this strategy can produce1 to $15,000 a month obviously it depends on the market and the in the wheel strategy is not a perfectly Flawless strategy there is no such thing as a perfectly Flawless strategy but I'll tell you how to manage it all right let me go through my notes here basically the way that you would manage this strategy is first of all you have to pick stocks that you like I always say that in my videos if you're not trading stocks that you like if you don't know why you own a stock I will challenge you that you don't even know how to invest you don't know what you're doing a lot of people are into like the micro strategy or the smci stuff I believe those YouTubers that are covering these stocks are kind of on the scammy side of things because I don't like the hype the reason why YouTubers cover hype is for views I mean Everyone likes views on YouTube but I'm not going to disregard what I actually believe to be true and for me I would always recommend do not go for hype go for safe highquality companies spy would be the safest side and then the middle you know would be your craft hind would be some American Airlines it would be you know your utilities your financials like your Banks and JP Morgan and and Bank of America stuff like that and then on the higher side of things I I'll show you one more example on Nvidia it would be your your Tesla your Nvidia the Palante tier the higher risk stuff that I've covered that has absolutely paid off all right it's it's absolutely paid off we've been making money hand over fist bicep over tricep as I like to say uh we've been doing fantastic so I hope that your guys pockets is like full of money and then yeah you're just happy so look with 212,00 or you know let's say $250,000 um you can make a full-time income selling options and just looking at these positions right here on Tesla I think that it is a it's an absolute no-brainer to to run this on Tesla now you can also run this on on a stock like Nvidia Nvidia is also going to have high volatility and when you go for a higher volatility stock that's really good because it makes Financial Freedom a lot easier you can make a full-time income with 212,000 or 250,000 basically in around 200 to 300 K range because we're going to disregard you know 4% per year typical standard rule you can make 4% a month when you can make 4% a month on 2 to 300K that's what really brings you to that $10,000 a month Mark right so for my portfolio I I'm okay with even just you know a little bit less I don't even go for it's kind of hard to say because lately I've been making like 10% so in the last like month I made like $400,000 or so and that's what pushed me over the $4 million Mark so you know it just varies but I'll say that as you scale it just get it's easier and easier but don't be discouraged if you have you know 50k 100K it just takes time to scale right it's it's a journey but I want to say that the typical Financial rules out there you got to you guys got to fire a financial adviser all right I mean you can hire me as a one-on-one coach I'm going to be much better than financial adviser that just takes 1% of your money every year or you know it really is so simple or just watch my free stuff right you can make a lot of money by just running the wheel strategy and you don't need to have like this million dollar account to really hit some retirement figures right money is is actually not as hard as most people think it's it's not right so I'll talk about managing and everything like that I just want to go over Nvidia I want to show you I have you know 500 shares of Nvidia but let me just show you how I would run the wheel strategy on Nvidia so you'll go to sell put and again I'm going to go for the same for the same expiration I'm going to go for about 30 days out or so and I will go for the 130 strike that is a 31 Delta actually nvidia's implied volatility is lower than Tesla's so Tesla is going to be our highest play which makes sense like on 200,000 if you can make 10K a month you kidding me 10K a month is like more than most people make per month and $200,000 I don't think is unreasonable at all to make 10 $10,000 per month so Nvidia right now is actually lower implied volatility and therefore when I go over this example when I go over 130 if I do like uh it's actually going to be about 17 contracts yep 17 contracts um you're going to make about 4250 per month so on the covered call side let me go through the covered calls so this is about 4K and then if you already had invid and you were to do a sell call let's go for the 139 45 Delta is pretty high but again we don't care if we lose a stock this video is just going to assume that you just want High income to retire you need that income you're going to be using it for your needs right so you don't mind getting that income so the 139 strike here has a 45 Delta implied volatility here so here it is going for $5 um but you also have some upsides so we're going to go basically $4 up right nvidia's current price is 136 thereabouts so at $1 139 that's going to be $3 of upside plus $5 of Premium so that's $8 $8 you know is pretty good that's $800 on on 13 Grand so again if I go for 17 contracts here all right 17 contracts uh this will be a lot of money this will be about 8,500 plus some upside so it's 4 to 10 grand right why is it that wide guys well it's because option trading isn't like it's not a job you can't get $7,500 per month 12 months in a row some months are going to be 6K some months are going to be 10K my month's 400k as as my portfolio grows bigger I see a lot of people that say I can never get there you can get there it's just a matter of time just I'm farther along in the journey than you are that's okay it take it just takes time you'll also get there if you stick to this game so I mean the results are going to vary but give or take on $200,000 if you make 4% it's like 8 Grand and all you have to do is just sell puts to get in I would say 30 Delta and then on the covered call side you are going to go a little bit higher so you can go for 35 or 40 Delta it actually depends on on yourself like it is a case by case basis that is why I do one-on-one coaching it's because I'm not only doing my live trading and giving trades and covering questions and going over technical analysis and fundamental analysis I also do one-on-one coaching because it varies on people's situations like if you want to retire your risk level is going to be different from someone else's risk level your time Horizon is also going to be different so that's why I do one-on-one coaching obviously you can check that out if you want and if you don't want to totally fine just wanted to point that out so look a couple more tricks I want to go over before I wrap up the video adjusting your risk and reward is really easy here and I just showed you three examples spy Nvidia and Tesla look at the implied volatility pay attention to it the higher the implied volatility the riskier it is right however you also want to pay attention to RSI and the bowling band if the RSI is under 40 that's a good indicator that the stock is not necessarily oversold but it's it's much better than buying at a 52e high the lower the RSI the better all right so you want to jump in by selling puts and beginning the wheel strategy now if a stock is at a 52 we high I would honestly probably not trade that stock just because if you think about it a stock that's already expensive using the wheel strategy which is a bullish strategy can be a little bit dangerous it's not a bulletproof strategy there is no bulletproof strategy and that's a lie right every single option has its pros and has its cons all right being whatever there's everything has a pro and con in life there is no nothing is like necessarily like good and nothing's necessarily bad it's just how we think about things and there's trade-offs and everything right being rich and famous can have cons right being poor can have Pros same thing with each strategy it just you know the wheel strategy has cons the con is when the market goes down the wheel strategy suffers however it doesn't suffer more than a regular stock strategy so if you're looking to retire it's still make sense to have a 100% option portfolio that might sound crazy to you but it's actually safer than stocks so it's literally

positions for the most part I have some other strategies some are for fun some are for teaching but if it was up to me I could be fine with just 100% wheel right I know it's easier for me to say I get it I have a 7figure portfolio but if I had 200k I would still run majority of the portfolio in just the wheel strategy using a combination of some ETFs actually xlk and XL Y is also good xlk is the tech uh spider tech ETF and then XL Y is the consumer discretionary ETF you can look into those as well in this market there's you know I think ETFs are are good because they save you a lot of time

with options you don't you can make a lot of money Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta all these stocks fantastic stocks and in my video the other day I mentioned how we are in a very bullish Market there is a lot of money to be made so look with um the wheel strategy and running it on spy I said in my little short one minute summary that you can go 30 days in 27 Delta so let's go sell a put option I'm going're going to show you how this works so sell put let's go for 30 days right so that's going to be basically basically into January basically going into the new year so spy January okay I would let's let's take a look and see a 27 Delta here 587 27 dels okay 587 that was really close I picked 586 587 uh here has $400 now let me explain this is going to be in the lower end of returns and then I'll tell you how to get higher and higher returns with the wheel strategy on the lower end of things if you just want that safe passive income and you're kind of retired and you're just busy you won't be able to probably produce look $400 on 50 50k so on 200k you're only going to produce about $1,600 a month all right so that's on the low end of things but I will explain that when you're selling puts the put selling portion is the lower return portion on the covered calls you can make about double all right let me let me show you an example how that looks like so here you know in a

side if I go to sell call let's say that you got a sign at 600 right so you got a sign for 600 if I were to sell like the 602 right here um which is very close to the money and I'll say Hey you will lose a stock or the ETF if it goes into the money but we don't really care because the whole the whole goal here right is that we're just trying to create a lot of income into retirement that that's really it guys we're trying to create income into retirement that's the goal of of this video is to show you how you can run the wheel strategy and just the wheel strategy you can literally Go 100% wheel strategy on spy or single stock so to finish up this spy example the put side of things would only create about $1,600 of income now the covered call side of things would create a little bit more income so we made about $400 un covered calls it's about 700 or so plus you get $2 of upside let's say this you know the etf's at 600 it goes to 602 so you get two plus you know about seven so it's $9 right so we got 400 to sell puts and now we get now 900 an upside for the covered call side of things right so $900 on the 50k or so you know if you multiply that by four you get at 3600 so you can make between 1,800 on the bottom end to 3600 okay so 1,800 to 3600 on just spy I think that's a pretty good monthly income for having 200k right most people can't figure out how to make income it's pretty easy on spy now if you want to create more income and you actually want to have that you know $8,000 Mark $99,000 $10,000 Mark you're going to have to use single stocks okay because you know going 30 days out in 27 Delta on spy is going to produce 2% per month in income or so 1 and a half 2% but if you want to get to the four 5% Mark or I honestly these past couple of months I'm at the 10% Mark it's it's just ridiculous I'm making money hand over fist just hand over fist and all these stocks guys you know bicep over tricep as I say but look I think that spy is an okay start if you have a bigger portfolio but if you're at 200k you're going to want to use the single stocks that I'm about to cover right now before I cover the single stocks let me just go through my notes real quick I want you to know that selling monthly options is probably the best although I have seen a lot of successful people go for two and three Monon options because they're busy professionals I work with a lot of Engineers doctors lawyers nurses accountants Etc these folks have jobs they're busy and they don't even have a lot of time to go on my live calls they don't even have a lot of time to really trade okay and that's okay because you can just set these positions and forget about them two months out three months out so I want to say that you can retire using the wheel strategy either you can create weekly income if you have more time and you have more desire or you can go for that monthly and two months out and three months out expirations right other thing I wanted to say is this strategy allows for consistent monthly income and for me that is probably my favorite right every single month I I like to get income I don't like to do weekly I also don't like to do two to three months either so I think this is a really reliable way to turn savings into cash flow into retirement so of course S&P 500 is is high quality but if you really want to get that bigger income let's go over some examples in my portfolio so um my videos are unscripted so I'm just going to go through a couple of examples here by the way let's just go to my total return I just want to show you guys that I've been doing pretty well a lot of my positions are are going for a good win right now let's go into something like a Chipotle okay I think that chipotle is going to be the next level of volatility it's not high volatility by no means like if we go look at this option right here the implied volatility is 29 so to be honest with you this is just only a little bit more I guess risky than S&P 5 00 it is a single stock so it is definitely more risky but the volatility is not that that much higher all right so if I were to go to sell put and that's how you get started in the wheel strategy real quick I have a whole wheel strategy course here my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff my free content here on YouTube is basically everything that you need to really level up your option trading my free stuff is better than people's discords it's better than people's boot camps and better than people's coaching so I try to give you guys everything as much as possible for free um because that's that's my mission that's my goal and I 100% believe in that and I've seen iten happen over and over folks are making full-time income look sell sellp put well January 17th will be 50 days out let's go for January 3rd about 30 days out and if I were to sell I would go for about a 30 Delta so let's go here that's 18 Delta that's way too low huh that's interesting okay 30 Del right here so on this position right here let's go and let's put $200,000 to work let's just say hypothetically that we want to put all $200,000 to work all right so if I go for 20 contracts here let's go for 35 contracts that's 212,000 roughly let's go for 36 contracts $212,000 here you're going to make $3,000 a month right for selling puts and then once you get assigned you can expect about double all right like I just showed you in the Spy example when you sell a covered call you typically have a bit of upside okay and the covered call can be closer to the money so here $3,000 okay let me just show you if you had already been assigned on Chipotle and it's currently at 62 you can go for something like 63 so this will give you a dollar of upside plus 145 so this right here would be a lot more attractive obviously on the cover callide because you have some upside on the stock itself so this right here would probably be $3 to $4,000 a month thereabouts right it depends on volatility depends on market conditions so that is the next level so you can go from Spy which is 1,800 to 3600 to to something like a like a Chipotle which is like fairly low low risk and that would be between like three 3 to 4K okay so that would be a bit higher there now let me go to something like a Tesla all right so now Tesla would get you a lot closer to that really big income okay and by the way I think you need to have a combination of all these things you need to have some spy you need to have some safer stocks you need to have some riskier stocks it's just a combination of things that I think is really important so let's go for January 3rd again okay and for Tesla I'm pretty bullish so if you are bullish personally like I'm bullish on Tesla you can go for a little bit higher Delta remember the Delta is just a give and take relationship the higher the Delta the higher chances are that you will get assigned okay and the lower the Delta is you know essentially the lower chance you'll get a sign however the higher the Delta the more you get paid the lower Delta the less you get so it's all about uh risk and return it's a it's a clear trade-off so 320 if I were to sell a put I'm going to go a little bit higher on the Delta all right the implied volatility volatility here is 50 so 50 is obviously better than the 29 that we just saw for Chipotle so this this position right here is going to be uh a lot more lucrative it's going to be a lot more lucrative for for selling options and running the wheel strategy so if I were to do five here that's 150k 7 this would be about 212k so you can see here how on the sell puts I would already make almost 10 ,000 okay on the covered call side of things you can make you know this strategy can produce1 to $15,000 a month obviously it depends on the market and the in the wheel strategy is not a perfectly Flawless strategy there is no such thing as a perfectly Flawless strategy but I'll tell you how to manage it all right let me go through my notes here basically the way that you would manage this strategy is first of all you have to pick stocks that you like I always say that in my videos if you're not trading stocks that you like if you don't know why you own a stock I will challenge you that you don't even know how to invest you don't know what you're doing a lot of people are into like the micro strategy or the smci stuff I believe those YouTubers that are covering these stocks are kind of on the scammy side of things because I don't like the hype the reason why YouTubers cover hype is for views I mean Everyone likes views on YouTube but I'm not going to disregard what I actually believe to be true and for me I would always recommend do not go for hype go for safe highquality companies spy would be the safest side and then the middle you know would be your craft hind would be some American Airlines it would be you know your utilities your financials like your Banks and JP Morgan and and Bank of America stuff like that and then on the higher side of things I I'll show you one more example on Nvidia it would be your your Tesla your Nvidia the Palante tier the higher risk stuff that I've covered that has absolutely paid off all right it's it's absolutely paid off we've been making money hand over fist bicep over tricep as I like to say uh we've been doing fantastic so I hope that your guys pockets is like full of money and then yeah you're just happy so look with 212,00 or you know let's say $250,000 um you can make a full-time income selling options and just looking at these positions right here on Tesla I think that it is a it's an absolute no-brainer to to run this on Tesla now you can also run this on on a stock like Nvidia Nvidia is also going to have high volatility and when you go for a higher volatility stock that's really good because it makes Financial Freedom a lot easier you can make a full-time income with 212,000 or 250,000 basically in around 200 to 300 K range because we're going to disregard you know 4% per year typical standard rule you can make 4% a month when you can make 4% a month on 2 to 300K that's what really brings you to that $10,000 a month Mark right so for my portfolio I I'm okay with even just you know a little bit less I don't even go for it's kind of hard to say because lately I've been making like 10% so in the last like month I made like $400,000 or so and that's what pushed me over the $4 million Mark so you know it just varies but I'll say that as you scale it just get it's easier and easier but don't be discouraged if you have you know 50k 100K it just takes time to scale right it's it's a journey but I want to say that the typical Financial rules out there you got to you guys got to fire a financial adviser all right I mean you can hire me as a one-on-one coach I'm going to be much better than financial adviser that just takes 1% of your money every year or you know it really is so simple or just watch my free stuff right you can make a lot of money by just running the wheel strategy and you don't need to have like this million dollar account to really hit some retirement figures right money is is actually not as hard as most people think it's it's not right so I'll talk about managing and everything like that I just want to go over Nvidia I want to show you I have you know 500 shares of Nvidia but let me just show you how I would run the wheel strategy on Nvidia so you'll go to sell put and again I'm going to go for the same for the same expiration I'm going to go for about 30 days out or so and I will go for the 130 strike that is a 31 Delta actually nvidia's implied volatility is lower than Tesla's so Tesla is going to be our highest play which makes sense like on 200,000 if you can make 10K a month you kidding me 10K a month is like more than most people make per month and $200,000 I don't think is unreasonable at all to make 10 $10,000 per month so Nvidia right now is actually lower implied volatility and therefore when I go over this example when I go over 130 if I do like uh it's actually going to be about 17 contracts yep 17 contracts um you're going to make about 4250 per month so on the covered call side let me go through the covered calls so this is about 4K and then if you already had invid and you were to do a sell call let's go for the 139 45 Delta is pretty high but again we don't care if we lose a stock this video is just going to assume that you just want High income to retire you need that income you're going to be using it for your needs right so you don't mind getting that income so the 139 strike here has a 45 Delta implied volatility here so here it is going for $5 um but you also have some upsides so we're going to go basically $4 up right nvidia's current price is 136 thereabouts so at $1 139 that's going to be $3 of upside plus $5 of Premium so that's $8 $8 you know is pretty good that's $800 on on 13 Grand so again if I go for 17 contracts here all right 17 contracts uh this will be a lot of money this will be about 8,500 plus some upside so it's 4 to 10 grand right why is it that wide guys well it's because option trading isn't like it's not a job you can't get $7,500 per month 12 months in a row some months are going to be 6K some months are going to be 10K my month's 400k as as my portfolio grows bigger I see a lot of people that say I can never get there you can get there it's just a matter of time just I'm farther along in the journey than you are that's okay it take it just takes time you'll also get there if you stick to this game so I mean the results are going to vary but give or take on $200,000 if you make 4% it's like 8 Grand and all you have to do is just sell puts to get in I would say 30 Delta and then on the covered call side you are going to go a little bit higher so you can go for 35 or 40 Delta it actually depends on on yourself like it is a case by case basis that is why I do one-on-one coaching it's because I'm not only doing my live trading and giving trades and covering questions and going over technical analysis and fundamental analysis I also do one-on-one coaching because it varies on people's situations like if you want to retire your risk level is going to be different from someone else's risk level your time Horizon is also going to be different so that's why I do one-on-one coaching obviously you can check that out if you want and if you don't want to totally fine just wanted to point that out so look a couple more tricks I want to go over before I wrap up the video adjusting your risk and reward is really easy here and I just showed you three examples spy Nvidia and Tesla look at the implied volatility pay attention to it the higher the implied volatility the riskier it is right however you also want to pay attention to RSI and the bowling band if the RSI is under 40 that's a good indicator that the stock is not necessarily oversold but it's it's much better than buying at a 52e high the lower the RSI the better all right so you want to jump in by selling puts and beginning the wheel strategy now if a stock is at a 52 we high I would honestly probably not trade that stock just because if you think about it a stock that's already expensive using the wheel strategy which is a bullish strategy can be a little bit dangerous it's not a bulletproof strategy there is no bulletproof strategy and that's a lie right every single option has its pros and has its cons all right being whatever there's everything has a pro and con in life there is no nothing is like necessarily like good and nothing's necessarily bad it's just how we think about things and there's trade-offs and everything right being rich and famous can have cons right being poor can have Pros same thing with each strategy it just you know the wheel strategy has cons the con is when the market goes down the wheel strategy suffers however it doesn't suffer more than a regular stock strategy so if you're looking to retire it's still make sense to have a 100% option portfolio that might sound crazy to you but it's actually safer than stocks so it's literally safer so having a 100% option portfolio is what I would do and I would use the wheel strategy to essentially retire and that's essentially what I've done I'm just running the wheel strategy with my positions for the most part I have some other strategies some are for fun some are for teaching but if it was up to me I could be fine with just 100% wheel right I know it's easier for me to say I get it I have a 7figure portfolio but if I had 200k I would still run majority of the portfolio in just the wheel strategy using a combination of some ETFs actually xlk and XL Y is also good xlk is the tech uh spider tech ETF and then XL Y is the consumer discretionary ETF you can look into those as well in this market there's you know I think ETFs are are good because they save you a lot of time and they have built- in diversification",1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,BdAalfGEON8,2024-11-29T20:30:00Z,"RETIRE EARLY ON JUST $212,000 With The Wheel Strategy on THESE Stocks",Netflix,"those stocks are going to be ones that I covered in this channel Nvidia paler but you can also use other tech stocks so that could be meta that could be Netflix and actually any stock that has an RSI that's under about 40 is a really good candidate to begin running the wheel strategy or if the stock is towards the bottom end of the bowling or band because when you're running the wheel strategy what you want to do is you want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that is fairly cheap okay you don't want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that's at a 52 we High which is kind of difficult in this market which you know that was my short summary but if you have time let me explain to you you how to actually implement this all right so see you later if you don't have any time and now if you have some time let me go into the specifics so look I want to debunk the myth and I want to completely change the the 4% rule okay the 4% rule states this and you guys might may have heard of it the 4% rule is you can take out 4% per year in income when you're retired which is a bunch of BS to be honest if you're running the wheel strategy I can make 4% a month okay a month not a year so it doesn't make any sense to me that's that's why I like options so with the $200,000 portfolio $222,000 as I said in the title I think this is a really good position because 4% is essentially approaching the $9,000 Mark which is going to be six figures per year and I think that's a really good income Source right so you can really retire or have a full-time income or a really strong secondary source of income now I quickly want to say that in my experience I've been running the wheel strategy since I had 100K okay when I had 100K in my portfolio I I just start to really focus on the wheel strategy and I did a little bit early but I left my corporate job when I had 100K which is maybe a little bit ear um let me show you on spy I'm going to start off with the safest ETF I'm going to get riskier and riskier and then how to really capitalize and make four five even more perc per month so portfolio is at 4 million I guess our next Target is 5 million I've been doing very well and very happy and very blessed so spy all right I do have a position here I have a pretty sizable position and I um or actually running the wheel strategy as I mentioned all right so look let me explain to you what Spy is and why you would want to use it spy is going to be on the safer side of things spy is safer because it's an ETF that has 500 company companies in it essentially when I was getting my degree Finance everyone talked about beating S&P 500 and that's because this Benchmark is truly difficult to beat it is truly hard to beat for for the average investor and even many hedge funds do not beat the S&P 500 so it truly is a very interesting metric to look at now the S&P has all the sectors in it like technology consumer cyclicals consumer services consumer defensive utilities real estate energy Industrials Healthcare and financial services all right so this ETF has the top holding is Apple which I have a huge position in and I always say on this channel like you don't need to have the hottest stocks to make good money with options you don't you can make a lot of money Apple Nvidia Microsoft Amazon meta all these stocks fantastic stocks and in my video the other day I mentioned how we are in a very bullish Market there is a lot of money to be made so look with um the wheel strategy and running it on spy I said in my little short one minute summary that you can go 30 days in 27 Delta so let's go sell a put option I'm going're going to show you how this works so sell put let's go for 30 days right so that's going to be basically basically into January basically going into the new year so spy January okay I would let's let's take a look and see a 27 Delta here 587 27 dels okay 587 that was really close I picked 586 587 uh here has $400 now let me explain this is going to be in the lower end of returns and then I'll tell you how to get higher and higher returns with the wheel strategy on the lower end of things if you just want that safe passive income and you're kind of retired and you're just busy you won't be able to probably produce look $400 on 50 50k so on 200k you're only going to produce about $1,600 a month all right so that's on the low end of things but I will explain that when you're selling puts the put selling portion is the lower return portion on the covered calls you can make about double all right let me let me show you an example how that looks like so here you know in a month it's $400 but on 200k it'be $1,600 per month nothing really that big right nothing really that big however on the covered call side and before we get into the single stocks on the covered call side if I go to sell call let's say that you got a sign at 600 right so you got a sign for 600 if I were to sell like the 602 right here um which is very close to the money and I'll say Hey you will lose a stock or the ETF if it goes into the money but we don't really care because the whole the whole goal here right is that we're just trying to create a lot of income into retirement that that's really it guys we're trying to create income into retirement that's the goal of of this video is to show you how you can run the wheel strategy and just the wheel strategy you can literally Go 100% wheel strategy on spy or single stock so to finish up this spy example the put side of things would only create about $1,600 of income now the covered call side of things would create a little bit more income so we made about $400 un covered calls it's about 700 or so plus you get $2 of upside let's say this you know the etf's at 600 it goes to 602 so you get two plus you know about seven so it's $9 right so we got 400 to sell puts and now we get now 900 an upside for the covered call side of things right so $900 on the 50k or so you know if you multiply that by four you get at 3600 so you can make between 1,800 on the bottom end to 3600 okay so 1,800 to 3600 on just spy I think that's a pretty good monthly income for having 200k right most people can't figure out how to make income it's pretty easy on spy now if you want to create more income and you actually want to have that you know $8,000 Mark $99,000 $10,000 Mark you're going to have to use single stocks okay because you know going 30 days out in 27 Delta on spy is going to produce 2% per month in income or so 1 and a half 2% but if you want to get to the four 5% Mark or I honestly these past couple of months I'm at the 10% Mark it's it's just ridiculous I'm making money hand over fist just hand over fist and all these stocks guys you know bicep over tricep as I say but look I think that spy is an okay start if you have a bigger portfolio but if you're at 200k you're going to want to use the single stocks that I'm about to cover right now before I cover the single stocks let me just go through my notes real quick I want you to know that selling monthly options is probably the best although I have seen a lot of successful people go for two and three Monon options because they're busy professionals I work with a lot of Engineers doctors lawyers nurses accountants Etc these folks have jobs they're busy and they don't even have a lot of time to go on my live calls they don't even have a lot of time to really trade okay and that's okay because you can just set these positions and forget about them two months out three months out so I want to say that you can retire using the wheel strategy either you can create weekly income if you have more time and you have more desire or you can go for that monthly and two months out and three months out expirations right other thing I wanted to say is this strategy allows for consistent monthly income and for me that is probably my favorite right every single month I I like to get income I don't like to do weekly I also don't like to do two to three months either so I think this is a really reliable way to turn savings into cash flow into retirement so of course S&P 500 is is high quality but if you really want to get that bigger income let's go over some examples in my portfolio so um my videos are unscripted so I'm just going to go through a couple of examples here by the way let's just go to my total return I just want to show you guys that I've been doing pretty well a lot of my positions are are going for a good win right now let's go into something like a Chipotle okay I think that chipotle is going to be the next level of volatility it's not high volatility by no means like if we go look at this option right here the implied volatility is 29 so to be honest with you this is just only a little bit more I guess risky than S&P 5 00 it is a single stock so it is definitely more risky but the volatility is not that that much higher all right so if I were to go to sell put and that's how you get started in the wheel strategy real quick I have a whole wheel strategy course here my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff my free content here on YouTube is basically everything that you need to really level up your option trading my free stuff is better than people's discords it's better than people's boot camps and better than people's coaching so I try to give you guys everything as much as possible for free um because that's that's my mission that's my goal and I 100% believe in that and I've seen iten happen over and over folks are making full-time income look sell sellp put well January 17th will be 50 days out let's go for January 3rd about 30 days out and if I were to sell I would go for about a 30 Delta so let's go here that's 18 Delta that's way too low huh that's interesting okay 30 Del right here so on this position right here let's go and let's put $200,000 to work let's just say hypothetically that we want to put all $200,000 to work all right so if I go for 20 contracts here let's go for 35 contracts that's 212,000 roughly let's go for 36 contracts $212,000 here you're going to make $3,000 a month right for selling puts and then once you get assigned you can expect about double all right like I just showed you in the Spy example when you sell a covered call you typically have a bit of upside okay and the covered call can be closer to the money so here $3,000 okay let me just show you if you had already been assigned on Chipotle and it's currently at 62 you can go for something like 63 so this will give you a dollar of upside plus 145 so this right here would be a lot more attractive obviously on the cover callide because you have some upside on the stock itself so this right here would probably be $3 to $4,000 a month thereabouts right it depends on volatility depends on market conditions so that is the next level so you can go from Spy which is 1,800 to 3600 to to something like a like a Chipotle which is like fairly low low risk and that would be between like three 3 to 4K okay so that would be a bit higher there now let me go to something like a Tesla all right so now Tesla would get you a lot closer to that really big income okay and by the way I think you need to have a combination of all these things you need to have some spy you need to have some safer stocks you need to have some riskier stocks it's just a combination of things that I think is really important so let's go for January 3rd again okay and for Tesla I'm pretty bullish so if you are bullish personally like I'm bullish on Tesla you can go for a little bit higher Delta remember the Delta is just a give and take relationship the higher the Delta the higher chances are that you will get assigned okay and the lower the Delta is you know essentially the lower chance you'll get a sign however the higher the Delta the more you get paid the lower Delta the less you get so it's all about uh risk and return it's a it's a clear trade-off so 320 if I were to sell a put I'm going to go a little bit higher on the Delta all right the implied volatility volatility here is 50 so 50 is obviously better than the 29 that we just saw for Chipotle so this this position right here is going to be uh a lot more lucrative it's going to be a lot more lucrative for for selling options and running the wheel strategy so if I were to do five here that's 150k 7 this would be about 212k so you can see here how on the sell puts I would already make almost 10 ,000 okay on the covered call side of things you can make you know this strategy can produce1 to $15,000 a month obviously it depends on the market and the in the wheel strategy is not a perfectly Flawless strategy there is no such thing as a perfectly Flawless strategy but I'll tell you how to manage it all right let me go through my notes here basically the way that you would manage this strategy is first of all you have to pick stocks that you like I always say that in my videos if you're not trading stocks that you like if you

YouTube but I'm not going to disregard what I actually believe to be true and for me I would always recommend do not go for hype go for safe highquality companies spy would be the safest side and then the middle you know would be your craft hind would be some American Airlines it would be you know your utilities your financials like your Banks and JP Morgan and and Bank of America stuff like that and then on the higher side of things I I'll show you one more example on Nvidia it would be your your Tesla your Nvidia the Palante tier the higher risk stuff that I've covered that has absolutely paid off all right it's it's absolutely paid off we've been making money hand over fist bicep over tricep as I like to say uh we've been doing fantastic so I hope that your guys pockets is like full of money and then yeah you're just happy so look with 212,00 or you know let's say $250,000 um you can make a full-time income selling options and just looking at these positions right here on Tesla I think that it is a it's an absolute no-brainer to to run this on Tesla now you can also run this on on a stock like Nvidia Nvidia is also going to have high volatility and when you go for a higher volatility stock that's really good because it makes Financial Freedom a lot easier you can make a full-time income with 212,000 or 250,000 basically in around 200 to 300 K range because we're going to disregard you know 4% per year typical standard rule you can make 4% a month when you can make 4% a month on 2 to 300K that's what really brings you to that $10,000 a month Mark right so for my portfolio I I'm okay with even just you know a little bit less I don't even go for it's kind of hard to say because lately I've been making like 10% so in the last like month I made like $400,000 or so and that's what pushed me over the $4 million Mark so you know it just varies but I'll say that as you scale it just get it's easier and easier but don't be discouraged if you have you know 50k 100K it just takes time to scale right it's it's a journey but I want to say that the typical Financial rules out there you got to you guys got to fire a financial adviser all right I mean you can hire me as a one-on-one coach I'm going to be much better than financial adviser that just takes 1% of your money every year or you know it really is so simple or just watch my free stuff right you can make a lot of money by just running the wheel strategy and you don't need to have like this million dollar account to really hit some retirement figures right money is is actually not as hard as

kidding me 10K a month is like more than most people make per month and $200,000 I don't think is unreasonable at all to make 10 $10,000 per month so Nvidia right now is actually lower implied volatility and therefore when I go over this example when I go over 130 if I do like uh it's actually going to be about 17 contracts yep 17 contracts um you're going to make about 4250 per month so on the covered call side let me go through the covered calls so this is about 4K and then if you already had invid and you were to do a sell call let's go for the 139 45 Delta is pretty high but again we don't care if we lose a stock this video is just going to assume that you just want High income to retire you need that income you're going to be using it for your needs right so you don't mind getting that income so the 139 strike here has a 45 Delta implied volatility here so here it is going for $5 um but you also have some upsides so we're going to go basically $4 up right nvidia's current price is 136 thereabouts so at $1 139 that's going to be $3 of upside plus $5 of Premium so that's $8 $8 you know is pretty good that's $800 on on 13 Grand so again if I go for 17 contracts here all right 17 contracts uh this will be a lot of money this will be about 8,500 plus some upside so it's 4 to 10 grand right why is it that wide guys well it's because option trading isn't like it's not a job you can't get $7,500 per month 12 months in a row some months are going to be 6K some months are going to be 10K my month's 400k as as my portfolio grows bigger I see a lot of people that say I can never get there you can get there it's just a matter of time just I'm farther along in the journey than you are that's okay it take it just takes time you'll also get there if you stick to this game so I mean the results are going to vary but give or take on $200,000 if you make 4% it's like 8 Grand and all you have to do is just sell puts to get in I would say 30 Delta and then on the covered call side you are going to go a little bit higher so you can go for 35 or 40 Delta it actually depends on on yourself like it is a case by case basis that is why I do one-on-one coaching it's because I'm not only doing my live trading and giving trades and covering questions and going over technical analysis and fundamental analysis I also do one-on-one coaching because it varies on people's situations like if you want to retire your risk level is going to be different from someone else's risk level your time Horizon is also going to be different so that's why I do one-on-one coaching obviously you can check that out if you want and if you don't want to totally fine just wanted to point that out so look a couple more tricks I want to go over before I wrap up the video adjusting your risk and reward is really easy here and I just showed you three examples spy Nvidia and Tesla look at the implied volatility pay attention to it the higher the implied volatility the riskier it is right however you also want to pay attention to RSI and the bowling band if the RSI is under 40 that's a good indicator that the stock is not necessarily oversold but it's it's much better than buying at a 52e high the lower the RSI the better all right so you want to jump in by selling puts and beginning the wheel strategy now if a stock is at a 52 we high I would honestly probably not trade that stock just because if you think about it a stock that's already expensive using the wheel strategy which is a bullish strategy can be a little bit dangerous it's not a bulletproof strategy there is no bulletproof strategy and that's a lie right every single option has its pros and has its cons all right being whatever there's everything has a pro and con in life there is no nothing is like necessarily like good and nothing's necessarily bad it's just how we think about things and there's trade-offs and everything right being rich and famous can have cons right being poor can have Pros same thing with each strategy it just you know the wheel strategy has cons the con is when the market goes down the wheel strategy suffers however it doesn't suffer more than a regular stock strategy so if you're looking to retire it's still make sense to have a 100% option portfolio that might sound crazy to you but it's actually safer than stocks so it's literally safer so having a 100% option portfolio is what I would do and I would use the wheel strategy to essentially retire and that's essentially what I've done I'm just running the wheel strategy with my positions for the most part I have some other strategies some are for fun some are for teaching but if it was up to me I could be fine with just 100% wheel right I know it's easier for me to say I get it I have a 7figure portfolio but if I had 200k I would still run majority of the portfolio in just the wheel strategy using a combination of some ETFs actually xlk and XL Y is also good xlk is the tech uh spider tech ETF and then XL Y is the consumer discretionary ETF you can look into those as well in this market there's you know I think ETFs are are good because they save you a lot of time and they have built- in diversification",1.0,0.6

Invest with Henry,BdAalfGEON8,2024-11-29T20:30:00Z,"RETIRE EARLY ON JUST $212,000 With The Wheel Strategy on THESE Stocks",Chipotle,"let's go into something like a Chipotle okay I think that chipotle is going to be the next level of volatility it's not high volatility by no means like if we go look at this option right here the implied volatility is 29 so to be honest with you this is just only a little bit more I guess risky than S&P 5 00 it is a single stock so it is definitely more risky but the volatility is not that that much higher all right so if I were to go to sell put and that's how you get started in the wheel strategy real quick I have a whole wheel strategy course here my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff my free content here on YouTube is basically everything that you need to really level up your option trading my free stuff is better than people's discords it's better than people's boot camps and better than people's coaching so I try to give you guys everything as much as possible for free um because that's that's my mission that's my goal and I 100% believe in that and I've seen iten happen over and over folks are making full-time income look sell sellp put well January 17th will be 50 days out let's go for January 3rd about 30 days out and if I were to sell I would go for about a 30 Delta so let's go here that's 18 Delta that's way too low huh that's interesting okay 30 Del right here so on this position right here let's go and let's put $200,000 to work let's just say hypothetically that we want to put all $200,000 to work all right so if I go for 20 contracts here let's go for 35 contracts that's 212,000 roughly let's go for 36 contracts $212,000 here you're going to make $3,000 a month right for selling puts and then once you get assigned you can expect about double all right like I just showed you in the Spy example when you sell a covered call you typically have a bit of upside okay and the covered call can be closer to the money so here $3,000 okay let me just show you if you had already been assigned on Chipotle and it's currently at 62 you can go for something like 63 so this will give you a dollar of upside plus 145 so this right here would be a lot more attractive obviously on the cover callide because you have some upside on the stock itself so this right here would probably be $3 to $4,000 a month thereabouts right it depends on volatility depends on market conditions so that is the next level so you can go from Spy which is 1,800 to 3600 to to something like a like a Chipotle which is like fairly low low risk and that would be between like three 3 to 4K okay so that would be a bit higher there",1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,BdAalfGEON8,2024-11-29T20:30:00Z,"RETIRE EARLY ON JUST $212,000 With The Wheel Strategy on THESE Stocks",Tesla,"now let me go to something like a Tesla all right so now Tesla would get you a lot closer to that really big income okay and by the way I think you need to have a combination of all these things you need to have some spy you need to have some safer stocks you need to have some riskier stocks it's just a combination of things that I think is really important so let's go for January 3rd again okay and for Tesla I'm pretty bullish so if you are bullish personally like I'm bullish on Tesla you can go for a little bit higher Delta remember the Delta is just a give and take relationship the higher the Delta the higher chances are that you will get assigned okay and the lower the Delta is you know essentially the lower chance you'll get a sign however the higher the Delta the more you get paid the lower Delta the less you get so it's all about uh risk and return it's a it's a clear trade-off so 320 if I were to sell a put I'm going to go a little bit higher on the Delta all right the implied volatility volatility here is 50 so 50 is obviously better than the 29 that we just saw for Chipotle so this this position right here is going to be uh a lot more lucrative it's going to be a lot more lucrative for for selling options and running the wheel strategy so if I were to do five here that's 150k 7 this would be about 212k so you can see here how on the sell puts I would already make almost 10 ,000 okay on the covered call side of things you can make you know this strategy can produce1 to $15,000 a month obviously it depends on the market and the in the wheel strategy is not a perfectly Flawless strategy there is no such thing as a perfectly Flawless strategy but I'll tell you how to manage it all right let me go through my notes here basically the way that you would manage this strategy is first of all you have to pick stocks that you like I always say that in my videos if you're not trading stocks that you like if you don't know why you own a stock I will challenge you that you don't even know how to invest you don't know what you're doing a lot of people are into like the micro strategy or the smci stuff I believe those YouTubers that are covering these stocks are kind of on the scammy side of things because I don't like the hype the reason why YouTubers cover hype is for views I mean Everyone likes views on YouTube but I'm not going to disregard what I actually believe to be true and for me I would always recommend do not go for hype go for safe highquality companies spy would be the safest side and then the middle you know would be your craft hind would be some American Airlines it would be you know your utilities your financials like your Banks and JP Morgan and and Bank of America stuff like that and then on the higher side of things I I'll show you one more example on Nvidia it would be your your Tesla your Nvidia the Palante tier the higher risk stuff that I've covered that has absolutely paid off all right it's it's absolutely paid off we've been making money hand over fist bicep over tricep as I like to say uh we've been doing fantastic so I hope that your guys pockets is like full of money and then yeah you're just happy so look with 212,00 or you know let's say $250,000 um you can make a full-time income selling options and just looking at these positions right here on Tesla I think that it is a it's an absolute no-brainer to to run this on Tesla now you can also run this on on a stock like Nvidia Nvidia is also going to have high volatility and when you go for a higher volatility stock that's really good because it makes Financial Freedom a lot easier you can make a full-time income with 212,000 or 250,000 basically in around 200 to 300 K range because we're going to disregard you know 4% per year typical standard rule you can make 4% a month when you can make 4% a month on 2 to 300K that's what really brings you to that $10,000 a month Mark right so for my portfolio I I'm okay with even just you know a little bit less I don't even go for it's kind of hard to say because lately I've been making like 10% so in the last like month I made like $400,000 or so and that's what pushed me over the $4 million Mark so you know it just varies but I'll say that as you scale it just get it's easier and easier but don't be discouraged if you have you know 50k 100K it just takes time to scale right it's it's a journey but I want to say that the typical Financial rules out there you got to you guys got to fire a financial adviser all right I mean you can hire me as a one-on-one coach I'm going to be much better than financial adviser that just takes 1% of your money every year or you know it really is so simple or just watch my free stuff right you can make a lot of money by just running the wheel strategy and you don't need to have like this million dollar account to really hit some retirement figures right money is is actually not as hard as most people think it's it's not right so I'll talk about managing and everything like that I just want to go over Nvidia I want to show you I have you know 500 shares of Nvidia but let me just show you how I would run the wheel strategy on Nvidia so you'll go to sell put and again I'm going to go for the same for the same expiration I'm going to go for about 30 days out or so and I will go for the 130 strike that is a 31 Delta actually nvidia's implied volatility is lower than Tesla's so Tesla is going to be our highest play which makes sense like on 200,000 if you can make 10K a month you kidding me 10K a month is like more than most people make per month and $200,000 I don't think is unreasonable at all to make 10 $10,000 per month so Nvidia right now is actually lower implied volatility and therefore when I go over this example when I go over 130 if I do like uh it's actually going to be about 17 contracts yep 17 contracts um you're going to make about 4250 per month so on the covered call side let me go through the covered calls so this is about 4K and then if you already had invid and you were to do a sell call let's go for the 139 45 Delta is pretty high but again we don't care if we lose a stock this video is just going to assume that you just want High income to

$8 you know is pretty good that's $800 on on 13 Grand so again if I go for 17 contracts here all right 17 contracts uh this will be a lot of money this will be about 8,500 plus some upside so it's 4 to 10 grand right why is it that wide guys well it's because option trading isn't like it's not a job you can't get $7,500 per month 12 months in a row some months are going to be 6K some months are

I haven't covered meta and I want to make my videos different I don't want to just keep repeating myself so I'm going to cover four kind of different stocks here so first one is meta look look at the meta chart all right we've had meta really you know there's a lot of analysts ratings right here by the way a lot of analysts were raising their price Targets on meta and that actually they're late guys analysts are typically late like look how late they are like the stock already went up and then there was like three analysts back to back they're like oh hold up let me do my job and let me change my price Target you know most of them are are late to the game don't you wish like they were early you know that's that's what I'm trying to recreate here one of the best investors actually I was in Median Columbia and this guy was worth like a hundred million he said you don't have to be smart you just have to be early all right so I'm trying to put you guys in early trends look there was a double top pattern right here on meta here was at 593 then again about 590 look this is not a 10% squeeze on meta per se but if you use options you can almost get a 10% move in the stock let me show you guys what's up in with with meta I don't currently have any meta this is a position I'm thinking about starting because of what I see going on in the stock market and I am making a lot of money on the other plays I I typically talk about but I don't see anything wrong with opening up something like this as well now there's two plays I can show you on meta real quick so look I think we're going to get a squeeze higher so I'm going to show you a small account play and a bigger account play on a bigger account play first I'm going to go to trade meta options you would simply buy 100 shares that would be fairly expensive but hey I have a lot of sixf figure folks that I work with so I would go for something going into the end of the year December 20th that's literally right you know before before Christmas so we're going to get a 23-day move here and I said 10 days but you know we'll make it 3 weeks 21 days or so I'll also have a couple short-term plays as I go through my examples here but look so for meta again we had that double top pattern here at 5 590 is so if I go to around 590 you'll actually see that I can collect about $930 in premium so not only do I get that upside here about $20 or so I also get $9 so I can make around three grand on a short-term move that's going to be about 3 weeks so three grand here is about a 6% return Total return so about six grand on about 50 55k right so the three grand over the 55k is roughly 6% or so so that's a 6% move in 3 weeks here's another play I would do for a smaller portfolio now this is going to be a little bit riskier but if it moves you're going to make so much money look it's going to be 575 okay this option right here has a 51 Delta very high Delta good volume hit ask sprad is okay it's not great um so if you buy the 575 and then you just go ahead and sell another call option to create a bull call spread a bull call spread screen just turned white 7 a.m. for me or 7: a.m. in East Coast but I'm making these videos out in Europe right now 585 if I do a sell call this right here will subsidize the cost of buying the 575 option you can see here how my Max loss is 468 but my Max profit is about 532 so it's roughly betting 500 to make a th000 so this right here will squeeze out a 100% return I guess I'm under promising and overd delivering in this video because you can literally double your money on this play right here I would not do more than 1% of your money on this play though so if you have a 100K portfolio you would just do two contracts here so you would do two contracts where you essentially uh B buy two contracts that's $1,000 worth of risk and then you have 2,000 potential dollars to exit the position so you can turn like 1K into 2K so yeah that's my meta play.",0.98,0.85
Invest with Henry,45292DvRbvw,2024-11-28T14:30:01Z,Top 4 Options I'm Buying NOW (10% in December 2024),Apple,"I have three specific stocks which is snowflake Nvidia and paler these three stocks along with many other tech stocks I'm also going to cover meta I'm going to cover Apple in this video I'm going to cover Sofi these stocks these tech stocks which are really they call them the Magnificent 7 I think there's like 15 of them right now these stocks are going to squeeze higher and in general being in the hottest tech stocks right now is going to be very profitable because I see a short squeeze uh potentially going to happen. now let's go into my Apple play so a lot of you guys lose focus and attention because Apple isn't as sexy as other YouTubers that cover your micro strategies and mcis and all that other nonsense stuff guys I've made more money than everyone else by not doing the nonsense stuff all right cuz I'm not looking to blow up a portfolio if you're watching other channels that cover these crazy stocks it's not my style not my style I'm not into that I'm into just creating safe passive income I say that in a lot of my videos but honestly like I've made crazy money on Apple let me show you my Apple position and let me show you where I think Apple's going to go based on technicals and I'll actually go into some fundamental analysis here I'm going to try to make this video not too long though so Apple 234 I have 4,9 shares this is 28% of my portfolio I have apple at $81.99 per share and apple is actually breaking some limits right now which is what makes me really like the stock on the six-month chart we're about to hit this really key resistance point so look guys what usually happens is there's a psychological level here that investors once it hits a key resistance point if it breaks through which which looks like apple will that's going to change a lot of people's beliefs and a lot of people are going to start jumping into the stock and we're going to see some some really good momentum so if I go to the Chart actually let me show you what the volume looks like because I said for me the the volume is actually you know it's becoming more indicative like look there was a lot of selling pressure here on Apple stock and since then we've been kind of not having much volume but recently I've been seeing a lot of uptrend in more volume and the stock is going up this is a very positive momentum sign that I learned from uh working on Wall Street not at Goldman Sachs this this specific tip I learned basically when I was a Quant analyst working in Philadelphia for a hedge fund so this is some another information that I learned from one of my um experiences and uh the fund I was working at had about $9 billion and Nvidia was actually a play that they had this was a long time ago this I think back in 2017 or so 2017 actually yeah seven years now so look the volume here is really good and the uptrend is very clear I think we're actually going to finally finally you see I drew some lines here not sure what the second line is here maybe that was an accident but this first line here this purple line was my technical analysis where I really thought I drew this a while ago by the way I don't know when I drew it but it was a few months back at this point when I actually entered into Apple to begin with the stock I saw a really clear Trend to 250 per share I was a little bit off but I do think we'll hit 240 per share so given that I think that we're going to finally get to 240 again I'm not I'm not promising anything big I'm ju I just think we're going to get a little bit more of a squeeze because as people come from Thanksgiving everyone's happy you know some people most people are have eaten turkey and stuff like that and everyone's in a Jolly mood I think that there's going to be more money being put put to work plus the the the Dan IES clip that I showed you guys I think we're entering AI Revolution and and apple is part of that even though it's not a standard AI pick like some of the other names like snowflake I'm going to be doing some more research into snowflake because I do have a lot of students that have stock in it so you want me to do analysis on snowflake let me know down in the comment section below look so Apple you know 2 234 I think we're going to get uh 240 on Apple sometime at the end of this year so I'm going to go for a covered call position here for December guys I don't have a whole lot of cash I'm already fully invested I put out all my trades in the Discord community so this is just stuff for you guys that are not in Discord to also take advantage of some of my safer plays that I put out on on YouTube to put cash to work because you should be fully invested something I actually teach in my one-on-one coaching is that we we should be Beyond fully invested we should be on margin as well using safe margin I use safe margin but that's not I won't cover that on YouTube that is something that I only leave for my one-on-one students it is a little bit it's it's definitely higher Lev stuff 240 uh we can go for sell covered call now this right here would mean that we'll get about $6 of upside for apple on a covered call and then you know the two the $234 that you collect is just icing on the cake guys that's just you know little bit of sprinkles and and and icing on the cake so you know you can just enjoy that as premium that you collect so look you get $6 plus 230 236 so it's about $85 give or take about eight bucks which is roughly like what a three a 3% return so this right here is a 3% return but again I'm going to show you a smaller account play right now which is going to be that bull call spread the bull call spread can easily just be 235 and 240 so very simp simple guys every time I do a covered call if you have a smaller portfolio you could do a bull call spread the Robin Hood calls that a call debit spread same thing I will say it's a higher risk strategy because with the covered call if the stock goes up cool if it goes down that's also fine you have the stock now on a bull call spread if the stock does not go up then you do lose the capital that you put in so I want you to be aware of that so it is a disadvantage to have a smaller portfolio but you know that's just that's just how it is right that's why it is easier for me to work with folks that have 50k that is why I say you know if you want oneone coaching you should have uh multiple five figures the more you have the better for sure so I do kind of DQ smaller portfolios there just cuz it's hard for me to work with them but I have a bunch of free content here for you guys as well so look 225 on the max loss and the max profit is 275 so you can again double your money so you can get a 3% return if you're going to be ultra conservative and Ultra safe um on the covered call and if you want to go a little bit riskier you can just simply put you know two contracts here nothing wrong with that even if you have a big portfolio put in a couple contracts and you know if the stock goes up you get a 3% return on the covered call and then you get a more than double on your money here and then you mix that return mix that return up mix these strategies up a little bit you put 1% of this uh maybe even half a percent you can put even half a percent on the bull call spread here and then all of a sudden there there we go we're we're building our momentum we're building the portfolios really quickly going into December 20th this next month I really think we're going to be printing money pretty crazy all the students are making lots of money this is the easiest time I've ever seen this is the easy like if you're not making money right now you're never going to make money forget about it like honestly just quit because this is the easiest time so if you're not making money right now you are absolutely doing something wrong cuz it's it's freaking easy right now.",0.98,0.9
Invest with Henry,45292DvRbvw,2024-11-28T14:30:01Z,Top 4 Options I'm Buying NOW (10% in December 2024),SoFi,I have three specific stocks which is snowflake Nvidia and paler these three stocks along with many other tech stocks I'm also going to cover meta I'm going to cover Apple in this video I'm also going to cover Sofi these stocks these tech stocks which are really they call them the Magnificent 7 I think there's like 15 of them right now these stocks are going to squeeze higher and in general being in the hottest tech stocks right now is going to be very profitable because I see a short squeeze uh potentially going to happen. look next stock I wanted to cover is Sofi I know there's a lot of folks that do like Sofi Sofi is a good stock overall uh I've actually have a friend who works at Sofi he's had some experience at Sofi that I also worked with him at Goldman Sachs he actually built options.com options.com is the link in my description is the third link I don't usually promote it it's just a software that helps you pick pick options it's an option recommendation engine I contributed some of my technical analysis knowledge to that software my friend built it so you know it is a tool that I do use to pick good options there's spreads there's covered calls on that software so if you're interested check it out I usually almost never promote it's been months but I have it down there in the description Sofi is a really good company the past 6 months this stock has gone parabolic which to me is you know I do want to pump the breaks and say hey this Stock's at an all-time high I don't want to be a hype YouTuber and I don't like picking stocks at all-time highs however momentum is a thing guys when I worked on Wall Street uh momentum is definitely a thing it's definitely something that works and if you you know here PE people have said hey the stock is really high but it went from 14 to 1515 so you know that's like a $150 on $14 that's that's a 10% move that is a 10% move in a in in a short amount of time so we went from November 11th to November 27th about a two-e period a 10% move so can that happen again the answer is yes it can happen again so I want to bring to your attention that Sofi has a a good business it you know it has some AI components it's not one of those AI hype stocks so it's not going to be Ong with the trend like Nvidia which is the next stock I'll cover but this stock has had some you know really interesting uh facts and figures this stock has a really high forward PE ratio again just pointing out this is not a stock that is the best fundamentally I'm simply playing off of momentum and I'm telling you if you want to participate in the squeeze this is a little bit of a different strategy than what I cover I want to diversify and give you guys a different perspective and my personal opinion of what I would be doing if I wanted to be a little bit riskier because I am playing stocks like this in my in my personal portfolio but I'm using small amounts I'm being super clear with you on that because I hate it when you guys lose money and I have a huge responsibility here here and in my Discord to perform that's my number one goal is to give good results and performance it's not it's not for fun guys it's for results and I'm actually trying to deliver something here that will actually help people so look the the fundamentals here not the best right so if I scroll down the profit margin is okay we we got 8.5% profit the revenue per share is only 247 this company is going for for not a cheap valuation not a cheap price of sales and not a cheap price earnings ratio now I also want to point out that they do have a lot of cash so I'm not worried about the stock going bankrupt or something like that it's a good company not the best valuation but I want to say that you can play the game where you can buy expensive and the stock gets more expensive because of the clear momentum and the tech Market uh heat up I really think that that's going to be a a good investment for the next 2 three weeks so let me show you what that's going to look like I'm going to go to Sofi right here and I'm going to show you uh the options that I would be playing right now so on Sofi you can either try to get into the company by selling a put option I have several sellp put videos you just type in to YouTube invest with Henry sellp puts you will get a you'll get my top two videos most likely YouTube will recommend them the recommendation engine here on YouTube or you know you can do covered calls so you can sell the 15 put here this is a this is a 4% this is over 4% return right so this this would be decent entry into the stock but also to be honest because we are trying to play that momentum you can just straight up go into a this is going to be really interesting but you can go into an in the money buy call option at550 and then you can sell something like the 17 and a half and this right here is going to give you this is going to give you some big some huge returns now this is somewhat unlikely to happen fully to 17 and a half but I don't don't expect SOI to go to 17 and A2 fully you know I think it may go to 16 A2 maybe 17 so you would open up to 17 a half honestly it's a smart bet and I said this on target recently guys I don't cover this on YouTube it's just too boring people's attention span isn't enough to to listen to my boring plays but my boring plays have printed money in Discord I I picked up Target right after the earnings and we went from 110 to like 1 120 and I bought call options freaking printed money printed money and this is the same scenario where I see that Sofi in this market it can really print more money like if it goes to 17 and a half this would be a triple you're you're betting $65 to get 200 you know I don't know if we're going to realize at full 200 my strategy here would basically be if it were to double if I were to double my money I'm not going to open up this play I have enough plays from from my Discord I'm not going to open up this play but I'm just showing this on YouTube I think this could be a really interesting play and the way I would actually manage this is I would not hold this position until expiration typically I am holding positions till expiration but on this one I think you should ride some momentum if you believe in the Dan IES Trend the AI the next phase here and the bullish 2024 which is the theme that I do believe in I think that here if you see a short-term rise in Sofi from 1564 whatever 16 to 16 and a half you see a good profit on your hands you just cut that position take profit I would not really hold this until expiration just because it is unlikely for Sofi to reach 17 and a half but it it can it can I wouldn't I wouldn't nothing is impossible in this market truly nothing is impossible and if I can put 20K 30k 50K in your guys portfolios in the next you know three four weeks great great then uh why not why not that that'll be a good thing.,0.95,0.8
Invest with Henry,45292DvRbvw,2024-11-28T14:30:01Z,Top 4 Options I'm Buying NOW (10% in December 2024),Elastic N.V.,one of them is snowflake the other one's actually elastic we've been fortunate enough to have the CEO on the show kind of a broad uh based play they do Cloud they do security as well. I think in 2025 that's going to be the key you look at elastic snowflake names like mongod DB they're the ones now that file names like paler in terms of the software the use cases I believe the the software AI age is now here 20125 that's going to be front and center that's why we upgrade those names. both of those names have recently had earnings actually we're going to show the charts big jump snowflakes up over 25% since earnings elastics up over 20% since earnings what's going to push them even higher I mean they've had big spikes post earnings what else is going to happen that's going to be another Catalyst that's just the appetizer in terms of where I believe these stocks are going because now the consumption model what's happening across Enterprise AI obviously it starts with Godfather vad Jensen Nvidia but now you look at the consumption piece these LM models what you're going to start to see I believe earnings and overall growth is being underestimated potentially by 15 20% over the next few years that's why you look at names like snowflake elastic mango it all starts obviously messy of AI paler but this software phase is here and it's just the beginning.,0.95,0.8

Invest with Henry,DdK02X_6890,2024-11-27T15:00:11Z,Maximize Profits on Tesla Stock (TSLA) WITHOUT Buying More Shares!,Tesla,"Tesla stock is up over 40% year-to date and a lot of my students are asking me is it still okay to buy Tesla stock and how do I maximize my profits and make the most amount of money right now on Tesla stock using option even though Tesla stock is up a significant amount I found a very big reason I think you need to pay attention to that is actually going to make Tesla rise more up to $400 per share in 2025 in my opinion I just sat down and over a few hours of time researching Tesla I redid my price Target and I'm going to show you why I think Tesla is worth this much I'm also going to show you a leap option and how to profit off of Tesla here in the next few months. Tesla stock will go up to $400 per share due to self-driving having a bigger impact than Car Sales themselves. Elon Musk will influence Trump and the White House as they develop the relationship and I think there's going to be two really good freebies for Tesla one of them is going to be regulatory favoritism the other one is going to be trade and tariff um negotiations that are going to help Tesla a lot. The actual play I'm going to make in this video is going to be buying a leap option at 330 strike price I'm going to personally put 5% of my money into this leap option play on Tesla and the expiration will be for September 2025. I'm bullish so I'm going to be buying the 330 call option and I believe Tesla is going to go to 400 and uh and the last one is I just want to wrap up the little summary here it's going to be pretty clear guidance for me personally that Tesla is going to have disproportionate returns here in uh the rest of 2024 and going into 2025 I think we'll see $400 per share in the first quarter or the second quarter of 2. I'm going to open up Tesla right now and go to my position here on Tesla and Tesla's currently trading at $342 per share. I do have a th000 shares which is about 8 and a half% of my portfolio I have 1,000 shares at $118 this is a play that I put out in Discord I'm currently up $125,000 and I have several different option plays one that I recently opened up is actually a sellp put position but I'm actually going to open up a new leap play in this video so you guys are really in store for some for some really good sauce here on how to make more money. Regulatory favorit ISM for EVS okay that's the first reason I have that I think you need to pay attention to and Elon Musk guys it's not even a question he is going to impact Donald Trump in in the white house why do you think they're they're buddies right typically people are actually not usually friends unless they have a joint benefit to each other okay even you and your friend you probably help each other whether it's laughing or money or whatever when two people come together it's for a reason and politics is for money politics is straight up money I Al actually think Democrats Republican same side they're just making money on us right really clear so why is Elon Musk becoming buddy buddy with Trump well the reason is can you guess it it's money all right real simple real straightforward Elon Musk could influence Trump to maintain or enhance policies that support EV such as infrastructure Investments guys as an example that's EV charging networks that's a really big deal because I have a friend who has a Tesla and he doesn't really enjoy driving long distance because you have to plan ahead so when there's more charging networks when there better cost Better Price win win win win across the consumer and Tesla as a company that's a really big deal guys telling you that's going to be a really big thing. It's going to streamline I think if Trump streamlines regulations more specifically for autonomous driving that's going to be a game changer that's going to be a complete Game Changer because autonomous driving not I don't even I can't even say this is an opinion it's just basically a fact the price of earnings multiple on autonomous driving since it's like a software um Revenue stream is going to be way more valuable than the core car business when Tesla sells a car okay that justifies is one multiple but the reason why they are going to hit a $2 trillion market cap and this company is going to crush it is because of AI autonomous driving and all of these software trends that we see software guys goes for multiples that are way higher than traditional businesses and that's why from the very beginning Tesla has been valued more than GM and all these Legacy automakers um because software has better margins way better recurring margins High margins okay so that's the first thing right now was second thing for regulations is trade and tariff negotiations all right must could leverage his influence to push for favorable trade agreements or reduce tariffs okay reduced tariffs also going to be a really big deal because that EV tax CRA credit of $7,500 or so is going to go away so right now musk has to be quick he has to be really quick the timing has to be impeccable because as these EV tax credits go away the Tesla vehicle is you know in certain States right it's not in every state but it's going to be a less favorable option for for the consumer to pick so if they if Tesla wants the consumer to still go for Tesla then they obviously need the pricing to make sense economics has to make sense okay. Lowering Tesla's production cost is a really big key for Elon Musk this man is a businessman this man is an influencer this man has a personal brand something that you guys don't think about all the time but everyone in YouTube has a personal brand I'm just being honest with that's how it works Elon Musk is a personal brand he has his own initiatives he has his own plan he has a way of marketing Elon Musk personally has more followers on Twitter or X right then Tesla itself so he is a personal brand and the way he's trying to influence the White House is basically to get the production cost of Tesla lower why because you have more economies of scale economies of scale is basically economics 101. So Tesla wants to do this because if they can lower their cost they can pass that lower cost on to the end consumer and they can lower the price of Tesla vehicle uh price per per vehicle or price per service for the autonomous driving or for the insurance that they have or for lots of different products that they have and services that they will have in the future and if it's cheaper it's going to make economic sense for the consumer to take action on that right it's pretty pretty simple to be honest it's really really simple why he's doing this right now. Tom Naran right um he is an analyst and he said it perfectly he said that autonomous driving and new regulations will change the landscape for Tesla and justify the valuation easily easily okay. Tesla shares though popping today on a report that said that the Trump Administration is planning to ease Federal rules on self-driving driving Vehicles now this follows news on Friday that Trump's team is also reportedly planning to kill the $7,500 tax credit for Ev purchases so joining us now is Tom nian of RBC Capital markets Tom it's great to have you on let's start right there what's going to matter more for Tesla and for the vehicle market and any of these AI plays that might be attached to autonomous driving is it going to be uh a different regulatory landscape for autonomous vehicles or is it going to be taking away uh that that tax credit what's going to matter more. If you can make your own vehicle at lower costs doesn't have steering wheels or pedals you can bring down the cost and Tesla's argument is they can actually gobble up market share and if you look at autonomy and AI Etc that comes at a much higher multiple You have a trillion plus dollar market cap for Tesla you know is are you going to get there with an auto business for selling more cars or through AI autonomy right so autonomy is the way they can justify that market cap more they can from selling cars. All right guys the last thing that he said there was auto business or AI autonomy which do you think is going to be worth more of course of course AI autonomy guys AI autonomy is going to be worth so much more as I said in the beginning of this video than than just traditional Legacy you know cars okay Tesla's not a car company Tesla has been mistaken for a car company this is an autonomous driving company this is an AI company this is a data company all the things that I've covered on this channel with Nvidia paler I'm in Tesla for the same reasons guys it's really simple here right I'm in this company for the same reason so so look I think autonomy is going to make a lot of sense and I think we're going to see $400 per share in early to mid 2025. Now what I want to do is I want to go over a leap option I've explained to you why I've explained to you what I've explained to you everything now I'm just going to show you what I'm actually going to do and I'm going to buy some leap options. Tesla if you were to buy 100 shares would be $350 per share would be $35,000 now if you buy a 330 call option then you only paying about $8,400 here okay and you get the same benefit so you get to put up about 1/4 of the price so you know that is a lot less than having to put up a 100 shares which is going to be around the $35,000 Mark so here it's a lot cheaper and it's a lot more efficient so that's why I like the limited risk nature of leaps and now the third thing is I said there's three things is there's just an extended time Horizon so leap can look like shares it can really look like shares if you buy a long-term leap it's really function ing in the same way if I expand this option right here this Delta is 66 so it's not as high as 70 or 75 as I usually say but it's close enough you're getting a lot of benefit if the stock goes up to 400 so basically it'll go up by $50 and this option right here will be $50 times the 66 Delta all right so that's going to be about $33 higher $33 higher I did that math in my head real quick really love math back in in uh in school $33 is going to be how much this option would rise and because that $33 is actually a lot of money on $84 so if Tesla goes up by 50 this option increases by 33 33 you know you know as a portion to$ 8,400 so$ 3,300 is what you would make on $8,400 that would be like around 40% return or so 40% or so return but you know if you do the math if Tesla goes up by 50 bucks you know that's really only a 15% return or so on the Tesla stock so had you had Tesla stock you would make about 15% but if you have this leap option you're going to make about 40% so you have almost a 3X leverage Factor here with the leap option you get almost 3x the same return if you were to use the same capital or basically you can think about as you're able to use oneir or you know about 40% of the capital so instead of you know putting out you know 35k you're only putting out 8,400 to get the same benefit and if the stock moves up you get huge you get huge benefits you can close at any time that's also what I want to point out you guys do not have to hold until expiration. I'm comfortable enough to to go for something like the 390 uh call option right here so if I sell this call option I will collect $3,000 and I can reduce my cost down to only $5,000 you know give or take $52.90 so by reducing my cost here to 52.90 or $5,300 that's fantastic because now I get even a bigger leverage effect than I mentioned earlier.",1.0,1.0

Federal restrictions was one of the big reasons why GM uh stopped making its origin uh purpose-built vehicle right that allows you to make a vehicle without pedals and steering wheels so you need that Federal deregulation if you were to call it a policy framework in order to allow for that that's what the Tesla cyber cab is why is that important it cuts down a lot of costs.,0.9,-0.5

Invest with Henry,Z38SDPa7TKk,2024-11-26T19:00:17Z,Make Consistent Passive Income by Selling Covered Calls (Options for Beginners),Nvidia,"I have a covered call on Nvidia I have some covered calls on palen here and in general covered calls have been a fantastic way for me to generate consistent income so you do need to have 100 shares but you can still do this with a small account portfolio because you can have 100 shares of a cheaper stock and there's plenty of names out there one of them is American Airlines there's a lot of cheap stocks that you can use that you can run 100 shares buy 100 shares and essentially sell covered calls now I'm going to be showing you an example right now using Nvidia because Nvidia has been one of my favorite stocks that I've been covering a lot on the channel so I'm going to go to Nvidia stock right now and I'm going to show you how you can basically run the covered call strategy and I think right now is a very interesting time because Nvidia is just under $140 per share and by the way the options I'm going to tell you right now the options on Nvidia are absolutely delicious they are like the best options that you can possibly ask for for so for NVIDIA it's currently at $138 per share and I do have uh 300 shares not that much and I want to actually acquire some more shares so what I'm going to do right now is I'm actually going to buy some shares let me just go to my account and see how much money I have I have 25k which is not a whole lot but I can still work with 25k so what I'm going to do is I'm going to invest and buy a 100 more shares than I have right now so I'm going to go to buy Nvidia do uh so this is set to Dollars I'm going to go to shares going to go to buy 100 shares you can actually buy 200 shares and I'll be slightly on margin and I'm okay with that because I'm going to be collecting a lot of Premium later today when I have my Discord trading session so I'm going to be slightly in the margin which is fine I'm going to go ahead and buy 200 shares right here boom okay I'm actually going to reduce my margin um right now I'll show you what this looks like so check this out if I go to my account right now you will notice that I have margin used now of $2,000 you can see this little gold thing right here so I'm using $2,600 wor margin however I'm going to show you that I'm going to pay this down right now so I'm going to go back to Nvidia I'm going to sell um a few covered calls so I currently have 500 shares and I've already had some covered calls at 148 I'm going to show you how to sell some covered calls right now and it's actually going to bring my margin usage down guys and that's because when you sell a covered call essentially get paid right away you get paid the cash right away the premium that you collect on the option so of course what I'm looking for is I'm looking for a high quality stock and I'm looking for strong fundamentals okay I'm also looking for strong technicals all right so I pulled up Nvidia on a chart I'm going to just show you how the chart looks like right now okay you can see that that I have a few different indicators here and this is the new view of yaku Finance so used to this view however I'll just show you what I'm using I'm using the Binger band 20 and two you can see that there's this bowling your band Channel and right now Nvidia is actually somewhere in the middle okay so it's in the middle of the bowling your band which tells me we're neither expensive nor are we like really cheap we're just somewhere in between which is actually a really good time to do covered calls this is the most important thing that you should actually look at which is technical analysis on Nvidia because Nvidia doesn't really trade on fundamental analysis I've said this on many other stocks that I was absolutely correct on like palen here and Tesla they don't trade on on fundamentals these stocks trade on technicals especially in this bull market right now we can make money hand over fist guys or you know bicep over tricep as I say on a company like Nvidia and as long as it's not at the you know Peak Peak then we should be okay right so right now it's not at the peak it's not at 151 so we're more than good to sell covered calls the green flag I'm waving the green flag right now we're definitely a green flag the RSI is also 4 7 so we're right in the middle we're right in the middle on the Bowling your band we're also in the middle on the RSI and the in the moving average we actually just popped below the moving average which is actually a buy sign okay so there's a buy sign or a Buy Signal on Nvidia so I'm saying right now is a fantastic time to jump into Nvidia you can actually see some of the stocks that I follow there on the right hand side of my screen so yeah for NVIDIA what we're going to do is I'm going to go to sell I'm going to sell a covered call option now expiration dat is really important and I'm always looking for a stock that you know has pulled down a little bit at least so I can get a better price and for NVIDIA the stock has pulled down below 140 so I think this is a a really really really good time guys to jump into the company and to invest at a fair price I'm always looking at what is fair because it's actually not the option strategy that's the most important it's the stock selection itself which is what I do in my Discord Community all the time I'm always looking for stocks that are fairly and reasonably valued because if a company isn't fairly reasonably valued then uh there is no strategy not the wheel strategy that I covered not selling puts not covered calls none of those strategies will work however when you find a stock that has really good strong uh fundamentals and technicals and it's a good Growth Company like Nvidia is for many reasons I've already mentioned in Prior videos right AI the management is good um the trend is good so all these things I'm paying very close attention to that's what makes the company a good buy and covered calls is just the strategy that you use to generate income on the stock that your reite uh like so so this strategy still makes sense to me and even if you have a small account even if you have to put a little bit more money than you want into Nvidia I think it makes sense Nvidia is one of the top stocks along with apple to be honest with you I do a lot of boring stocks where I make a lot of money in my private Community because on YouTube I can't always cover all the boring stocks because people aren't interested in them but I'm making money like hand over fist literally on many other names and Nvidia just happens to be one of the top names that I am sharing on YouTube publicly so a covered call what I do let's talk about management let's talk about opening the position and closing the position first of all let me just open this position to begin with so I'm going to go for December 20th for me a good expiration is anywhere from 1 to six weeks even a little bit longer is fine because I'm all I'm all about passive safe income I'm not about day trading and I don't want to do too much work I just want to create enough income to uh you know live a good retired lifestyle which is you know fairly early for me but uh for many folks I mean you can really retire with just covered calls or or the wheel or you know any of the other strategies that I cover on this channel I do specialize in in retirement and that's what I do a lot with my one-on-one coaching I do a lot of retirement strategies so um I have the 148 let's go back to the technicals here you can see if I if I zoom in we had a double top pattern we had a actually like a Quant Tuple top pattern right here right usually it's a double top like this is a double top but then again we had like another double top or a triple top I mean the stock has really been at these levels for quite some time and this is since uh you know this is for for about a month now uh the stock has just been sideways sideways action and unless there's a big earning event or there's a big Catalyst guys I I think the stock will continue to go sideways I don't really see it going above the 140 roughly 146 level I think at 146 we're going to get a little bit of short-term resistance and it's all about just eyeing it and understanding where's support where is resistance for me right now shortterm and video is going to have some one uh resistance at 146 so right now I am going to go for this 146 covered call and we had $2,600 in margin I'm going to show you how I'm going to reduce my like the capital that I'm putting up right now so I'm going to go for two contracts okay I'm going to go for 325 here or actually let me go for 320 because the bid just went down to 320 and I want to get filled here as fast as possible because I respect your time I don't want to take too much time here beautiful so I collected $639 194 and actually if I go to my account right now you can see it actually did get reduced from 2600 down to 1,900 I'm about to make a lot more money during my live trading session that I do in Discord but you can see here how just you know just the covered calls here already kind of put cash into my account so when you doing covered calls the cash does go into your account immediately and that is spendable cash that you can use right away and by the way the portfolio is just doing phenomenally like I'm up 1% today this is the easiest Market to make money in we are fairly full for one-on-one coaching we do have a few more spots left if you want to hit the first link in description you can and you can have a free consultation to learn more about one-on-one coaching but we're we're fairly full right now we're making a lot of money you know I wish there was there was more of me but I'm trying to share as much free content as I can here because I really care about you subscribers all right let's go back to my notes Here I think the one of the most important things that you guys want to watch out for is Delta okay when I'm selling options I'm typically going for a 30 Delta on the selling put side and the covered call side okay right now the I actually didn't even look at Delta because I've been trading for such a long time that often times I just either use my Intuition or I use technical analysis but I do want to pop back in to the option here so I pulled up the 146 uh option that I just sold and the Delta is actually 33 so you can see here how I instinctively already sold an option that was around a 30 Delta without even looking right as I'm making this video it's unscripted I don't have a plan for this video I'm just sharing everything I know from the past 10 years of experience that I've had from working on Wall Street Goldman Sachs my finance degree all these experiences I'm trying to share them uh as much as possible online here for you guys because I want to make sure that my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff because everyone else is kind of copying me people that run boot camps and that that have programs they're kind of mimicking my programs cuz I've been here first and I've trained a lot of other option YouTuber so I just want to democratize option trading education give you guys as much free info as possible I don't think you you always have to pay for something when I can give it to you for free unless you want one-on-one coaching that's cool too but you don't have to so look the next thing that I want to cover in my notes is I'm super confident super confident on Nvidia just absolutely super confident and a lot of that has to do with the AI Trend with management but I'm also just super confident because I've been trading for such a long time now I understand how to manage this position if it goes against me look on a covered call in most cases if the stock goes to 146 for example andv is Shing around 138 so let me show you back on the chart here if it goes to 146 and it starts to reach this top I'm not going to be worried I'm not going to be concerned whatsoever only if we break out of this top pattern then I will say huh what's going on here so if it breaks out of this pattern above 146 towards 150 then I need to either close this position all right I need to close it out if I don't want to lose my shares or I can roll this position higher now look there is a third scenario okay there's three scenarios scenario maybe four scenarios okay here's one scenario one scenario is the stock goes down all right well the covered call strategy will have losses because it is a bullish strategy it's a neutral to bullish strategy depending on the strike that you pick right now I'm showing you a bullish strategy so if the stock goes down you're going to lose money on the stock but you have some margin of safety have that cushion from the covered call itself however of course you know a lot of people will say hey I'm losing money yes you will be losing money but so you would also lose money if you're a stockholder but with the covered call you're actually doing better so a covered call is safer than just investing a stock so scenario one if the stock goes down you just hold your covered call and really nothing happens to the covered call itself you you make money on the covered call and you lost money on the stock as anyone else would on the stock when it goes down now if the stock goes sideways you will make money on the covered call itself which is still amazing and the stock will make nothing but you've made money overall the third case is if the stock approaches 146 but doesn't hit 146 that's fine that's good you're making money on the stock and you're making money on the option that's actually the ideal scenario you know Nvidia is trading at 138 pretty much right now on 3797 what's going to happen is if it goes to 140 that's beautiful that means the stock went up you made money and the option decays and pretty much expires out of the money and then you can sell a covered call again if it goes to 142 or 14 3 you're still in really really good shape now only if it pops above 146 and continues okay if it hits 146 you can be as concerned as you want my uh opinion my non-financial advice here right I'm not a financial adviser but I'm better not a financial adviser in my opinion if it goes above 146 you just don't do anything yet I know it's concerning but really don't make the mistake of closing positions too early way too many Traders I see do that and that's also why as a coach I have coaches myself I have mentors myself I I'm connected with some of the golden Sachs folks that I used to work for uh with not yeah well for yeah with and for so for me I'm always looking to gain an edge and get better and um I think one of the biggest mistakes is just cutting positions too early and I I make that mistake myself so do not make that mistake if it hits the strike you still have to assess do is it going to go higher and in most cases it's not because you see the top of the bowling her band here is is roughly um 151 so it can't really go that much higher so in this scenario that I'm giving you it's really an easy money play I'm literally giving you an easy money play on how to make easy money on Nvidia because it is likely to go up but it's not likely to go up that much which is what I said in the last video that I made um basically saying that earnings will come in hot hot they came in hot guys the earnings came in like fire but the thing is everyone already expected they already expect it guys that the earnings will be good so for that reason the stock did not rise a lot and right now we do not have a catalyst to to make the stock go up in the short term so we can make money steadily and safely and pretty passively by just waiting up until the next earnings and right now the stock will probably have some type of earnings Drift But you know typically earnings drift either goes down or up and Nvidia just didn't go anywhere which is exactly what I said I thought that Nvidia would go up towards 150 um but you know it's under 140 so if it was my bet I would say that we're still going to go back up to 140 142 something like that we're going to see the stock rise especially right now into the end of the year and into into the January effect as well as what hedge funds are doing when I look at the volume of what hedge funds are trading right now it's it's Bonkers they're just making lots of money and they're putting a lot of capital to work and I think a lot of that is obviously going to go into Nvidia and just looking at the support we have strong support we we really do have strong support but we also have a clear resistance which is why the covered call strategy right now makes the most sense and like I said the covered Co strategy is a bullish strategy so I am moderately bullish okay don't get confused a lot of people think oh I'm crazy bullish no I'm actually moderately bullish and I've said that in many of my videos which makes me very different from um the hype YouTubers out there some hype YouTubers are like oh it's going to go to the Moon I'm not like that guys I'm just trying to make right now on this Market 10% per month or you know a little bit more because this is a hot market and I've gotten this portfolio lots of lots of upside um and I've grown it pretty quickly I actually need to take money out of it because the portfolio is getting too big and a lot of a lot of you guys think this is impossible for you to do yourself but you are absolutely wrong a lot of you if you're listening right now I'm telling you you can do it you can grow your portfolio from five to six figures and then six to seven it's all about compound interest the money gets really easy if you have the right strategies and you're picking the right stocks I mean so many of my students just follow me they don't even know what they're doing sometimes and they just follow me and they print money now obviously I want everyone to know how to trade for themselves because my interest is is not to have someone on the hook like a financial advisor and to charge them fees like many financial advisers do I just you know obviously my time is valuable and I but I teach everything I teach everything right up front I don't hold anything back because I want more successful students at this point we have many of them uh so that's what I like doing so look one more thing that I want to say and this is actually I have a few more things to say this video is getting long I apologize I'm trying to give you so much in this video If you appreciate it please do subscribe I would really appreciate it if you do look one thing that I want you guys if you're a beginner or not a beginner this strategy is all about generating income you don't have to get fancy with the covered call strategy please you do not need to just use it on high quality companies literally Nvidia is one of them or you can use it on different stocks I'm just trying to give you my blueprint if you want to have other stocks that's fine as well now check this out if you want to make more money on the covered call strategy you can actually go a little bit closer to the money I'm going to show you the tradeoff right now on uh on Nvidia stock I'm going to show you the tradeoff that you're going to be making so I showed you the covered call okay let me go back to December 20th let me show you a little bit of a variation all right so let me show you strike selection and and picking optimal strike is really important I showed you the 146 but look let's say that right now you're afraid of a market crash okay which I do I do see some folks asking me my in my community when I'm making my calls what are you going to do when there's a market crash listen I don't try to predict Market crashes and I always have a joke me and my team my team I have I have a coach on my team my one-on-one coaching it's me and another coach and during my onboarding process you know when you guys book a call you schedule a call using my first link we have a consultation and during the consultation people say what are you going to do during that crash and I give them the same joke every time I say listen you know Michael bur Michael bur predicted 2008 right everyone's like yeah he's a genius right but something that you guys didn't know is Michael bur has predicted 17 of the last two crashes 17 of the last two crashes you get what I'm saying do you get that joke he overpredicted more crashes than there are so I'm not going to be doing that guys the reason why I have the best results hands down on YouTube um they're the only investors that are better than me are not on YouTube I'm telling you they're I'm the best option coach the only people that are better than me are actually working on Wall Street and they're not they're not on YouTube I didn't want to be on Wall Street because it's I don't want to get up early and I don't want to go to work I don't want to wear a suit and tie I enjoy traveling and look I'm just I'm comfortable here right I like coaching a lot more and helping individuals I don't want to really necessarily help all these corporations and everything I want to help the everyday person so sorry if I'm going on a T I'm just trying to give you the full the full picture here look sell sell call I'm going to go for a sell call that could be 140 why would you do this this goes back to what I was just saying about predicting crashes if you're one of those guys or gals right I have lots of women that I coach as well I love working with women uh there needs to be more women in finance and managing money but that's besides the point the 140 covered call okay this will be a lot closer to the money this is a lot closer so you have less upside but the premium here is higher it's 540 the closer that you go into money right the closer that you go to the current stock price the more premium that you will collect okay why because there's a higher chance of this actually happening you're going to get compensated more for this higher chance you see option Traders are not dumb they understand the chances and the probability that the option will go into the money that's why the Delta here is going to be 048 it's going to be a lot higher than the 33 Delta that I traded before and because the Delta here is higher you're going to get paid a lot more you're going to get paid almost $550 now look the other reason I keep showing you guys in Nvidia is because I'm a big proponent of trading options that are liquid liquid options are better liquid means there's a lot of volume there's a lot of open interest and the bid ask spread is tight this is extremely important guys I'm always looking at showing you guys what is the most profitable not what is the most hype not what the most interesting is what is the most profitable because I know when I make you guys money you do end up wanting to get some coaching with me either way I want to make you money I'm not looking for the hype stuff so look I wanted to cover spy in this video as well in trading on spy I won't have time to do that as this video is getting long if you guys want an spy video let me know down in the comments below I also do have another spy video that you can check out right here and it is about also using option strategies to create safe passive income on spy",1.0,0.9

but you have some margin of safety have that cushion from the covered call itself however of course you know a lot of people will say hey I'm losing money yes you will be losing money but so you would also lose money if you're a stockholder but with the covered call you're actually doing better so a covered call is safer than just investing a stock so scenario one if the stock goes down you just hold your covered call and really nothing happens to the covered call itself you you make money on the covered call and you lost money on the stock as anyone else would on the stock when it goes down now if the stock goes sideways you will make money on the covered call itself which is still amazing and the stock will make nothing but you've made money overall the third case is if the stock approaches 146 but doesn't hit 146 that's fine that's good you're making money on the stock and you're making money on the option that's actually the ideal scenario you know Nvidia is trading at 138 pretty much right now on 3797 what's going to happen is if it goes to 140 that's beautiful that means the stock went up you made money and the option decays and pretty much expires out of the money and then you can sell a covered call again if it goes to 142 or 14 3 you're still in really really good shape now only if it pops above 146 and continues okay if it hits 146 you can be as concerned as you want my uh opinion my non-financial advice here right I'm not a financial adviser but I'm better not a financial adviser in my opinion if it goes above 146 you just don't do anything yet I know it's concerning but really don't make the mistake of closing positions too early way too many Traders I see do that and that's also why as a coach I have coaches myself I have mentors myself I I'm connected with some of the golden Sachs folks that I used to work for uh with not yeah well for yeah with and for so for me I'm always looking to gain an edge and get better and um I think one of the biggest mistakes is just cutting positions too early and I I make that mistake myself so do not make that mistake if it hits the strike you still have to assess do is it going to go higher and in most cases it's not because you see the top of the bowling her band here is is roughly um 151 so it can't really go that much higher so in this scenario that I'm giving you it's really an easy money play I'm literally giving you an easy money play on how to make easy money on Nvidia because it is likely to go up but it's not likely to go up that much which is what I said in the last video that I made um basically saying that earnings will come in hot hot they came in hot guys the earnings came in like fire but the thing is everyone already expected they already expect it guys that the earnings will be good so for that reason the stock did not rise a lot and right now we do not have a catalyst to to make the stock go up in the short term so we can make money steadily and safely and pretty passively by just waiting up until the next earnings and right now the stock will probably have some type of earnings Drift But you know typically earnings drift either goes down or up and Nvidia just didn't go anywhere which is exactly what I said I thought that Nvidia would go up towards 150 um but you know it's under 140 so if it was my bet I would say that we're still going to go back up to 140 142 something like that we're going to see the stock rise especially right now into the end of the year and into into the January effect as well as what hedge funds are doing when I look at the volume of what hedge funds are trading right now it's it's Bonkers they're just making lots of money and they're putting a lot of capital to work and I think a lot of that is obviously going to go into Nvidia and just looking at the support we have strong support we we really do have strong support but we also have a clear resistance which is why the covered call strategy right now makes the most sense and like I said the covered Co strategy is a bullish strategy so I am moderately bullish okay don't get confused a lot of people think oh I'm crazy bullish no I'm actually moderately bullish and I've said that in many of my videos which makes me very different from um the hype YouTubers out there some hype YouTubers are like oh it's going to go to the Moon I'm not like that guys I'm just trying to make right now on this Market 10% per month or you know a little bit more because this is a hot market and I've gotten this portfolio lots of lots of upside um and I've grown it pretty quickly I actually need to take money out of it because the portfolio is getting too big and a lot of a lot of you guys think this is impossible for you to do yourself but you are absolutely wrong a lot of you if you're listening right now I'm telling you you can do it you can grow your portfolio from five to six figures and then six to seven it's all about compound interest the money gets really easy if you have the right strategies and you're picking the right stocks I mean so many of my students just follow me they don't even know what they're doing sometimes and they just follow me and they print money now obviously I want everyone to know how to trade for themselves because my interest is is not to have someone on the hook like a financial advisor and to charge them fees like many financial advisers do I just you know obviously my time is valuable and I but I teach everything I teach everything right up front I don't hold anything back because I want more successful students at this point we have many of them uh so that's what I like doing so look one more thing that I want to say and this is actually I have a few more things to say this video is getting long I apologize I'm trying to give you so much in this video If you appreciate it please do subscribe I would really appreciate it if you do look one thing that I want you guys if you're a beginner or not a beginner this strategy is all about generating income you don't have to get fancy with the covered call strategy please you do not need to just use it on high quality companies literally Nvidia is one of them or you can use it on different stocks I'm just trying to give you my blueprint if you want to have other stocks that's fine as well now check this out if you want to make more money on the covered call strategy you can actually go a little bit closer to the money I'm going to show you the tradeoff right now on uh on Nvidia stock I'm going to show you the tradeoff that you're going to be making so I showed you the covered call okay let me go back to December 20th let me show you a little bit of a variation all right so let me show you strike selection and and picking optimal strike is really important I showed you the 146 but look let's say that right now you're afraid of a market crash okay which I do I do see some folks asking me my in my community when I'm making my calls what are you going to do when there's a market crash listen I don't try to predict Market crashes and I always have a joke me and my team my team I have I have a coach on my team my one-on-one coaching it's me and another coach and during my onboarding process you know when you guys book a call you schedule a call using my first link we have a consultation and during the consultation people say what are you going to do during that crash and I give them the same joke every time I say listen you know Michael bur Michael bur predicted 2008 right everyone's like yeah he's a genius right but something that you guys didn't know is Michael bur has predicted 17 of the last two crashes 17 of the last two crashes you get what I'm saying do you get that joke he overpredicted more crashes than there are so I'm not going to be doing that guys the reason why I have the best results hands down on YouTube um they're the only investors that are better than me are not on YouTube I'm telling you they're I'm the best option coach the only people that are better than me are actually working on Wall Street and they're not they're not on YouTube I didn't want to be on Wall Street because it's I don't want to get up early and I don't want to go to work I don't want to wear a suit and tie I enjoy traveling and look I'm just I'm comfortable here right I like coaching a lot more and helping individuals I don't want to really necessarily help all these corporations and everything I want to help the everyday person so sorry if I'm going on a T I'm just trying to give you the full the full picture here look sell sell call I'm going to go for a sell call that could be 140 why would you do this this goes back to what I was just saying about predicting crashes if you're one of those guys or gals right I have lots of women that I coach as well I love working with women uh there needs to be more women in finance and managing money but that's besides the point the 140 covered call okay this will be a lot closer to the money this is a lot closer so you have less upside but the premium here is higher it's 540 the closer that you go into money right the closer that you go to the current stock price the more premium that you will collect okay why because there's a higher chance of this actually happening you're going to get compensated more for this higher chance you see option Traders are not dumb they understand the chances and the probability that the option will go into the money that's why the Delta here is going to be 048 it's going to be a lot higher than the 33 Delta that I traded before and because the Delta here is higher you're going to get paid a lot more you're going to get paid almost $550 now look the other reason I keep showing you guys in Nvidia is because I'm a big proponent of trading options that are liquid liquid options are better liquid means there's a lot of volume there's a lot of open interest and the bid ask spread is tight this is extremely important guys I'm always looking at showing you guys what is the most profitable not what is the most hype not what the most interesting is what is the most profitable because I know when I make you guys money you do end up wanting to get some coaching with me either way I want to make you money I'm not looking for the hype stuff so look I wanted to cover spy in this video as well in trading on spy I won't

Invest with Henry,6lfcSLiyjho,2024-11-25T14:00:07Z,Nvidia Stock (NVDA) Shareholders MUST DO THIS After Earnings!,Nvidia,"Nvidia reported some big numbers and I have an idea what's going to happen next in December before earnings I correctly predicted by saying this mark my words what's going to happen is NVIDIA will beat earnings but the stock won't rise too much because expectations already baked in so what will happen next let's explain why earnings did not make a really big dent in the stock and while the earnings were so fantastic yet the stock didn't move exactly as I mentioned and most importantly what do we do next and how do we make more money on Nvidia going forward that's the most important thing in our mind and that's the most important thing that we care about is how do we make more money in this market so that's exactly what I'm going to cover in this video I'm going to show you a couple of plays we're going to dive into my portfolio by the way my portfolio just hit $4 million as you can see on the screen right now we have $4 million $1,000 so exactly as we've been making money hand over fist guys bicep over tricep I haven't hit the gym it's been been a lot of work lately and some travel so I'm in a new location but look long story short let me just get to the point here I respect your time the whole point here is NVIDIA had earnings the stock didn't really rise that much which is exactly what I thought would happen so I'm going to pull up Nvidia right in front of you and I'm going to show you my my position here let's see if you guys like this format this really raw format of me filming videos but you guys already know you get my authentic self no matter what 14177 and and this stock really didn't pump anywhere right so I'm fairly flat on the stock in this portfolio I've had nid for ages and ages um but I started a new position by selling puts by doing covered calls as you guys can see here on the screen I have several positions which have all done very well I mean I recommended doing 15 uh3 and 155 covered calls those did not hit in the money I have the 148 uh covered call which is also making money I 132 put which is making money so there has been several positions here which um have been making money sorry if I have my finger my fingers in your face it feels a little bit weird we'll see what happens with this video's comment I'm trying a new style here in my hotel guys I I'm going I'm going to look at my notes right here so excuse me if I'm not looking at the camera so look I I don't think they they really mattered for the stock too much even though they had good earnings guys it's all about expectations and the expectations were already High guys so like I'm saying the most important thing that you need to understand is that the stock market is an expectations game nobody actually cares how well the stock did nobody actually cares about anything other than what they personally expect because the shock factor is exactly what makes a stock rise or makes it fall it's all about emotions the market isn't really a science and that's why in my Discord Community when I do my Monday and Wednesday uh trading sessions I always say guys listen here's the facts here's what I see here's here's my the the facts but here is also my opinion here's my intuition because I've been doing this for 10 years that's what makes me the top option coach in the world is I have the biggest experience and sometimes I do make my decisions based on hey I think this is what I'm seeing from other folks I'm taking an eye I'm looking at other people because this game is all an expectations game it's pretty common sense if you can understand social velocity which I am always tracking I'm tracking social velocity very heavily and actually this Market that we're in right now is is honestly a purely social velocity and momentum-driven Market there's not a whole lot of science going on if you look at some of these companies they have really high priced earnings ratios and they don't always really make a lot of sense a lot of these mag s stocks actually don't make sense on paper which is why you need you need someone or you need yourself to understand why this company is going up so much so look I said I I track social velocity a lot but I also want to point out and I want to show you a quick clip of Bank of America Vivic Arya as he explains it really perfectly this is going to be a one minute clip I said what do you think the disappointment is here I mean there was disappointment is that yeah the supply chain um you know is scrutinized very closely uh it's followed by a lot of uh people and every time the company uh reports uh expectations continue to uh build up naturally for this size and what the stock has uh done uh but there are always constraints uh when it comes to uh not just getting the supply but actually building the products getting them uh to customers and what we have seen from Nvidia over the last two years is that uh they are able to beat their own guidance by two to2 and a half billion dollars consistently you know last time they guided 32 and a half billion and they reported 35 billion so that's why I'm not surprised to see uh them not exactly come to the high end of where the whisper expectations are but if I look at the usual range of Beats they have we will come pretty close I think once they actually uh report the quarter so I think this is more a case of you know expectations in a transitions quarter uh it's nothing to do with the long-term fundamentals of the company all right guys so look uh keeping this video short as possible I'm going to wrap up with my notes here and then I'm going to jump into the stock and how I'm planning to how I'm planning to trade Nvidia stock H my my fingers in in the in the in the camera shop Nvidia I'm going to probably do a couple of things I'm going to sell covered calls and pretty much continue to run the wheel strategy and I do have some cash and collateral here it is before Market open but I am going to open up this position because I am light on Nvidia in my current portfolio so I am going to open up a position on it now look to finish up with my notes I think expectations Drive the stock market period hands down period end of story okay and nvidia's recent earnings are a textbook are a textbook all right smiling right here a text textbook example and case which you guys have to learn and never make this mistake again okay I wouldn't call it a mistake cuz we're still making money with the stock going sideways but if you bought you know a lot of call options or if you're really aggressive and buying options in the market Market that is a mistake especially for a company that has already the highest expectations possible like everyone is already in the stock so that's why selling options is so profitable on on Nvidia and I think we're going to get a lot of upward movement on Nvidia this stock is going to double but it might take some time like it's it's late November right I think in 2025 we're going to see this stock basically it could double it could double you just can't time it don't time the market be on the trend be on the trend like you guys need get rich overnight no you don't get rich for sure like Uncle Henry right here we're at $4 million right I thought I would hit this in January and February I hit it earlier that's what happens when you ask for Less you get more when you ask for more you get less that just seems to be the case with with how life works all right so look Nvidia success in AI is no secret guys and the Traders were anticipating that these results would happen well in advance right a lot of if you look at nvidia's history it just continues to beat so uh Traders know it's going to beat that's why I told you it's going to beat I was I never try to predict too much in this in my videos but I literally predicted Nvidia because it's not hard to predict it's not that I'm a genius it's just that I have a lot of experience so I I can tell what's going to happen right and I can't predict it but with Nvidia it was it was easy it was easy so guys moving forward the real opportunity lies in identifying whether Nvidia can deliver unexpected upside okay unexpected not expected if it's expected it's expected it's nothing special unexpected in areas like new AI Partnerships or accelerating demand and key markets in the future that's where I think the answer if you ask me can Nvidia surprise again and again and to the upside I think the answer is yes it can and I think that's why the stock is going to double and that's why I'm going to show you some specific option plays in just a second but look if you want to know how long I don't know because that's a Fool's game to play it's a Fool's game to play of when Nvidia will rise a whole lot that's just a Fool's game I just know it will I don't know when all right we're going to have to find a scammer to tell you when I don't know when that's that's just a scammy thing nobody knows when not no no professional okay now look I've been in this game for a decade and money is really easy if you know how to analyze and properly analyze a stock and properly analyze the option and long term is where it's at because great companies like Nvidia Thrive over the long term right what happens is they keep growing their revenue because they keep gaining contracts and customers and business and they keep innovating and they either they grab more market share or you know the mar the pie is growing right all the Fang other stocks are buying Nvidia gpus so Nvidia could technically lose a little bit of market share but if the pi continues to expand and get a lot larger then that's also fine that's how a company grows they just need to make more Revenue now listen after Revenue they need to make more earnings in bottom line profits so that is going to happen naturally and Nvidia has some insanely High profit margins okay really really high profit margin in fact it's so high that you may see some government regulation down the road saying that it's a monopoly okay we don't have to worry about that right now we are going to think how do we make money today and how what's the future look like yes they may have some regulatory issues down the road potentially but that's not something to be really concerned about all right so relax there I'm just trying to give you guys an objective view of the good and the bad because I want you guys to have the full picture all right so last but not least here's what we will do I'm going to jump into my portfolio and uh let's go to uh I'm going to sell a put option I already have a put option that I have sold I'm going to tell you what a good entry is I would probably go for two different expiration days okay one is going to be um one is going to be December 20th and other one will be uh January guys I'm buying this thing hand over fist bicep over tricep all right got to hit the gym a little bit but you know this thing is doing really well it's doing really well and it doesn't have to go to the Moon to make a lot of money I'm doing just fine growing my portfolio to $4 million and a big part of that is just options expiring on Nvidia and just you know monthly expirations so I'm going to sell a put and I'm going to go for something a little bit more aggressive now that earnings have come in we have had an IV Crush okay an IV Crush let me explain to you lots of Education in this video all right and Ivy Crush basically is pre- earnings okay pre- earnings what happens is the stock will have high implied volatility all right so when I showed you guys the call options before earnings uh if I remember correctly this is like a few days ago uh before earnings let me go to the option I was looking at which was the 152 covered call uh the implied volatility was I think it was around 96 if you guys watched that last video which many of you did so I think now it has fallen by half okay the implied volatility has fallen by literally half and that's just a function of before earnings you have one of the highest implied volatility times that a stock can have right and that's because a lot of investors are expecting a big move because there's an expected Big Move implied volatility is higher to account for that expected big move so the options are going to be like twice as expensive which is why buying options before earnings can be very risky but can also be very profitable it's a double-edged sword okay it's a double-edged sword of of what can happen so right now that earnings have already come in implied volatility is low it's less attractive but it's still high enough to make tons of money and because it's still high enough to make tons of money I would simply just stick to the easy wheel strategy that I've been covering for the past 5 years on this YouTube channel we're about to hit my 5year anniversary so I hope that you make another you know thousands and thousands of dollars by just sticking to my simple formula of covered calls all right so what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to look at the 135 you can see here that the Delta is 30 oh my goodness I just picked the random option and it happens to be a 30 Delta which is exactly my sweet spot of what I say is my sweet spot 30 Delta how did I do that well honestly it's just because an out- of-the money option that's just a little bit lower is typically around a 30 Delta right so I just intuitively picked a 135 strike and it happens to be 30 Delta perfect implied volatility 43 that's pretty good uh implied volatility of 43 is is also like a good implied volatility it's it's it's fairly High the volume is amazing it's at 8,600 that means that you're going to get filled in this trade fast as a as a a MF right that's as a mother right uh I don't curse on these videos just trying to make these a little fun today uh the volume is 8600 it's fast you're going to get filled fast bid ask 335 340 that that's that's a perfect tight bid ask that's that's tight as as a bicep curl all right that's tight that's good the tighter the bid ask the better because when it's a wide bit ask spread all right you basically are not going to get um a good fill you have to basically play around with the bid ask spread and most likely than not you're not going to get filled for the best rate which just means that you have slippage costs all right that's what I call slippage cost you're just losing some money it's like it's like a Ferrari it's like you're trying to sell a car a Ferrari or Toyota it doesn't really matter let's just say a Ferrari okay it's a $200,000 car you're trying to sell it on Craigslist now I don't know why you would sell a car on Craigslist a Ferrari but let's say someone comes to you and then they they just say hey I buy it right now for 199,000 you're like dude all right fine right you're not going to say no but you see see that's that's $1,000 slippage cost which is right it's like what 0.5% cuz 1% would be two grand and then he just knocked you down by 1,000 so it's a half a percent loss it's kind of a big deal guys it it kind of adds up when you're making many trades over a single month right if there's a high slippage cost you can be short a couple hundred bucks and in a year that's a few thousand I mean it it really does add up so you want a tight bit ask spread all right so I would go ahead and sell the 135 uh here for December now also for January I would go to January 17 this is the traditional expiration and for January I would also look you can go a little bit lower so for example let me pick the 130 and I bet you this is going to be around a 30 Delta again uh 26 Delta so it's a little bit lower so you can see how I actually went from 135 to 130 but it's even safer like it's literally even a lower Delta so the more time you give an option this is why I do like to do monthly trading and two month Trading is because the more time that you give an option the more premium you collect up front so a lot of you guys that are in that retirement Zone that have a couple hundred, which is uh many of you guys and I work with uh I work with folks oneon-one and I do Zoom chats and I just text them back and forth all Market hours that's what my one-on-one looks like I actually give you my time and I see a lot of folks that have a few hundred, and they're easily just selling puts and creating a really solid income Source right now in this market $10,000 a month is easy it's just easy like I have so many students that are making like 8% 15% 20% in a month and that's it's just an Easy Market I don't assume it'll always be easy there's good times there's bad times there's Seasons right in everything in life right and with Nvidia right now I think it's we're still in the early Innings I don't know if I could say early in Innings but the mid Innings where we're still going to get some more uh momentum upside which is why I'm still planning to cover the stock on a very regular basis and keep you guys up to date if you're subscribed to running covered calls selling puts and just the wheel strategy now let me tell you real quick about how to run the wheel strategy and manage it uh I can show you an example as well so look you sell a put right on Nvidia at 135 or 130 whichever you personally prefer one is not better than the other I just showed you two plays I didn't click it but here let me click it it's $400 in income one is not better than the other guys they're both fine all right they're both meaning that you will have to buy Nvidia at 135 or 130 if Nvidia pops down or declines below those strike prices now look if that happens at expiration you don't need to do anything you don't need to roll anything you don't need to do anything guys I'm a fan of doing less and creating passive safe consistent income I see a lot of people over trading and that's a big mistake and I teach passive income so you want to wait until expiration for these put options that you sell just hang out do do other things in life if it goes below this is how you manage it all right A lot of people want to know oh should you close it should you roll it no no listen when we are selling puts on a high quality company the whole reason we sell puts is because we don't mind owning shares and we want to get paid to own the shares for a cheaper price than the market so if you want to manage it or roll it you just watch too many YouTube videos about you know other folks that tell you you need to manage it and roll it they don't really know what they're talking about what you need to actually do is just to hold the position until expiration get ass signed and then sell covered calls you want to sell covered calls above your average cost so look on Nvidia if the average cost is 130 okay cool what you go do is then you sell call options now these are not going to be accurately priced right now because basically I showed you the 130 and in the future if it were to be 130 these options would be worth less right just they would be worth less like if I were to go down to the $130 it's not going to be worth $17 that's $1,700 it's going to be worth a lot less maybe it's $400 $500 who knows uh right now but nonetheless you want to sell covered calls at your average cost or above so if you got it at 130 then you're just going to sell 135 covered calls and essentially you're just going to collect premium and then if it goes up to 135 it's fine guys it is it's fine you you made money okay you don't need to do too much if you follow my strategies they're very easy to print money with doing less work that's that's my strategy and that's what I teach on this YouTube channel if you guys have questions feel free to email me down below I'm going to add my email if you want one-on-one coaching I am the only and best one-on-one coach on option trading and I can show you how to make $10,000 or more per month if you guys want one-on-one coaching I still have 12 spots left for one-on-one coaching this year it has been an amazing journey with all my one-on-one students many of them doctors Lord Engineers but you can be anyone you can just be a hardworking professional or someone that's close to retirement that wants to create a big source of income really scale up their portfolio and just wants to you know really learn these strategies I teach I show I show you how to fish but I also give you fish so this is the best program that if you want to scale up especially in these times I think there's so much money to be made these next three months like legitimately I hit $4 million in my portfolio in this market we might even hit 4.2 million 4.5 million in the next couple CP of months right times are good so yeah take advantage of these times stay safe invest safe and thanks so much

I would say that paler is still one of my very favorite positions and actually I'm going to make a live trade right now on palen here it's finally a time when the Market's open it's late in the evening for me but the Market's open so we're going to make it now check this out on paler right now my average cost is $21.7 this is a very low price compared to the stock obviously at $60 per share it's at 61.89 right so I'm going to show you how to get a much more favorable price now guys just to remind you real quick I'm not going to spend too much time on why I like Palante here but the three reasons are one I see a lot of billionaires buying this stock right we I've taken a look at Ken Griffin of Citadel he posted his 13f not that he wants to post it but big uh organizations hedge funds when they have $100 million in assets they have to report what they're buying and what they're selling so Ken Griffin he's buying palons here hand over fist guys hand over fist he's buying this stock and I think that that's going to be a really interesting Catalyst because he increased his position by 1,00% and guys you know earnings is not soon on pound here but I'm already starting on this channel I'm already beginning 2 and a half months early mark my words we're going to have some amazing earnings coming up and I'm going to give you a price Target in a future video if you're subscribed to this one today we just want to cover how to sell puts and enter into paler for a good price and get that runup because I think due to the Trump rally as well as you know just end of year stuff I do see the market continuing to rise we're in full-fledged bull market mode guys the market I see is very hot and I'm actually not worried right now I think we're going to get a really hot rally as well as the January effect so the January effect is something that a lot of experts call and anomaly and basically this January effect anomaly means the stock market goes up in January so hey guys for the next couple of months we have to make as much money as possible hand over fist guys hand over fist all right the second reason is topping estimates I saw that the revenue for palen here was astronomically High I've already sent in another video we went $20 million more than expected and then the third reason is and I already mentioned it is actually the earnings coming up okay so look I have over 300K invested in Palance here right now this has been a big position for me in this portfolio and um I'm still very bullish so look check out my positions right now guys I think that the most optimal entry for palent here there's actually two optimal entries the first one let me tell you is the 55 cell put I would easily sell 55 cell put go as much as 10% of your portfolio I think 10% of your portfolio in Palance here is honestly a no-brainer I wouldn't say that that's anything crazy or anything like out of the norm right we want to have 10 to 15 stocks in our portfolio that's just a typical and stand standard amount because when I was covering risk management back in college I was taking a risk management course the numbers showed that 12 stocks in your portfolio is basically Diversified if you get 13 14 15 stocks yeah you get a little bit of benefit but it's diminishing returns think about it as you eat a first hamburger you're really hungry that first hand Burger tastes like heaven right you're like oh God thank you so much for this hamburger but the second hamburger you're like well this is still good the third hamburger you don't want to eat it cuz you're full right the same thing with diversification that's the same way that it works you get diminishing returns which is one of the standard PR principles in economics hopefully I'm not talking too fast I just want to hit you guys with some fast um actionable insights on paler and how to make more money cuz I do respect your time so um we're going to keep this video short 55 cell put on paler that's what I would do for 1220 let me actually show you why I'm doing that right I'm going to go to trade paler options and I'm going to go to sell put option I'm going to show you the Delta because I think Delta is really important to understand when it comes to paler and any any option that you trade knowing Delta tells you so much about the option a Delta tells you the chance is that the option will go down to that price okay so if I go to the 55 option right here I'm going to open up some more watch I'm going to open up a lot more pounds here right in front of your eyes I have 300K into the stock I'm going to open up some more right now just to show you how much I support this stock and how much I believe in it. I don't make videos on stocks I don't believe even if I can get a lot of views on this channel I do not do that I'm not going to sell out I'm only going to tell you stocks that I 100% I have my money in that's it if I'm not talk if I don't have my money in it I'm not going to recommend it to you guys I'm not going to cover that stock that's not how I am for me it's all about the truth. So here's the 55 cell put look the Delta is 0. 21 that means that there's a 21% chance of Palance here reaching this price which honestly I you know that that means there's an 80% chance of me being successful I have an 80% success chance on this trade and a 21% chance that basically palent here will go below 55 but I'm not concerned $55 per share guys is a phenomenal price selling put options is what I personally call a non- losing strategy that's what I want for you guys I want you to have that safe passive income but I also want you guys to have non losing traits cuz I hate it when you know investors they go into a trade they lose money no I want to put you in trades that are so easy to make money that you just basically profit and you don't have to do too much work okay that's why selling puts for me you're going to get an optimal entry into Palance here and that's where you really maximize profits if you're looking to maximize profits you don't always want to buy the stock at the current you know price so instead of buying it at 6181 I already covered a video on leaps but I'm also going to just say we're going to sell a 55 uh put option right here and you know I said I'm going to go big guys I said I'm going to go big so let me go let me go 20 contracts here and let me see that's going to be 107k bet and I'm going to collect some income right here and most importantly the income is nice guys that's cool but what's really cool is if pounds here pulls back to 55 56 I'm going to look like a genius because I'm getting paid to wait that's one of my sets I'm getting paid to wait or I'm getting paid to enter so either paid to wait or paid to enter either way this is going to be a beneficial position so I'm going to go for 1.37 just because I want to I want to do this quick I'm going to go closer to the bid I can go for 1.38 but I'm trying to get filled fast so I got 16 contracts filled right there boom I got 20 contracts filled. I just showed you a really good play on Palance here now I'm going to show you more of that safe passive income approach where uh you can have both guys you can have both you can have the 55 sellp put but you can also go for the 50 this would be a really low Delta now to be honest the 55 is going to make you a lot more money but I'm just going to show this for some of the retirees okay so 50 cell put I'm going to go continue and I think this is good to have diversification across different expiration days. I just want to show you this example and I want to put my money where my mouth is and go heavier on pents here this is going to be U I'm going to get $335 nothing crazy but look when you have positions like this on Tesla on Nvidia you guys know that I've I've been right all along with Tesla Nvidia and Palance here so I just post posted that trade you see now I have three contracts sh that I sold short this is a very low Delta if you want higher income I would go for the 55 Delta if you want really high Del uh actually let me give you a third play right now uh 60 cellp put would also be fantastic entry guys it would be fantastic uh entry this is a little bit higher on the Delta this is a little bit higher than my sweet spot my sweet spot is 30 Delta here the Delta is a little higher than what I like but still this would be a very good entry and $4 this would be over about 7% return in 60 days okay a 7% return I just know 7 * 6 is 42 and this is 425 so we're at little bit over 7% return if I click this right here you'll see that I have to put up about $5,500 worth of uh Capital now let me tell you why the the strike price here is 60 but I'm collecting about 425 which makes my total Capital outlay 5,575 don't worry about the max loss the max loss is incorrect that Max loss just means if pound here went down to zero you would lose 55 $0000 but paler is not going to zero so forget about that you don't have to worry about it it's not going to happen so there we go that's the place that I would have to maximize paler and have a better entry into paler stock right now versus just buying the shares and I think that this stock is going to have really good performance.",1.0,0.9

paler Nvidia I'm about to cover these stocks right now in Tesla use these strategies on high quality companies that are growing use it that's the secret sauce you will scale from 100K to 500k if you just use those strategies and use them on the proper stocks I would use paler Nvidia Tesla I would also use some other high flying companies that have good momentum but still very solid fundamentals I would use leap options all across the board let me start off with Tesla Tesla for me honestly like looking at what Elon Musk is doing Elon Musk has influence in the white house if you don't think that's going to affect Tesla positively you're out of your mind Tesla is going to get a big Boost from the regulatory side I don't know to what extent right I said in my last video I don't know to what extent but I'm very bullsh on Tesla Tesla's currently at $320 per share my average cost is $218 per share told you guys to get in but I still think there's opportunity here so if you want to scale up from like 100 K to 500k I do think Tesla will be a$2 trillion company you can watch my full analysis on Tesla I believe it'll be $2 trillion in probably in the next two years and what you should be doing is just honestly doing some leap options so let me show you an example I'm going to go to trade I'm going to go to buy call I'm going to go and just buy a leap option a leap option is just anything long-term okay a long-term call option essentially so a long-term call option technically is 180 days out it's 200 days out so all of these expirations right here would be perfectly viable now I'm going to go for September 19 I just like September 19 I think it's a good expiration date well my uh screen there changed dark mode uh I think SE uh September 19 is really good so I'm going to go for something that's already in the money now guys the reason why you want to go in the money is because it gives you that upside if you go for an out-of-the money option the facts say that options typically expire out of the money so an out ofth money option is not going to be really your best bet if you want profitability and you want to scale your portfolio from 100K to 500k or really anywhere from 50k to 100K whatever right whatever your big goals are I encourage you that it is possible you you will make it happen if you properly trade if you properly get in with proper Delta out of- the money options not really suitable I don't recommend them and I don't personally use them and I have not really used them to grow my wealth the way I've grown a lot of my wealth is by going for in the money uh so for example I would go for something like let me just expand this 73 Delta perfect it's like I have another sense for these options I know know pretty much exactly what I'm looking for which is a 70 Delta right I picked a 73 Delta I already knew that because this option is pretty much in the money by a lot but it's not super like crazy in the money this is just in the money by about $45 so 25 and then Tesla's at 320 so this is currently $45 in the money that's pretty good and you can see how if you had to buy 100 shares of Tesla it would be $32,000 it'd be 100 shares of 320 but this 275 call is going for $9,300 so in my opinion I mean you're spending onethird of the cost versus buying 100 shares what do you think is going to happen you if it goes up you're going to get a huge leverage Factor you're putting up onethird of the capital three times less and you still get to control one shares that's why like sometimes I debate back in the day when I was buying shares I honestly debated that options can just completely replace shares altogether because an option gives you control of 100 shares So when you buy a call option you have access to 100 shares it honestly doesn't even make sense all the time to own shares when you can own a leap option I'll give you two different Variations by the way because right now you might still be thinking to yourself well you know this option's expensive and it doesn't exactly move like stock let me explain very very simply the 275 call option right here it's going for $9,300 and the Delta is73 that means if Tesla goes up like 10 bucks this option is going to go up by like s bucks so it's moving similar to shares very similar actually but not exactly because shares if it moves up a dollar you make a dollar but on an option if the stock goes up a dollar because your Delta is73 you'll make 70 cents however you make a dollar on the shares here you make 70 cents but you only put up $9,000 instead of $30,000 so70 on one3 of the capital technically is like $210 I'm multiplying 70 cents by three you can see it on the screen because well we're only putting up about 10 grand versus 30 grand so if if I were to do three of these leap options that would then be 30 grand like buying 100 shares therefore if I do three of these I literally control about $21 cents for each $1 move in the stock so basically if the stock goes up a dollar this leap option goes up 70 but because a sleep option is like basically three times cheaper than owning shares that means I can own three leap options and if I were to compare 100 shares versus three leap options the three leap options will actually be 2.1 times stronger on the upside okay because the Delta here is about 7 so I'm just multiplying 7 by three times which is about 2.1 so I actually get double the strength for the same amount of money that's why leap options are so powerful okay let me actually show you a different little variation here though if I were to go for something like the 200 strike you can see this is a lot more expensive but it's literally now 88 so this is about the same if not very very similar to just the stock itself so when the stock moves up a dollar this leap option is going to look pretty much like stock there's almost no difference except you get to put up a lot less capital in fact half of the capital so this wouldn't be as good because you can kind of do the math for yourself here this is about half the cost of Tesla if I were to buy 100 shares I can pretty much do two of these leap options for the same price as 100 shares and 2 * .9 is 1.8 so here I get 1.8 which is like I get 180% of owning 100 shares so in the first example we got 210% and here we got 180% long story short basically buying leap options gives you control and upside on the stock so hopefully you guys understood that I'll make a lot more simple examples now so look one of the most important things that I want to tell you about is that with Tesla for example my parents they bought Tesla 4 years ago when Tesla was at a peak now my parents are doing okay but they definitely have that Soviet Union mentality where they're afraid to invest their like savings right they have some money in real estate because they believe in hard assets more than option trading and stocks but options are way better because they don't take much time so I always try to convince them of that and they've recently realized yes options are better because Tesla went up and they're like we made so much money I'm like yes but you would have made more money had you dollar cost averaged okay so here's how you can actually dollar cost average not just with stocks but with options as well okay I'm giving you guys a lot of new information you can actually dollar cost average into leap options so let's say that you buy a leap option like I just showed you right you can actually buy a leap option every single month or every single two weeks as you have money available you can dollar cost average into a leap option just like you dollar cost average into shares so so literally I am bullish on Tesla I'm bullish on paler which I'll cover in a moment and I'm also bullish on Nvidia so what I would be doing if you want aggressive growth and you don't mind the risk Please be aware that buying options has risk because when the stock market goes down these options will be worth less now because they're so deep in the money and they are very similar to stock you are unlikely to lose the entire premium you're not likely to because these are very deep in the money options like Tesla's not going to go to 200 but you can can lose money if we enter a bare market and I will tell you one thing when I was working on Wall Street and I was I basically had multiple jobs and all of the people that I worked with all basically said the same thing because they were all making tons and tons of money you can't just be in the top three companies like paler Nvidia and Tesla that I cover on this channel you can't you still need the other stocks that I cover I don't cover them on YouTube they're not as popular but the other stocks that I cover are just widely Just Blue Chip stocks like there's nothing crazy about them I buy good quality Blue Chip stocks because I studied Finance I have a degree in this stuff and after like reading every single waren Buffett book after being mentored on Wall Street I realized that blue chips are kind of like that cheat code to scaling your portfolio just like I told you on Tesla buying leaps on Tesla and buying bull call spreads on Tesla has literally printed money in the Discord Community I was just thinking about one thing just I got to share this right guys I like taking risk I personally like taking risk I'm a risk taker and that's why I've had a lot of good results is cuz I use calculated risk right and I have my own coaches I'm still in contact with folks on on Wall Street I still get coaching from you know former Goldman Sachs professionals who are really freaking high up because I understand the power of mentorship like I'm still learning I'm still improving guys I'm I'm 10 years at this game and I'm still getting better I think that's what makes me the best on YouTube because the only people that are better than me are definitely not on YouTube they're professionals that have already have eight figureure Network they've already made it they've made it way more than me I have mentors that are way richer than me and that's what you want that's that's what I want I want to look up to people and I want to grow to the next level and I'm bringing all that wealth and all that knowledge to you guys here on YouTube cuz I don't see anyone else doing that all the other YouTubers they're taking my wheel strategy and they're regurgitating and copying my content but that's not how you actually improve guys you need to improve by actually getting better by picking the right Stocks by picking the right Delta by understanding rolling I made a recent video on rolling by using leaps by diversifying by there's just so many things that that we can improve on the risk management side of things when do we get out of a position all of these stuff by the way it's always something that I am improving it's always something that I'm getting 1% better I'm always trying to get 1% better when it comes to my trading because if you can avoid even one big mistake per year and get a little bit better at the wheel strategy and managing it and and picking the right stocks

you can't just be in the top three companies like paler Nvidia and Tesla that I cover on this channel you can't you still need the other stocks that I cover I don't cover them on YouTube they're not as popular but the other stocks that I cover are just widely Just Blue Chip stocks like there's nothing crazy about them I buy good quality Blue Chip stocks because I studied Finance I have a degree in this stuff and after like reading every single waren Buffett book after being mentored on Wall Street I realized that blue chips are kind of like that cheat code to scaling your portfolio I'm looking at my notes here because the next stock that I want to cover is paler I'm just really fired up like it's evening and I'm still fired up because the opportunity is just so big it's so big right now on paler we've made so much money on paler it feels it honestly feels like we're printing money and the results that they've come out with like 30% year-over-year Revenue growth insane us commercial growth 44% and I've said guys that the commercial growth is probably more important than the government contract growth because it's all about expectations the market is about expectations because the market already expects Palante here to win you guys aren't being you're not Geniuses and neither am I a genius to say oh paler is going to do good with government contracts duh they're going to do good of course they're going to do good they've been doing good so it's this isn't a risky bet so the market already has that baked in guys it's already baked in like a pie it's already priced in that if it's priced in you can't make money the way you make money is when something is not priced in I personally believe that the commercial growth for paler is not fully priced in now I'm not saying that paler is going to explode as a stock in the near future because it has already done some exploding but in the longer term I would sell put options on Palance here so I showed you a buy leap option on Tesla because I think Tesla has a clear path to two trillion with palen here we also have a clear path here to a lot of gains but because we're currently at $66 per share and I'm up a whopping $228,000 on this stock which is hey if You'been part of the channel you already know Uncle Henry picks the best stocks the best stocks for you to make money you already know you already know all right we're going to stop bragging and we're going to get to the facts the facts are palen here I believe will go into some sideways action for the near term and in 2025 it will reach $80 or more in the near term I would look for a better entry I mean guys how can I get excited about paler when the stock is up 11% in a day I don't want to be a fool I don't want you to be foolish with your money you worked really hard for your money that means that I want to respect your money like I respect your time and I can't say that you should buy call options or go too aggressive on paler right now you should look for optimal entry and you should maximize your profits as much as possible and for paler I would say that we want to look for an entry around $60 per share okay because if we can get in 60 I do think that's a decent margin of safety to own the stock so what I would do is I would go for January 17 um I would look for a shorter term pullback to jump into the stock but you know selling $60 puts right here they're going for $340 so you will tie up about you know $5,500 $ and you're going to make about $300 for doing that I would say that the return here isn't massive but it is a good return of a few hundred to get assigned on Palance here if Palance here goes down you will thank me later because if you are going to own shares and it goes down you get hurt right away but if it goes down and you have a margin of safety like right here p is at 66 if you sell a 60 put for $ 340 worth of Premium I mean you tell me what's better you already know right if someone has a $66 per share shares and it goes down to 55 well that person lost $11 right 66 to 55 is 11 bucks but if you sold the 60 put for $ 340 I mean it goes to $55 per share you'll be down $160 but you're really not down that much you're only down 160 bucks whereas other guy the shareholder is down ,00 right 11,100 so $1,100 where you're down 160 I mean that's literally like a 10x difference so it is a 10x difference now if paler decides to take off a lot more I will show you one I'll show let me show you a buying strategy play which you you can run because I do think paler I do think it can hit $70 per share so I would do a bull call spread all right let me explain this all right now I hope this video is jam-packed with a lot of info so I know it's going a little bit longer but I'm hitting you with strategies and I'm hitting you with what I think will make money so you know look 65 right here if you buy okay let's go to buy 65 okay we can buy the 65 call option okay that's going to be kind of expensive but then if we sell the 70 call option this right here this will help you scale your portfolio fast like you will take 100K to 200 to 300 to 400 even if you're using a portion of your portfolio for a strategy like this call debit spread which I call the bull call spread okay they're just two two different names right they're same thing look if you buy the 65 call and you sell the 70 call you're subsidizing the cost of the 65 call with the 70 call so you're going to be having a total cost of $220 but you have a total reward here of 500 you're putting up 220 to make 500 this isn't a 60-day period this is two months guys that means if you're putting a portion of your bigger portfolio like 5K into this position that 5K can be 10K right in 60 days obviously you don't put in too much money into this position because we use our mind here and we diversify and we have 10 positions at least least in our portfolio but this right here it's it's a powerful strategy buying a bull call spread on a high momentum stock like paler which has 30% Revenue growth right has 44% us commercial growth the guidance by the way is freaking fantastic from Wall Street which is really important guys that's also why I'm still bullish on pal here is because the guidance is strong guidance future okay that's what people care about people don't care about the past many of you guys have already forgotten that I put literally tens of thousands of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars in your pocket with all these plays we're thinking now what's going to happen in the future and I understand that guys it's human nature so I'm here to provide that value and tell you how we can get even richer how we can get more money and that is going to come from guidance guidance on paler strong which is very important I mean if you're looking to scale your portfolio you got to take some aggressive bets you're not going to get rich uh aggressively by just selling options with 100% of your money if you really want to scale and I mean scale quick like I did you are going to have to do some smarter and more aggressive buying strategies and I think that this could be a really good buying strategy just like I told you on Tesla buying leaps on Tesla and buying bull call spreads on Tesla has literally printed money in the Discord Community I was just thinking about one thing just I got to share this right guys I like taking risk I personally like taking risk I'm a risk taker and that's why I've had a lot of good results is cuz I use calculated risk right and I have my own coaches I'm still in contact with folks on on Wall Street I still get coaching from you know former Goldman Sachs professionals who are really freaking high up because I understand the power of mentorship like I'm still learning I'm still improving guys I'm I'm 10 years at this game and I'm still getting better I think that's what makes me the best on YouTube because the only people that are better than me are definitely not on YouTube they're professionals that have already have eight figureure Network they've already made it they've made it way more than me I have mentors that are way richer than me and that's what you want that's that's what I want I want to look up to people and I want to grow to the next level and I'm bringing all that wealth and all that knowledge to you guys here on YouTube cuz I don't see anyone else doing that all the other YouTubers they're taking my wheel strategy and they're regurgitating and copying my content but that's not how you actually improve guys you need to improve by actually getting better by picking the right Stocks by picking the right Delta by understanding rolling I made a recent video on rolling by using leaps by diversifying by there's just so many things that that we can improve on the risk management side of things when do we get out of a position all of these stuff by the way it's always something that I am improving it's always something that I'm getting 1% better I'm always trying to get 1% better when it comes to my trading because if you can avoid even one big mistake per year and get a little bit better at the wheel strategy and managing it and and picking the right stocks before earnings by the way if you're at this far in the video I want to give you a little Golden Nugget that I'm about to cover on Nvidia stock because Nvidia has earnings very soon if you're watching this in the future every time a stock has earnings it's very important but specifically I'm going to make a Nvidia video uh right before earnings here because that's going to be a big big opportunity okay when it comes to a stock that reports earnings that is the golden opportunity for you to make fast cash okay if you're looking for fast cash fast money Goldman Sachs actually uh came out uh with some research that said 3 days before earnings you should be buying call options so that's what I'm going to be covering in tomorrow's video make sure that you're subscribed if this video is already getting old and you're watching this in the future always prepare for earnings be very Vigilant on earnings okay let me show you right now what I'm going to be looking at when it comes to earnings I'm going to use Nvidia because before earnings happens I always try to understand how big will the earnings be in comparison to the expectations I don't care how big actual earnings will be I care how different it will be from expectations because when you get a shock from expect ations that's when you get a big move in the stock I have a really small position on Nvidia in this portfolio because my other portfolio is where I have a few thousand shares of Nvidia and this portfolio I'm taking it a little bit light I mean it's $42,000 it's not that light but it's fairly light and what I'm looking at right now if I scroll down with Robin Hood they do have several interesting and analyst ratings and stuff I'm My Own analyst guys I don't look at analyst ratings I'm My Own analyst I listen to myself I don't look at really too many analysts you know it could be an interesting opinion but I listen to myself and my own research at the end of the day look at these earnings this is actually really interesting because Nvidia has met earnings each time one but it did meet earnings here but here it beats earnings beats earnings beats earnings met earnings beats earnings I have a really good feeling of what's going to happen next mark my words and I'm going to you know what I'll just cover it tomorrow's video not to leave you on a cliffhanger I just feel like it's not that relevant to this video on scaling let me give you this short summary I'm going to explain it more in the other video I feel bad leaving this this video without telling you I think that Nvidia will beat earnings but I think the stock won't move up that much I'll give you the full explanation later but in general what you want to look for and Nvidia doesn't really have this pattern right now it doesn't really have this pattern is you want to see three consecutive huge beats which is not the case for NVIDIA let me show you a different stock I'm going to find a different stock that has actually P here I think pal here will be a good example I'm going to show you pal here Nvidia doesn't quite have that Trend paler has it like crazy pal here has huge beats you see the difference here is massive massive massive massive and massive when you see massive beats that's a much better indicator and I would jump into three days three-day uh call options three days before earnings because Goldman Sachs already proved that that strategy returned 95% in a week during earnings weeks so it's a little bit longer of a story because obviously that is on a larger set of data and every single study that they have is obviously to some degree obviously with data you can cherry pick so I'll go over that in a future video if you're interested comment down below sorry if there was some rambling in this video I obviously it's late for me but I wanted to give you guys as much jam-packed value as possible and give you as much insight to help you improve your trading make sure you subscribe and I'm going to put an important video on the screen for you guys to watch if you have some time right now",0.98,0.65

Invest with Henry,Jql1SyWuW_w,2024-11-15T18:41:03Z,URGENT: Nvidia Stock (NVDA) Shareholders Need to Do THIS ASAP!,Nvidia,"are you still trading Nvidia or holding Nvidia because Nvidia is honestly still one of the best stocks. It's been a few weeks and we have to talk about what I'm doing with Nvidia cuz I'm up over $1,000 on options. Nvidia is actually still one of the best stocks and right now it's actually at a perfect setup to do multiple different option strategies so I'm going to show you my portfolio because look right now I have shares but look at all these options positions. All right so look on Nvidia I'm about to print even more money. The easiest strategy on Nvidia is going to be selling put options. I've been selling put options on Nvidia for some time now because I've been buying Nvidia bicep over trip guys. I've been buying this thing like no other. I'm going to be selling new put options on Nvidia looking for a new entry. I've also been doing covered calls guys for the past 10 years I've been trading options and for the past 5 years I've been making YouTube videos and I started off with the wheel strategy I've been teaching the wheel strategy from the very Geto because that is the safest strategy the wheel strategy is a combination of selling puts and covered calls on the same stock. I've been running both of these simple and easy strategies on Nvidia and I think that right now it is still not I think it's absolutely still a good time to run it on Nvidia and I'm going to do that again and I'm going to be doing it for December expiration and as my options approach expiration in December I'm going to be selling more options for January. First of all for NVIDIA expiring this Friday okay as I'm making this video I'm going to sell some more put options except now I'm going to do it at 135 strike so I'll come back to these options in a moment let me just show you some Nvidia options by going to sell put I'm going to go for December now look you guys already know the reason I want to buy Nvidia is because AI Innovation they're price to earnings multiple is actually very reasonable. Nvidia is actually a very similar story and I think Nvidia stock will be about $200 per share in 2025. I think we can see another 33% pop in the stock okay. If Nvidia goes up 33% you will absolutely double or triple or even quadruple we'll take a look at the exact example your portfolio so by being an Nvidia you will make way more than 33% in 2025 if the stock goes up 33% which I think is kind of like a base case like my base case is NVIDIA will ride up by 33%. I mean we've had over 200% in a year right so 33% I'm really not asking for too much. I'm very confident I'm good at my trading skills so I'm not really asking for anything just based on my view and based on my belief I think we can probably honestly double a portfolio we can double a portfolio or double the investment we make in Nvidia. So look Nvidia I'm going to sell put I'm going to go for December 20th and I'm just going to look for entry I'm going to show you the option that I was looking at I was looking at the 135. That's why I'm trading Nvidia and Tesla that's why I'm making a boatload of money because I'm following where the money goes where the money's flowing I try to go there right. I'm looking for entry in Nvidia and I'm not scared at all I'm not scared whatsoever. If you sell a put option that's out of the money and you get assigned on Nvidia at 135 when nvidia's at 147 you're going to be winning because you're getting a $12 discount paid you're getting paid up front literally the cash enter is your account you can take that money and go to Whole Foods with it once it's in your account you've gotten paid now you just have an obligation to buy Nvidia at 13 5 but what's wrong with that obligation like tell me what is wrong when you have to buy Nvidia which is a good quality stock at 135. I would say on Nvidia I would jump in buy a 100 shares and then do a covered call at 150. You don't want to miss out on Nvidia okay. This is just one of my safer easier place. If Nvidia goes up which I think it will this option is going to profit a lot. For uh Nvidia January 2025 this right here has um has subsidized my cost of the 120 call. By simply selling options on Nvidia. Because if Nvidia pulls back let's go back to Nvidia you'll be very safe especially with the cell put. The cell put that I showed you for 135 you'll be safe the covered call that I showed you for 150 you'll be fairly safe because when the market pulls back you have more margin of safety.",1.0,1.0

much more money there is still to be made in this wonderful company in this video I'm going to break down how you can still make more money on Tesla given that we are now post election and with the Federal Reserve meeting this window of opportunity is closing so there isn't much time that we have here to still capitalize on this opportunity we can't afford to wait there's a setup that I really want you to get into so I'm not going to waste any of your time I respect your time let's jump right into it watch this quick clip on Gan monster and what he said about Tesla because this is going to be an absolute game Cher If Tesla gains 50% share of the US ride sharing Market by 2030 which actually I think is is a reasonable Target we'll save that discussion for another day but that would add about 20% to operating income and so Stock's up 15% that adds 20% now they can take this in other parts of the world but a lot of it got priced in in a hurry I'm a big believer and what that means the one piece that maybe wasn't priced in today is that if they sell more Robo taxis elon's talking about 2 to four million a year ultimately that'd be about a third of total Tesla deliveries I'll take the under on that I think it's probably closer to one to two but uh that's another piece so Melissa to answer your question I think that this kind of Fairly reflected or started to price in some of the robo taxi opportunity yeah and that's where analysts and and so many wall streeters got so bullish after that cyber cab event um that's where they sort of said you know the the market cap could be X Y and Z above what it is right now guys check it out Tesla has been on an absolute tear and we need to talk about this I have 1,000 shares of Tesla I made $121,000 in a really short amount of time on Tesla stock and specifically I think that the market cap is going to reach $2 trillion now why do I think that well actually this is a thought from Gan monster as well as many other investors on Wall Street they're looking at Tesla and they're predicting that the stock will have a total market capitalization of 2 trillion right now Tesla's at around 1.1 trillion so I'm going to be sharing my research with you and going down the list of what the opportunities are in Tesla and what I'm specifically going to be doing with the stock because right now the stock I'm up $120,000 in a short amount of time a lot of my options right here are just put options I do not have covered calls I'm letting my shares completely run and that's been the best decision that I've made this year so far and I think there's still a lot more money that we can make here so look check it out a lot of this actually has to do with Robo taxes which I want to cover as my long-term thesis but first I want to go over my short-term thesis because you might not have time to watch this whole video so let's just first give you the the whole blueprint the summary of the short-term thesis the short-term thesis is this Elon Musk is an active supporter and campaigner for Trump in the election that equals power okay now that Trump's in the White House and Elon Musk and Trump are like buddy budddy that's going to be a very big uh benefit to Tesla now I don't know to what extent but I'm telling you there is going to be influence and power and that's going to translate into some regulatory stuff that's going to translate into Tesla stock having a really really good four years like I said Elon Musk will have influence over the White House and you know maybe this has nothing to do with the business of Tesla but it's going to impact Tesla indirectly all right now I also want to say that in Trump we musk okay I saw that quot or comment somewhere and I thought it was really funny in Trump we musk okay so given this relationship I think there going to be the best four years of Tesla and also just looking at you know obviously politics are really important if you think politics don't play a huge role in making money you're absolutely out of your mind politics is money it's a business everything's a business doctor's a business everything's a business right politics is especially a business and I think politics is really important for Tesla due to regul regulatory actions right as well as EV tax credits right EV tax credits have been a huge contributor to eveve adoption and they're going to be going away which I actually mentioned in my last Tesla video before Tesla was over $300 per share you can watch that video but just visiting my channel that EV tax credits are going to have a big impact on Tesla now let me tell you because I've gotten a lot of questions and myself as a financial analyst I used to be a financial analyst on Wall Street let me tell you what I think about the valuation and because I've analyzed Tesla's numbers and I think the valuation I have a lot of thoughts to it okay so here let me go down through my research this is from the research that I've done I spent a lot of hours on this all right Tesla's forward PE ratio is jawdropping guys it's like its PE ratio is 100 that means for every dollar that they're earning you are paying 100 times to own this stock okay that is jaw-dropping numbers now look to put that into perspective look at Nvidia Nvidia is a fantastic growth stock right it's only at 39 times earnings and even giants like Microsoft and Amazon they also sit in P ratios of well below 50 okay the best companies in the world the fastest growing are below 50 Teslas at 100 the valuation on just from the fronts right if you're just looking at it from the front view it's shocking it's alarming right I am concerned however let me point out something very important when it comes to Tesla and how I made a lot of money and why I think there's still more room to run for the stock folks it's very simple all right this stock doesn't trade on fundamentals it trades on momentum which is something I've covered a lot on this channel and I've actually had my momentum wheel strategy which I think a lot of you guys saw my momentum wheel straty this stock is running on momentum okay momentum is the biggest force in the market it's kind of like gravity but the opposite right we're pulling up right now and we want to ride that momentum it's like a wave okay you don't have to have the biggest boat to benefit from a you know a wave the wave goes up you're all all Rising boats there that quote right all tides all high tides rise boats right so this stock is going to continue to run and I think it's going to continue to run to $500 per share because of Elon Musk his campaign support and Trump in the election which is going to equal power his influence over the White House to some degree I don't know to what degree right I'm not a predictor of politics I'm not even a political guy I could care less right I'm trying to put some money in your pocket I'm trying to gain more wealth I'm trying to do you know I'm not trying I'm the best option trading coach that's my goal right I don't care about so I don't know to what degree although I do think that there will be some influence there now I've talked about fundamentals because that's obviously what you know I've been doing on Wall Street for some time right I I wasn't on Wall Street for the longest time I didn't see a point I wanted to be investor as fast as possible if you want to make money the best way to make money is working for yourself and investing it's not working for someone else and it's not paying high taxes all right so look Tesla I have sold put right now I'm letting my shares run I would say right now if you're thinking about jumping into Tesla I would honestly aggressively sell put options because I am tempted to buy the stock as it goes to $500 per share in the next you know 2025 2026 but right now it makes a lot of sense to sell puts and I would aggressively sell puts so if I go to trade Tesla options I would break all my rules because right now we want to ride momentum and there's two ways to ride momentum okay here's the first way first way I would just sell puts short term you can sell puts for next week and you can go for an aggressive put sell just to get just to acquire shares right now look unfortunately the big momentum Spike has already happened right everyone has already made money I've made six figures and I have Tesla two portfolios I made multiple six figures on Tesla by not doing covered calls by simply just having the stock okay I decided that back when Tesla was around 250 per share that there was enough momentum for me that I couldn't really ignore it what I thought about was Tesla is going to have upside I don't know how much I did not feel comfortable selling covered calls therefore I actually bought back my covered call and I let my shares ride the same thing I've done for paler okay Tesla and Palante here are two stocks I've been absolutely 100% correct on and I've let both ride okay I'm super thankful because given election I was really bullish on on the results I I pretty much knew who was going to win and I thought that would be a bullish move which is why I've been telling you guys buy options actually lately do covered calls sell puts get 100% into the market that's what I've been saying right that's why we have so many students right now that are making like 8% 10% per month in fact here's a student actually that has been with me for a few months now and here's his results so far here to date I am up around $200,000 and I started my portfolio with around $90,000 at the beginning of this year I think that the most helpful thing has been the community the community the the the coaches being there to resolve my questions my doubts sometimes it can be a little scary at the beginning because you're talking about a lot lot of money so being behind people that already gone through uh those learning paths and are very willing to show you and share with you uh the their insight and their most important in strategies it's really really helpful so I did my homework before joining I almost joined another Discord which at the end was a fake one or or not a a one with this kind of great leadership uh and so the other thing that I would say is there's a high Roi on investing in this community I mean the the amount of knowledge and insight you will get from joining this community will very easily pay the investment you will make all right guys so look I'm going to sell puts at 330 all right I'm going to just hold on to my stock that's all I'm doing sell puts aggressively don't even worry about Delta well the Delta here is actually .3 so this actually goes according to my sweet spot I actually thought this would be a higher Delta this is only3 so that's actually perfect go for 3.4 Delta if you want to acquire Tesla stock if you're already in Tesla stock just let the shares run if you have covered calls roll those covered calls up okay watch the recent video I've had on rolling because you want to roll to make more money there's a lot of things to do with Tesla there's just a whole lot of money to be made I can make this video super long but I'm trying to be as efficient as possible because I respect your time let me cover my long-term thesis I've told you my short-term thesis I've told you why I've told you how much I think is going to happen and I and I even gave you that fundamental breakdown now look you know this is this is my long-term thesis here so here's a long-term thesis I personally assume that Tesla's going to have about 1 million Robo taxis over the next 5 years okay over the next 5 years I think we're going to see driverless cars just driving us around okay that's scary and I kind of don't want to get into a driverless car but nonetheless economically it's going to happen right because not having a driver and having the car drive you means that a there's going to be a lot of people that want to get in on business are going to buy Tesla like crazy and then B at the end of the day I mean people want to save money right unless you have money falling from the sky you want to probably save money right for the most part I think 90% of people or or or more right given the choice of a uh you know $45 ride with a with a person or a $27 ride with the Tesla I think people are going to pick the $27 ride right because that is a decent amount of savings that's a whole lunch right there right so people are going to have free lunch I guess which in economics the principle of the first one of the first lessons of Economics is there is no free lunch but I think because Tesla literally has such lower costs it's going to actually provide like a free lunch in terms of like the cost savings that there's going to be a million Robo taxis over the next 5 years and let's just say people are estimating $200,000 per year on these Robo taxis let let me just say the low end we're going to have $100,000 so look 1 million Robo taxis $100,000 per year that's going to be a $100 billion of Revenue now Tesla might achieve $40 net margin uh which I think is comparable to you know software like margins a lot of software companies do have 40% net margin all right and since Tesla could earn both on the subscription of you know the Tesla autonomous vehicle as well as you know other revenue streams I don't know all the revenue streams are going to have but I think it's going to be around 40% that would basically be you can see on the screen 100 billion Revenue times 40% margin which is $40 billion in net income now a tech earnings right I was a tech analyst a tech future earnings or a forward earnings multiple right let's say that this is common in the market is 25 PE ratio Tesla is at 100 right now me putting a 25 PE ratio is being very reasonable all right 40 billion time 25 PE ratio that's a $1 trillion valuation that is what I think will be added to Tesla's valuation over the next 5 years but maybe that'll get realized sooner maybe that get realized later I'm not going to try to predict the stock at what when it'll do that it's just I know it will I don't know what time period exactly but I'm telling you in the next 12 24 months just like I predicted pal here just like my portfolios at you know is it's it's approaching $4 million actually let's take a look at my onee results cuz I they they were pretty good my onee results 5.9% just like I've been right on the money with so many options I believe Tesla will approach a $2 trillion valuation in the next couple of years and I think right now it's a really good time to ride the wave okay unfortunately you might have missed out on on a lot of the easy gains but I think there's still more gains to come so $500 per share on Tesla I think very reasonable in the somewhat near future",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,MMIw8uLZOH4,2024-11-12T21:09:10Z,SELLING PUTS ON SPY: The Best Hack to Grow Smaller Accounts | OPTIONS TRADING,SPY,"all right guys so I want to show you in this video how I'm selling put options on spy even if you have a smaller account I'm going to show you a cheat code on selling puts with smaller amounts of capital and raking in consistent cash flow. now let's go into an example on spy because I want to show you this cheat code that I think is really going to help out some of the smaller portfolios but also this is a really good strategy for using even if you have a bigger portfolio. now look first of all I do have a lot of shares of spy I've had spy in my portfolio for some time this is a very big Diversified ETF. spy is one of the best because the expense ratio is super low and here's the top 10 Holdings they have Nvidia Apple Microsoft Amazon meta alphabet broadcom birkshire hathway and Tesla the expense ratio is 0.09 meaning 9 cents for every $10,000 that you invest so basically the expenses are non-existent this is a very cheap ETF. now look I'm going to go to trade spy options the Spy strategy I'm going to show you right now is really good and easy for retirement. I would say that this is one of the best strategies period for running on spy so if you're going to be selling options on spy this would be the way to do it. I know spy it's simple it's easy it's fantastic for retirement but still what if you want to trade it with less Capital. the Delta is going to be a little bit lower because the chances of spy going down to 590 um are going to be a little bit lower in this shorter amount of time right. if the market pulls back a position like this can get hurt so you need to understand how to manage it properly because I want you to make money on the fear I want you to capitalize on Market volatility and on spy this is basically the only way to really squeeze out some big returns like right here you can see it's $126. you will benefit as long as spy stays above 590 okay if it stays above 590 591 or 595 or even if it spy goes up you will be in the green okay this is your green zone. anything above 600 you're in the green anything uh under 600 you're still in the green right up until this point your break even point of 588 74. the worst thing is when the stock ends up falling down on a put you get a sign well on a put credit spread it's it's pretty difficult because the way to manage this is if it goes down you need to actually close or roll. this is a smaller account strategy where we're going to use a very small amount of money only about $800 uh to make a hundred or you know $126 now that's not so bad and the worst case scenario here is basically if spy ends up going lower if it ends up going to 590 this is when I would start to think about actually closing out this trade. the Delta here is much lower okay it's 12 and the volume here is is also pretty good all right but this is going to be much safer because it's out of the money so if I sell the 580 and then I go ahead and buy the 570 the return here is lower okay it's going to be uh you know about 5% a little bit over 5% or so okay but this 5% is going to to be coming in about 2 weeks so it's still a 10% return per month now this trade is a lot safer because the Delta is only2 so with the 12 Delta that means there's a 12% chance of you actually having to close out this option or actually this 12% chance is actually spy hitting 580 okay there's a 12% chance that doesn't mean that it's going to be below 580 it's just it's just the chances of spy going down to 5 580. now what I would do in this scenario is most likely spy will not go down to 580 because that is significantly lower right that's $18 lower than the current price of where spy is at right now so this is a fairly safe put credit spread and spy is an expensive ETF so this gives you the potential to get into spy for a much lower price and you can trade shorter term options and really have fun with it but also at the same time as having fun be profitable. if you mismanage it and it goes all the way down so in this example if spy goes down from you know to 570 you will end up losing the entire collateral here the entire Capital that you put up of $950 and that's that's not something that you want to do. what I would do is if this uh spy ETF were to go down to 580 I would basically in 90% of cases I would immediately close in the other 10% of cases I would most likely roll this lower. when I go lower that again gives me that safety and I can protect this $950 especially if some time has gone by look if if spy goes down slowly and slowly and slowly and we approach expiration you may actually still have a gain on the position if it goes down to 581 it's a little bit out of the I may say to myself hey I'm actually still up on this position let me once again create safety. the same thing should be applied for your Finance you want to use credit spreads to increase the value of your portfolio quickly but do so in a smart way and spy is one of the best because what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to make your journey to becoming wealthy and basically growing to a sixf figureure portfolio and a seven figure portfolio as efficient as possible with the least amount of pain. and look the options on spy they're just an absolute dream like check this out if I go to the expiration days look how many expiration days are there's zero days one day two day three day four day you know 7 Day 8 9 10 11 the expirations here are an absolute dream the liquidity on spy is also a dream. the options on spy are absolutely a dream and there's so many good factors about them like the choices but also the volume itself. well spy is like Toyota everyone is trading it everyone is an spy so by jumping into spy you have a lot of volume you have a lot of liquidity there's always a buyer and there's always a seller and the bid ask okay that's really really important.",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,k2WVXt8U01g,2024-11-10T19:45:02Z,Pro Trader Explains Rolling Options to Avoid Losing Money,Starbucks,let's say that Starbucks for example uh we can use Starbucks well this would be an in the money covered call so this would be an example of you do not want to roll it down this would be pointless to roll down uh since it's already in the money but you can roll this up so I can go to roll this position and I can take this position from November 15 to let's say again I'm going to roll it out to December which is about a month and I can go from um this each of these examples is going to be very unique so I can go from 95 to 100 okay the net debit here would be 138 but pay attention because here I'm moving up by $5 which is a significant move it's going to cost me $138 however I literally get $240 more upside why Starbucks is at 9740 my cover call is at 95 it's $240 in the money so if I roll up to 100 I immediately get $2.40 more of a value I'm paying 138 to get a guaranteed well basically a guaranteed $2.40 now so this is an absolute no-brainer I'm paying 138 to make 240 and I get upside right I get a lot of upside I get upside because you know still Starbucks is not $100 as I'm making this video so that means that the St Starbucks can go up to 100 I would make even more money so I'm getting the intrinsic value of Starbucks how much it's in the money right now from 95 to 9740 and I still get more upside to 100 this is a no-brainer this gives me $5 of potential upside and I'm spending $138 so this would be a debit roll nothing wrong with the debit roll absolutely nothing wrong with the debit roll because I'm paying $138 to essentially get $5 of upside $240 of it is already realized so this would be a fantastic return this would be absolute Nob brainer return this is exactly what I do all the time in my portfolio,1.0,0.9

investors if you think politics and business isn't mixed you're absolutely crazy and Elon Musk did the unthinkable which is going to pay off big for Tesla what's even more crazy is how much money we're going to make on Tesla and to set us up I want you to quickly watch this clip of Dan IES and what he had to say does that change that number look I mean I think this it's a strategic bet that musk made that ultim could pay dividends for Tesla in a huge way for the coming years I think $40 to $50 per share it adds just for beginners not just because of what could happen from a tax credit perspective I think leveling you playing field you take out the Detroit automakers and then that's really going to give them an advantage from a cost scale and scool perspective Biden the big thing here Trump could ultimately FastTrack autonomous FSD and our whole view as we've talked about in the show trillion doll hours evaluation just on AI alone this is going to unlock it that's a key makes a lot of sense is there no scenario in which relations with China take a big hit and musk is asked to pick a side is in a sense yeah and and I think that so on the other side especially it's not just for for Tesla also apple as well for musk I think there's a comfort in him being in this situation that he could almost be a pseudo sort of you know ambass call a 10% politician 90% CEO in terms of making sure that the retaliatory or the carve out I think that's going to be important the carve out piece from a tariff perspective and I think one of the reasons that you see Nvidia up today you see semi you look at Apple despite some fears about what we're going to see on tariffs there's a view maybe with mus there bar could be a little worse than the bite when it comes to tariffs specifically on AI and I think that's really right now what's what's key not just to to AB but to the broader tax you you started off by saying you think this could materially help Tesla having him in the White House how what what sort of regulations are we watching so I think there's three things uh one is that the EV tax credits get taken away and I think that even though negative for Ev sector bullish for Tesla because of their scale and scope so from from a price perspec for Detroit though potentially bad for Detroit bad for of course bad for GM bad for cover as well which and and my view going into this was like that was a potential risk but I think Mary and the team have kind of pulled back a little so it's not like they've bet it all on EVS so I think one is going to be that where they get an advantage two and I think probably most important is this autonomous FS State because when you think about cyber cab and everything we've talked about 26 could that be 25 now s of trump clears the path there this changes the whole Paradigm I I think for are those regulatory authorities that oversee full self-driving Federal in nature all right guys so look we're going to be looking at my notes and I'm going to be opening up my portfolio and we're going to take a look at Tesla stock because as you can see I'm up $79,000 on Tesla and I am not playing options at the moment but I am thinking to start opening up a few different positions so listen up the first thing that I want to say is Elon Musk has a strategic bet on Donald Trump right he was a big Trump supporter this is very very interesting and now that Trump has won the election this is going to be a really bullish setup for Tesla and I think Tesla was going to be a $500 stock in the not so distant future okay let me explain what's going to happen and how I'm basically going to capitalize on this look the first thing is Trump will help Tesla because EV tax credits will be taken away now from one perspective you're like Eevee tax credits will be taken away that's bad for Tesla isn't it no it's actually not bad for Tesla so I was doing a lot of research and I'll tell you why Tesla is more vertically integrated than many other auto manufacturers producing its own batteries producing its own software and producing its own components this integration reduces cost it improves margins and allows Tesla to weather the impact of losing tax credits better than competitors guys this is a relative game people have to buy cars they're going to be buying cars so when a company like Tesla is vertically integrated and they basically make everything within themselves and they're not reliant on other suppliers that is a really big deal because what what's going to happen is when tax credits get taken away other manufacturers are going to suffer a lot more their margins will be a lot lower or negative potentially meaning they can't hire a good talent and if they can't hire a good talent Tesla is going to win Tesla's already won right but they're going to win harder in relation to competitors and as that happens the Brand's going to increase the quality is going to increase and most important economies of scale let me talk a little bit about economies of scale because during my college education I was Finance analytics and econom the thing is with economies of scale what that means is when you produce one good right just one time it's really really expensive because well let's say that you're producing a car you have to buy the whole you know the whole manufacturing plant and and all these employees right if you would sell one car the one car would cost you like a billion dollars right but if you would have a billion cars sold then the cost goes down because your fixed cost like you know the employees the lights Etc it gets covered by a huge amount of volume okay the more volume a company does the better because they have better unit economics unit economics means that it's cheaper to produce each vehicle so if Tesla were to produce let's say a million Vehicles it might cost them $50,000 right per vehicle but now if they produce 10 times more Vehicles it's 10 million Vehicles maybe instead of $50,000 now it'll only cost $30,000 per vehicle so their profit margin actually increases not decreases it actually increases from having more volume okay so that's the biggest cost and scale advantage that Tesla is going to have and under the Trump Administration I think we're going to see a lot of advantages for Tesla another one is uh Trump supports us-based manufacturing which I highly agree with as an American why would you want China to have all of the money manufacturing and their economy booming why don't we have it in our own country where our own plants are designing manufacturing and we have our own suppliers within United States that way the money stays within United States stes so I think that's going to be really interesting for Tesla as well and I think a lot of people are going to start realizing that this is a very dire time for America right America is in a very critical point and things are getting a lot worse and now is the time to basically have America turn things around we really need to turn things around right so when it comes to Elon Musk he understands that so he made a huge bet and I think this is going to be reflected in Tesla I think Tesla is going to reflect the good times we're going to experience right now in the economy and again I'm not trying to predict market and I don't have a political side I don't I could care less I'm just trying to put the most amount of money in your pocket and I am also trying to scale my portfolio past $4 million so right now you can see that Tesla is at $297 we're almost at $300 per share and my average cost is $218 I've been making money hand over fist with Tesla like literally hand over fist bicep over tricep on Tesla because I saw the writing on the wall okay when I looked at Tesla's chart when I looked at their business I was is really bullish for the election I already had a feeling right who's going to win based on social media and looking at Tesla I think that Tesla is going to continue to rise and that's actually why I don't currently have any covered calls on Tesla you guys know on this channel I'm a big proponent of running the wheel strategy right selling puts and covered calls I've been talking about the wheel strategy for basically 4 and a half years now all right I think that Tesla is actually not a good wheel strategy right now because the momentum is so hot you should be jumping in with some leap options with some buy and call options or just holding stock which is what I've been doing now look before I give you this play one more thing about Elon Musk Elon Musk is 90% CEO as we saw that Dan I said and he's basically 10% politician all right Elon is a genius and Dan IES basically said that the stock was going to be $300 shortterm well hello we're already at $300 in the short term so the next stop is basically going to be $500 per share for Tesla and in my opinion $500 is actually going to happen a lot sooner than you even think and the last thing is the AI all right I think that AI is going to play a huge component for Tesla and Tesla is going to dominate because the AI story right now we've seen it with Nvidia we've seen it with a lot of other stocks in the market AI is going to be a big contributor to Tesla so let's jump into my portfolio let me tell you what I'm going to do with Tesla right now I have uh 1,000 shares in this portfolio and the these are two plays that I gave out to my Discord Community um but they're basically going to expire worthless right I sold 200 puts and 220 puts Tesla is nowhere near this Tesla is around 300 so what I think would be a smart move right now is a couple of different strategies okay the first one would be to sell puts look you want to sell puts on Tesla to get in however it's not it's not necessarily cheap so what I would do is I would go out to an expiration like December 20th okay and then I'm going to try to get Tesla at around 260 all right so the Delta here is 0.2 let me explain how this is really unique all right typically my sweet spot Delta is 30 but for Tesla right now I would go for around 20 you can see that the volume here is 5,000 contracts have been traded and the open interest is is 10,000 so the trading volume is really really huge on the strike price right now 260 I think is a is a no-brainer right cuz if Tesla's at 300 if it pulls back 10% we're still going to be at 270 per share this is 260 strike price so literally nothing happens if if Tesla goes down you're fine if Tesla goes up you're fine if Tesla goes sideways you're fine that's actually why all right I don't want to I don't want to open up Pandora's box right now but I'm actually selling puts on Tesla my other portfolio on margin so straight up I have more Tesla than I can afford to buy in my other portfolio at 260 all right now how you should play this is if you have cash don't go as Extreme as me I'm a I'm a professional I've been doing this for a long time a decade all right take it easy if you're a beginner or you're an intermediate or even if you have a big portfolio have some experience regardless I would recommend right now that you take a close look at the 260 and sell puts to basically get into the company all right what you want to do is you want to acquire shares of Tesla if possible at a cheaper price however if you also want aggressive income and you're not super bullish on Tesla what you can also do is you can purchase Tesla stock you can buy 100 shares and then you can sell a covered call option at the $300 strike as Tesla opens up here in the next you know I'm making this video in the morning so if Tesla opens up higher let's say it's above 300 I would go for the most aggressive close the money covered call now when I say aggressive that doesn't mean that it's risky I'm saying aggressive in terms of income generation so I'm looking at selling a covered call option at Tesla to begin the position now me personally doesn't make sense because I have owned Tesla for such a long time I've been recommending it in my Discord Community for a couple of months now so I'm just going to keep riding my shares higher so you have three choices you can sell puts to get in at 260 you can um buy some shares of stock and ride it okay or you can do aggressive covered calls for aggressive income and I really call it safe income because a covered call is going to have less volatility and margin of safety versus buying the stock so I would recommend that you be either on the sellp put side where you're acquiring the stock or the covered call side where you're getting aggressive income versus the middle point which is just buying stock now one more thing I want to mention is I would be buying leap options absolutely I would be buying leap options right now and I've showed leap options many times on this channel but I'll show you one more time so I'm going to go to September uh 19 2025 you can go buy call option now the whole point of a leap option is you want to buy something in the money to get that upside exposure now Tesla options are expensive they're not cheap so they're expensive but this strategy still saves you a lot of money so versus buying 100 shares at uh you know 297 which is going to be 30 grand you can still buy a call option for $8,600 so it's still an expensive strategy but you know the strategy is a little bit better than just than just having shares so I would buy let's say for example you can well that would be a lot so let me go for five contracts I I would buy something like five contracts and just ride Tesla higher now if you want to uh lower your cost per um contract here you can also sell covered calls against it or even run a bull call spread okay let me show you what a bull call spread would look like or actually let me show you the poor man's covered call first so let's go to January 17 and if I were to sell a call option since I think we're headed to $500 per share in the somewhat future I can't predict when right I'm not a genie guys I'm not going to pretend to know what the Market's going to do but I am bullish so I'm going to sell the 350 for example and here you will see that I am reducing my cost by $1,100 so this 350 covered call on the leap would basically be $11 that would subsidize my cost against the $8,600 so my new cost would basically be $7,500 which would be pretty advantageous now another strategy that you can use is you can sell a call option for the same expiration so I can go for September 19 as as well and you know I don't know if Tesla will reach 500 by you know next 9 months or next one year so it might reach $400 so you can just sell something like the 400 and you can instantly basically get $3,000 off so now your total cost would be $5,500 as you can see your your total Max profit here would be pretty pretty sizable to be honest you can make a really big uh a really large amount of money here by um essentially buying a bull call spread",1.0,1.0

20% return versus negative 33% return so put selling offers the same returns as equities with lower draw down risk so when monitoring conditions I do want to point out that that the wheel strategy will be superior in bare markets as well as neutral markets and in Bull markets you will make money so I am truly teaching you guys something that is going to make you money regardless of Market condition which is why I have mastered the wheel strategy and I specialize in teaching the wheel strategy to busy professionals to create consistent cash flow because it is hands down the best strategy."", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.9}, {""company"": ""Apple"", ""excerpt"": ""look for high quality stocks with strong upward momentum to maximize returns that's Apple that's Nvidia that's Sofi that's paler that's many many stocks as long as it has an upward Trend the wheel strategy is going to be good and practically anything that is rising is a good company to invest in as is but running the wheel strategy will help help you get a more optimal price we'll talk about optimal entry and Strikes and all that good stuff later on in the course. I'm running this wheel strategy on a lot of stuff on Apple right now any cell put that you see is is the wheel strategy and covered calls are also the wheel strategy so I'm selling puts on Apple so I'm starting the wheel strategy there and American Airlines here I'm actually finishing the wheel strategy by selling covered calls I'm about to get out of the stock at $11 running the wheel strategy on Google which is one of my favorite stocks on Nvidia I made a lot of money on Nvidia on PayPal and on Tesla I have different uh positions as well but let's start off from scratch. now last but not least I want to cover Apple for technical anal is this has been a very easy stock to make money for a very different reason Apple here has had a lot of sideways action as a wheel strategy investor who is just basically selling puts and covered calls you actually don't mind at all when volatility is fairly low you don't mind at all when the volatility is just you know it's there but the stock doesn't have a clear path or Direction many stock investors would get uh frustrated and they would get upset but Apple here is the perfect example at of 50 RSI right here and the Stock's just moving sideways it's really not doing a whole lot and that's good okay if I go to your to date you know since July this stock is the same price and for me that's been fantastic because I did dump a lot of money into Apple um let me actually show you my Apple position I dumped a lot of money into apple and I've just been selling puts uh covered calls um which is all the wheel strategy okay I have uh 235 covered calls at the moment and it's up about U it's up about $ 4,391 uh this right here is uh is working out and I'm also up $232,000 on uh the shares themselves. so what I would do right now I'm going to go to trade Apple options and I'm going to show you simply how implied volatility impacts premiums okay so let's go for an expiration date that is going to be I'm going to go for January 17 2025 and I'm going to use that across all the examples that I have okay so right now if you'll see if I go for the nearest out of the money option this is very very close Apple's implied volatility is very low it's at 25 okay this is low volatility I would consider this very low okay the Delta here is 37 uh the premium here is $720 okay 7 $20 and you're tying up about $21,000 now look this return right here is about 3% right it's like 3 and a half% because 1% would be 225 3% would be about 660 this is 3.3% is right doing the math in my head um you know that's okay but it's not really that high of a return for an 80-day period right you probably want to if you want to have more aggressive upside and growth you probably want to go for a little bit more volatility now there's nothing wrong wrong with this if you can make 3 and a half% in under 3 months well you're still going to do very well in comparison to just someone who has an ETF you know like spy or something like that however you guys probably are on this channel because we want to make more aggressive growth we want to make a lot more money we we we don't want to have our money growing slowly. and actually I wanted to put into perspective the Apple return that we just had okay I'm going to pull up Apple I'm going to keep the Excel sheet uh in front of you but when we were looking at the Apple example and when we went to go sell a put option okay that put option was also for January 17 and it was $720 so I'm going to copy all this okay let's just paste it and now it was $720 okay the capital that was being tied up was a lot more the capital that was being tied up was $2,780 so 21780 aha annual return went down a lot so um Apple can provide a 15% annualized return on the put selling portion we didn't talk about covered calls just yet but on the put selling portion of the wheel strategy uh Palance here would be pretty much triple as profitable as Apple would. I also want to point out constantly managing stop losses adds very unnecessary complexity and emotional stress rather than exiting too early I prefer to manage risk through careful stock selection and just focusing on premium collection if you're assigned shares you can simply shift to the covered call phase of the wheel strategy keeping the income generation going for me managing the wheel strategy is very easy because I'm not really managing it that heavily when you sell a put you relax and you wait to get assigned when you have a covered call it's a little bit more complicated if you want to reduce taxes for example but let's just say you're trading in a Roth IRA or 401K it's really simple you just always let it sell off make that income and get that huge appreciation so for me sticking to the wheels basic framework reduces overthinking and it it reduces and minimizes the chances of making impulsive mistakes you really should truly do nothing when it comes to the wheel strategy and ultimately patience and consistently and ultimately patience and consistency yields uh better results over time anyways so doing less is truly making more when it comes to option trading. so we have I do have a lot of suggestions and it depends because someone with $600,000 that wants medium risk we are going to use mag 7 but we're not solely going to use Ma s because uh there is higher implied volatility so I am implementing some double dividend strategies which is basically going after dividend paying stocks we have Exon Mobile we have craft Hinds so that's kind of how my conversation looked like with scenario a with the $650,000 portfolio we focused on lots of diversification. now during bull markets uh we we just we crush it we completely crush it with palen here with Tesla with uh let's see what else we got going on here pal here Tesla Amazon PayPal there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you could be buying now you can also buy buy stuff like Mora um Riot um I don't personally have these and looks like Robin Hood did pretty bad in earnings I'm glad I don't have these I keep a close eye on these stocks but I don't personally have them at the moment but yeah you can uh you can take a close look at some of the riskier companies I mean I have students that outperform me because they're using riskier stocks and it's a bull market listen I have nothing wrong with that I don't mind students outperforming the the coach right I don't I don't mind I mean fantastic I love seeing people celebrate."", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.7}, {""company"": ""Nvidia"", ""excerpt"": ""look for high quality stocks with strong upward momentum to maximize returns that's Apple that's Nvidia that's Sofi that's paler that's many many stocks as long as it has an upward Trend the wheel strategy is going to be good and practically anything that is rising is a good company to invest in as is but running the wheel strategy will help help you get a more optimal price we'll talk about optimal entry and Strikes and all that good stuff later on in the course. I'm running this wheel strategy on a lot of stuff on Apple right now any cell put that you see is is the wheel strategy and covered calls are also the wheel strategy so I'm selling puts on Apple so I'm starting the wheel strategy there and American Airlines here I'm actually finishing the wheel strategy by selling covered calls I'm about to get out of the stock at $11 running the wheel strategy on Google which is one of my favorite stocks on Nvidia I made a lot of money on Nvidia on PayPal and on Tesla I have different uh positions as well but let's start off from scratch. which is why I would do the wheel strategy on something like Nvidia so if I type up Nvidia you will see that if I were to go for an option on Nvidia we're going to make more money than the example that I just showed you on Google so if I go to trade Nvidia sellp put okay I'll go 30 days out November 29 and if I you can see here how it's it's less the strike price is less yet the premiums are or or way more so at 135 the premium here is is $7 and that's all essentially due to the implied volatility so the higher implied volatility you can go out of the money more and get the same returns so I was showing you 580 here I can go all the way down to 132 and uh I can still collect uh the same premium and this is obviously putting less money to work than the example I just showed you on Google which was in the 160s this is in the 130s so it's a very big difference and picking um options based on implied volatility is is a very lucrative tip. so I have 100 shares of Nvidia all right to properly hedge and get the most value to increase my Sharp ratio the most most to increase the premium the most I would go for at the money so it's at 140 I would sell a 140 I get 590 here see how the further up I go the lower the premium becomes it's because the chances of Nvidia going up higher are lower than the chances of Nvidia being at the current price it is right at 140 or above so the more it has to rise I mean the less chance it'll it'll do that so investors obviously know that and that's why the premium here is is more for an in the money or at the money option of 140 so going for an the money option is going to produce a better sharp ratio. so if you sell a 140 so going back to my screen here if I sell a 145 covered call on Nvidia the chances that it's going to be 145 is about 35% 34.9 3% that's because Delta it's a sensitivity of the option but also basically explains the chances that the option will um end up going to that price that 145 price in this example. I used to close out right before expiration just so because I thought that then I'd have my money so that come Monday I could start trading quicker um I don't think I run into that with TDM Merit trade now that I use them so I don't do that anymore I just let them expire completely um sometimes I might roll but it's kind of rare because if if I'm doing the wheel I pretty much never roll um so it's really only for spreads that I do it a bit but that that's it otherwise I'm writing it out till expiration okay cool I guess like the next question is um I'm making like a wheel strategy like Cor it's going to be a lot of the like a toz all the fundamentals and everything I guess the big question is for people they probably want to wonder like how much can you make off the wheel strategy do you mind sharing maybe some of your personal like wins and losses and what has that looked like for you on a monthly basis I'm actually not familiar how long have you been in the in the Discord for about let's say two months maybe okay two months all right sounds about right and what what has your results been like well before I'd say uh before I even did my prop trading for a year um I was still doing the wheel but I was flying too close to the Sun essentially you know if Tesla was at 200 I might be selling the 199 put because I saw that premium and I thought wow you know Tesla's only going to go up but then Tesla drops to 150 um so yeah I basically being successful in the wheel strategy I think once it started really clicking for me was actually doing the math um and actually looking at the stocks not just saying wow Nvidia just pumps like crazy everyone's making money in it so I'm going to make money well maybe that train's coming to a Slowdown and and it has a correction so and I don't want to hold a stock uh I'm basically on the downtrend so I'm looking at companies that I really like but I'm also making sure that it's near a support level typically and that I'm TR happy with just holding the stock and I'm not going to freak out if it drops 20%. my opinion on risk management with the wheel would be don't put it all into one when I uh about a year ago when I was still kind I just got back into doing the wheel strategy I put all my money into selling puts on Tesla and I think my strike was 257 think it got up to about 262 and then it rode all the way down to 140 or 145 so I realized all right if I just sold one on Tesla one on Nvidia maybe three on paler because it's just a smaller um size per contract then I would have been in so many other stocks that were doing well that that Tesla wouldn't bother me that I was so far down in and then I would still have money to be able to trade instead of having to sit there waiting for Tesla to come back which took months and months um so I'd say yeah with the wheel strategy just diversify the stocks that you're in and make sure that they're stocks that you like. so we have I do have a lot of suggestions and it depends because someone with $600,000 that wants medium risk we are going to use mag 7 but we're not solely going to use Ma s because uh there is higher implied volatility so I am implementing some double dividend strategies which is basically going after dividend paying stocks we have Exon Mobile we have craft Hinds so that's kind of how my conversation looked like with scenario a with the $650,000 portfolio we focused on lots of diversification. now during bull markets uh we we just we crush it we completely crush it with palen here with Tesla with uh let's see what else we got going on here pal here Tesla Amazon PayPal there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you could be buying now you can also buy buy stuff like Mora um Riot um I don't personally have these and looks like Robin Hood did pretty bad in earnings I'm glad I don't have these I keep a close eye on these stocks but I don't personally have them at the moment but yeah you can uh you can take a close look at some of the riskier companies I mean I have students that outperform me because they're using riskier stocks and it's a bull market listen I have nothing wrong with that I don't mind students outperforming

put and usually I'm still looking at technical analysis maybe if it's something like Palante tier you I just sold the 36 strike today for two weeks out um even though it just pumped a bunch which uh I'm not too worried about it's just such a good stock if I have to buy it at 36 I'm not going to be mad so I don't worry as much for a stock like paler um but one of the other trades that you had in the Discord was the American Airlines and basically when it was close to $11 I was more than happy to sell the puts there I don't even know what Deltas they were but it was pretty close but I knew that that support was so strong that I didn't worry about it at all awesome I know we're trading a lot of American Airlines and Palance here um what do you think why do you think we're successful on those trades I want to get your perspective from you know the student perspective I I don't know exactly what you guys do on your end but it seems like there's a lot more research than people just going in going hey I'm going to sell the 30 Delta uh just no matter what the technical analysis is no matter if there's earnings but essentially for me I usually look at that a trade like that and when I first saw American Airlines in the Discord I just looked at it and pretty much every reason that was posted in Discord made sense to me I just wanted to confirm it myself uh just do my own due diligence and then I'm essentially just extremely comfortable with the trade go through the math I go okay this is how much I'm expected to make and then I I always have a plan of exit so if stuff starts going the wrong way am I going to completely get out am I going to get out at you know half my full risk and so as long as I have that then I don't stress about my trades. my opinion on risk management with the wheel would be don't put it all into one when I uh about a year ago when I was still kind I just got back into doing the wheel strategy I put all my money into selling puts on Tesla and I think my strike was 257 think it got up to about 262 and then it rode all the way down to 140 or 145 so I realized all right if I just sold one on Tesla one on Nvidia maybe three on paler because it's just a smaller um size per contract then I would have been in so many other stocks that were doing well that that Tesla wouldn't bother me that I was so far down in and then I would still have money to be able to trade instead of having to sit there waiting for Tesla to come back which took months and months um so I'd say yeah with the wheel strategy just diversify the stocks that you're in and make sure that they're stocks that you like. the next stock I want to cover is going to be paler paler has been on an absolute tear but I have said we have to be more cautious The Hired goes up paler is looking a lot like Nvidia where the stock is just parabolic and there's a lot of money that has been made but you always have to make a decision based on technical analysis is there still going to be more money that will be made okay okay so from the moving average perspective we're way above and that's actually why I don't really like 60-day moving average because I personally prefer 30 because 30 gives you a lot more recency bias um which I think is helpful what is recently happening with someone or a stock I think is more important than what has happened like a long long time ago right like if I were to judge you as a person I would look at your actions and your behaviors like this you know year versus 5 years ago right you were a different person 5 years ago uh so I like recency by more and for stocks I like to use 30 days so I changed it to 60 because when I was working on Wall Street that's what one of the analysts used but I was personally never a fan of it so I have my own strategy my own method that I've developed over the the past decade here so Palante here as a stock I think same it has a RSI of 64 and uh I would say there's one important note here for technical analysis this is a very simple tool okay if you just draw you just simply pick a bottom this okay visually look at where a hard reset or a hard bottom was and there was a huge pop that is right here okay this was a massive massive pop right there from the bottom here this was back in August okay and then and then I would I would put it on a other um you know kind of a a bottom here so this is from bottom to bottom and this is an art not a science but if you look at bottom to bottom here we've had a straight line trajectory towards a very clear path and I would say that momentum is one of the strongest factors when it comes to technical analysis if you can use momentum to uh run the wheel strategy I did come out with a video uh you know called momentum wheel strategy it's a new wheel strategy I'm basically using momentum I think this is one of the strongest forces within within charting analysis that you need to pay attention to if you see a stock that is parabolically up like this I would use the wheel strategy so I would say this is a very powerful indicator. let me show you something a little bit better I'm going to show you uh Palance here okay Palance here I've been making money hand over fist bicep over tricep you guys already know got the bicep over the tricep all right we've been buying this company so much and the reason is because let me show you let me show you all right so if I go to trade paler options and I go to sellp put I'm going to also go for that uh January expiration okay the same expiration and uh you will see that the return here is almost 10% it's $ 370 and you're putting $3,800 in capital to work so if you ask me this is almost a 10% return um and if you were to compound this return okay you would get a phenomenal rate of return all right so what I want to show you real quick is I'm going to be using Excel to give you uh an estimated annual return okay this is something that nobody talks about what is a good return When do you close a position when do you manage a position when do you take profit I actually base a lot of my decisions off of pure math and the good news is it's very simple math so let's go into some math of estimating returns and taking profit uh on the wheel strategy so I just told you that basically we can make $370 okay and we were basically selling put option on Palance here and the collateral was 3830 okay so 3830 so here we have the premium okay premium and this is uh Capital all right this is the capital that we are um going to be using so look check it out all we have to do is do this divided by this well is this good or bad well we actually don't know at the moment we actually don't know because and I and I'll give you a quick example is 99.7% good you were probably tempted to tell me yes it's good or no it's not good it really just depends on the time so if I said is this good and you said no what if I told you it's one day ah it's good if you said it's good what if I told you this is 10 years ah probably not that good right so it all depends on how much how long and there's a third Factor risk but I will make a video on risk management if you want that let me know in the comments or you can email me I'll drop the email in the description we can talk about that but there's only three factors that I cover personally as an investor who's been investing for 10 years and what I teach my students is how much are you making how long does it take and what is the risk we'll focus on just the two things right now we will focus on how much and how long all right so you can see that 99.7% is the return now we need to see that this option was expiring January 17 and obviously this video is timeless I'm just telling you what I'm doing and everything but as the time I'm making this video this option has about 80 days to expiration all right so if I go to days this will be 80 Days well is 99.7% return good for 80 Days well we still don't know right so what we need to do is we need to find the multiple okay I will call this the multiple we need to find multiple what is multiple well how many times can you do this in a year because what we're trying to do is we're trying to figure out the annualized return so our multiple will be the 365 that's how many days we have on this planet uh divided by 80 all right that will be our multiple this is the this is the amount of times that we can make this trade happen uh in a year okay now here's what we do we take the return and then we multiply it by the multiple and then we get a annualized return now this is exactly and this should be a percentage this is exactly 44.0% per year I don't know about you but I think that this is a fantastic return on the wheel strategy selling puts on Palance here is a 44.8% return per year. now during bull markets uh we we just we crush it we completely crush it with palen here with Tesla with uh let's see what else we got going on here pal here Tesla Amazon PayPal there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you could be buying now you can also buy buy stuff like Mora um Riot um I don't personally have these and looks like Robin Hood did pretty bad in earnings I'm glad I don't have these I keep a close eye on these stocks but I don't personally have them at the moment but yeah you can uh you can take a close look at some of the riskier companies I

yeah definitely and it's the least stressful so especially when you're following the rules of okay American Airlines is at that support of $11 even if I get hit no big deal um it just it makes it so there's less Revenge trading there's less impulse Trad that's where I lose money yeah. so we have I do have a lot of suggestions and it depends because someone with $600,000 that wants medium risk we are going to use mag 7 but we're not solely going to use Ma s because uh there is higher implied volatility so I am implementing some double dividend strategies which is basically going after dividend paying stocks we have Exon Mobile we have craft Hinds so that's kind of how my conversation looked like with scenario a with the $650,000 portfolio we focused on lots of diversification. now I will say that uh with certain other uh strategies which I don't like as much as the whe strategy you you may have higher risk but that's for you know that's for another video now um look I also want to talk about rolling up uh call and and showing you some examples of rolling up a call for example American Airlines right now is uh in the money for me and I sold a 13 call it's at 1391 right now so Market's about to open up what I would do is I would just simply go to roll this position and I would go from this is expiring on November 8th I would go up to January let's say so I can go to January and I can go from 13 to 14 and boom I mean I can go from a covered call and give myself a whole dollar more of upside all right uh from 13 to 14 and essentially um I give myself a dollar of upside and I collect a credit of $90 so I think that's just fantastic that is a really fantastic way to to make a lot more money by rolling up. so for example if I go to American Airlines right here I'll show you why nobody would want to exercise this option right now so look American Airlines is is at 1391 per share right I have the 13 covered call this is a very standard play for me uh covered calls on American Airlines now the option is going for 106 so if you were to exercise you would have $91 in the money right .91 but if you just trade the option you have A1 six so what would you rather $91 or6 if you're rational you would say 106 therefore this option is worth more than the amount of is in the money right so getting a signed early pretty much never happens because part of the reason options are valuable is the time that they have the Theta the time and the time gives them more value than the intrinsic value so an option is a combination of intrinsic value and extrinsic value right intrinsically how much is it in the money extrinsically how much volatility uh is there how much time is there uh what other risks are there right so the option is always going to be worth more than intrinsic value that that it's in the money so you're never really going to have early assignment risk for the for the most part obviously depends in in certain situations you know when time basically only when time's running out when there's very little time the less time the higher the risk and the more the Delta the higher the Delta yeah at some point um maybe the discrepancy here might be a lot less if it's one or two cents then yes someone might assign or you know exercise but typically very very low very very low chance I've not gotten assigned early for a very long time very long time."",

selling covered calls I'm about to get out of the stock at $11 running the wheel strategy on Google which is one of my favorite stocks on Nvidia I made a lot of money on Nvidia on PayPal and on Tesla I have different uh positions as well but let's start off from scratch okay let's take a look at a stock and try to find something that will make sense for us to essentially start the wheel strategy on so I've got Yahoo finance open I'm going to go through some of my stocks here you know what let's go for Google okay I think Google is a good uh stock pick because it's not yeah it's not near its all-time high it's not even close not even close it was at over $190 per share back in in July and as we approach December here in November um you'll notice that the stock is down a lot but it's also not at 52 we low I think right here that it was oversold it also went way below the bowling band next now we've had a lot of stability so this is a sideways Market well it's it's a bullish Market but this is sideways action for Google and I would say that it would be good to sell a put at the bottom of the Binger band as I mentioned the bottom right here looks like it's around H if I scroll if I scroll in here it looks like it's around just over 160 okay so this is just over 160 around $1 161 per share so if I wanted to get optimal entry and start the wheel strategy on Google I would simply just sell a put option at probably around 161 okay and um if you sell it at 161 this gives you an optimal entry much better than the current price of the stock so I'm slightly down the stock it is what it is so if I go to sell put and I go to so by the way we'll talk about expiration days and and strike selection and everything like that in this course and I'll go into great detail but let's just first off start off with a 30-day option so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pick an expiration day that's around 30 days out and then if I sell something like the 165 here the Delta 042 you can see here how the premium is actually really really good so in one month I'm making over 3% return and I'll talk about strike selection here this is a a highish Delta I'll talk about the different Deltas that you can use in strike selection but this is just an example like if you sell a put at 165 here you collect really good income and from there on we'll talk about managing and everything like that but um once you have a stock if you do get a sign then you just sell covered calls so two parts of the wheel strategy selling puts to get in and selling covered calls to basically generate income when you do get assigned and I'll talk about A to Z in just a moment. which is why I would do the wheel strategy on something like Nvidia so if I type up Nvidia you will see that if I were to go for an option on Nvidia we're going to make more money than the example that I just showed you on Google so if I go to trade Nvidia sellp put okay I'll go 30 days out November 29 and if I you can see here how it's it's less the strike price is less yet the premiums are or or way more so at 135 the premium here is is $7 and that's all essentially due to the implied volatility so the higher implied volatility you can go out of the money more and get the same returns so I was showing you 580 here I can go all the way down to 132 and uh I can still collect uh the same premium and this is obviously putting less money to work than the example I just showed you on Google which was in the 160s this is in the 130s so it's a very big difference and picking um options based on implied volatility is is a very lucrative tip."", ""confidence"": 1.0, ""sentiment"": 0.8}, {""company"": ""Yahoo Finance"", ""excerpt"": ""so I've got Yahoo finance open I'm going to go through some of my

Invest with Henry,e9EoKE7kXBY,2024-11-05T15:27:40Z,URGENT PALANTIR IS ABOUT TO DO THIS!,Palantir,oh my goodness this is insane pal year reported earnings and the numbers are absolutely mindboggling this stock has printed me so much money in my community I need to tell you what I think about the stock right now because with this news I think we're in a very interesting point of paler overall trajectory of where the stock has been where it's going in the future and how you can make a lot more money because guys I'm looking at my research right here and the numbers are absolutely like I can't even fathom how profitable and how crazy paler actually is we're literally printing money year over-year 30% growth paler has been growing Its Top Line like an absolute monster guys I'm pumped up I'm so pumped up because we're making money hand over fist bicep over tricep guys I'm so pumped up because what I see going on with paler is almost unheard of trajectory okay this is like going to the Moon all right just like Nvidia has had a huge rise paler is doing the same exact thing and I have been early on this trend I've been covering paler since IPO and now just take a look at where paler is this stock has been going up by $5 $10 and every time that's tens of billions of dollars of market cap being added every single strategy that I've had on paler has been working out and it's not even because I'm a genius at options it's just because I've picked the right vehicle and I put you guys in this vehicle so we've been making money hand over fist and I want to give you an update of what I think is going to happen to Pal here because when I looked at the results last night and I'm recording this in the morning I was asking myself there oh my goodness I was bullish but this stock even surprised and blew my expectations out of the water and I've been doing research on paler for years since IPO this stock has been the number one stock that I've been holding okay so listen let's talk about the 30% Revenue growth as well as what I think is even more impressive is US commercial growth 44% this company palen here where the CEO went to my high school I love the CEO I have so much trust in the CEO I have as much trust in the CEO almost as much trust as I have in myself that's crazy the CEO has been guiding the company through AI he's been innovating like crazy the talent at the company is insane and now with this earings beat I think that the stock stock is going to go parabolic I've been saying this stock is very undervalued and now we're finally seeing this stock coming to fruition I mean it's had a fantastic 2024 but with this earnings I see the stock I see this actually pushing the stock over the edge okay going into 2025 we're going to be in some really hot times okay when a stock is hot you can print money you can legally Prince money okay now looking at the commercial growth of 44% guys palen here used to just be you know friends with the government they used to just have contracts with the government for the most part and they were having a challenge growing and there was many doubters people were doubting that hey palen here you know they're a one trick pony well guess what this is definitely definitely not a one- trick pony and I'm really pumped off and excited because the money that I'm making the money that my students have made in Discord has actually been lifechanging you know maybe not for me I'm already rich but it's been lifechanging in terms of my net worth it's also been life-changing for the the students that I have in Discord right and like looking at more of the results right here you know they gave really positive guidance guys that is a huge deal all right let let me tell you tell you something right now a company can have good earnings and the stock can still go down the reason why paler had phenomenal out of this world out of my mind out of my mind earnings but it's still continues to pop higher it's growing like my biceps are growing it's growing like it's growing like no other right it's growing I can't even make an analogy how much it's growing all right I'm I'm like shocked as as I'm making this video it's it's shocking the craziest thing is the guidance was even more positive coming from their from their team from the leadership they're positive going into the future which means this train is just taking off or this plane or this jet or this Bugatti I don't know but this vehicle is just getting started okay I've been a little bit too early on the trend I've been 3 years on this stock right whenever the IPO happened I've been making videos for 5 years now okay let me tell you the guidance was so good that I think the stock is going to keep going up I think okay look when I was studying Finance all right one of the Tendencies or trends that happens in the market is after earnings you get a huge pop in the stock right and then it goes It goes a little bit higher okay it's called Drift all right like you're drifting a car car it's drift go all right goes a little bit higher I think that's what's going to happen to Palance here okay because listen 30% Revenue growth 44% us commercial growth guidance was really good and I want to say that listen the past of the past I get it the stock was doing phenomenally in the past you know few months now earnings came in do we have more room to run honestly I think yes I think yes I think now we have the reasoning now I have the confidence to say that yes I think that we can run some more okay I've had uh some shares that have been uncovered okay what I mean by that I've been buying call options I've been doing Poor Man's cover calls on Palante here I'm just straight up Holding stock right now guys I'm just straight up Holding stock because I didn't know how much paler was going to go up I was bullish and they surprised me me and I making like tons of money on it so look I think that now with the proof here okay the proofs in the puding they had the best quarter ever I mean the best growth quarter that I've seen and I've been covering the stock for every single week in my Discord session I've been saying guys this is a fantastic stock to have in your portfolio sell puts to get in sell covered calls to generate income but looking at at this earnings I've never seen a quarter that is this strong okay it it's it's almost unheard of now one more you know a few more things I wanted to say here is look Palante here they reported third quarter adjusted earnings of 10 cents all right 10 cents 10 cents a share on revenue of $725 million okay now listen analyst surveyed by fax set fax set by the way is a data provider it's kind of like Bloomberg when I used to work on Wall Street actually used fax set super archaic software but they give you the data right data to make data driven decisions right so when I was on Wall Street I was looking at not ai ai wasn't around when I was working on Wall Street this is a little bit a while ago now but we were making data driven decisions because that's part of my area of expertise it's Finance economics and data analytics my degrees now look analyst surveyed by fax set were expecting earnings of 9 cents a share on Revenue of $75 million okay that means that paler beat earnings by 20 excuse me by over $20 million all right in one quarter that is a pretty big beat $20 million that it beat okay topping estimates all right now in the same period last year the company reported earnings of 7 cents a share on revenue of $558 million guys just to put in perspective this company has grown by hundreds of millions of dollars in a year it's topping Topline it's topping bottom line it's not like okay we've topped Topline estimates and we spend a bunch of money to get there no it we've topped Topline and we've surpassed your expectations you Wall Street guys all the Wall Street analysts we've surp past all the Wall Street analyst expectations and we have made more money bottom line okay you can't even argue this you're top and bottom line bigger better stronger grower right that's not a word but you're growing okay now look my only my only regret guys and I've been covering pal here on a freaking basis I've been hitting this I've been hitting this stock on YouTube because I want you guys to get rich as often as I've been hitting the gym lately all right because health is number one for me right God is number one for me those two things are number one for me more so than making money um but I want to help because that's part of my mission that's what that's what I want to do that's what I believe my faith I just believe that's the best thing to do with my time right and the only regret I actually have is that I didn't buy more I didn't recommend it more because I didn't want to be spammy on YouTube YouTube I didn't want to spam this stock but look I I I'm kind of upset with myself I should have been even spamer on YouTube telling you guys buy more buy more okay look the stock it's maxed out on all its metrics right now it's maxed out all right if you know I played tennis for 15 years I love tennis I watch some American football as well um it's maxed out it's like Roger feder it has good forehand all right good Top Line it has a good backand that's good bottom line it has good serve okay that's basically that's basically the leadership on all fronts this stock is a 10 out of 10 which is very rare I never see that in the market you usually see a 10 out of 10 Stock that is priced for Perfection right you know it's it's expensive I would not say right now that paler PE ratio price to sales ratio I would not say it's exuberantly irrational right there's that famous book there and that famous quote I would not say that it's exuberant L um overpriced nothing like that I would say right now we're still in line we're still on the trajectory for making more money because as this stock Rises I don't think we're going to get a whole lot of resistance from the market because look hedge funds billionaires everyone on Wall Street now they've been blown out the water guys we blew them out the water so look I think it's a CH code and that's part of the reason why honestly ly I'm I'm a great option Trader I I think I'm one of the okay there's better option traders in this world than me not on YouTube on YouTube I'm number one but look it doesn't even it's not even an option question this is straight up the stock itself is so good any option strategy will work on on paler right now you can sell a put by by just throwing a dart at it okay you can sell any put 50 Delta 40 Delta 30 Delta 20 Delta you will make money right now you can buy a call option for any expiration any strike and because it's a bullish strategy you're going to make money that is seriously a really really rare time to be in in the stock market right giv elections I I'm not taking any sides on Election I'm not Democrat I'm not Republican to be honest I don't even care I'm doing what I can do to level up myself in life how can I level up with God in life how can I level up on this YouTube channel how can I level up at the gym as a human I don't really care I don't I could care less about the politics I could care less I don't even live in the United States because it's a lot of nonsense okay I'm just trying to make money and I'm trying to make you guys also some money I'm trying to make you stupid rich and when it comes to Palance here literally quality value growth beating Top Line beating a bottom line you can use right now the leap strategy or you can just stick to my momentum wheel strategy okay I'm about to show you a video on my my M wheel strategy real quick before I pass pass this video and and stop this video there's one more important thing I think the stock Rising is absolutely insane the numbers are insane and if I had to make a prediction which I don't usually like to do I just like to make safe passive consistent income selling options but if I had to make if I had to make a guess of what I think paler is going to do I think we're going to have a runner folks truly invalu trillion doll valuation is possible it's not just you know it's not that if that's going to happen it's basically when is that going to happen when is a trillion dollar valuation going to come in because with this Innovation with this Revenue growth it's just time guys it's just a matter of time right I don't have my watch on me right now um it's just a matter of time all right so listen if you want to play paler in a smart way I would say the smartest way other than Holding stock is probably to run my momentum wheel strategy that I've come up with on a unique way of doing the wheel strategy you should check out this video right here on the momentum wheel strategy my story as well and run the strategy on Palance here all right congratulations for making a lot of money and I'll catch you guys in the next video,1.0,0.95

Invest with Henry,YvU8sSdJURA,2024-11-04T16:45:04Z,Top 4 Options I'm Buying Now (EASY MONEY for November 2024),Neo,The first stock I'm going to be covering which I haven't covered for a very long time is actually Neo so Neo is a stock that is in the EV space I used to cover this stock a lot I made a lot of money with the stock and then I ended up selling it and I've actually got out of the stock for a profit um it's been a very volatile stock and now that the stock has pulled back tremendously I want to give you guys an opportunity to make money on the stock now remember you don't actually need a stock to have a whole lot of direction to make money with my option strategy often times we can print cash even the stock doesn't do too much now quickly I want to go over um Neo uh and why I'm bullish on it I'm only semi- bullish on it but the good news is the strategy that I'm going to tell you about actually requires the stock to be semi- bullish I don't need the stock to go up a lot to make a lot of money so let me explain all right so first of all Neo um they have a growing EV Market in China the EV Market in China is booming and uh there's specifically if you take a look at the economic difference between EVS versus the you know gas and and Diesel Etc EVS just have an economic Advantage right they're cheaper to get in and also just looking at Neo they have an Innovative battery swapping model so this Innovative battery swapping model um Al although it can take a little bit longer to swap that battery versus going to a gas station if you look at the overall time that it requires to actually get energy into the car and actually be able to drive a specific difference a specific distance it is actually much better than Tesla because Tesla still takes a lot of time to charge whereas a battery swap gives you a whole lot of range okay so they have a very Innovative model not to mention they are expanding into Europe so just looking into expansion actually really bullish because I'm in Eastern Europe at the moment which is where my roots are from and um I do see a lot of Chinese vehicles here there's a lot of Chinese um vehicles coming onto the market and I do see some consumers starting to switch to these vehicles so I'm I'm very bullish actually on China in the long term in the short term I would say that it can be a hit or miss however let me show you the option strategy that I'm going to use on Neo so let me go into Neo right now and let's take a look at some of the options um specifically Neo is just going sideways which is actually a really good pattern a lot of people U mistaken uh sideways action is bad no it's actually really really good and I'm going to show you several different option strategies that you can run right here very simple option strategies where you can make a lot of money okay so what you have to consider with Neo the stocks at around $5 per share and yes let me point out I'm not one of the guys that's just going to Hype you up and say oh we're going to make money to the Moon you also have to be aware of the risks look before I give you this play on Neo and the other three plays that I got China's economic challenges okay they have challenges with real estate they have a struggling and slowing consumer spend okay their birth rates have come down quite a lot okay so I think this is going to impact uh Neo's domestic sales it will impact Neo's domestic sales but again I don't need this stock to go up a lot because I'm looking at aggressively and when I say aggressively when I AG I ly sell options this actually means safety okay let me explain this little Nuance right here let's go to the example so I'm going to go to trade Neo options specifically what I want to do is a covered call an in the money covered call okay I did have a video on this so I will link that video at the end of this video an in the money covered call I will explain to you now but just wait till the end of the video you can see more about it if you still have questions so look an in the money covered call essentially is going to look like this you first have to buy 100 shares of Neo that's $5 stock I mean it's only only going to cost you 500 that's a very very low amount okay you can put a very small amount of money here and then you can start selling covered calls all right so here's what you would do you would sell a $5 covered call now let me go for an expiration date that is December 20th I think this is a really interesting strategy very very interesting to make high income at a very safe way so look I'm going to go for the $5 strike this is a $66 premium so there's a few things to note here $66 is actually about 12% return in 47 days so it's about six weeks and this is about a 12% return which means 2% return basically a week 2% a week is a ridiculously high return this is a way to collect a lot of income okay now also why is it safe and specifically why is it safer than going for an outof the- money option Let Me Explain If you go for out of the money options which I typically Ally recommend I'm giving you a little bit of a different way to do covered calls right now if you were to do a covered call out of the money you get a lot of good upside and you get some get some margin of safety because when you collect the premium right here at $66 you get to collect premium it actually reduces your average cost so if you were to buy 100 shares right now you would spend $510 but we're collecting $66 so that would reduce us down by $66 which would be about $4 and you know 56 uh there about right so $4 and you know 50 or so so at $4.50 you actually get a really good discount you get a really good discount because the stock is trading at five uh $510 but because you're selling a covered call which is in the money if the stock goes down you're completely protected not completely protected you're protected down to that Mark that I mentioned which would be the $456 or so right so at that point or $454 actually that that's the correct number if it goes down to 470 you don't care at all you could care less that's actually even a good thing it's actually a fantastic thing because let me give you three scenarios if it goes up okay cool no problem you make 12% in 6 weeks if it stays the same that's fine you make 12% in 6 weeks now if it goes down to say $5 you you don't care if it goes below $5 you're actually good because you get to keep your shares and now your covered call is out of the money it's below five so when it expires you don't lose your shares and you still get all the premium you get the premium no matter what but if it's above $5 which it's already starting at 510 this is a way to basically generate quick money like fast cash but you're definitely going to lose your shares if it's above $5 at expiration right so at December 20th you're going to lose your shares because it's above $5 and the person's going to exercise that's not a bad thing but you will lose your shares you are putting in capital and then that Capital will be basically used and then you'll get it all back right so you'll put up $510 you'll get paid the $66 here in this example um basically you're putting up$ 450 and you're going to make about um yeah you're going to make about $66 so or about $50 $50 so you put in 450 you get 500 so you 450 you put in and then 500 you come out essentially more along those lines okay and then you can just rotate this every 6 weeks okay so I think this is a really smart strategy for Eevee Market in in China yes we have some problems in China for sure and that's why I backed away from Neo which was a genius move okay some of you guys watch my videos on Neo and you say well Henry had a tough time with Neo no I did not have a tough time in Neo it just looks like I had a tough time on Neo on some of my old videos because there was a lot of volatility my Discord members have been very profitable on Neo throughout history

Invest with Henry,YvU8sSdJURA,2024-11-04T16:45:04Z,Top 4 Options I'm Buying Now (EASY MONEY for November 2024),Sofi,"The second stock that I want to cover and this is also a stock that I recently covered in my last video on November 1st where I went over my live trading here's the video by the way on the live trading that I did watch millionaire Trader sell puts live this is a really important video uh I'm not sure why a lot of you guys missed it and we only have 16,000 views out of our 300,000 subscribers you guys should really check out this video because uh I show examples and in the in basically I traded Sofi and the next stock on this list is Sofi I'm going to show you what Sofi looks like on the chart because I think this is really important Sofi specifically is a very good company and has a unique fintech Advantage okay uh what I mean by that is they have a unique fintech ecosystem all right I'm going to look at my notes here so I wrote here unlike many fintech competitors Sofi offers a comprehensive Suite of financial products okay this basically allows it to benefit from cross- selling and high customer retention okay that's really important High customer retention and cross- selling makes a lot more money when you have a better relation ship which is by the way this is the whole reason I started one-on-one coaching I see a lot of option gurus coming on to YouTube they're kind of copying me and I have proof that they're basically making the same videos as me that's why I decided to go one-on-one coaching because I actually want to build a better relationship with you personally one to one I'm independent I don't promote anybody else I don't promote any sponsors and I don't promote any other YouTubers quite frankly I've been doing this for 10 years I'm saying this because I think really deeply about customer experience and when I invest in companies I think about the same way I deliver my coaching as a coach I want to make sure that I deliver the best level of experience and that is true for Sofi I'm always looking for a company that has brand that can also deliver the best customer service because what happens is when you deliver a good customer experience and someone gets results and in terms of my coaching or with Sofi when someone has a good experience with their Mobile Banking they don't have to look elsewhere they get everything in one platform in one ecosystem that's exactly what Sofi does which is why I start to really like this stock and this stock has basically gone off to the Moon um a lot I mean this stock went from a $6 stock to $11 per share stock this stock has almost doubled and that's because what they're doing for their customers is phenomenal they're actually focusing on the experience I also believe when you do a good job as a company as a business owner that will Foster that will Foster to customer loyalty and long-term relationships long-term relationships equals money Point Blank that is the most important thing so when I'm looking at investing in Sofi I think that this stock can be a $20 stock you know I'm buying it in November but I think it can be a $20 stock in 2025 and Beyond so by the end of 2025 or early 2026 this stock if it's at $20 will essentially be a double so I'm going to show you the option strategy that I personally would run on Sofi right now I do have a couple positions on Sofi but I'm also going to be looking at using the poor man's covered call strategy or the leap strategy okay let me show you what that looks like all right so I'm up a little bit of money here on Sofi here's what the leap strategy would look like you buy a call option okay you go out far in terms of dates all right so we'll go out to September 19 2025 um I would buy right at the money right around $10 so if you buy at $10 this is a 70 Delta that is beautiful 70 Delta gives you that exposure gives you that um Advantage versus buying the stock because if you buy the stock well you'll have to put up about $11,000 but if you just buy a leap option it's only $315 to control 100 shares so now if I go to sell all right and I go to sell I can sell something like January and I can sell uh something like the $12 strike if I go to expand here you can see it's a 43 Delta it's a little bit high but the bid out spread is amazing and you can see that if uh Sofi has a bullish move in the short term which I think will be slightly bullish again this video is about being slightly bullish I'm not a mega bull right now I'm slightly bullish that I think the market will continue to run positively okay and because it'll run positively you can make $100 here $100 or so if this uh leap option were to go to around $112 per share you would actually make probably even more than that because um essentially going from 11 to 12 is already $100 on the leap option itself and then if the $12 covered call expires um out of the money you've essentially made $75 right here on the premium and then on the call option Rising you'd make about another dollar so you can make a really good return on Sofi every two to three months by doing the poor man's covered call strategy",1.0,0.9

(Selling put options for beginners),Nvidia,"So the next thing that I want to do is I'm going to go to Nvidia on Nvidia I've been bullish and I've said many times that Nvidia because of AI because of the leadership the CEO the management very bullish and I see a big upside to Nvidia I I think this is going to be an $800 stock in the next couple of you know few years it'll take a few years obviously to get to 800 it'll be one of the biggest companies in my opinion so I would say that I'm always looking to acquire shares of Nvidia I'd be more than happy to own the stock anywhere at 1:30 let's actually take a look at nvidia's chart on on Yahoo finance and let's take a look at the bowling ban so the bowling ban is something something that I take a look at very closely specifically the bowling band tells me where a good entry could be you can actually see right here that if I zoom into to the Binger band the moving average is 131 and the bottom of the Binger band is about 127 all right so here's a unique strategy that I'm going to use to sell this put option I'm going to go to trade Nvidia options and I'm specifically looking to really take advantage of that bottom of the bowling band 127 now look that doesn't mean I'm going to go sell a put at 127 I'm actually going to go a little bit more aggressive than that because I want to get aggressive ownership of Nvidia I I want to get assigned I'd be happy to buy the stock so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go for a shorter term expiration is actually very shortterm you know to be honest I like longer term expiration just because I am looking to do less work and I want to stick to that more passive approach so um you could go shortterm you get paid in proportion to the time of the option so a lot of my students that like weekly income I think a lot more of my students like monthly income it just depends typically when I have a student join my Discord we're a lot more active we're learning quickly we're making fast money and then you know we go from making that fast money to quick money and um we just kind of mellow out over over a period of time we just get you know $ 10,000 or more dollars per month and just kind of keeping it chill so look what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to I'm going to go for a see the 130 here has 355 volume 22,000 open interest that's a lot of open interest guys this is very important by the way when you're looking at selling a put option you want to make sure that there is healthy volume because when there's liquidity that that makes it easier to get in get out of this trade and the bid ask here is very tight that's that's beautiful the bid is uh 8.05 the ask is 8.15 I mean that's really tight that means you're going to get a fantastic price on trading this option right here now this option is going for $815 like I said I want ownership so I can go for something even closer to that 40 Delta Mark typically my sweet spot is 30 Delta but if I really want aggressive ownership of a company I may go for a higher Delta so 40 Delta here actually meets what I'm looking for personally right now so I'm going to go ahead and sell a put option on Nvidia I'm going to click continue and this is a sizable uh chunk of money because at 132 strike it does tie up $133,000 per contract so if I were to do five contracts here you know this would be sizable enough for me this would be $65,000 bet I'm going to go for 8.95 H let's go for 8.9 just so I can get filled here a little quicker and I'm going to submit this so right now I submitted this trade wow I did just get filled on five contracts so the collateral is going to be roughly it's going to be roughly $66,000 so if you take 132 and you multiply by five that's essentially yeah it is $66,000 however I have collected 4,000 let's add right now $444 185 cents of the total amount of Premium that I've collected so far in this video I think we're well into the over 5K Mark now and I'm trying to keep the video under 20 minutes so we're over the 5K Mark so we have succeeded I want to see how far we can go here uh in the next 10 10 minutes or whatever so look I think it's really important because the $66,000 worth of collateral here is not actually not 66,000 because the premium that I collected which is the 4,400 it will subtract from the collateral so this is going to be a little bit cheaper then again it is capital intensive to sell puts and you know you need to have the capital because if I get assigned which you know I want to get assigned on Nvidia then I'm going to have to have the the cash to actually buy the shares",1.0,0.95

(Selling put options for beginners),Sofi,"all right so the next stock that I want to go into all right so we've done American Airlines Chipotle I also want to look at another small account trade I want to look at Sofi I think Sofi is a really good company overall it has kind of gone up in price but right now the momentum is strong so I I do have some $10 puts that I've already sold but you will notice here that these 10 puts are expiring very soon so I want to replace them okay what I do is when I sell options I wait closer to expiration as as they're expiring I will typically replace that position or open up a very similar position so I can continue making money with the idea that I have right I want to keep capitalizing on my idea so what going to do right now Sofi is at 10 I'm also going to sell a $10 put and this thing is dropping pretty quickly actually put up Sofi on a chart all right so let me go to charting here and I'll show you that let's actually go to a shorter term chart okay here we had a pretty sizable Bounce from the 1047 level we had a double Peak at 1122 I think we're going to be going sideways here let me go to the bowling band let me actually decrease the period to 10 days to make a little bit tighter so Yes actually I am getting that confirmation that's kind of what I wanted to do was in the next you know two weeks or so do a Sofi trade which will be at around the $10 strike so I'm actually getting perfect confirmation that in the next 10 trading days which is two weeks $10 strike would be you know very safe all right so I want to take a sellp put order I'm going to go a little bit shorter term I'm going to go for the November 15 expiration if you're watching this in the future just use the same logic thought process to collect a bunch of premium in your portfolio this stuff really adds up guys you can easily make you know5 $110,000 just by selling put options every single month so what I'm going to do is you can see here that in 2 weeks I'm essentially getting a $16 premium here which is like around a 1.6% return okay it's not super high but you know then again this sellp put strategy is very safe it's for consistent income it's for optimal entry the bread and butter of income isn't necessarily made from selling puts although it is sizable you get a little bit more from when you actually get a signed and if the stock recovers you can make even more money right so you are looking for the stock to go down the ideal scenario is if the stock falls down you get assigned and then the next week once you're assigned it just goes back up right I had that happen to me so many times and that's why I'm never worried about managing this strategy I don't need to manage this strategy because I'm doing it on stocks that I personally done technical analysis on and I'm happy to own so I'm going to go ahead and execute this in even a small position let's let's go 15 contracts here 15 contracts essentially would be a maximum you know by the way this maximum loss is fake don't don't take this at Phase value because the max loss is basically if the the stock went down to zero yeah I would lose $1,745 but you know obviously when you sell puts on on these companies none of them are going to zero right pretty hard for a company to even fall 20% yet Al loone 10% unless we have a bare Market or a crash so this Max loss isn't something to really pay attention to what I am paying attention to is that on this position I'm collecting $255 I am tying up $14,000 is in collateral but my actual risk is is not really that okay so here I'm going to collect $255 so this is actually a pretty big return you know we have have over 2 and 1 12% thereabouts here which is a yeah pretty good return I'm going to go for the $18 here I'm going to review this trade and submit it and now we will see okay perfect I got filled for 15 contracts on Sofi I sold a $10 put now look if you're watching this in the future I would actually still sell $10 puts for December and for January expiration actually I can show you what that looks like right now but real quick we're going to add the money that I've made we're going to add trading during this video so far okay again I do need these options to go to expiration but you know the cash is in my account so I count this money as good as as good as mine all right so now what I'm going to do is I'll show you that you can do a different expirations on the same stock so I can go to December 20 right now I can still go for a $10 put right here and I can just open up let's say I'm going to open up just two contracts because you know I have enough Sofi I don't want to over leverage into it if I go to $44 and I go for the bid right the bid is much easier to get filled you can play around with the bid ask price but you know I try to go for the bid because I want efficiency in this video as fast as possible I'm just trying to collect money and show you guys that this is really possible for anyone",1.0,0.85

(Selling put options for beginners),Robin Hood,real quick I want to make one more trade on a sell put okay I'm going to oh actually I already know what it's going to be oh I'm super super excited right so uh Robin Hood actually the platform I'm using just reported earnings and look I love selling puts post earnings because I'm not afraid to sell puts into earnings either the implied volatility is high but after earnings to be clear what specifically happens is there's IV Crush okay IV Crush uh means that there's a whole lot of anticipation leading up into earnings after earnings happens there's obviously a big big move in the stock looks like Robin Hood's having a really negative move right now it's continuing to have a negative move in the early hours here in the first 30 minutes of trading so you know the IV Crush has already happened for the most part IV is still kind of crushing since the um volatility is since the stock is still going down but I'm not afraid to trade puts before or after earnings but it is a different mindset okay before earnings right what you need to be aware of is that you may have a big move after earnings you already had the big move but it's probably a continuation of that move so right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell a put option on Robin Hood it looks like some of the price targets here have been lower it also looks like their earnings came out and uh they they've actually had earnings of7 per share now for me I've been following Robin Hood for a very long time so this reaction of the stock falling down has raised quite a lot of money from its market cap like quite a lot like a fall of 133% from the market cap of right it's basically lost over about $3 billion or so give or take so I'm going to go to trade Robin Hood options or Hood options I'm going to go to sell put now I can go shortterm there this is crazy in one day okay this this option expires tomorrow in one day you can collect over 1% return right here okay this also is about 1% return and it's a dollar lower this is an interesting trade okay I personally don't like to do this type of really shortterm trade so I'm going to go for still a short-term trade but I'm going to go 15 days out and you can see here how the returns are still Bonkers they're like wow this is over 3% in 2 weeks that's over 6% in a month that's 100% return annualized per year okay so what I'm going to do is I'm probably going to go for the 22 A2 uh the bid ask here is actually not good this is not a good bid ask 5782 means there's a lot of slippage cost not good let me go for 22 okay that's better right so the 22 and a half strike price is just a little bit of a weird strike price um and it didn't have that much volume 30 volume whereas this has 165 volume so this would be a better option to trade and I'm going to get about 2 and 1 half 3ish per return I'm just going to go for 10 contracts here nothing too crazy I'm going to go for 0.55 okay so I could go for 0.56 again I want this video to be super efficient there we go I just sold 10 contracts and we're going to add $549 70s to My overall return here for this video,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,8n8oQVUjWzI,2024-10-29T21:31:27Z,Perfect Time To Buy Calls for High Growth (Nvidia Stock),Nvidia,"Nvidia is currently the biggest company by market cap in the entire world and they have earnings in about 3 weeks which is why I'm gearing up to trade options on Nvidia and make a ton of money like I just did on Tesla this is the perfect time to buy and to sell options this is a very unique opportunity so check out the CNBC clip on how I'm going to be playing earnings great to see you uh Nvidia doesn't report until late kind of lsh November but of course so so many signals this week right um with capex from some of the Meg s what do they need to show us to keep the Nvidia party going look they just need to show us that demand is there and strong and ideally growing right I mean the the big concern with I mean there's a number of concerns when anything runs this much but I mean the biggest concern has just been sustainability like the numbers have gotten so big so quickly you just worry that it can't keep going and like as of right now from everything we can see it looks like it's still going like I I I get the nervousness it clearly is not time to worry this year I don't even think it's time to worry next year we we we'll see as we go farther out but I think at this point they just need to show that demand is is strong and growing and accelerating and at least from where we're standing right now everything we can see things look pretty good I think right as Stacy I want to ask you about the story that SEMA was just talking about and that is the idea that um Trump especially but perhaps both candidates would crack down on Manufacturing of chips inside of the US but what we've seen from tsmc versus what we haven't seen from Intel sort of talk about that and what it would mean if tsmc wasn't able to ramp up here in the United States I mean it's look I I'll be honest so I heard Trump's comments as well and he was what did what did he say on on Rogan he said he didn't like the chips act he wanted to replace it with ter I it makes look it's it's Trump so he's gonna he's goingon to Trump is going to Trump but it doesn't make any sense right the idea that like Taiwan has stolen quote unquote our our chip making abilities is ridiculous like that that is not true and like not allowing foreign companies to make chips on us so that that is actually what we want I mean look the the whole like the idea that we are dependent on Taiwan and that is becoming increasingly an untenable situation is is very true and you know we want to get Leading Edge infrastructure built here in the US and to be honest from a policy standpoint it really shouldn't be mad all that much who who is building it I understand why Intel is sort of named the national champion but if the goal is really to get as much Leading Edge capacity built here as quickly as possible we should be giving the money to the folks who who can build it and as of right now that that entity is is tsmc and you're right you know there were there was some news flow of last week that suggested that their yield ramp in Arizona is actually exceeding targets and maybe even exceeding what they do in Taiwan there are no other players neither in nor Samsung that can make claims of anywhere near that so if the goal is to build the capacity and get it here and installed and running in the US to to you know to dest the supply chain that that's happening right now and so stopping that would be a problem sure have we have we given up on Intel then well we we we'll see I they report on they report earnings on Thursday I guess we'll see what they have to to say but I mean clearly you know in Intel's Core Business is under pressure they're they're losing share and they can't rely on their own manufacturing right now they so they're actually Outsourcing more which is impacting gross margins and everything like that so are their suggestion is that they believe their process Rob over time is getting fixed they're going to bring that volume back into the US and it's going to make everything you know wonderful I guess we'll see you know they they they they had a a a day of a few months ago where they were sort of giving out some targets for where they thought things could go over time and it really was like a 2030 story right even if they are on track like it's it's a slog between now and and and when we would actually see things really start to improve and as of right now we don't actually know if they're truly improving or not so strap in for Thursday I guess um uh it'll be entertaining uh if nothing else I'm sure yeah we're not going to get Invidia for a little bit Stacy but you know every so often you hear I'm sure you do it more than I do H well there's you know a small company over here that's developing a Next Generation chip that's going to ultimately disintermediate or or or push Nvidia to the side I mean how long is their dominance do you think going to last well I I mean there's always somebody in the wings that this is an enormous market right the idea that there's not going to be others trying to take a piece of that pie is ridiculous of course they are now that being said like nvidia's built up their position in in Silicon and hardware and software and systems and ecosystem over oh 10 or 20 years right and they they've put those Moes into place and so anybody that is trying to get in there and and I'm not talking that people can't get little bits clearly you know A and B and others are getting you know little bits but to be like material in that market you've got to like like penetrate those Moes and it's very very difficult thing to do and especially for a startup I when you just look at the the uh the amount of of of money that Nvidia has to invest in these things versus you know smaller you know very small companies it it's it it's a it's tough It's very very tough so at this point I'm not terribly worried about some like young upart coming in and taking a massive amount of of Nvidia I'm not even really that worried about larger companies larger competitors going in and trying to take a all right guys I want to show you my screen my Nvidia position and how I'm going to be trading this stock so look check it out one of the first things so look one of the highlights here of the analyst rasgon what he was saying is that Nvidia must demonstrate Revenue growth for earnings and I think that he's looking at nvidia's demand sustainability so when looking at the company sustainability you want to understand if the company is growing for NVIDIA it's clearly and very very obvious that it is a yes so so I'm expecting earnings to be very strong and just looking at the high valuations I'm personally not concerned Nvidia has had high valuations for a number of years yet their revenue growth is far exceeding what expectations are in the market the market is an expectations game guys so taking a look at Nvidia they're likely to meet expectations now look the current stock price is right under $140 per share if you take a look year to date at Nvidia this stock is a clear momentum winner absolutely clear okay now if I scroll down here on Robin Hood and I show you their earnings check it out their earnings continue to go up like basically in q1 of 2024 they barely beat earnings I know it's kind of hard to tell if I like scroll in there you can see they beat earnings by a bit they beat earnings by a bit in Q2 in Q3 and Q4 all right they have beat earnings and by the way I think this is off just by one year because we're not in 2025 but uh Robin Hood is saying we are so I believe this is 2023 and and and um this is 2024 so look they beat earnings last period this is last period and the period before every single quarter that we get earnings Nvidia beats and every time it it beats it gives more confidence to the market we have beat 1 2 3 four five six six of six of the past earnings okay so coming in on just under three weeks right now I am going to be trading options in a a very smart way to make a load of money just like I did on Tesla I printed money on Tesla literally printed okay now if I scroll up right now you'll see a couple of my Nvidia positions I'm essentially selling puts but I think going into earnings you actually want to buy call options okay this is something that I don't typically recommend and I would say that obviously buying strategies can be a lot more risky so I'm going to show you a couple of different variations of how I would be buying call options I'll show you buying call options I'll show you the poorman's covered call which is buying leaps and then selling call options on it and then I'm also going to show you uh so the bull call spread so those three strategies so I'm going to show you three strategies in this video it's going to be it's going to be filled with knowledge in this video so I also want to just point out that um you know the analyst was covering competitive threats for nvidia's dominance so he was saying that despite smaller companies attempting to enter the semiconductor Market he believes that nvidia's extensive ecosystem Hardware advancements and Financial Resources provide significant competitive Moes for the business which is extremely extremely important um I can't tell you how important it is to have a mo for a business that's actually the number one thing that Warren Buffett looks for is a mo so look one more thing before I show you some trades is earning season is a really exciting time but it's also a risky time so I want you to be aware that you can absolutely print money but it's also a potentially risky time because I mean there is a small chance that Nvidia might not beat earnings right so you just want to be aware that you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket and asset allocation and having proper diversification is a thing that you do have to pay attention to even though I am making a lot of videos here on Nvidia and palen here and I've printed money like my portfolio is going to hit 4 million not this year because um you know as we only have like two more months right we have November and December so it's possible but I'm probably not going to hit 4 mil this year but I'll hit it probably in January or February um you guys if you're subscribed you've seen the portfolio just rise and Rise right so look let's talk about um buying call options specifically the strategy of when I would do that so let's go to buy call I'm going to go for so look we got earnings on November 20th so November 22nd would be um the expiration date that you would pick for for capturing earnings right the call options are fairly expensive I would probably go for something really close to the money like the 140 right here you can see that the Delta is 0.55 so it's an outof the money option but the market expects Nvidia to go up so much so that the Delta is 0.55 and it's out of the money so that gives uh that paints the picture that the market has a bias for NVIDIA to rise like literally we have a bias for it to go up because typically an out- of- the- money option should not have a Delta of over 50 because you know the market follows random walk random walk states that um essentially the market is you know it's not certain if the stocks going to go up or down but for NVIDIA it it's pretty definitive that it's going to it's going to go up at least based on the option activity right so there's a whole lot of volume here there's 3,000 contracts traded and almost 16,000 on the open interest implied volatility is pretty high the bid ask spread is pretty tight this is a fantastic option to buy so you can buy this um if you buy this call option you'll have to pay about ,000 it is pretty expensive all right so your break even here is actually around 150 but look if Nvidia goes to say 160 by November 20 uh 2nd because of earnings then you could essentially double your money I mean that's nooke joke right doubling your money in 3 weeks I mean you kidding me I have a lot of students that have 100K 200k 300K portfolios and more so it's potentially you can make 100K in 3 weeks now obviously that's if you put your entire money on the position which you know I wouldn't recommend that at all you got to you got to be aware of risk management but uh look you can buy a call you can also sell a call so I would still stick to the 140 where you buy the call okay and then you can sell a call option let's go for you know let's say that we think it's going to go to 150 which is entirely possible here you can see how you can actually still double your money and I think this is actually a better play in my opinion so um if you're going to be buying options yeah you can buy calls you got really tremendous upside so if Nvidia went to 200 you would absolutely print money on a on a buy call option but I'm not really a kind of guy that likes to bet on big moves if I can make 5% a month then pretty happy right $3 million uh that's like well into the six figures per month or even if you have let's say1 K 5% it's 5 grand a month it's really good right so I would say that I'm not looking for like a massive like crazy move but I'm still going to print money and make a lot of money by just by just basically I can go for a call debit spread so here in this example you can buy the 140 and you can sell the 150 and the 150 essentially subsidizes the cost of the 140 right so you're paying $985 but then you're selling a call option and you are collecting $535 so you're total cost is only going to be um $450 which yeah has like half off right it's half off of buying and call option and the craziest thing is you uh will actually double your money at 150 rather than like um I think in our last example was 160 right because your break even was 150 in the prior example and to make a total of $20 you needed to go to 160 because the call was at$ 140 right so you need to go to 160 here we only need to go to 150 to double our money so this is a lot easier to double your money and this is probably more or less what I'm going to open up a small position on um when the Market opens up in about an hour although in an hour I have a interview with one of my students who has been very profitable so I'm going to get grab a testimonial I'm going to have a lot more testimonials on this channel guys because I have so many successful students and I haven't been posting their results which I want to share more of their results so definitely watch out for that I'm going to have that pretty soon here um it's going to be my wheel strategy um course which I'm coming out with very soon so U make sure that you have notifications on for that now um the max loss here is uh is only what you pay so whatever you pay is what you can lose so I like that it's a Define risk so this is a fantastic position now uh something else I'll show you is you can also buy a leap option okay so leap option is also a very powerful strategy where you just buy a call option that goes out uh far into the future so let's say that we go for September 19 2025 obviously that captures this earnings next earnings and the next earnings right so it captures in many earnings and and that is good because as Nvidia keeps beating earnings it'll likely you know rise and as it rises um this leap option will will perform very well so if I expand here this is a 68 Delta all right the implied volatility is lower the implied volatility is smooth out over a longer period of time so you saw that um a shorter term call option was having a like 68 69% volatility it's a little bit more smooth at 53% so um this option you know is going to be actually a little bit cheaper because when you're buying options you know lower volatility is good and that's why you know after earnings happens basically there's IV Crush typically so um right now we have higher implied volatility on Nvidia because there's there is earnings right so you can buy something like this you can buy a longer term call option and then you can sell calls against it so you can go for let's say let's say I'm going to show you a little bit different of a scenario so I can go for November 22nd right and now I can say hey I think Nvidia will go up but let's say that you're only moderately bullish on Nvidia you can can actually now sell the 150 and say I think Nvidia will go up but I don't think it'll go up much higher than 150 you can see what happens here to the Chart okay so I don't this is this has its pros and cons there's no best trade to make an option trading there is just strategies for your point of view okay if that makes sense for your point of view I probably not do this strategy right here but I'm giving you the option to because you know not everyone is Mega bullish on Nvidia you can be slightly bullish on Nvidia and still make money on it in this way if Nvidia goes towards 150 right you'll make money on the leap uh option right here so you'll make really good money you can make uh well you won't double your money so I would say that this position right here would probably be best done after earnings I have several videos on the POR man's covered call so I'm going to have that uh linked at the end screen here so yeah I wanted to show you the three strategies but I would say the first two are going to be much better the poorman's covered call you should do probably after earnings because um the implied volatility will go down and you'll have less risk of getting a the short call option so if you want to check out the port man's cover call video on how to do it properly I actually have an Nvidia video on that so check it out right here on the screen",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,OQhahDREU0g,2024-10-28T18:00:15Z,Secret Options Trading Strategies to Outsmart the Market (Full Course),Tinder,"I look at Tinder because Tinder has vast amounts of data okay all the S&P 500 companies in Tinder is owned by match match.com or match group right I specifically look at Tinder because first of all I do use it I I have used Tinder I do date in Eastern Europe but the other thing is I like data guys data is how I make my decisions okay I make data driven decisions when it comes to psychology there's many easy ways to lie about data there's many there's a lot of misinformation online even from your option gurus that seem to have money and to seem to have a good brand there's a lot of misinformation out there okay so when it comes to misinformation I like to use data to decide okay okay and I have a data anal degree and I love using vast amounts of data guys one data point isn't enough one data point is not enough okay you need a lot of data so looking at Tinder Tinder has tens and hundreds of thousands of data points right and I looked at a studies I looked at a lot of studies on Tinder some of them are public and some of them are taught by the CEO they you know the chief marketing officer Etc on these calls they'll go out and say hey these are our data points this is what we're looking at right because as a company Tinder is trying to decide how to keep people on the platform so more people are paying uh Tinder and staying on the platform right when they looked at the data of men and women it it seems that men will swipe left and right so if you don't know how Tinder works it's men and women both on the platform and they're both looking to uh if you swipe left that means you don't like someone if you swipe right that means you like someone if you swipe right and they swipe right you have a match and then from there you get to have a conversation right so when they look at the data points right women they find something a little bit wrong they swipe left they swipe left immediately because women are the Chooser they're the choosier sex because obviously there's biological repercussions whatever right I'm not going to get into all the biology of things but they have a higher reproduction cost right because women when they have a baby it is higher cost than a man who could in theory have hundreds of Offspring whereas women cannot right so on Tinder this is this is actually a fact it actually shows you through data that women will swipe left they don't want 90% of men they don't want them because they don't meet their standard they don't meet the looks what whatever something has turned them off men on the other hand um swipe 50/50 or even more leaning towards yes on most women because men are much less picky than women and this is through data and this is a very interesting phenomenon that actually has a lot to do with trading because trading is statistics statistics and data help you make better decisions and the game of trading is all about risk while it may seem low risk because the loss per trade is capped at a certain Mark where you're buying options these and small losses can slowly erode in account so small losses can lead to huge losses especially if you're chasing short-term price movements and the idea of limited risk in this case is M misleading because the likelihood of winning big is much lower than it actually appears just the same way as I mentioned with poker the same way that I mentioned with the genie index where rich people getting richer and poor people getting poor there is statistical facts that you can take advantage of and the same thing applies for the market that's exactly what I do with my option selling every morning I do a lot of research I'm trying to exploit statistical um anomalies okay so when you're selling options for example I'm looking for statistical anomalies now I don't necessarily have as much data as I used to so I used to work on Wall Street and I had access to a lot of data part of the reason I have data analytics degree is because stock market is just a lot of data information right and um I was working at a hedge fund and essentially we were trying to predict if a stock was going to beat earnings or not okay and if the beat earnings obviously has a chance to win so I had many different factors that I've worked on it's called factor analysis stuff I don't talk about on this channel typically um because I try to get really really to the point and I try to keep it more like broad because I have a bigger audience right I'm the number one option coach in the world and I have a lot of views so I want to keep it very high level and then I make it a lot more like specific in my Discord Community right but in this video it's a longer video and I want to give you all the knowledge that I know I hope you're really enjoying these examples cuz straight up what I'm talking about no one talks about because they not is uh they don't have formal education they don't know how to talk about it like I I have a data analytics degree so can talk about statistics and data analysis and give you real examples because I have a lot of experience here I worked at hedge funds more so as a financial analyst and a Quant and I wasn't a Trader guys I don't have licensing to be a Trader but I'm in my opinion better than a Trader because I actually know how it works on a deep level and I use statistics to outperform the market really important if you look at Jim Simmons or any other hedge fund Titan a lot of them are mathematicians they are mathematicians and they're exploiting the market through algorithmic trading so I did not do algorithmic trading per se but I was looking at multiple multiactor models which can be applied to algorithmic trading all right so I want to discuss uh after working at Goldman Sachs to hedge funds economics Finance degree all that stuff I'm telling you that you need to understand statistics better and I hope that this video has changed how you think about statistics with some of the examples I gave you and by the way to wrap up with the Tinder example yeah women are just a lot more picky when they choose a partner whereas men are not as picky and also one more crazy thing is the top 10% of men will match with the 80% of women so it is again the genie index the rich get richer and the same applies for Tinder statistics that top 10% of men the best looking men The Tall Men I'm not particularly tall myself so if a man's 6' 3 literally life is is kind of easy right life is a lot easier it's a lot lot easier when you're a tall man options just completely open up all right just completely open up because a lot of women's preferences are taller men so on the Tinder dating app you'll see that and I and I by the way I talk to a lot of guys I have a lot of friends here in Warsaw Poland um because it is a very good place for entrepreneur there's a lot of entrepreneurs here because entrepreneurs are leaving America because the dating is really bad there and they're going to other countries there's a trend on the internet called passport Bros where basically men are going to other countries where it's much easier to find their dating preferences right I won't go into too much detail but there's a lot of travel going around on the men's side right going away from America and I talked to a lot of men and there's a clear correlation it's it's not an opinion it's it it is a clear correlation being taller gets more results just like being richer gets more results right being better looking you make more money it is is just a proven fact and there's multiple research studies on that so I'm not going to beat this whole Tinder example on by dead horse but just to wrap it up the top percentage of men get 80% of the women and the bottom 50% of men get zero results absolutely zero right so that's the same thing in economics the bottom 50% of society has no wealth they have like 1% of wealth like the bottom 50% of America is like debt nothing in their bank account 2K 3K they can't even afford to fix a tire right they can't they have an emergency expense 67% of Americans say that would be a problem to fix right they can't fix a flat tire cuz they don't have the finances for it and then from 50% to 80% this category has money that's like your middle class they have some money but then once you get into the top 10% of of people's earnings it like starts a Skyrocket like for me my income I've I've I've taken a look at it it it probably puts me at around 0.5% right so half of 1% I don't know what it is for my age if I look at it for my age I might be even lower I'm a little bit on the younger side but still the if you look at wealth it's it's like this right and the people that are richer than me are way way richer than me right people have 50 million 100 million and then Leonardo DiCaprio money and then billionaire status right so there's many many levels to the game I'm just somewhere further along towards that level right same thing applies in in all areas including trading what level are you at because there's many many levels that you're not even aware of that I want to bring to your attention I'm not even the best Trader guys I am not the best Trader there's traders that are far far better than me but they're not on YouTube because they're busy being Traders all right they're busy being Traders which I don't I personally am more of a social P personality so that's why I'm on YouTube I'm the best option coach with the best results on YouTube there's better people than me but they're not on YouTube I'm actually a Trader and I became a millionaire as a Trader and then I later on became a coach so I want to be really clear about that so if you want to get rich you need to understand how to put probability in your favor the genie index how do you become that one poker player that's a winner how do you become that top level Tinder guy that gets all the matches how do you become the top 1% Trader how do you do that well it's not with limited risk options um and it's not by really even selling options the secret is being in high probability positive expected value places positive expected value I'm going to explain to you what positive expected value means this is statistics and I'll explain to you what it means in just a second let me discuss one more thing here I have some notes here and I want to I want to stick to I want to be organized the overemphasis on the safety of buying options is a classic example of how the industry uses framing to shape perceptions on the general public so you can make more trades and spend more money with a broker this pisses me off guys a lot of people they over trade because the industry makes money off of you the industry makes money off of you over trading so I'm I'm telling you right now trade less if you want more results I'm making free videos you don't have to buy anything I I don't recommend buying Financial education for the most part okay if you if you want more coaching with me that's cool but in general I've looked at other programs I have students coming from me from other programs and they all say the same thing the program was okay but I didn't learn anything new or the program is pretty good but I didn't get any results it's always like the same conversation when they come to me and they've tried all the other programs cuz you guys watch a lot of channels and I I see the data I have tons of data I actually see exactly when you guys click off the video I see how many people subscribe how long you watch down to the second okay it's actually crazy how powerful YouTube is it also points out how important data is because it helps me become a better Coach and I see that in my coaching programs as well I track students results I track when they're successful what mistakes they're making and over the years I figured out the common mistakes and how to avoid these mistakes I've also realized better coaching Styles because I've been at it for five years I've been I'm the first option coach on on YouTube for the most part there's a guy maybe there's a couple people older than me that have more subscribers but they're not coaches they own brokerages like literally like tasty Works owns a brokerage right that's the only guys that have been option coaches longer than me they literally own brokerages and I look at students outcomes and I'm always trying to think to myself how can I make students better how can I make them take less mistakes and the overemphasis on the safety of buying options in the marketplace is an example of how industry uses framing to basically make you trade more and I always tell students right away do not trade so much you're just making The Brokerage rich not yourself you want to get rich don't make The Brokerage rich don't make you know others Rich make yourself rich make yourself rich that's why in Discord Community when I trade live on Monday and Wednesday I just do 10 to 15 trades I am not doing too many trades first of all it's bad for your time and second of all it's bad for commission and even if you think your broker is free like Robin Hood it's actually not free guys Robin Hood is not free H wake up Nothing in life is free all right for the most part Nothing in life is free so Robin Hood is not free they're giving you subpar execution right and there's also a bitas spread so every time you trade other people are trading and they're providing liquidity and volume you're losing money so you're probably learning a lot of stuff in this video I'm really happy for it if if you if you are please subscribe it would be it would mean the world to me so look many Traders uh and if this is not for my eego guys I'm I'm literally telling you what worked my goal is profitability and results for my students and I put my money where my mouth is so I don't go for false safety and I also go for high probabilistic outcomes which is really interesting look I'm going to tell you a story that's going to blow your mind all right this story is going to blow your mind about Warren Buffett Warren Buffett famously he got documented declining a bet related to golf specifically in the context of his humility and self-awareness regarding his golfing skills with his best friend Bill Gates this incident occurred during a conversation with Bill Gates in back in 2010 right this is what I found online but I heard about this story a long time ago Buffett and Gates were discussing various topics including their favorite pastimes right Gates jokingly suggested hey Warren Buffett let's make a bet on golf if you win you win $10,000 if if you can beat me in a round of golf Warren Buffett said I don't know man so how much do I have to bet b get said $1 bet me $1 you bet $1 if I lose you get $10,000 $1 you bet $10,000 you win wow guys that seems like a really good profitable bet huh that seems really good huh Buffett refused he said heck with that I don't need that I can bet you I'll tell you what happened there I can bet you Warren Buffett refused because he is not overestimating his ability to win and because even $1 bet to win $110,000 is not worth it if the odds are one in 100,000 to break even on a bet where you bet $1 and get $10,000 you need odds of 1 in 10,000 right Warren Buffett probably said I don't think I can win even one out of 10,000 times therefore he refused the bet because basic statistics says that that would be negative expected value it is not high probabilistic because he's not going to win so there's no point of him betting $1 to win 10,000 in this case it would be an even money bet it would be worth it if he could put 10 cents instead of $1 because 10 cents would be one out of 100,000s and Bill Gates gave him one out of 10,000s and Warren Buffett said no I'm not paying a dollar because the odds of me winning are probably less than one in 10,000 so it's at negative expected value you tell me does this stuff start make sense to you so don't fall for the false safety of limited risk options or even option traders that post stupid videos claiming that they have a high win rate right I've seen that on the internet I've see that coming up a lot now I see option Traders or or not option Traders YouTubers influencers that will say that they're option Traders the newer ones especially they'll say ah we got a high win rate guys look I got a 90% win rate look at that guys 90% win rate is no good to me I don't care about what win rate is are you profitable how much money are we making 90% if you have a high win rate and you win 90% of the time you win a dollar 90 90 times but 10 times you lose 50 do the math you won 90 and you lost 50 10 times you lost $500 you made 90 you're negative $410 you guys understand me win rate is extremely deceiving okay when I see other YouTubers claiming that they have high win rates I laugh I laugh I know that they don't know what they're talking about about I know they're marketing only I know they don't know what they're talking about because having a high win rate is extremely not important and it's extremely deceiving I'm not looking at win rate guys because again going back to expected value you can have a 99% win rate if it's only $1 and your 1% lose rate loses a million guys that's no good that is no good so it's actually not win rate it's all about expected value which is statistic and nobody's going to talk about it nobody's talking about how to actually make a lot of money so all right so I'm just pulling up my portfolio here on my phone CU I want to point out that in the past one month I have had a 3.21% return and $112,000 okay you can see that I'm not making crazy money by no means I'm making 3 to 5% per month but it is extremely extremely consistent and I pull up my videos all the time I have nothing to hide I've shown you guys over and over for the past 5 years my whole entire journey to building this 3.6 a million do portfolio because I'm actually confident that I know what I'm talking about I actually show my entire journey and um this $112,000 that I made in the past month and 3% return I mean it's more than enough to live on and also you can see that I'm going for high probability trades like you will see right now that I have Chipotle Nvidia Google Nvidia Target palen here I got I got spy trade by the way this is a shorter term spy trade I open this up a little bit short term here I am doing some shorter term trading it's actually yesterday I opened this up I think today is uh see what today is so it's been like a day or so or two so I actually open this up the other day and so far I'm already up on this position $540 so yeah spy you can make plenty of money in spy but there's so many positions that I have here and I'm just trying to I'm just trying to make consistent income guys I'm trying to place high probability trades I don't care about a high win rate I don't care about looking good I only care about what are my actual results how much how much cash am I actually making per month what what is the percentage return because obviously I have students that have smaller portfolios and we want to you know grow their accounts so percentage return matters I get it that everyone has millions of dollars you don't need millions of dollars average student account size is 70 to 100K obviously I have many sixf figureure portfolios and then I have many five figure portfolios so it it's both and one thing I want to point out is um in my portfolio I'm using boring companies all right I'm using very very boring companies so when it comes to psychology a lot of people think that they have to get cute they have to get really Innovative no you don't literally the stock market is a proven game that's been working for like you know so so many decades before my dad was born I think around my grandpa was born the stock market was around right it's been around it dates back a long time right early 1900s I don't have the data in front of me but this is a proven game and options specifically are super lucrative because a lot of people are jumping into options right now they don't watch my videos they're not subscribed to the channel they don't understand how I'm trading and they're following like rumors right that's why Warren Buffett doesn't live in New York City is because there's just too many rumors and people have bad results it's like so funny New York City which is um the capital of Finance has some of the worst results because there's so many people that are overtrading and they're overdoing it in New York City they are trying to outperform the market and they get other opinions and they end up underperforming the market completely that is our lengthy chapter let's go to the next chapter the next secret and lie in the industry is high volatility plays equals more money false You guys saw my portfolio my portfolio of boring company has outperformed all the interesting investors on YouTube in the stock market online and basically everyone who is going for sexy has underperformed me I've performed better than you know I've seen guys on YouTube tattooed chef and all these little stocks and this will make you a millionaire no I haven't seen any millionaires that have made a million and kept a million some people made a million none of them kept it all right that's because boring wins guys boring and simple wins that's why my YouTube channel here I almost want to change my name I almost want to do Wheeling strategy with Henry all right run the wheel with Henry this strategy I've been using for a decade since I was like 19 I was a teenager I've been running the wheel I literally became Rich part of it I'll be honest was Bull call spreads on Tesla so let me not say I made all my money on the wheel cuz that would be that would be a false statement I'd be lying I I didn't make all my money on the wheel but I've certainly Built My most consistent income from the wheel all right I've made like $500 to $600,000 on spreads and it helped me grow my portfolio for sure but I took a little bit higher risk and I would have still gotten to where I am today just a little bit slower had I just ran the wheel strategy and I'm running the wheel predominantly right now I'm not doing spreads as much anymore but I was so let me let me be honest let me be honest about that anyways The Lure of high volatility options guys is not actually all it said to be the lore of high volatility options often draws Traders in with the promise of sub substantial returns many believe that riding the wave of volatility will lead them to Quick profits lured by stories of traders who hit it big overnight right like oh they hit it big oh let me go for high volatility no no this is this excitement often overshadows the real risks involved as Traders tend to underestimate both the inherent volatility and the effect of time Decay on their options okay time Decay very very important we'll cover that soon so when I sell options I use implied volatility but it's not really the main focus all my profitable students and I have all my profitable students and I have over basically thousands basically thousands of all my profitable students and it's been thousands at this point by the way with the students it's been like all my profitable students and it's been thousands at this point I've coached thousands of students that have watched me become profitable I have 20 one-on-one students at the moment which is by the way what I'm focused on I'm focus on one-on-one coaching more so now I still have Discord but I focused on one-on-one coaching which includes Discord all right at this point we're only focusing on Delta and Theta we're focusing a little bit on volatility but I'm paying really close attention to just Delta because Delta gives you a lot Delta tells you the whole picture very very quickly without having to waste a lot of time and I create a 15 stockat list with them and when I when I do my one-on-one coaching I'm like listen we just need 15 stocks we need to do this on a consistent basis doc a lot of doctors I work with I say hey Doc we're going to do 15 stocks you do some covered calls for you doc we're not even going to go one month we're going to go two or three months we're going to set the position and if you feel worried contact me otherwise your prescription is you're going to wait until expiration with me all right we're going to wait until expiration and as we get close to expiration we'll have another call we'll we'll take a look at your portfolio make some adjustments maybe some rolls but this time doc go be a doctor go enjoy life go go do go do your thing because we're not actively trading you don't need to when you have proper entry you don't need to do all that right if you're running the wheel strategy and that's basically exclusively what I do with with all my guys it's very low maintenance low maintenance and low volatility can be high returns so don't fall for the Trap of hype stocks and chasing volatility that is a huge mistake on your guys's end huge mistake to follow just volatility blindly and just Chase Chase Chase listen you're not a lion you're not chasing a gazelle all day right I mean that sounds fun right let's be honest let's not Chase let's attract let's get that income to come to us it's also a big big psychological thing right A lot of people you guys are chasing things in life you tell me has chasing you know I have women watching I respect women I have a lot of women students I recently had two women sign up they're doing fantastic they they gave me a testimonial within their first month but let me just say this for the guys chasing women you don't get results chasing money you don't get results chasing anything in life you don't get that outcome when you relax you lean back and you don't need it I don't need money I don't need women I don't need nothing I'm fine I'm I'm I'm chilling myself I'm I'm fine guess what right now I'm getting all the results I'm getting the best students I'm getting the best results when it comes to trading I'm getting high level women getting good women I'm getting results at the gym I'm getting results because I've stopped chasing I need you guys to get into this mindset of stop chasing start attracting start getting your mentality and your mindset and your psychology to where you want to be pretend you're already there okay and then do as if you're already that successful person get rid of those bad habits and already function like you've already made it that way when you lose a trade you say listen I'm a successful man or a woman it's all right it's all right I'm going to make it back right you got to be optimistic you got to have that strong mindset okay stop chasing if you think you're making good money now in this market you could be making a lot more let me tell you that also all right A lot of people going back to the last CH last two chapters ago about overconfidence you think you're making good money you can make more money a lot more money I have new students that make 177% return in their first month okay so if you think your 5K on 100K is good it's good five students making $177,000 on 100K so be hungry but don't chase I have a video by the way on my momentum wheel strategy which um I think is really important because it's a little bit of a deviation on the wheel strategy so I'm going to have that at the end of this video when you get to the end and I tell you you know you can watch the momentum wheel strategy that'll be up on the screen that's really important for you because that is the mixture of high returns it's the mixture of low volatility and that's actually what I've been implementing right now is the momentum wheel strategy it's a strategy that I personally made up and I'm innovating in this industry of option trading I'm innovating because I'm the number one option coach in the world I'm innovating and I think the momentum wheel strategy is specifically using higher um momentum stocks in a in a certain pattern and Trend to use the wheel so I'll add that as at the end or it'll be in the description you can watch later all right guys we got through another chapter all right in this course of just really outsmarting the market and and putting psychology to use to make a lot more money to dial up your gains like crazy in this next chapter all right we're going to talk about confirmation bias in strategy selection this is a big Pitfall even the expert Traders make this in general is by the way a very huge human error very huge bias all right confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that causes individuals to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs or hypothesis while disregarding or downplaying evidence that contradicts those other beliefs all right in the context of trading this bias can lead traders to seek out data analysis or narratives that align with their current strategies or their you know viewpoint for example all right if a Trader believes that a particular stock is you know destined to rise you're in love with paler I like paler too but I'm not in love with it I'm not married to it paler has a bad quarter I see something bad I'm out I don't get emotional about money guys I'm trying to make money here I'm trying to make you rich I'm not getting emotional if a stock has bad earnings I'm not married to it I'm out I'm out the door's right there right investors they may actively look for positive news or analyst reports that support their views while ignoring bearish indicators or Warnings this is super dangerous super dangerous all right very very dangerous all right it's kind of like the equivalent of a woman who falls in love with the man the man's a bad boy tattoos Thief robber whatever and that woman's like oh he's he's my dream man he's okay like dude that guy is in the streets like killing others and she's with them all right that's that's super dangerous because that woman is in love that's like a romantic example right I'm giving you guys examples across the board you know sorry some of my examples you know not the most appropriate or whatever but I'm just giving you examples of how psychology works which is what this course is about okay it's super dangerous to fall in love it's super dangerous to be completely dependent and super dangerous to have confirmation bias all right confirmation bias I took a lot of psychology as you guys can see I'm very well rounded I i' I I'm pretty good in many areas of of of the important areas of life um always studying always improving because when you improve you do a better job you do a better job as a human you do a better job with God you do a better job in your results and areas of life so I just want to say that one more time now look this is this confirmation bias is very common politics it's it's common in romantic relationships it's common in sports and many other things in life trading is is life trading is life guys it's literally life all right so a a DieHard fan of a sports team for example May highlight their team strengths right I don't know I'm from Philadelphia right so I don't watch football I watch Tennis but let's say you're an Eagles fan right or Cowboys or whatever right I don't watch football but but let's say you're a DI hard fan of the Eagles right you may highlight hey you know Donovan McNab or whoever is our quarterback at this time been a while uh he's he's the best we have all these strong players but you're going to ignore the weak players right let's go to uh let's go to tennis for example you might say well Roger feder doesn't really have any weaknesses I'm trying to point out a weakness but the top players don't have any weaknesses um alz right now has no weaknesses feder has no weaknesses jokovic Nadal they don't have weaknesses but you kind of see where I'm going at especially when there's a team sport basketball football there's typically a player that is a little bit lower than other players even though they're all a players there's typically like an S player who's like better than the rest like LeBron James whatever people who love their teams will downplay the bad part right oh no no that's nothing bad right you know he's he's all right he's good he's good right so that's that's confirmation bias you're going to look you're going to actively look for reasons to believe you're going to actively look you're going to passively look for reasons not to believe all right so the case of a you know the woman in love with the killer bad boy she say oh well you know he hugged me today he he's a nice guy but he killed someone oh well he was just having a bad day see it's a little extreme but confirmation bias is Extreme guys I'm not being extreme I'm telling you what I see every single day I see Traders they have a stock they fall in love with it they're immune to the bad news bad news comes out no you know the company's good while the company's falling it's a negative momentum spiral no it's okay it's okay crashes 30% and then they Chang their mind too late it's too late you got to look at the writing on the wall once you see a warning got to start thinking don't get tied to the stock think for yourself and don't have confirmation buys all right let me go more example for instance a fan of a football team might celebrate a recent win as evidence of their superiority of that team right but he may neglect to consider their poor performance in the previous matches right or it should be those losses just a bad luck guys I don't really believe in luck I believe in skill and statistics and data all right in In God We Trust all others must bring data that is my statistics professor's mug on his uh on his desk sports betting by the way if you're curious is also a lot confirmation bias all right it can be very profitable by the way sports betting can be very profitable I'm curious if you guys do that but um curious if you guys are into sports betting I personally am not against it right I think it could be profitable so look my goal is not only to make you richer but to protect you from getting poor in one secret to making money will sound funny one secret to making money is not losing money all right confirmation bias makes you lose money when you have many win streaks on one strategy or one stock fall in love with it you become blind your position sizing increases becomes huge you become overconfident which is what I covered in the other chapter you guys reading the news only in the positives positive positive positive watching content that confirms your confirmation bias that persuades you to be even strong stronger on your confirmation bias very dangerous not even aware of it goodness I'm actually making this course I I might I think it's a little I don't even know if I'm going to release it it's a little bit too powerful guys this these topics no one's ever covered on YouTube these are topics that I've gotten from the CIA from Goldman Sachs these are Insider these are inside topics that very powerful almost a little scared to even share this video it's a little too powerful on psychology of the market you guys are going to be a little too strong you guys are going to be bicep over Tri you're going to get so big and so rich be careful careful I got to have a little bit fun on these videos all right let's get back to Serious mode cuz we're here to make money aren't we this is why I always teach risk management in my Discord guys and regardless how much money I make I still stay humble and I don't increase position size Beyond 15% per position I don't care if you have the Golden Goose you got the Golden Goose position you got the the Hail Mary you got the the LeBron James of stocks we don't fall in love here guys we don't fall in love with one stock and hold it for life all right we don't do that here we're here we're rational we're trying to get rich fairly fast and very safe we're trying to get rich fast safe those three things don't necessarily go well together that's why we're optimizing and that's why I'm here as a coach to help you optimize for that outcome I have a coach myself guys I have multiple coaches by the way I love coaches because the CH cod in life is having a mentor or someone that's above you teach you 10 years of information and one month that's why I'm so far along I have mentors so look when it comes to stocks I am massively bullish on I do not blindly buy too much of them very important statement even stocks I massively bullish in I do not blindly throw too much money in I keep my position sizing safe make sure that you have position sized correctly make sure that you're reading all news on a stock good and bad and make sure that you don't fall for confirmation buys let's get it into the next chapter so this chapter will be the ological trading secret that you must be aware of which is the gamblers fallacy in option trading right I want to address how Traders often think that they are due all right often Traders say I'm due for a win after strong losses they have a lot of losses I'm I'm due for a I'm due for a win Henry I'm due for a win this leads to very poor decision-making or the opposite listen a lot of people I'm winning I'm winning I'm winning I don't need help I'm winning I I'm confident I'm winning I I'm a man I'm winning I know what I'm doing win and win win and win big loss boom it can happen to anyone all right win win win win you can still lose lose lose lose you can still win right you need to stay balanced this is import professional poker players by the way have coaches and they talk about something I it's been a while but they talk about balance strategy Balan risk management poker is about risk and management Sports is about risk and management relationships are about risk and management your trading is about yeah you guessed it risk and management let me paint you a picture right here using statistics and numbers if you flip a quarter five times in its heads five times this doesn't change the odds of you flipping the sixth time does that make sense all right if I flip a quarter right now all right I don't I don't think I have a quarter in my office all right but if if I if I take a quarter right and I flip it once I flip it twice all right it's heads Heads flip it a third time it's heads all right we see that tricep fourth time heads fifth time heads what would you say Henry is going to be a sixth quarter huh it's going to be a sixth quarter what are the odds of that six flip what are the odds let me tell you the odds they're still 50/50 the odds are still 50/50 I'm excited I got to entertain myself during these videos especially when they're long all right I'm going out of my way to give you everything I got cuz I I want you to level up I want you to subscribe we're about to hit 300,000 subscribers and my community is growing like crazy I'm having so much success I'm so freaking blessed God blessed me so much to help you guys I feel I feel happy bless uh I feel blessed being able to bless you guys with money and then I feel like I get more blessings blessing you it's like a it's like a forever giving I love it so look 5050 is the odds of a quarter so it doesn't matter if it hit five times so you guys that think you're due for a win or due for a loss get that out of your head if you have the proper strategy you're due for a win more likely than not if you have the right strategy you're due for a win always and if you have a bad strategy you're due for a loss always all right so that's that's basically how it works so this is a common but very dangerous mental trap it's extremely dangerous cuz our brains are are made to detect patterns so if you see heads five times in a row your brain will trick you and tell you wow it's going to be heads again but that's not true it's just 50/50 so where Traders misunderstand probabilities and overestimate AKA overconfident but overestimate their chances of winning on the next trade okay this is particularly interesting because in the shortterm it is important to understand a stock having multiple days of a win streak just like the quarter it doesn't make make it so that the next day is going to be a win it it's not so guys it it's not so all right so multiple days doesn't mean a damn thing means nothing but multiple months does mean something okay so there's a little bit of a Nuance here multiple um days don't really do anything right but multiple months do multiple months is momentum multiple days is just luck all right so I want to educate you on how to recognize this fallacy and promote discipline trading strategies shortterm nobody knows guys it's gambling nobody knows don't chase and rule number three don't freaking Chase all right shortterm nobody knows longterm it's obvious and why my portfolio is about to hit $4 million guys it's obvious I've shown you the whole journey it's obvious I know what I'm doing better than anyone else does I've mastered this game longterm is where it's at having a long-term mindset a long-term strategy long-term beliefs not falling for the fallacies the misinformation and myths that I've covered in this video will help you also Master the game and scale your portfolio to seven figures I'm helping you guys here along the way if you're subscribed I'm going to keep making the best videos on YouTube hands down the best videos on YouTube to level your trading to give you as much free value better than people's paid value giving you more free value so if you want any coaching you can feel free to you know use the first link in the description otherwise I am super thankful that you guys have made it through the end of this video that means that you have a really good attention span which actually is also a psychological thing which is going to make you a better Trader so

Invest with Henry,TgNzibRAtx4,2024-10-27T15:45:01Z,DO NOT Buy Tesla Stock (TSLA) Until It Hits THIS Price (Earnings Update),Tesla,"guys Tesla stock exploded after earnings and I've made a video about unusual options so this is an updated video on how you can make more money on Tesla. I was just thinking about my subscribers here I was thinking about you guys and how much money we made this week on Tesla so I'm going to quickly show you that I'm up $49,000 on Tesla have a thousand shares in this portfolio um I have several different option positions on Tesla and I did tell you guys that there is unusual option Behavior there was a lot of people buying calls specifically there was a lot of um call volume in general and there was multiple data points that made me believe that Tesla would beat earnings and I'm very happy because I'm not running a challenge right now but in my challenge we sold two 10 foots which paid for the challenge easily okay so I'm very excited to give you guys more information on Tesla I think this is a very valuable stock and now that it's up a lot I think people have made a lot of money and you're probably question yourself should I keep holding the stock should I sell the stock should I buy more shares what option position should I do. I want to say that first of all there is a recent interview with Dan IES I think that interview is very important to watch and understand before I give you my thought process and um some of the reasons why I'm very bullish on Tesla still right now so check out this clip and then let's continue on with the video with some examples talk about Tesla because those numbers are out now revenues are light but hey earnings uh what matters more here I mean the whole story is about gross margins I mean that's really been the headwind on Tesla stock I'd say $ 30 to $40 of a headwind to the stock you saw gross margins I mean this is a blowout not even us thought that we could see a gross margin where Essen is anywhere from a 2 to 300 bit beat this shows price Cuts now under control margins start to tick back up you start to get now toward 20 % grow margins I think this is the start of the stock ultimately this will have a three in front of it as a stock as the grow margin start to Trend up and as well as growth into next year from a delivery perspective so does the robo taxi stuff matter look I think longer term I would think the the longer term story here is autonomous is robotics is essentially the AI play Street what they needed to see here show me margins you cannot have margins going toward 13 14% now that margins are starting to level off that is so important not just from a cashow perspective but showing the worse is in the rearview mirror and when you think about all the Bears and all the negatives it comes down to deliveries will start to uptick China I think is a source of strength in the quarter but that gross margin it's a Goldilocks for any bear okay it's a Goldie Locks for any bull the Bears it's kind of a nightmare for because that was ultimately the core of the story yeah to your point free cash flow 2.74 billion ion doll at Tred expectations for Q3 but some of the details we're getting here on the Outlook I think are also really notable they're basically saying despite the ongoing macroeconomic conditions we expect to achieve slight growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024 also talking about energy storage deployments that are going to more than double this year but perhaps this is most notable because I know you've written about this saying plans for new vehicles including more affordable models remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025 what should we take away from that when I know a lot of folks have looking for a sub $330,000 vehicle we're even expecting to get some details on that the robo taxi event which maybe was unrealistic the win pin to the story from a growth is a sub 30k vehicle and I believe that that hits by middle of 2025 that's the growth I mean that's ultimately you're talking about like single digit growth this year that's how you get to 10 12 15% type growth margins under control that's what the Bulls want to see and I think the fact that they actually double down and I expect clearly on the conference call they'll Focus not just on margins but more details around that vehicle look robotx today we could argue you know many would say that they're disappointed I believe ultimately that chose the vision the autonomous Nei Vision Street need to ultimately see stop talking to talk Walk to Walk show the margins they did it and musk really has I think stepped up in that capacity and what's been a year of softness for Ev demand and obviously more adoption of of hybrid vehicles for example are we going to look at Q3 as an inflection point for that changing especially when you look at results like this today or is this a Tesla specific story as they do deploy more manufacturing techniques more software more more AI both internally and externally I think it's a combination I mean you had a you you look at GM's quarter I mean that was a wano like quarter for GM and then you look at what we've seen in terms of Tesla I believe this is the Reflection Point this right now is the start to me of what we're actually starting to see from a gross margin perspective the Renaissance of growth come back they've essentially been in between two growth waves next year you have a sub 30k vehicle then the autonomous and AI Vision plays out and that's in our opinion that's how you get to trillion trillion and a half mark cap. The first thing that Dan Ives was saying is Tesla's gross margin is in Focus. The interesting thing is that Tesla actually didn't um beat earnings they actually missed earnings but their gross margin went up guys. Look here's Tesla's adjusted eida margin um it was you know 18.7 and that was in Q2 2023 then the stock you know went down a bit 16.1 15.7 15.9 14.4 and there were some you know I wouldn't say troubling signs but you know people like ah well Tesla is going to grow its Revenue sure that's pretty obvious but it looks like the margins are also falling that's just what happens guys with with companies at scale their margins go down so look I think going from Q2 to Q3 from 14. 4% to 18.5 like that is a that's a 4% pop right 4% pop though divided by 14.4 is like 30% so I'm actually surprised Tesla did not go up more I'm actually surprised that Tesla isn't up like 100% or like well I I get why it's not right the market cap is already big but this past week move of 21% like I had a really strong feeling that that would happen that's why I sold you see here I sold the 200 puts I had some positions expired before on Tesla I sold the 210p puts in my challenge I just sent that message to like literally everyone I've had over 50 people join and I just copy paste copy paste like manually hey do the 210 do the 210 I told everyone CU I was like I'm super super bullish on this. Gross margins are increasing which is a really positive sign for Tesla. You would be a fool not to realize that you'd be a fool not to be invested in Tesla to some degree it makes up a huge portion of the S&P 500 so I think you're kind of missing out on a really good stock. I think Tesla's plan to introduce a sub $30,000 electric vehicle by mid 2025 is crucial for achieving higher growth rates. I would say that Tesla having cars that is sub $30,000 freaking genius because at the end of the day what Wall Street wants to see is Tesla's gross revenue going up. I think when it comes to Future growth with with Tesla right having those 30,000 30,000 or sub $30,000 vehicle I think that's going to reach Mass Market appeal right so it's going to make it really easy for people to um be invested in the company from a investor point of view but I think it's also going to be easy for people to buy the vehicle obviously it's cheaper. I think that's also really important about Tesla like they just need a cheap car they need a reliable car to reach the master. I think if you could switch every Prius for a uh for a Tesla and they start dominating and taking more market share oh man oh man like this this company is's going to dominate. While the robo taxi project that they have is seen as a long-term play Tesla's Ai and autonomous plans are key to the company's vision and growth trajectory appealing to a lot of bullish investors. Tesla's Q3 a free cash flow free cash flow okay that's a very important number it exceeded expectations at $ 2.74 billion. Analysts view this quarter as an inflection point for Tesla in the EV industry with potential growth ahead due to advances in manufacturing software and AI so they're becoming more efficient at selling vehicles and looking at the competition which is really important I mean there is a lot of competition to Tesla so I actually do think that some of their competitive Advantage has has gone away which is difficult right because they had better vehicles but guys there is there's there's better vehicles on the market now that are electric vehicles we have a lot of we have a lot of competitors right so I think that um you know what and I know you guys already know this but Tesla's a bet on Elon Musk in many ways because Elon Musk has more follow followers on Twitter than Tesla so we're all betting here kind of on personal branding. If I had to predict what Tesla is going to do I would say in the next 12 months it might hit 300.",1.0,0.9

Uh actually their profit margin went up a lot last time I saw this was 3.5 um which makes sense why Amazon stock is up a lot because a doubling in margin from 3.5 to 7% means essentially that if Revenue stays the same they are doubling their earnings doubling.,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,K6wxlQvh2Pk,2024-10-25T13:11:51Z,WARNING: THESE Stocks Will Explode (Not What You Think),Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund,"I'm personally also under on the um energy so I'm actually going to make a trade right now on XLE now I don't have a whole lot of cash let me just check my cash real quick depending on how much I have a lot of cash actually just tied up in a lot of sell puts because I'm aggressively trying to get into positions I'm running the wheel strategy and I've sold a lot of aggressive puts which is why you just saw I had $885,000 of cash but my buying power is only 126k and it's because well here's an Spy cell put I have it's a very short-term put I am doing a little bit short term trading here and there on spy but anyways I do have enough cash I am going to purchase XLE so look I have a lot of my students especially my one-on-one students I've noticed that they have CVX SLB Exxon Mobile I like these three companies a lot right if you look at the top Holdings here you will see that Exxon Mobile is 23% of XLE it's a it's a ETF with energy sector right it have xon mobile they have Chevron they have kico Phillips Williams uh and then here's the SLB here's slum B right uh we got Philip 66 we got Marathon petroleum I know a lot of you guys have oxy oxy I think there was um a lot of popularity I think it was on YouTube and there's just a lot of publicity on it because Warren Buffet in Oxy you know oxy is not a main contributor it's not a main holding right now in the top 10 for XLE but look I'm not against oxy I think in general energy companies are actually a really good investment they have really good cash flow really good C like really really good cash flow as well as good dividends so if we take a look at the dividend income here we got a 30-day yield of a little bit over 3% okay now it's up to you whether you go for single stocks or the ETF itself I'll show you example of both right now I think that given what Paul tudo Jones says and given what I've been saying about about inflation when inflation goes up which they're under representing I think when those numbers become more public so to say you'll see that commodity prices will also go up and when commodity prices go up um these companies and energy will will make more money I do think part of that is priced in I'll be honest with you but I also think some of that is not priced in so if you want a good hedge and a good protection in your portfolio and Pa Paul Tudor Jones said he doesn't have any bonds guys I I say the same thing why would you even if you're in retirement just go for option income it's way more attractive than bonds it's way safer options are safer than stocks and in my opinion options can be safer than bonds obviously bonds are probably bit more safer but they also have no returns at all right so I'm not a huge fan of bonds either so I agree with Paul Tor Jones on all fronts there now look if I were to do XLE it's at $90 for the past 3 months it's going sideways which is actually a good thing I would do a couple things here okay you can run the coverage strangle strategy s puts covered calls the wheel right the wheel my bread and butter the these are my bread and butter I actually just added coverage strangle today in today's video but my brand butter is sellp puts covered calls and uh and the wheel shot right so I've been doing that for a decade now so let's go into um I would just straight up keep it really boring I would go through election and I would just sell a put option on XLE I would go right here around at the money okay this is over 3% return if you want to generate income the safest income just go XLE you get a sign no problem we have a strong cash flow you have a strong cash flow ETF okay so I could go for something like this sell this option right here collect $300 um put up $88,500 the return is not an awful lot so here if you want to hire return what you can also do is you can also sell a call option you could sell to 95 this gives you upside this would be better if you want higher return uh a little bit higher on the risk I would say a little bit higher but not by much you can do the 95 covered call okay so the 95 covered call here essentially you would buy 100 shares of XLE and then you would sell the 95 call option so when you sell the 95 call option here you get upside from 90 to 95 which is about $5 and okay and you get the $2 you get seven in total addressable or total potential upside on 90 which is you know almost 10% it's like a 7% is return in 90 days you get a 7% return now we're talking now that's good okay so it depends on which side you want to go on selling puts and covered calls are very similar in risk and return uh so this is a very similar risk and return but if XLE moves up which I do think it'll move up I would probably say the covered call however if you want to run the covered strangle strategy you would do both if you have a bigger portfolio which is you know majority of you guys that I and especially the one-on-one students I work with got 50k 100K 200k 300K Etc right these guys are in closer to the retirement Zone but even if you're just a busy professional and you're just starting off in your option Journey you're at 25k 50k look I mean I I think you can still do both right it is a significant portion of your portfolio and you have to be mindful of asset allocation and risk management but what you can do is you can sell a 90 put option and you can buy 100 shares and sell a covered call obviously I only sell cash secured puts for the most part unless it's more of my Advanced strategies with oneon-one students that are you know in the six figure range so sell a cash secured put you have to have the cash and then for the covered call you also want to have you need to buy 100 shares CU covered call by definition is covered so you need to buy 100 shares now look I think aside from XLE what you can do is you can also sell um you can also go to individual stock itself so Exxon Mobile I'll go over Exon Mobile and oxy maybe I'll cover SLB as well",1.0,0.9

Palantir stock has Skyrocketed 150% this year but the real question is what is going to happen next that's always what I'm trying to predict as best as I can because with Palantir this is an Ever Changing stock and it's quickly changing in value it's changing in momentum and there's a lot of money to be made by following this company. The answer is dollar cost averaging high quality companies like Palantir makes sense because I believe Palantir stock will be $80 to $100 by the end of 2025 or into 2026. I think selling puts a 40 Delta specifically a bit higher of a Delta long term on Palantir using different expiration dates one of them is going to be January another one is going to be March also makes a lot of sense and I'm actually going to increase the Delta for my typical Delta of 30 and 20 because a higher Delta actually brings in more premium and I'm willing to take on more risk with Palantir because the risk of getting assigned isn't so scary if you want to own the stock. I'm still bullish on Palantir but I'm not really buying the stock itself I'm trying to acquire the stock with different option strategies the main one being selling puts and also dollar cost average dollar cost averaging into the company on a consistent basis. I believe the stock will be 80 to $100 by the end of 2025 or in 2026 based on the research that I've done to understand Palantir value at above $40 per share and why I would dollar cost average and sell puts long term. I want to highlight the most important thing, the most important thing is revenue growth guys. The stock isn't based on some fairy tale dream it's based on cash Revenue how much money are they generating. Initial growth and inconsistencies in 2021 through 2023 cause Palantir issues. Look, I think it's very clear though with Palantir there was inconsistencies between 2021 2023. Palantir Revenue did increase but in a somewhat uneven matter, it was increasing there was inconsistency. The company faced challenges in maintaining a consistent growth pattern primarily due to its heavy reliance on government contracts. So something that really helped them government contracts also kind of gave them uneasy revenue and slower adoption of its software in the private sector also affected Palantir. This inconsistency led to investors to have concerns about whether Palantir could sustain its growth momentum and break into the commercial sector and the commercial Market because that was also a really big opportunity, investors knew that and Palantir knew that. So the Turning Point actually happened in 2023 when Palantir launched artificial intelligence platforms or AIP, that was a major shift. A major shift occurred in early 2023 once they actually launched that when Palantir had its fourth software suite, the Palantir artificial intelligence platform. The platform was a Game-Changer, absolute Game Changer, designed to address the growth demand for AI driven Solutions across Industries. And the introduction of AIP opened up a new opportunity for Palantir particularly in the commercial sector. The impact of AIP was quickly reflected in Palantir financials as the slope of the revenue line ended up being steeper indicating accelerated growth as the slope of the revenue line ended up just absolutely taking off and accelerating growth at that point. This marked the start of a new phase for Palantir where it appealed to private Enterprises and grew substantially from that because there was a lot of Revenue made a lot and it led to a more Diversified Revenue base. In short, the company was no longer just a provider of solutions for the government but was now becoming a key player in the commercial AI space. And now let's discuss diversification into the commercial sector because this is so important to understand if you're going to be selling puts to dollar cost averaging it to Palantir that is a long-term play. If you want to be in a company long term you need the emotional strength to hold it and what helps emotional strength knowledge. So historically Palantir derived a significant portion of its revenue from US military contracts and related government agencies. However, with the Advent of AIP, the company began attracting private sector customers in Industries like healthcare, finance, and energy. To promote AIP Palantir organized immersive demo seminars where businesses and Business Leaders could actually come and see the software in action and identify use cases that would benefit their companies. This strategic move which was absolutely genius by Palantir was highly successful helping Palantir gain new commercial customers and reduce its dependency on government contracts, very good for their business. As a result, the company's Revenue growth became more balanced between public and private sector contributions and again as I said more revenue and more Diversified that's exactly what investors saw. As you can see the company went from 7 or 8, I was covering the stock back then by the way I do want to point out I was covering the stock when it was cheap I was covering the stock back in IPO at 27 and essentially I've had Palantir for a long time but um yeah it grew it grew to over $40 per share and now we're in a very interesting point because everyone knows it's a good stock now. The cat is out the bag right, everyone knows everyone's in it so now is a very interesting time because every little discount that you get into the stock makes a big deal on a compounded annual return basis. Like if you hold the stock for 3 years and you bought it at 38 or 36 by selling a put option to get in it's an advantage I mean it adds up because over a long period of time it ends up compounding and every 1,000, 2,000, $5,000 that you have invested ends up growing over the long term. So look I think AIP as a growth catalyst is the most fantastic opportunity about Palantir. I know the government contracts are fantastic but commercial and in the private sector very very good. AIP has allowed Palantir to capitalize on the booming demand for AI driven solutions, particularly in sectors seeking to enhance operational efficiency, automated processes and gain deeper insights from data. The platform's ability to scale and be customized for a variety of applications has broaden Palantir appeal so basically they've been a leader in AI and they're leading their business and it's accelerating in growth after the release of AIP this has been the most obvious thing that has driven the stock. Keep in mind it's not just the business but also the investors moving the stock, it's not just the business that made the stock $42 it's the investors. The market cap of Palantir is 93.83 billion, about $95 billion. Now the demand is very high for Palantir because now including S&P 500. The influx of institutional investors also increases the liquidity of Palantir stock which is a good thing for us but it also increases the stock's price. So the higher gets the more expensive it becomes and many people mistake price with value. Many people make this mistake so when when a stock goes up more investors become interested in that stock which is the reverse of what it actually should be so when a stock goes up a lot of investors are excited wow it's going up I want to be part of that great but it's already well it's becoming well known and the more well known and the more expensive it is the less of a value it is. On the flip side when I was talking about Palantir before you were subscribed to the channel maybe you were, maybe you're subscribed I love you if you were subscribed but a lot of people I was telling Palantir is a good investment people thought I was crazy. You're going to regret not being in Palantir. You also can't over leverage it to Palantir because it doesn't matter how bullish I am how bullish you are you also can't have more than 10% of your eggs in one basket so to speak, the common term that they use you need to have diversity. Although I am recommending that you should be selling put options to get in. Let me show you my positions my positions on Palantir I have 31 puts 36 puts which the 36 put I recently opened up. I mean made a little bit of a mistake on Palantir cuz I sold the covered call. I'm winning cuz 102k I'm up total on this position so I'm up 102k I'm down 27. I have a lot of Palantir in my other portfolio I have another over 5,000 shares so look this company I have almost half a million in almost half a million in Palantir it makes up a significant portion of my wealth but again it doesn't make 20% of my wealth it does not. So I would recommend that you still stay aware that even the best company should not take up too much as a percentage of your net worth ideally it's actually net worth. The influx of all the institutional investors guys they're going to keep it's going to probably keep the stock above 40. Now given some of my luck I'm not I've done fantastically well but I'm not always the luckiest so given my luck I say it's going to be about 40 it might fall below 40 but hey it's not a problem because I'm not a short-term guy I'm not going to look and get afraid if it falls to 39 tomorrow it's fine. I'm happy anywhere 36 37 38 for selling puts and anything under 40 I'd just straight up be buying shares I'd be dollar cost averaging. It can be Palantir, it can be Nvidia, it can be any high quality company. I cover many on this channel. When you follow the same stock for a long time you understand it you don't have to be an expert at fundamental or technical analysis if you follow a stock for a long time you start to get a feel for it so that's very important in the stock market guys. As more institutions buy into Palantir this increases demand this leads to Upward pressure on the stock and the stock price goes up it's basic supply and demand guys. Institutions often take long-term positions which can support a steady rise in the stock value over time which is actually what I really like to see. Now that Palantir added to S&P 500 and it didn't crash that's a very strong statement because a lot of Institutions are not looking at it and they're buying it they're not selling it so that's also a very strong case. Palantir built its reputation in initial success through its deep Partnerships with the US government especially its Flagship product Palantir Gotham which was designed for Counter Intelligence there's designed for something a little bit similar but I can't mention on YouTube. These contracts provided consistent revenue streams giving the company solid Financial Foundation while allowing it to develop and refine its Cutting Edge technology. Government contracts particularly long-term ones offer Palantir stability in volatile markets because these contracts are $100 million and guess what they're not going to go anywhere. I mean look once a company and I've said this I know I've said it but I want to instill the actual thing of how how I'm picking this company when Palantir comes into a business and implements an implementation they cost a $100 million company's not going anywhere the switch cost is too high. That's why Palantir is kind of like a sass right it is a sass they do like a bunch of Consulting a bunch of Consulting work as well right they have deep relationships but I kind of view it as a software play as well I mean it is a software play but they really have that that very strong business model and that Revenue growth model so it's just the best of both worlds. However the company does recognize early on that the overreliance of the government has been good but there's also limitations so government contracts are typically slow moving and while they're reliable they can also be subject to budget cuts and political changes and you know extended procurement processes there's a whole bunch of stuff on the government side. In order to achieve sustained growth Palantir needs to diversify into commercial sector not just the government sector they're doing that and that's where the launch of Palantir Foundry and AI integration came. I also think that it's going to be a stock that honestly I think Palantir is going to be 180 100 or more dollars per share in the next few years so it's going to have Nvidia like returns I'm so bullish on on the long-term prospects that selling $40 put options that expire into you know 2025 no no issues no issues because getting assigned this stock is a good thing so getting paid to get assigned is an absolute no-brainer. And because they're in healthcare and they're in financial services and energy and utilities and Manufacturing, I spent a lot of time researching this video. Starting off with Healthcare Palantir has significantly expanded into Healthcare sector where data integration analytic capabilities offer transformative benefits. The company helps healthc care providers, pharmaceutical companies, and public health organizations leverage large data sets to improve outcomes and efficiency. The key use cases include vaccine distribution and tracking during covid-19 pandemic Palantir was instrumental in vaccine distribution and tracking providing real-time data to ensure that vaccines were delivered efficiently and in the right quantities and in various locations. Also just Hospital operation Palantir platform is used by hospitals to streamline operations from managing patient data to optimizing resource allocation ensuring better care at lower cost. Pharmaceutical companies use Palantir here to accelerate drug Discovery so improved clinical trial outcomes and enhanced overall operational efficiency by providing real-time analysis of patient data and trial results. Now let's talk about the financial sector Palantir Foundry platform enables companies to process analyze and visualize vast amounts of data to make better decisions. Financial services companies are increasingly adopting Palantir tools to manage risk, optimize investments, and streamline Regulatory Compliance which is super boring but super needed. So an example of how Palantir is applying on this or has applied is basically on the risk management side. Banks and financial institutions use Palantir to Monitor and mitigate risks such as credit risk or operational Risk by analyzing vast amounts of real-time data this allows them to stay ahead of potential crisises or inefficiencies so it is it's mandatory for the business they need it. Also on the investment decisionmaking side which is what we're doing here what we're studying here basically with options and investment decision- making Palantir helps investment managers Aggregate and analyze data from various sources providing them with actionable sites for optimizing portfolios and finding new opportunities that's right. Palantir is also in investments in investing advice in portfolio Management in hedge funds insane because data at a hedge fund is the most important, the most important when you have a data Advantage it's game over you can make a lot of money and it's practically unlimited money practically. Palantir helps companies manage compliance more efficiently by automating data collection reporting process and all of this data is how AI basically makes decisions. Now moving over into Palantir here into basically their energy the energy side of the business how they're helping energy companies in the utility sector where its platform is used to optimize operations reduce cost and manage infrastructure more effectively. So with growing Global emphasis on sustainability and the energy transition Palantir tools are becoming increasingly valuable for energy companies. Some key applications include operational efficiencies, it's all about efficiency guys there's always cost and inefficiencies that are very important so energy companies use Palantir to monitor production process an optimize resource allocation reducing waste and improving overall efficiency. Sustainable energy with the transition to renewable energy sources Palantir is helping companies manage their data to integrate solar wind battery storage Technologies effectively into existing grids. Also smart grids utility companies use Palantir to optimize their smart grid systems which are designed to manage electricity more efficiently which pretty obvious there some electricity efficiency savings can cost a lot of money. Now on the manufacturing sector it's major focus for Palantir especially with the rise of industry 4.0 technologies that integrate automation data exchange and Smart Systems into production lines. So Palantir platform is used to optimize operations enhance productivity quality and manage complex Supply chains. Key benefits are again the supply chain so Palantir Foundry analyzes production processes in real time reducing downside improving efficiency and identifying cost savings. Also there's predictive maintenance this is super interesting by analyzing machine performance data right they have machine learning models that are predictive and saying hey this machine may fail or break soon you must fix it or or you must proactively take a look because this cog or there might be an issue here so they reduce the risk of a bad outcome by predicting it in the future. As companies move towards more datadriven logistical operations Palantir platform will help them optimize routes manage fleets and predict demand. Also looking at things like Fleet Management Palantir Foundry platform allows logistic companies to track their fleets in real time helping them optimize routes reduce Red fuel costs and improve delivery times which is really important. When it comes to Route optimization Palantir software helps companies optimize delivery routes reducing fuel consumption and all of this is again why I think that the stock is a no-brainer to sell put options on.",1.0,0.85

Also looking at things like Fleet Management Palantir Foundry platform allows logistic companies to track their fleets in real time helping them optimize routes reduce Red fuel costs and improve delivery times which is really important because don't we all want our Amazon packages as fast as possible I wish I could have Amazon I don't have Amazon out here but if I had Amazon oh boy I would probably order a few a few fun things it's fun to shop.,0.95,0.8

calling a put so let's say that I'm going to go into December because I want to capture in all the November volatility so let's go to December 20th and um I'm going to buy an at the money call and a put now listen guys I'm not an option buyer I'm just showing you some examples of option trading strategies you guys always ask what other strategies are you using I mainly use the wheel strategy but I get a lot of comments that you guys want something new here's something new here's something that is an interesting idea but use it at your own risk because buying options if you uh if it doesn't end up going in your favor you end up losing in the money so it's not a consistent income approach it's more of a shorter term higher risk higher return approach which nothing wrong with that I mean if you had good performance I always tell my students listen some of you guys are making 20 $25,000 a month put 5K on a on a buy position why not have fun with it I mean if you're doing very well and you're exceeding all your goals have some fun with it go for some buying strategies why not it just depends on your personal risk um level right and your risk tolerance and how much you want to budget out for consistent income and how much you want to budget out for taking a little bit more of a risky play so here this would be my risky capital I would just go ahead and buy a 585 call all right so right here you'll see that the upside is unlimited so why not options are pretty fun you get unlimited upside uh then I would also buy a put option for December and I would just do 585 this is basically right at the money and right here you'll see it's a long straddle it benefits from high volatility by the way there's a couple ways to make money here there's a couple ways to close this position so look the first way is if the if spy ends up Rising I mean you can wait until expiration it'll be somewhere in this Zone you're going to be in the green or let's say that before December 20 we have election and all that it goes up a lot and you're somewhere in this Zone and you still have time left just close out the trade same thing applies for the bottom if the stock market ends up falling spy is at you know 500 or whatever you're going to end up having like a ton of profit right if it's at 500 basically this option will be like $85 in the money and you've paid 29 so you can technically turn 29 into like 85 in this example so that would be more than doubling your money almost tripling your money actually so I mean the rewards could be pretty significant if you have a huge huge huge move which is possible nothing's impossible in this world guys kind of two rules nothing's impossible and nothing's guaranteed so um a lot of stuff could happen and we have the saying in uh in Russian it's like who doesn't take the risk doesn't get to drink champagne something like basically that's how it translates so take a risk drink the champagne so 585 Call 585 put I would I would do something like this and this is a long straddle now if you want to reduce the cost which you can so let me go back here if you want to reduce the cost and say actually I'll show you three strategies in this video it's going to be interesting you can go for an out of the money this will reduce your cost because you're going out of the money right so 590 it'll it'll reduce your cost and then 580 so this is going to be a long strangle it's same thing it's the same thing you know what the difference is instead of the same strike the 585 two times now it's just like a little Gap here it's like the same thing it's like a little line it looks a little different but it's about the same thing so it's a Str a straddle versus a strangle a strangle is going to be a bit cheaper so the cost here of this position is is a bit cheaper because it's a little bit out of the money now if you want to play the iron Condor strategy I think that could be really interesting as well so if you go to sell call right we have we have a long call so now we have a long call we can sell calls um as well so we can sell let's say say we're going to do a $10 width which I typically don't do but I'm showing you something interesting here all right so let's go for a $10 width so I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and sell that and I'm also going to sell um a put option here under so I I sold a 580 I'm going to go for 570 all right so now this right here will basically be kind of like an interesting iron Condor play pretty much so here your your total cost went down from 2.7k down to just 776 so this would be a much more suitable small account strategy that I think um is also viable to play around with and potentially get a return here the return is you know it it's it's actually not that high because you're you're you're putting up a very small fraction of what you would be but here your break evens are pretty close I mean if it's above 597 69 you're going to make some money or if it's below 572 you're going to make some money so if you if you think there's going to be volatility through election which I think so this could be a profitable play again it's not my style but it's a profitable play potentially",1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,aLVHRWutPoc,2024-10-12T18:30:02Z,Maximize Profits on Palantir (PLTR) Stock Without Buying More Shares!,Palantir,"P your stock is up over 140% this year but the real question is what do you do right now instead of buying more at these highs I'll show you a strategy using leaps that can maximize your returns without putting all your Capital At Risk I'm diving into leaps and we're going to be going over pounds here on my screen with some real examples and real quick I want to point out that uh I'm up $11,000 on Palante here officially six figures I've had this position many times this is a new six figures that I've made in my portfolio and that's the reason my portfolio is g to $4 million guys. So I'm going to be diving into leaps options and why this strategy is perfect for investors who want to control really have that control for more shares of paler. I'm sorry if I'm being goofy for more shares of Palante here for a fraction of the cost. It's a very simple strategy I want to hook you up with the strategy if you've been watching paler you know they're making big moves in the AI and government contracts I'm excited cuz I've said this for many many time so I'm just I'm just saying it again in this video I'll show you how to use leaps to maximize your gains on paler we've already made a lot of gains but I want to make you more gains so let's cover the basics real quick. By buying leaps instead of the stock itself you can control 100 shares for a fraction of the cost this is fantastic way for investors especially with smaller accounts to gain exposure to the stock that's high quality like pound here without having to put up all their hard-earned money keep that money for yourself a little bit and use less upfront to get your desired returns all right so let me show you a real life example right now using palent here. All right so the Stock's at $41.70 wow my screen just changed because 7:00 a.m. all right well so uh what we're going to do is first of all my average cost is $21.94 this sock is parabolic which makes me a little bit nervous cuz the higher it gets the riskier it becomes I know you might not look at it that way but actually it's the inverse of what most people think when a stock goes down it's becoming safer all right that's why when it was going down and nobody was listening to me I was making videos on pal at $16 per share No One listened to me Henry's crazy no guys no just sometimes you need some time you need some patience I gave it some time I had some patience I put the six figs in the account all right anyone can do this how would I go about it right so just go to Pal your trade options. So if I buy a leap option here let's say that I want to go out to September all right let's go out to September 19 2025 and let's go for an in the money option so let's go for something like 35 Delta right here is going to be 78 which is perfect perfect okay so if I go for 35 so if I buy the 35 it is $15 which is uh it is a discount it says 15.5 Robin Hood says 127 which makes no sense I guess it's pre-market but you're actually going to get filled for somewhere in between the bid and ask price so uh you know call $45 or the Mark is $470 so about $470 all right the uh volume here is pretty good actually it's 500 the implied volatility here is actually even higher than Nvidia so that is that's some good volatility right there that's some really good volatility uh that's high volatility which is a good thing for option sellers but it's not a good thing for option buyers it makes the option more expensive all right so the option right here is going for $15 pretty expensive but hey it's better than buying 100 shares of pal here for $ 4176 because 4176 would be $4,175 whereas uh you can buy the call option for $1,500 okay. And by the way I just want to say you know if you're thinking to yourself well why should you invest in pal here it isn't an all-time high the reason why I've been covering the stock for a really long time is because of the quality of the company. So why would you want to invest in paler long term well paler is becoming a dominant player in Ai and data analytics especially in the government and the military contract part of their business okay they're working with top Global organizations from the US government to private Enterprises helping them harness the power of data. I have a data analytics degree guys I have Finance economics and business analyticsdata analytics it's like kind of the same it's the same thing essentially and as the world becomes more relying on AI and data driven decisionmaking which I am 100% I've been 100% I have a degree in it because I knew that it was going to be the future so I was basically this is so funny I knew that data is going to be the new the new oil like there's a lot of research articles and because when I went to college you know there was like Harvard Business review and they were talking about how important data is so I decided at the time I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do I knew I wanted to work on Wall Street which I'm not doing because I realized it's kind of like kind of scam it's kind of a scam you know all the financial advising industry and all that Wall Street stuff let me get back to the topic here paler is positioned to to basically benefit immensely and when I look at the data that they're taking advantage of and they're implementing for large organizations governments that's where the money is because data helps you make better decisions and there's a lot of slippage cost um when it comes to companies trying to make decisions so make a better decision make more money how do you make more money have more data so having data is really important that's what paler does and once they come into a company they establish their software they're very very sticky all right stickiness is something that uh some of the smartest Consultants uh will talk about stickiness right stickiness of a business so a lot of businesses have recurring Revenue models right and when you look at pounds here when they have a government contract that's 100 million that's not it baby they're going to make more they're going to make more which is awesome they come in for 100 Mil for 5 years and guess what after 5 years you think that company's going to leave no no they're not going anywhere because they've already spent 100 Mil they already invested all right it's like uh yeah I had some funny jokes but let let's let me get let me be serious here they're not going anywhere right so when you're using leaps you can capitalize on this future growth with less Capital upfront while leveraging the long-term potential all right so what's also exciting is paler expansion Beyond just govern contracts they're breaking into commercial Enterprises as well with their Foundry platform they're helping big companies use AI to optimize operations Supply chains and even Healthcare you know why this company's successful because the CEO went to my high school the Alex carp actually went to my high school that's why that's how I heard about this company I had several of my like classmates from high school like dude this company's becoming big the CEO he's uh his class of whatever it was like 2 222 or 225 or whatever because we had my my high school is actually one of the oldest high school Central High School Philadelphia one of the oldest most diverse high schools okay very good high school um so this mix of government and the commercial contracts makes paler a global player in the AI obviously CEO I like a lot and by holding leaps you actually get to benefit from the developments and the stocks rise without having to put up all the capital. I'm bullish on Palance here but in the short term it's squeezed out so much returns I'm not sure if we're going to go that much higher let's say we might go to 45 boom I would sell the 45 now this looks very similar to a covered coal except you're putting up very small amounts of money putting up less money is obviously advantageous. And when it comes to owning palant here and having less upfront capital in it I would recommend doing a poor man's covered call. Number one is uh there might be a significant price increase in the underlying stock so if pounder goes up all right so when or if the underlying stock goes up or if and when pound year experiences a significant price increase and the value of your leaps option has risen substantially you might consider closing the position to lock in profits nothing wrong with that at all so why would you do this well leaps are long deed options but if the stock has made a big upward move you may have already captured a large portion of the potential gains right you might have made a quick short-term game and in that case you can uh close out this option so let me give you an example here basically if you bought a leap call option on Palance here at a strike of you know it could be 35 it could be 30 and the stock price goes from 40 to 45 the value of your leaps will increase significantly and you could sell to realize those profits without having to wait until expiration especially in the beginning days there's very low Theta or time Decay on a leap option so you're not losing any value and it's going up in it's going up huge in value so before the time DEC really kicks in take the profit nothing wrong with taking profits right so look even though there's more time left on the option capturing a 25% move in the stock price in a relatively short period of time is often a a very good opportunity to lock in gains by taking profits early you're removing the risk of a market pullback and you could erase your gains so it's kind of like a double-edged sword you can hold for more gains or you can just take your profits now listen closely I'm saying this because I made so much money on Palante here and as it approaches 50 and it becomes more expensive I'm more cautious I felt that in my chest I'm more cautious because this is my best opportunity where I made not just 100K for myself I made like Millions for others but now it's getting more expensive as it approaches 50 and it becomes more expensive I'm more cautious so I'm recommending to take profits as you go on Palante here as you see fit as your leap options um experience results as your stocks increase in value I think you should be taking profits and kind of see how it goes all right nothing crazy many investors understand that a 25% rise in a short period of time offers a solid return and locking in profits can be very smart and practical move but it's also good for risk management if you have a large position on the stock and the leap option is up a lot it can be really good risk management because look it's actually crazy because in this portfolio pounds here was 6% now it's approaching 7% so when stocks rise they become they grow and they become a larger portion of your portfolio so if a stock doubles it may no longer be the best risk management play in your portfolio you may need to reduce exposure reducing exposure means reducing risk. So I think when it comes to creating passive safe income you need to look for companies that have Innovation okay so this can give investors more time for the underlying stock to actually play out that's why I do like leaps a lot because they gives you time all right time is money but time is also opportunity time is opportunity guys don't let it slip away all right don't let it slip away because with time you should be using it wisely so you get your desired outcome you know if you want to get richer it requires time requires patience requires the right strategy requires the right mindset so when I look at pound here as a company when I look at the options all right I I don't want to see rapidly declining options if I'm you know when I'm buying them especially when you're buying them guys because when you're buying options short term out of the money number one way to lose money right so why does it matter why is it so good that these options Decay slower well slower DEC on leaps generally have expiration dates that are one or two years or N9 months out that means that the that data DEC is minimal during the first half of the option's life or even the 2thirds of its life okay this gives you more time to benefit from the movement in the underlying stock without constantly fighting the erosion of value okay options eroding in value every single day by the amount of theta okay so you see the Theta on the screen right there so look when it comes to confidence and long-term plays if you're investing in companies like paler with a bullish long-term Outlook due to their growing dominance in AI or government contracts or whatever the reason is that you're investing in palent here there's many reasons for it holding leaps allows you to participate in potential upside without worrying about short-term volatility or about you know fast time dek which hurts an option bar it also gives you greater flexibility you can hold on to your without feeling pressure to sell them within a week or a month you actually give yourself opportunity for a scenario to play out and this is very unlike shortterm options where Theta ramps up as expiration approaches so this means that you can better weather temporary dips in the stock price and um you let me just give you an example let's say that you bought a leap call option on Palance here with a strike price of 30 and the stock is currently at 40 or 4172 since leaps are long dated the options value is less impacted by time DEC in the near future all right so it's not really going to be affected even if the stock trades sideways for two you know 3 months it's fine even if the stock trades sideways for a few months you won't really lose as much value in your option as you would with a short-term option okay so I'm me give you some actionable tips okay it's all about action that's how you make money as you take action take advantage of leaps to ride out the long-term trends especially in stocks with high growth potential like pounds here use slower Theta DK to your advantage allowing more time for your investment thesis to unfold. If you're still confident in the long-term prospects of a stock like paler then buy your leaps and then just hold as they approach expiration you can roll the option to a future date allowing more time for the stock to rise or you can just kind of manipulate that strike price to collect more income. Another quick example is imagine your leaps on Palance here at uh $3 strike price with an expiration date of 2 years from now okay that's really long the stock has appreciated to $50 and now your leaps have gain significant value right you can just simply roll out your position by your current leaps and buying new leaps with with the higher strike price at just 40 you can completely just take profit and then open up a new leap that has uh you know at a higher strike price so you get capturing a large profit and then you reinvest some of the money into buying a new leap option and then you keep some of the gains as well so um that's also a really important strategy and if your leaps are nearing expiration but you believe the stock still has Room to Grow then just consider rolling your position to a later expiration to maintain exposure to the stocks future upside again I'm usually not holding leaps until expiration I'm typically cutting them for a profit because why not taking profits somewhere in the 1/4 or or the halfway mark if you made a significant gain makes a lot of sense to me so rolling is an excellent strategy for managing positions with high potential long-term and a long-term stock play like pal here. The poor man's covered call strategy or or or leap strategy on a high quality company like paler and selling calls against it makes a lot of sense for me.",1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,3ksXPTJEHaE,2024-10-11T19:30:00Z,Generate $500 Safe Daily Passive Income (Wheel Option Strategy for Beginners),Nvidia,I'm going to show you a lowrisk and consistent option play that I'm going to make on Nvidia. let's just jump into Nvidia right now Nvidia is one of my top plays I love Nvidia on multiple levels both on the technical side as well as the fundamental side. now look Nvidia right now is at $116 I have several different option positions and in fact I'm running the wheel strategy on multiple different levels I have a 107 cellp put and a 102 cellp put both of those are expiring in October in a very short amount of time. if I go to the one month return right here you will see that the bottom um for NVIDIA was around 102 so no surprise that I am selling around this level. if I look at the 3-month low um Nvidia has actually had a double bounce it has had a 98 uh low point on August 7th that was a while ago and um a low point at 102 and that's why I've been selling options on Nvidia around I've had 98 sell puts and I've had 102 sellp puts but right now I'm specifically very bullish on Nvidia I think that this level is very cheap and in fact I would say around $107 per share would be exactly where I would want to buy Nvidia. I would love to buy shares of Nvidia in fact if the market was open I'm I'm a little bit pre-market right now if the market was open I'd be adding to my Nvidia position. I would be way you know below my 107 estimate of where I think Nvidia is an absolute steal like an absolute steal even at 110 because of the premium. the wheel strategy allows me to buy a stock where I want to buy it and on Nvidia I want to go hire Delta. Nvidia I think is a very good value at $107 per share. Nvidia is not going to zero okay then it's a high quality company so you don't have to worry about that.,1.0,0.9

I'm going to show you an example on American Airlines my portfolio has been in growth mode for you know week after week 1 to 2% now not every week is 1 to 2% sometimes I have 75% sometimes I have 6% sometimes I on earnings I have a 3 to 4% returns right you know during earnings weeks there's a lot of opportunity and sometimes I have losing weeks as well guys I'm the only guy that's trans transparently showing you everything my wins my losses and uh not really fudging my numbers right I I'm telling you I have losses but I win most of the time and I've been doing this for a long time so it's pretty easy for me now but really wasn't always like this and I'm going to show you the technicals by the way let's go to the Chart right here on American Airlines. American Airlines has done nothing it has been going sideways now on the surface level to you you might think to yourself well why is Henry trading American Airlines I like industrial stocks guys Industrials is a necessary component in your portfolio and Industrial is like Caterpillar and you know American Airlines and Delta Airlines is a fantastic addition to having your portfolio. American Airlines has been going sideways it hasn't really had a whole lot of movement has had a big dip right here and now we've just recovered back to $11 per share. let's go to trade American Airlines options let's go to sell now let's go to an expiration date let's go November okay so if I were to sell a put option at 11 you'll see how basically this is 6% return in one month how insane is that that's insanely good 6% in one month on a good quality company that's moving sideways literally guys I don't know how to give you a better money printing machine that's passive that doesn't require that much work that you can just literally click a button to make money using your Capital literally look at the pattern you don't have to be a rocket scientist understand that American Airlines is moving sideways premium is really good if I expand this option right here the implied volatility is very good the volume is good the bid ask price is very tight now look the bidest 66 the ask is 69 it means there's very little slippage cost guys when you have a wide bid ask price that's very bad that means there's a lot of money that's being lost and someone else on Wall Street is making money because they're making a market right they're buying at 66 and they're selling at 69 that's good for them but you as a retail investor and myself I'm always looking for a good bid ass spread I'm looking for good volatility the Delta here is high but look I don't care because of the pattern because of the technical analysis I'm confident been doing this for a decade this works I've been doing American Airlines for years I've been talking about palent here since it was IPO I've been trading American Airlines for four years now okay this company is very interesting and it's good to make money you don't have to use American Airlines but I'm teaching you the logic and the thought process because I want you to make money this game of option trading is not only fun it's exciting it's very lucrative so selling put option here at 11 if it goes below 11 my management strategy will be to do nothing to get assigned and then once assignment happens let's say that uh it's November I I had to acquire American Airlines in fact I think I'm in that position right now so let's look at my position I acquired a 100 shares of American Airlines actually this was an example that I was doing during my live coaching call so here I have 100 shares and guess what once the Market opens up my average cost is 1091 I'm going to sell an $111 covered call option so this is a very small position it's $1,000 but this is a perfect example I'm making $14 on ,00 okay now I'm going to be selling a covered call option I'm going to show you which covered call option I'm going to sell today I'm going to go to sell call I'm going to go to you know let's go to December it doesn't even matter the whole point is you collecting income all right the 11 covered call is going for a dollar this is literally a 10% return in 89 days how insane is that literally a money printing machine now if you wanted to go a little bit out of the money like the $12 covered call here I think that's also a very fantastic idea because essentially um you get some upside so let's say that you got acquire you got a sign at 11 okay if you sell $12 covered calls not only do you collect the premium here of $62 but you also have the upside from the stock itself going from $11 to 12 so you got a whole $1 um increase now the reason why I like American Airlines again is because the technical analysis is very clear and understandable to me I like to make money in simple ways I don't want to get complicated I just want to have that safe passive income to continue traveling and living a a good lifestyle and really I I enjoy the work that I do",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,N4JvgqFttKg,2024-10-10T18:47:04Z,DO NOT Buy Nvidia Stock (NVDA) - Do THIS Instead,Nvidia,"Nvidia stock has been one of the Market's best performers but buying now at this price could limit your returns instead I'm going to show you a smarter way to profit by selling puts on Nvidia and generate safe steady monthly income just like my students are doing right now first off let's talk about nvidia's high implied volatility or IV right now because the stock has had such an insane runup as you can see and everyone is piling into it the option premiums are infl which wink wink is actually a good thing for us option Sellers and the stock is up over 170% year to dat so I want to talk about a better entry opportunity into Nvidia because right now as we can see the stock has had some roller coaster rides okay the stock had a double top pattern at $135 per share then it had a I would call it a crash from $135 to100 that is a crash then we had a rise then we had a pullback and now we're at a rise so the pattern is very interesting but also a little bit scary so I want to talk about getting into Nvidia at a better price and that means that as an option seller we are looking to sell some put options for optimal entry number one outcome is if nvidia's price drops to your strike price you get to own the stock at a discount from where it's trading at today okay now number two if Nvidia stays above your strike price you keep the premium you you collect it upfront as the pure income and you're happy you're smiling you get to do it all over again Let me give you a live example on put selling on Nvidia so we're going to jump into my screen right now and you will see that I am up $1,529 on Nvidia and I have several positions right now only thing I currently have open that has a decent amount of Premium besides this one is the 125 cellp put okay this is expiring on the 18th which is very very soon okay since this is expiring in the next couple of days here at 125 I feel very confident because Nvidia is at 134 all right so you tell me would you rather buy Nvidia for 134 or would you rather buy it for 125 I'm going to be adding to my position on Nvidia because I made $11,500 in a short amount of time on Nvidia because it's a good stock it has a lot of good volatility and the options are beautiful okay oh and let's also not forget Nvidia has massive long-term potential with its leadership in AI its military applications and its government contracts this is a company with serious staying power guys if you do end up owning the stock at a lower price through selling puts you're not just getting a good deal you're getting exposure to one of the most Innovative companies in the world at a price that makes sense I'm not paid by Nvidia I'm simply presenting my opinions guys I'm not a financial adviser I think Nvidia is a good company and I've made money hand over fist bicep over tricep as I say in my videos on Nvidia stock because of the high quality nature of Nvidia and Ai and Leadership the CEO everything everything is on point and the fundamentals are decent they're fantastic they're decent I've been teaching this strategy to my students for a while now and they're consistently profiting by using put selling strategies on Nvidia and other high growth companies implied volatility here 48% that's really good okay apple is probably around 29 so Nvidia is over 1 and a half times almost two times more implied volatility than Apple for NVIDIA the high implied volatility presents opportunity because when you're selling a put option you get a lot of Premium if I'm looking at generate income on Nvidia I would essentially look at just 30-day options I'm taking a look at Nvidia it is above the Binger band it is above guys that is my that's my red flag right there that is the red flag that I have that's that's the color of my collar right here red flag you don't want it to be above the bowling or band okay that is it's a red flag I'm planning to run from the stock if it goes to much higher but instead I'm happy to sell some puts I don't want to buy it at 132 but I want to buy it at the M uh the Binger band average of 117 I would love to buy it at 120 132 it's getting a little Rich for the short term something could come out in the in the near term and say Hey you know we're going to sell more gpus or whatever some good news or CEO can announce something that could change the fundamentals but at these levels were above the Binger band beware a lot of people making videos on Nvidia great company beware I wear you buy it okay Let me go back to Nvidia options we see now it's above the Binger band the moving average is 117 all right so we want to get to that zone okay if I go down to you know 120 is pretty good 120 is pretty good the Delta is 23 that's good that's a little lower than I need okay if if I go to 123 Delta is .27 I like this okay this is a style preference all right if you want a higher risk play go for 130 if you want to be super safe go for 115 that's where I'm making money right now 123 seems to be legitimate $4 an income um you're putting up about 12 Grand so the premium here is about 3% in 30 days 3% in 30 days you get paid to buy Nvidia at 123 per share one of the new reasons Nvidia by the way is so exciting also is its dominance in the AI and semiconductor space Nvidia is at the heart of AI Revolution supplying the gpus that power AI research and development worldwide okay that's why this company keeps growing that's why this company is in a bull run and I think we're going to keep being in a bull run it just depends how much of a bull run that's the only question I have it's not if we're going to be in a bull run it's by how much its products are not just used by tech companies every major cloud provider and data center is relying on nvidia's Hardware this positions them for long-term growth and selling puts allows you to potentially get in at a more attractive price while generating income along the way fantastic that's exactly what I'm going for with my safe passive income approach and this is a fantastic retirement strategy Nvidia gives you both it gives you high growth and income for retirement and I also want to talk about more reasons why Nvidia is really smart to sell puts right now because selling puts is a neutral to bullish strategy if the stock stays neutral goes sideways you make money if it goes if the stock goes up you make money actually even if you it goes down a little bit but it stays above the 123 strike price you're still going to make money okay so you're going to make money as long as it stays above 123 now even if it goes below1 123 your break even price since you're collecting $4 is going to be $119 per share so be aware that you may get ass signed at 123 but your average cost when you factor in your premium is actually 119 another new reason to be bullish long-term on Nvidia by the way is there massive expansion into automotive industry Nvidia is pioneering Aid driven software for a autonomous driving and autonomous Automotive chips all that stuff that has to do with vehicles that is a really big transformation area that envidia is capturing a lot of revenue from which will soon be a key part of you know all electric vehicles okay these AI chips all these software approaches to Vehicles they're going to be a huge Revenue driver for NVIDIA this adds another layer of growth potential to an already strong company so by selling puts you're setting yourself up to own Nvidia stock at a discount all right it doesn't have to to be Nvidia you can sell puts on any stock that you want I'm specifically covering Nvidia because as it gets more expensive it is way more wise to sell put options take my opinions here on YouTube I'm telling you the truth we've made tons of money okay Nvidia stock you can buy it at a discount as it continues to expand into um you know more profitable sectors and lastly Nvidia is also making huge strides in military contracts does that sound familiar Palance here the stock that I've been right on since IPO uh people were doubting me you know I know what I'm talking about I've done the research on these companies they are continuously growing and they're expanding their AI Partnerships I look at the relationships that these companies have because relationships is what makes you money all right so Palante here great relationships Nvidia fantastic relationships governments in the private uh sector and these private entities are heavily invested in invidious Technologies to power the next wave of Defense systems and AI capabilities this further strengthens their longterm prospects by selling puts you can either buy into the uh these promises in the future at a lower price today or you keep the premium and maybe the stock goes up I'm specifically covering Nvidia because as it gets more expensive it is way more wise to sell put options my position right now the the proof's going to be in the pudding proof's right there on the screen 115 125 102 107 I don't even have to talk my portfolio does a talking my portfolio does the talking here this is a much smarter way if you want to diversify across different expiration days",1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,1PDVHOzQgzM,2024-10-04T21:25:59Z,URGENT: Palantir Stock (PLTR) Shareholders Need to Do THIS ASAP!,Palantir,"paler stock is up over 120% this year so far and a lot of people are asking me if it's still worth a buy and the answer is no if you want to make a lot of money on paler stock you can either buy a lot of shares at an all-time high or if you only have a little bit of capital you can buy leaps which are a much better option strategy which can change your life here's how right now palter is at an all-time high which means that you want to get into the stock but you want to get a more favorable price that's typically either selling a put option or it's by risking less money with leap options tenter stock has Skyrocket 120% this year but the real question is what is going to happen next This is the important question because I've made a lot of money my one-on-one students have made a lot of money but you're watching today and you're thinking to yourself is it still worth a buy into the future and that is a very hard question it is hard to predict where paler will go I am still bullish on it but logic says that the more expensive a stock gets the worse of a value it is because it's more expensive if you're holding pound your shares right now you need to know there's a smarter way to grow your profits that way is going to be buying leap options so you're putting up a lot less Capital up fronts and then trying to subsidize or reduce the cost of those leap options by selling covered calls against those leap options okay I'm going to be showing you examples in this video and buying paler shares at an all-time high right now is risky I'm going to tell you that straight up right now because I've been covering the stock since it ipoed you can see on this channel years ago I was covering paler I've made a lot of money on paler but as it goes up I am becoming more cautious that is just the truth okay it's the unfortunate truth because this stock was a such it was just such a good value for a very long time and it was my best idea paler was my best idea and now we've made a boatload of money and we need to be careful care F now because what you earn you need to protect okay so what is a leap option and how can it potentially be life-changing for you right now because in a year from now a leap option can double in value okay it can double your wealth so that's why it's very important to listen look I'm going to go through an example and I'm going to walk you through this example all right so we're going to go ahead and type in palen here and we're going to take a look at the options specifically of what I can do just want to point out I have about 6% of my money in Palance here I'm up $72,000 or a little bit over $72 72 $72,000 um I actually have shares of Palance in my other portfolio as well where I focus more on higher growth more risky strategies just being honest with you I have a high risk tolerance in my other portfolio I like to do different unique things that I cover with my 101 students but this is really transparent here on on YouTube I've been trading for number of years and you guys seen me grow my portfolio from in the $100,000 $100,000 they Bots to over $3 million I've documented this whole process palen here has been a very good stock for me now I'll be honest with you I've made some mistakes where I I haven't owned paler the whole entire time I've sold it for profit and I've missed some opportunities but I've also saved some money because paler did have some volatility it went down currently my current position I'm up 65% okay and the options I am down I'm down on the options because covered calls are not advantageous when stocks go up the good news is this video is not about covered calls this video is about leap options it's about leap options which is going to be a lot better because if I did leap options I'd be up a lot more than 65% I'd be up hundreds of percent but I have a bigger portfolio and I'm all about safe stable income so this strategy is going to be I don't want to say it's more risky because it's not really more risky but it's a lot higher return with about the same risk give or take depending on how you set up the option so let me show you um if you buy a call option a leap option is going to expire all right so essentially one year so I'm going to look for an option that's September 19 2025 this right here the the use of a call option is to make it look like shares okay that's the whole point you want it to look like shares so for that you can buy something like the 30 here okay the 30 call option and the Delta here is 76 all right so when you look at buying leaps and creating income on leaps which is essentially called the poor man's covered call strategy this strategy right here allows you to put up a lot less Capital so think about it this way if you were to put up um 100 shares of pound here it would cost you currently 100 * 36 which is $3,600 however this leap option right here instead of putting up $3,600 you can only put up $1,150 so the amount that you're putting up is a lot less in fact it's 1/3 so you're putting up 1/3 of the capital and you can still get a really big return I'll explain to you right now so when you buy this obviously it's a little bit worse by itself why well the market isn't stupid okay the reason why you can put up less Capital here is because your break even is higher all right so if paler goes up a stockholder makes money but a leite buyer you have to break even at 4118 there's some extra space a gap that you have to fill you need the stock to go up to to Really Break Even because this option has a lot of time value okay there's a lot of time value on this option however you can sell calls because a long call option A Long leap option is the same thing kind of as shares it gives you a lot of the same characteristics so ESS you kind of own 100 shares and you can use it in mimic 100 shares so now you can sell covered call options so if I were to sell a covered call which is 3 months out that in the long term we're very bullish on Palance here we think it's going to keep Rising but let's say that we think it's only going to go up to $4 per share by January 2025 then here's what you would do you would sell a call option at 270 and now you can see the chart has changed um now we're only putting up $880 instead of the $ 1150 so this has subsidized your cost still giving you that upside this looks like a covered call it's very similar to a covered call but you can see it's kind of losing value if if the stock goes up a lot it kind of loses value because the short call option the 40 call option that you're selling it starts to kind of go against you if it's above 40 but it's not a problem because the 30 call option that you're along has a lot more Delta has a lot more strength so you just lose a little bit of value here above 40 but it's not much right you're you're profits go down a little bit your max profit is like 452 here but you know goes down to a little bit under 400 this is a very strong strategy very strong strategy I like this strategy a lot and if you're looking at um getting into pal here for a cheaper cost this is going to be very advantageous because buying palen tier shares at an all-time high is risky leaps they're potentially life-changing because you get to actually bet on palen here without having to put up $3,600 you're only putting up $80 and you're still getting about the same upside so this is a strategy to reduce your costs by 75% this is 1/4 so 75% off but still with about the same upside now obviously P here goes up to like $80 per share you're not going to make as much as a stockholder but I don't think it's going to go up to $80 per share by by January 17 right now real quick when this goes to expiration January 17 you don't really have to do much to manage strategy all right I get a lot of my one-on-one students kind of freak out like oh what should I do it's getting closer as long as it's out of the money it's out of the money you leave it alone once it hits in the money I think about rolling this option position which is actually really easy because you can roll from 40 to let's say like 45 or something like that now buying more paler shares at an all-time high is still not the best idea but you should have about 10% of your money in pal here because of the innovation in the AI instead of sinking thousands of dollars into the stock I think leap options can actually provide you a of two to 3x return versus just buying the stock because when you buy the stock you have to put up four times the capital you can make the same returns with you know 75% less Capital which makes your returns basically like three to four times more so here's why leaps could be the ultimate way to play pound here in the next explosive move because the next explosive move when I say explosive for me I'm kind of like this old school stable passive investor so an explosive move to me is like 5% that's a lot of money right cuz when you invest a sixf figure portfolio 5% in a short amount of time $5,000 200k portfolio $10,000 it's a lot of money right uh it's a lot of money for for most people it's a lot of money for doing things like I don't spend that much money in my day-to-day life I can also get by on like $10,000 a month even though I make a lot more I'm not really huge spender I would say I spend a lot of money sometimes just just depends but5 $10,000 is a lot of money especially overseas I'm mainly overseas I'm in my studio here in Poland but I'm in Dubai sometimes I'm in mova sometimes I'm I love Eastern Europe so I spend a lot of time here and that's my background my culture so yeah I like spending time here and I think when you look at paler it's just a money-making opportunity it's the cash cow the cash flow the gold mine opportunity for selling options so you can live a more free life and travel or you know really get that passive safe income into retirement so imagine having the chance to basically control 100 shares of paler without paying the full price up front That's really a game changer so want you to look into this strategy and look leaps they give you the power to profit big without putting all your Capital At Risk which is very important because I'm always looking out for risk management risk management and optimal entry these are the things that I focus on with my one-on-one students when I have zoom calls I always ask the first question is how is your portfolio allocated looking at asset allocation is the most important factor you might not know that let me explain real fast when I was working that Goldman Sachs they were putting clients in buckets they didn't pick stocks guys the craziest thing is you got a $100 million you're a CEO you go to Goldman Sachs they're not picking stocks for you they're picking asset allocation asset allocation a popular not so popular a not so popular Topic at all a lot of people ignore this which is absolutely wrong okay asset allocation basically dictates how much of your Capital do you have in different positions I'm going to call this the the asset allocation equation okay this equation to me 10 to 15 stocks leaps can also be 5 to 10% of your portfolio because we're in a bull market guys we've seen that with Nvidia we see that with Palante here I've literally scaled my portfolio to almost $4 million by just focusing okay by just focusing on high quality companies I got Tesla I got Nvidia I have apple I have Walmart you might be thinking to yourself why would Henry have Walmart this is a boring St it's not popular on YouTube I don't care if it's popular on YouTube I'm trying to get results I have $174,000 gains on Walmart on a boring company so it's all about safe passive income and consistent income for me leaps provide a good source of income and growth a lot of growth leaps give you the power to profit big without putting up the capital to risk leaps are literally one of the ultimate ways that you should be playing pal here especially if you are bullish on paler because this is a bullish strategy if you're bullish on paler long term or Nvidia or any other stock right but you're concerned about the current price leaps are your best friend they're way to have exposure at a lower price they're a way to own shares to have the upside with only putting up a fraction of the capital you don't have to buy at all all-time Highs at especially these all-time highs we're not cheap guys by no means I'll show you how to you know basically use options to maximize profit without taking on too much risk so look if you have a portfolio that is you know somewhere around 50k 100K then basically if you were to trade Palance here you would be doing about 10% which here would be about three contracts okay that would be three full contracts full I mean if you were to buy 300 shares but leaps that's a lot more that you can do because you're putting up a lot less capital okay does that make sense you're putting up a lot less Capital which means that you can do more contracts which means that you can have more upside all right some people will get on my case in the comment section down below um which by the way I read all the comments but please be careful there is a lot of scammers if you see someone writing their telegram they're pretending to be me unfortunately they're everywhere they're on telegram they're on Discord they're on YouTube I do one-on-one coaching that's why I also want to do one-on-one coaching I want to build deep relationships and I don't want anyone to um give their money to to like scammers or something like that okay so please just be very very very careful I would rather just no one have any issues it it honestly like breaks my heart when I see that I hate that I was saying that you some people get on my case because a leap option is a one-year um security right it's typically oneyear by definition you don't have to do one year guys the whole point of a leap in the sh I'm showing you which is really the poor man's covered call is that it gives you upside gives you upside with a lot less Capital up front Okay so if I were to do something this is a modified Poor Man's covered call um put my own twist to it I'm going to do um let's just do like Henry's short-term leap Poor Man's cover call all right definitions don't matter results matter so let's go let's get into the results 35 this would be a slightly in the money call option very very slightly it's going to go for a lot less money only $500 um and then you can do shorter term options that expire in a month essentially so if I think that we have upside for pounds here but only couple dollars worth I can go for like the 39 right here and you can see how I'm getting a very big reduction in My overall cost I'm going from $500 to $340 essentially that's the total cost and I can bring in like $263 of total upside if everything happens according to plan so what what would that mean if basically paler went to $39 per share you would be up around $300 on on this option right give or take it's kind of difficult to to say exactly because this option has a different expiration but surely the 35 call option would be worth it would be over $300 worth of profit and this right here would basically be worth about zero at expiration all right so this option let's say the new price would be $ 800 this expires worthless it's a lot of money why 5 to8 is three $3 $300 this option you sold DK so you made four you can make you can actually make $450 I actually knew that that's why I was doing the math in front of you guys because this isn't really actually correct Robin Hood isn't fully uh accurately calculating the the the top price I I don't know why that's the case but in theory you can this option can be worth $8 and this option can be worth Zer so you would make 300 and $150 all right so $450 very powerful for putting up $350 so obviously a lot of things going have to go vary according to plan but as long as paler basically goes up you're you're essentially going to be making money you're going to be making pretty good income without putting up that much Capital now this strategy isn't for everyone but but if you're looking to make significant gains with limited Capital this is going to be the best strategy now we went over the strategy and I want to discuss something that you can't Overlook paler its recognition as a leading AI platform is really why I'm investing in this company paler has been recognized as the number one AI in machine learning platform by Forester wave reinforcing its market dominance the company has made substantial gains both in government and Commercial sectors the CEO is absolutely phenomenal mentioned that he went to my high school I like the Innovation going on at paler paler position is at the forefront and it presents a prime opportunity for investors to capitalize on the company's expanding market share the company's ability to secure long-term government contracts is why I like it so much it has their pan in the government's pocket all right my tax dollars I want them back a little bit right I pay a lot of taxes right now they have their hands in the government pocket they have long-term contracts with the government as well as the commercial sector this these contracts are hundreds of millions of dollars and they're likely to keep getting renewed because Palante here wants in a company hard to get them out because once they install their software it's very expensive and it's hard to move over because data science as an industry there's a lot of data data siloed in different parts of a company organizing all that data is the hardest part it's not really analyzing the data a data scientist can analyze data in a reasonable amount of time organizing the data and getting it efficiently without like errors and mistakes is very difficult paler basically solves all of those equations right from the very beginning DIY right additionally paler focus on AI driven Solutions positions it to benefit from The increased demand for automation making it a compelling choice for investors seeking exposure to the AI Revolution that's why I've been covering a lot of Nvidia that's why I cover paler I've been investing in these stocks for very long time guys before it was popular on YouTube I had a paler stock NOW Nvidia I I I made a mistake I was avoiding it a little bit for some time I was on and off with it I have a LoveHate relationship with it I've made money overall but I've missed some opportunity as well so you have to be in Trends right now guys because going into 2025 there is a lot of money to be made especially with picking the right stocks selling options and even running lucrative buying strategies like the poor man's covered call like buying leap options like selling covered calls on a leap option which is all the same thing right it's all the same thing you're getting exposure into the stock so since going public in 2020 pal here has doubled its revenue from government and Commercial sectors they have doubled okay since 201 20 its international business has also grown significantly without compromising its principles by selling to China or Russia I've covered paler when it ipoed I actually heard about this St from one of my high school buddies who's in the steel business that's really kind of interesting my buddy's in the steel business um because Alex karp is an alumni in my high school and there's a lot of talk at my high school of Alex karp because we're proud of him right he he has a very interesting background which also is a very big positive for paler Alex karp he has a Jewish clinical pediatrician father and an African-American artist mother very diverse he was raised in Philadelphia he graduated Central High School in 1985 I graduated in 2012 uh thereabouts I think it was 2012 and I personally have over 5,000 shares of paler and I'm up a lot as you just saw when I was sharing my screen and I'm going to continue adding to my position because this stock makes logical sense given exceptional management AI the fundamentals of the business are very strong the brand is very strong the contracts that they have in place are stable this is everything that I look forward company this is exactly the type of company that I've been investing in and making money hand

Invest with Henry,1GvzZP1ZZtk,2024-10-03T18:06:32Z,NVDA Perfect Time To Sell Put Options for High Income,Nvidia,"there's no doubt that Nvidia stock is one of the best stocks on the market but it's already more than double this year alone and if you don't pick the right entry price you're absolutely going to lose money so in this video I'm going to share my Outlook on Nvidia my strategy for buying the stock and a trade that I just recently shared with my one-on-one students that are already making money on nvidia's current volatility offers a prime opportunity for a high option premiums making it absolutely ideal for put sellers looking to maximize income actually this Market market right now is exclusively Nvidia and Tesla in terms of option trading nvidia's elevated implied volatility is a good thing and it makes absolutely no sense in a good way I'm going to explain right now high quality momentum upwards and high premium these are the three factors that Nvidia has Count Me In that's a very good formula for making money when you have a highquality company that has high implied volatility those two things are really a good formula because you want to own the stock you don't mind so selling options which the risk or I'll put in quotations the risk is if you sell a put option you will get assigned into a stock but if you want to own the stock you absolutely have no problems this stock Nvidia is an option sellers dream I'm going to give you certain plays right now a few different plays from my portfolio live but I first want to say that selling puts on Nvidia it benefits from fast time DK okay which is Theta all right so jumping into my portfolio right now my portfolio is at $3.3 million and I'm going to go into Nvidia right right Nvidia is a pretty big holding for me I do have two portfolios Nvidia is a very big core holding in my other portfolio but it's still a good pze position in this portfolio as well and I am up $2,450 on Nvidia and I have sold multiple different options I have sold 107 puts 102 puts and 115 puts now let me quickly explain I like this stock so if I sell put options the worst thing that can happen is I may get assigned 100 shares for each contract that I sell a put option which for me is a good thing I'm personally looking for steady returns between 3 to 4% a lot of my 1on1 students that have 50k 100K and six figures in their portfolio 3 to 4% per month is a very good return I mean on 100K that's $3 to $4,000 per month fantastic okay Nvidia provides a very good opportunity because for you know folks that are looking for a bit higher return but still have a high quality company that has good momentum Nvidia basically fits all the requirements so what I would do right now is I'm going to go into Nvidia options I'm going to show you different plays but I also want to talk about Theta in time Decay okay because when you're selling options you really want to pay attention to essentially how the option is decaying in value because that basically gives you the theoretical amount that you're up every single day I'll explain to you very simply all right so if I were to sell a option that expires very short term and let's just say for example I go for the 115 you can see here that the Delta is 38 which is like out of the money it's it's lower than 50 so it's better than 50% it's better than a coin flip and the Theta here is42 so that means this is crazy that means this option is decaying by $42 in value every single day so that means if you sell this option it's losing $42 per day and when you're an option seller right you collect income and obviously you can't close it right that moment right if you sell an option you get that cash right away but there's still a position your in your portfolio right in one day it'll Decay by $42 which means that if you were to close a position after 1 day you'd be up $42 which is a pretty good return and this option right here specifically since it's expiring so short term the $129 that you uh collect right away it will fully Decay within just 2 days so when you sell an option your goal kind of one of your goals is that the option does not go below 115 in this example if it does not go below 115 you're good you can just do this option trade again if it does go below 115 that means that you will have to buy 100 shares of Nvidia but the is you don't really care because Nvidia is a good quality company so that's why selling put options on Nvidia is very lucrative I'm going to show you several different trades but I want to also tell you guys about the the mindset that I have and teach you a little bit more about Nvidia because Nvidia is good for multiple different options okay one it's good for selling put options which right here I'm showing you if you were to sell the 115 this is basically entry into 115 but you can also go for out of thee money options like pretty significantly out of the money like 110 now if you're going to go for something like 110 the 110 strike you would pick an option that is going to be expiring a little bit more out into the future so let's go for 110 you can see right here that you're basically going to collect $500 when you sell this option on the 110 strike now you will notice that the Theta here is a lot lower it's 0.02 so this option is decaying in value less it's decaying Less in value than something that is expiring more shorter term now I'm personally looking at Nvidia investing a lot of money into it because they have the potential to power and transform future Technologies AI is in the trajectory that most companies are looking at taking or have already taken including the most established companies like Fang companies if you look at you know meow or Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix Google these Fang companies which by the way have had really good performance um these companies are all investing in Ai and AI is a really big Trend and I like to be in a stock that has positive momentum because look I teach option trading on this channel I teach safe path passive income I teach folks how to retire and create uh that stable income into retirement however it doesn't matter what option strategy that you use if you don't pick the right stock and you don't pick the right price on the stock for NVIDIA right now because it has pulled back a decent amount I mean if I look at Nvidia stock I like that the stock is no longer at its all-time highs it's not necessarily a cheap company so if we look at the three-month return here it's down 3.86% and if I go to your to date this stock is just slightly off its highs of 135 $530 per share you can actually see that it had a lot of resistance because it had a double top pattern here at 135 then Nvidia reached another basically the double top at 135 isn't it interesting how stocks work it's kind of obvious logical but at the same time not logical and obvious it's kind of interesting because you can clearly see that Nvidia has very strong resistance and it does not want to push above $135 per share you can also see that it has very good support at around $100 right we had a double bottom at $100 so in my opinion NV is like a paler it's like an American Airlines it just goes sideways for the short-term future but it's trending upwards so it's kind of like sideways action but upward sideway sideways action and it has high implied volatility this is a gold mine stock I repeat if you sell puts and you sell covered calls this is a gold mine stock I'm literally up $2,450 in a pretty short amount of time um I open up options on a monthly basis that's because when I post my trades for my one-on-one members and the one-on-one members have access to Discord when I post trades I'm essentially doing two to eight weeks okay let me explain why um short-term options have more premium to them so they're attractive because they're decaying very quickly in that data which I talked about earlier is very high so that option is decaying in value and when you sell it you get to keep a lot of the income you make a lot of income quickly but but let me say that if you collect 2, $2,100 in 2 weeks or $4,000 in four weeks there's a difference there but the difference isn't that high and in my opinion it doesn't really justify short-term trading so that's why for me I like monthly options and I like to have 10 to 15 positions because once you have too many positions it is not easy to um to stay organized a lot of my the one-on-one students that I'm working with Hands-On I ask them share me your portfolio share me your positions let's take a look at how much cash you have they'll share me a list of like like 18 to 35 positions typically and I'm like H this isn't really how much how much time is it taking you and they'll tell me ah it's taking me like multiple hours a week I'm like not that good for management not only is it not good for time management it's not good for organization it also makes it much harder to trade because when you're sloppy with your trades you end up not taking profits at the proper moment you end up having more questions and the more decisions you have to make the harder those decisions become right you're you're bombarded with too many decisions but when you have 10 to 15 stocks uh it's much easier to pick a proper entry get to know the stock understand the fundamentals the fundamentals is very important and the technicals so what I would be doing right now is I would simply be trading options uh specifically selling puts on Nvidia um for entry so if you have shares I would say get more shares unless you're over 20% in that case take it easy you know you want to have safe risk management you don't want to have too much money in any one stock so I would be looking at 110 right here you can see how the implied volatility is 52% volatility uh the data is decently High Delta is out of the money and the bid ask is really attractive as well so I want to be in Nvidia because and I didn't mention this I mentioned this later in the video so I think the stock is going to be $800 per share at some point I think between 12 to 36 months now I don't know if it's going to be a month 14 month 16 that is something that is too specific of a question and nobody can predict that right but I think that Nvidia has a very long road map ahead of it competition isn't that strong Nvidia has a very sustainable competitive and durable competitive Advantage something that Warren Buffett talks about a lot right I've read all the Warren Buffett books and I've studied Finance I've had experience at Goldman Sachs I know I say that a lot in this these type of videos but I'm just pointing out that I've been at this game for a very long time and I do believe that nvidia's high momentum is going to continue and I think selling options for optimal entry is a very good idea right now and I see Nvidia being the Dominator for the next 20 years so if you have a long time Horizon of a decade and 20 years I'm going to make a crazy statement but I would be using margin to invest in Nvidia now I would be using smart margin that's probably not a topic for this video but I would literally and on My Philosophy from the research I've done is I'm actually more than 100% invested in the market not only do I put my money where my mouth is guys and have all my money in options I actually have leverage on options so if you want send me an email I do have one-on-one coaching Spots I'm very limited because I'm now selling my time you know for money essentially I am becoming a one-on-one coach because I want to have more impact on less people's lives but I want to have higher impact like really big impact and I really enjoy that oneone aspect I'm more old school myself so I'm kind of tired of doing like the cookie cutter like discords that everyone else selling so anyways feel free to reach out I'll have my email and my uh the first link in the description the only Link in the description for more information but look I see Nvidia really dominating for the next 20 years and I likely see that happening for 30 plus years and that's really difficult even if you look at the S&P 500 a majority of companies they never truly like stay in the S&P 500 forever that is really really rare and the reason why I say that is because when I look at Nvidia the use cases for NVIDIA like military and government and by the way that's federal state local all the government they are literally like I said kind of like paler where paler has their hands in the government's pocket the same thing is with Nvidia and I know there's some news out there that China doesn't you know want to use all their chips that's fine guys there's plenty of demand plenty okay so when um you look at what Nvidia is doing the use cases okay we have military and government we also have Enterprise software like the mega caps guys if you're involved with you know they have relationships with all the mega cap stocks believe me those stocks and those companies have a big budget so they're going to keep spending money on Nvidia right also if you look at Healthcare right it's really big guys we have an aging population and to be honest with you money is really easy money is easy and people as they get older get a lot of money it's really not that hard in fact right now even even if I did absolutely nothing God willing that I have good health and everything like that I'd probably make it to 100 million if I were to live to age 70 right that's because of compound interest money is really easy because it compounds over time right so when you look at Healthcare there's a lot of older people we have aging population and there's a lot of money in healthcare a lot and I know that because a lot of my one-on-one students are doctors dentists medical professionals like nurses and I find a lot of success coaching medical professionals because you guys medical professionals are extremely detail oriented have a hard work ethic and you're used to being kind of like unfortunately slaves right the medical system kind of takes advantage of the workers themselves which is why I think it's really important for you to trade options and for you to have a safe passive income on the side and ideally grow that income to the point where you don't have to you know be doing that dental work and and seeing like thousands of patients a month and doing lots of paperwork because I know I work with a lot of doctors I see exactly how the work is and it is very grueling as well as Engineers I mean engineering work is difficult and by the way even the most talented Engineers I've noticed get fired as they get older because there's agism in um Silicon Valley so more reason to trade options and more reason to look for opportunities like Nvidia to sell options for income and again Nvidia the use cases are also Automotive autonomous you know driving and autonomous vehicles operations streamlining robotics Pharma Pharma is a big one right we're going to have a lot of drugs coming out in the near future as we continue to accelerate AI as we continue to accelerate science Nvidia is going to be making money in all those areas I'm going to show you some different plays that you can have on Nvidia because you can absolutely go for a short-term plays and you can also go for long-term traits so let me show you in all cases the goal is the same we're collecting income we want steady passive safe income and and we want optimal entry into into Nvidia all right so I showed you the November 15 here but you can also go out much farther you can go out for um you go out for example May 16 2025 and you can sell an in the money option all right this is might go overhead a little bit but let me explain and make it more simple Nvidia is likely to rise by May 16 2025 okay if this stock goes up let's say to 125 this option right here will provide an over 10% return very safely if Nvidia stays at the current level or is below 120 you're going to be acquiring Nvidia the chances of it being below 120 is not that high the Delta here is actually going to say that this is crazy because this is an in the money option which typically an in the money option would have over a 50 Delta but the market understands that Nvidia is likely to go up this is kind of proof that the Stock's going to go up the Delta is 043 even though this is an in the money option so I can pretty much recommend regardless of when you're watching this video that selling at the money options which would be 115 or even in the money options at 120 would be a very good income producer I would actually sell puts on multiple different expiration dates but first I want to say one more thing another key reason Nvidia is a gold mine for selling puts right now is time Decay as I mentioned and Theta High Theta leads to increased income with the option decaying you know quicker or more rapidly when you're selling options every single day that goes by actually works in your favor especially with nvidia's quick moving options Market I'm not just looking at Nvidia for the next few months I I believe the stock is heading to $800 or more in a reasonable amount of time reasonable again being 12 to 36 months I always tell everyone that you should not be looking at the short-term results it's all about a consistent long-term Vision I'm a CEO of my business I'm also a consultant of other businesses and when I take a look at what the company's doing Nvidia specifically my perspective is if you want to grow your wealth or anyone wants to grow their wealth you find a strategy that works an option strategy that works on a high quality company and finding a strategy and sticking to it so that's selling puts and the second part of this video which is going to be covered calls let's go over some covered call plays so what I would personally do is if you already have shares of Nvidia you're probably in two camps okay one Camp is that you don't mind losing the shares okay you just want High income short fast income all right so I would go for something that's 30 days out all right and the second Camp by the way is you don't want to lose the shares so we'll talk about that as well so for NVIDIA what you can do is you can just sell a covered call that's closer to the money okay so 120 you can go for this right here here and essentially it's a46 Delta it's fairly High the bid ask is really good and you're going to collect $540 of income which is over 4% inane insane 4% a month beautiful that's beautiful and look if it goes to one1 you can always roll it up all right you can follow my dog strategy which is just rolling up by like $5 to $10 in 30 to 90 days that's simple truth of what the dog strategy is but also you can go out further in terms of date you don't have to manage this strategy super closely so you can go out for 2025 and any of the expiration but give yourself a lot more upside all right so you can go up to like 150150 and there's still $7 worth of income here so $7 worth of income pretty good income about 6% return you get crazy upside you get upside from 116 up to 150 so if you think that Nvidia can pass 150 you obviously would not sell a covered call at 150 you would go higher to let's say like 160 or so this is the same trading strategy that I've seen used on Wall Street by the safest and best financial advisers obviously I'm not not a financial adviser but I've seen this used for millionaire portfolios for smaller portfolios for Mega big portfolios this is the best strategy selling puts and covered calls you truly don't need anything else",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,zsG8VcjAUyA,2024-09-29T20:09:27Z,WARNING: Tesla Stock (TSLA) Unusual Call Options Activity (DO THIS BEFORE 10/10),Tesla,"Tesla's October 10th event is right around the corner and something very unusual is going on with Tesla's options there's a whole lot of money to be made and in this video I'm going to explain to you the unusual call options that I'm seeing on Tesla stock and how we can use that to make a lot of money ahead of the event. Welcome back to Fast Money Tesla showing some Sparks of Life surging nearly 10% this week and far outpacing uh the rest of the mag 7 stocks. The stock is up 21% in September its best month since June of last year and games come ahead of Q3 delivery numbers coming next Wednesday and the highly anticipated Robo taxi reveal coming almost a week later. It's uh it was the second most active in terms of call volume today behind perennial front runner these days at least Nvidia but of course it's a higher dollar stock price so the difference in the contract quantity between the two is not as big as it might first appear. Options Traders are are playing basically in Tesla and Nvidia exclusively it seems like. The China news this week along with all the other China news but it was Tesla in China that was coming through they've got this 1.99% 6-year uh financing which has to be supporting you know the Bears are going to say what do you what happens without that. And if you look at rivan's chart it's the inverse of Tesla's chart so Tesla is truly moving on China robot taxi everything's been pushed off the whisper number is higher than the streets number usually usually is but if they blow that number out people are still going to be scrambling to chase this one. Realistically it's whmo and it's Tesla and if Tesla could keep that momentum going if we waited this long if it's an exciting unve uh reveal then the stock can go higher guys they said 400,000 contracts over the daily average that is a whole lot of volume and there is a lot of high demand for call options on Tesla right now. Essentially option Traders are basically just trading Tesla exclusively and they're very bullish and this is unusual option activity. I have been in Tesla for a long time. Let me open up my Tesla position right now. Tesla has been a very interesting uh stock to trade. I also have spoken to several Tesla employees as I am a one-on-one coach and basically I work with a lot of Engineers Doctors medical professionals dentists and I have several people that do work at Tesla so I've heard a lot of very interesting information you know it's all pretty much publicly available but I think that the engineering team is topnotch at Tesla and I see a lot of upgrad grades coming in for Tesla so there is a whole lot of bullish momentum. If we take a look at the 3mon chart here the Stock's up 30% and in the last month alone this stock has up over 25%. So what I would be doing right now is I'm going to go to Tesla trade options. But with Tesla I think that the risk to reward ratio here is very smart if you're a more aggressive uh investor and you have a higher appetite for risk. You do need Tesla to move up a lot for you to actually Break Even you need Tesla to go up to $286 per share. A risk that if Tesla goes to $300 per share you can end up getting paid off pretty well over a 50% return. If Tesla goes to $300 per share November 15 now this would be an over 10 to 15% rise. You can 2.5 extra money if Tesla moves up by like 5% basically it's like a little bit more than 5% 5.5% if I'm doing the math in my head correctly. Given the huge volume of Trades being made right now on Tesla there's a lot of liquidity that means liquidity is a good thing for getting your option filled and not losing that much money to slippage cost. I don't personally think Tesla can go to $300 per share it's possible but the chances are obviously pretty low right. By buying the 265 selling to 275 Tesla doesn't have to go to 300 for you to get a 50% return Tesla has to go to 275 for you get a 250% return right or 2.5x whatever that percentage return is. I really don't mind going into Tesla because I think the Innovation the brand is very strong leadership is strong a lot of good stuff is happening right now we see a lot of information from China giving you know favorable loans and subsidies stuff like that which really helps out you know the consumer to purchase more of these vehicles. So yeah I would look at 235 sell put for October 11th.",1.0,0.8

Tom Le said inflation is no longer on the front burner. you don't need a lot of opinions and Tom Lee himself said it's basically a coin flip. American Airlines is fantastic this is a money printing machine because it goes sideways exactly what Tom Lee said he said that basically it's a coin flip.,1.0,0.1

(Options for Beginners),American Airlines,I one more trade for you guys and uh we still have a little bit of time left to do one more trade so let's do our uh next trade which is going to be American Airlines I think American Airlines is also very good stock to trade specifically because a lot of a lot of people will scratch their head and think like why are you trading American Airlines but a stock that consistently goes sideways in in action um like you can see here how the three three months we're just we're barely down we're going sideways is fantastic for selling options because there is volatility here but the stock isn't going in any clear like movement up or down which makes it a very good candidate for selling options for income so I'm going to go ahead and sell a put option I'm going to go for uh you know we can go for something like November 1st and very simply I can sell like 10 and a half uh strike right here which is a lot of money like 40 cents on basically $40 on basically a th000 is a 4% return in about a month this is fantastic 4% in a month is huge returns and it's safe returns which is is the crazy part so I'm going to do 14 contracts here because I already have or no I'm going to do 10 contracts here I I already know I have some contracts um already but let's go for 40 cents you know what I'm going to do 41 cents I'm going to show you that you can usually go in between the bid and the ask spread so if you go between the bid and ask spread you'll usually get filled so I did get filled right there we're going to add $49 to the bottom of the screen so um there we go we've collected uh somewhere almost probably five grand at this point in less than like you know around 15 minutes the reason why I like American Airlines is when there's sideways action in in a company but really good volatility that means you're able to collect really good income without really having any risk so again uh I consider all the trades that I made today basically zero risk cuz at worst I will get ass signed a stock that I want to own anyway so in my opinion this is like this is just proof this is this is the step-by-step guide where you can make consistent income uh very safely if you guys want to see me do live coaching or you want a one-on-one session with me I am now a one-on-one coach so feel free to check out the link in the description and I'll catch you guys in the next one,1.0,0.8

your time avjo JP Morgan xon mobile Proctor and Gamble Johnson and Johnson Home Depot AB uh Walmart I'll also be talking about Apple Nvidia in this video and then I'm going to give you a list of growing uh dividend payers so let me just go into avj real quick so so yeah let's go into avj by the way my portfolio is almost at 3.4 million dollar like what an insane how insane is that like week after week you guys see me growing my portfolio transparently here on YouTube we're up $221,000 pre-market right now like insane insane we're doing so well and I'm happy that I'm the only transparent guy I'm showing you my wins and my losses guys I'm showing you everything I'm not shy I'm not shy to show my wins and losses when I have tough times I admit it but right now times are beautiful and guys I do one-on-one coaching now so I have a Discord but I'm not selling a Discord I'm not going for the masses I'm going for one-on-one coaching working individually with folks which is very tough because we have no spots right now but when we have spots click the link in the description right now it's it's busy so broadcom okay $173 per share now look I don't currently have any shares my portfolio is full I have a lot of high quality stocks I have Nvidia guys I have just lots of high quality companies that my money is busy with okay that's a good thing I like avgo but my money's busy at the moment so I can't really do a whole lot however I'm going to show you if the market was open let me get my computer here and U if the market was open let me back up here give you guys a good view of the biceps and the triceps and the and the money here so that's that's what matters guys we want to we want to make more money safely okay it's very clear because what you want to do in finance in general okay a lot of people get this wrong the whole point of doubling your dividend is that you want safe income you want safe passive consistent in that's what my whole channel is about safe passive consistent income you know that's that's my slogan and that's because that's what I've been doing for a very long time I've been traveling the world I've been able to make consistent income I am not interested in making $5,000 one day and then losing uh $2,000 the next I have zero interest in that what I'm trying to do is I've hit all my goals but my original goal was just to make $110,000 a month then I bumped it up to $20,000 a month and obviously my portfolio is doing a lot more than that but that is a habit that I have formed over many years to just be consistently selling options okay look if you want a double dividend broadcom you buy 100 shares and then you go to trade avj options and I would simply go to sell call option again I did say quarterly is the best you could go for monthly options you can go for every two week options you do you but I'm telling you right now if you want less management if you want passive income just go for three months there's nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with that at all all right you can even go for month so look January 17 2025 on avjo at 173 I would go go to let's say 180 okay the Delta here is very high it's kind of crazy it's actually kind of good because avjo is at 173 this covered call is at 180 which gives you that upside plus the premium is huge $13 are you kidding me that's like a 7% return on the 100 share so if you buy 100 shares you're going to be putting up $117,000 in capital right you have 100 shares now most people just hold 100 shares and not much happens but if you're selling covered calls beautiful you're collecting income so $1,300 on 177,000 is getting to that 8% or so right I'm kind of doing the math in my head but this is a very high return let me go over the other I have 10 stocks on this list by the way so first of all avjo the reason why I like it is it has high volatility which means High premiums okay this is the first stock on my list for a reason because it is a little bit more exciting to have evj due to higher volatility like you can see here the high the the volatility is 39 which I would say isn't massively high but it's also very good right in the volume is very good at 291 so the Delta right here just tells you that a lot of people are bullish on avjo so even an out ofth money option is going for 50 Delta so bracom is known for technological innovation which obviously causes a lot of price swings okay this is a top S&amp;P 500 company makes it a blue chip stock very safe that is why I like it for many reasons now guys you can also go for a little bit closer to the money you can go for a 175 covered call you can go for October 18 okay I said monthly options are completely fine go for month L options I think nothing wrong with that all right so look this is $1,300 in January but you can also go for um October October 18 now I've said this many times the third Friday of every month is the best option to trade it is a traditional expiration don't ask me why it's a traditional expiration I don't know but the third Friday of every month is the best expiration okay so October 18 you can easily do this at 175 you can see here how in 24 days it's $600 on $177,000 so that's essentially a 3% return in 24 days with a little bit of upside right cuz from 173 to 175 you have like a124 worth of upside so in total $7 on7 which is it's really $700 on 177,000 that's a fantastic return",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,ybNVhJijauE,2024-09-24T23:24:56Z,Double Your Dividends From Stocks With This Easy Options Strategy,JP Morgan,by the way here's the list of stocks just so I don't again waste your time avjo JP Morgan xon mobile Proctor and Gamble Johnson and Johnson Home Depot AB uh Walmart I'll also be talking about Apple Nvidia in this video and then I'm going to give you a list of growing uh dividend payers The next stock I want to get into is going to be JP Morgan so I'm going to show you JP Morgan right now guys with the lowering of interest rates by the way more businesses are going to be uh borrowing money and because they're going to be borrowing money that's going to mean more fees for The Banks Banks are just intermediary and being an intermediary is very profitable it's very easy for uh for a bank just to rake in those fees right unfortunately not unfortunately that's good for the economy and the business but I don't really like paying all the fees myself but you know I pay them I pay them these Banks make good fees they they borrow money for low rates and they lend them out that's how Banks work right so the bank the banking sector is very stable obviously I worked for Goldman Sachs that was a phenomenal experience onto the inside of how Finance Works how trading Works majority of my time was spend just doing option research because that's been my hobby my interest since I was like 19 years old um and it's funny not to ramble I'm getting to the point here but the way I got into option trading was because I enjoyed playing poker and poker and option trading are very similar because decision-making skills there are similar look JP Morgan this is a Cornerstone of the banking industry right we got the phenomenal CEO phenomenal CEO and JP Morgan stock is less likely to have extreme moves right so if you take a look at 3mon uh performance right here this is very stable performance this this is what makes this a good double dividend stock you own the stock JP Morgan is currently paying a 2% annual yield which is nothing to write home about nothing crazy however it becomes quote unquote crazy right when you start selling covered calls when you start selling covered calls you can turn this 2% dividend and this isn't like even double you can literally every quarter make 2 3% so you're really like 5x in the dividend on JP Morgan and you can easily collect let's see how much you can collect So currently it's at $1 here's the good news we don't know what the stock market is going to do right in the short term right we never know in the long term we know high quality companies are going to rise in value that's a very simple equation now for a uh short term we don't know but by selling covered calls we actually give ourselves a margin of safety which is something that Warren Buffett talks about I'm going to the January 17 here Warren Buffett is obviously someone I've studied you can't go to finance school you can't get an economics degree and work on Wall Street without studying Warren Buffett I read all his books okay all his books I read he talks about the simple concept of margin of safety what that means is you want to buy a stock for at least roughly 15% margin of safety meaning if a stock is $100 in the stock market and you don't you think it's worth $100 you would want to buy that stock at $85 makes logical sense right you want a discount we all like discounts however we don't know what that value is Right unless you sit down and do the research you can't trust no body at all really at the end of the day you must do your own research into what you think the stock is worth don't listen to other people there's a reason why Warren Buffett does not live in New York City because there's too many people with opinions okay opinions are good and very bad at the same time okay you want to make sure you have a qualified Source most people are not qualified and the qualified people are not on YouTube for the most part okay so do your research but if you don't know the perfect price to buy a stock here's the good news selling covered calls gives you a margin of safety let's say you don't know what JP Morgan is worth if it's a fair price to pay 211 to be honest I don't know right now if it's a good price to to pay 211 however if I'm going to sell an option right at the money right which is it's at $211 I'm going to show you a little bit of a unique example right now if I were to sell an in the money option and in the money option at 210 okay the Stock's at 211 I'm going in the money at 210 why does this make sense because first of all I'm collecting $12 and uh my break even is it says 222 but I want you to think about it a little bit differently if you buy shares right now and you get $12 it's $211 average cost minus subtract out the premium that you get paid of $12 now we're at a per share average cost of $199 you tell me do you have to be a genius to to do this you you tell me do you have to know if JP Morgan is a phenomenal deal at 2 211 no because now you've collected premium and you can see that the stock is below 200 average cost so whatever the stock will be worth in the next 30 days it's probably probably let me expand the option here probably more than likely okay it's not going to be below 200 it can be but if it is you have a margin of safety so you don't have to be a genius you don't have to know where the stock market is going this double dividend strategy right here gets you $ anyways I've spent too much time on JP Morgan I'm rambling about whole bunch of stuff here let me go to the next stock,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,ybNVhJijauE,2024-09-24T23:24:56Z,Double Your Dividends From Stocks With This Easy Options Strategy,Nvidia,"by the way here's the list of stocks just so I don't again waste your time avjo JP Morgan xon mobile Proctor and Gamble Johnson and Johnson Home Depot AB uh Walmart I'll also be talking about Apple Nvidia in this video and then I'm going to give you a list of growing uh dividend payers I have a lot of high quality stocks I have Nvidia guys I have just lots of high quality companies that my money is busy with okay that's a good thing I like avgo but my money's busy at the moment so I can't really do a whole lot you can hit it at the park with one of my picks Nvidia that's that's number one if you want the highest income go for NVIDIA Nvidia Tesla Tesla has been on an absolute Terror recently just go for that this is going to be a little bit more safer although Exon Mobile if you look at the 3-month results 6% again this looks like JP Morgan it literally looks the same the chart is different but the return is about the same so imagine building yourself a portfolio of 10 companies that I'm going to be covering in this video that are more or less getting you a three-month return a 5% 6% then you have covered calls making another you know 2 3% for 3 months then you have a dividend payment of 0.5% what's xon Mobile's dividend it's 3.24 so in 3 month in a quarter it would be about 75 basis points or about actually 81 basis points cuz 81 is 1/4 of 3.24 so yeah I was pretty good at math I did a lot of math stuff I was I have an analytics degree so anyways it doesn't take a genius to do that but any I don't even know cracking myself up sometimes how I go off topic let's stick to the point xon mobile Ray company you buy 100 shares you sell a covered call I would straight up go for 40 Delta or very high Delta go for you know you can see the bottom here was 109 it's at 118 go for a 118 nothing wrong with that just just go for 118 covered call xon mobile for me oil prices are very stable and it's a good way to fight inflation we got we got got Liars in the in the senate or whatever guys the the inflation is is BS the inflation is actually much much higher I made a recent video how it's too funny it's too funny they'll tell US inflation isn't that high but the CPI the basket of stocks that they use they'll switch out guys they they'll they'll switch out out beef for chicken because it's a substitute okay I have an economics degree uh in in the CPI how they report inflation they look at a basket of goods they look at Transportation they look at education they look at uh food they look at housing right they will try to switch that basket up and give it different weightings okay so they'll take uh they'll take beef right which has grown by let's say 18% in a year and chicken has grown by 3% they'll switch out beef for chicken they'll say Hey you know inflation is not that high it's it's all right you know people go from the more expensive Goods to um the cheaper Goods when inflation is high right that's a it's a substitute it's called a substitute right they substitute one for the other guys I don't know about you but I want to eat my steak I don't want to eat chicken if I don't want to eat chicken why are they forcing me in the CPI to go from beef to chicken it it makes no sense so uh be careful you guys need to make more money because inflation is high all right and when we look at something like Exxon Mobile the commodity of oil and gas is going to keep doing well all right oil and gas is a good commodity that will hold its price same with gold right same with gold oil and gas you need something like a Chevron like an Exxon Mobile go for the 40 Delta and collect really good income and this is also perfect candidate to sell cover calls because stock is less likely to break through the covered call strike because yeah it's bullish but it's not hugely bullish right the momentum isn't that strong in in uh in oil and gas so it's a very slow and steady return again plus dividends plus covered calls easy money right easy money next one and um I think you guys get the point I'm going to go a little bit faster now Proctor and Gamble consumer staples are slow movers which makes it very powerful for the d double dividend strategy Proctor and Gamble a stable company with slower price growth um it's obviously in the consumer staples uh sector guys I'm a big fan of tech sector obviously I cover Tech all the time I was a software analyst on Wall Street I like Brands and consumer discretionary there's a difference all right there's consumer disc questionary which is going to be your Starbucks your Nike uh stuff like that the brands the person more of the personal Brands um I would argue Apple could go in there although apple is technology right and then you have your Consumer Staples your uh you know the detergent the the toilet cleaner the the stuff for your you know toothpaste for your teeth this stuff is what human beings have to use whether they got money they don't have money whether you're in America whether you're in Tokyo whether you're in the streets of Bangladesh or or you're in Kolkata India it doesn't matter people are going to be probably brushing their teeth regardless of of income right so these are the companies that make money next stock on the list is going to be Johnson and Johnson the again Healthcare consumer staple this is a defensive play guys as the market is somewhat expensive I'm having a difficult time in my live coaching sessions in Discord right now because um I don't have a whole lot of opportunities to trade I'm already fully invested and as the stocks reach their peaks and their highs I don't have too much to invest I I I don't don't so I'm looking at more defensive plays um I was working with uh one of my one-on-one students Phil and he basically he wanted to set up a retirement for his grandkids and I told him look you have a a sixf figure multi sixf figureure portfolio he has five grandchildren so Phil wants to set up $2,500 for each of his five grandchildren I said look I think you just need to have a little bit of defensive in your portfolio because if you want to save passive income which is through dividends through covered calls you want to just set up in some defensive play so we we gave him Johnson and Johnson and if you take a look at Johnson and Johnson let me go to J&amp;J you'll see that uh the return is very stable the Dividends are very high so again so let me go to year to date on this one the years to date is 4% so this is very stable obviously Phil wants to just set up just safe income for his grandchildren he doesn't want any variability CU he doesn't basically here's what he said he doesn't want to have to like set his grandkids up for Life he's not that rich he just has multiple six figures and he wants enough income for his grandchildren to not worry about their like basic needs you know what I mean like he's not going to pay for college he doesn't have enough money for their college education but he wants to set up something so his grandkids are you know less less stressed about their finances and stuff like that so I said look JP uh JP Morgan's fantastic and Johnson and Johnson's also fantastic because we have a 3% dividend yield and you can actually set up even even every six months covered calls so let me go to six months covered calls we're making a long video guys because I have a lot of ideas here all right so guys I'm going to go to I'm going to go like 200 days out in April 2025 look we can go for uh the 165 covered call this isn't banking your your your money like crazy this is not not like crazy income but look8 $8 is a basically a 5% return you get the JP Morgan dividend which is going to be one and a half% uh so that's six and a half% and you have a little bit of upside you have a178 C of upside so you can make 78% return on the safest play ever like literally this is a bond like it's just going up now uh let's go into more of my uh other plays that that are going to give you a little bit more income all right um uh I want to go over Walmart so Walmart let me go into my portfolio guys I I killed it with Walmart I killed it all right let me go to Walmart if I click into Walmart right here you will notice that um I am up 56% on Walmart 56% guys who said that you need highrisk growth stocks to make money you don't you can go for the safe boring stocks like Walmart and literally you can literally make as you see on my screen 56% $175,000 I am holding Walmart for less than one year yes I have a sizable position however it is pretty much multiple six figures on multiple six figures the return is high I caught Walmart at $51.90 cents per share and I'm very proud of this play because it demonstrates how you can have nonvolatile stocks go up a lot if you buy for the correct price okay it took a long time I did a lot of research and I realized that the digital revenues on Walmart are very good so I'm doing covered calls I have an 81 covered call it just broke through my covered call here so I'm running essentially the double div strategy myself and I've made 56% in a year on the double dividend strategy I will admit I did not always have covered calls on Walmart I did let these shares run because I personally like the momentum on Walmart and I allowed it to run a little bit higher all right I wanted to cover dividend growth there's so many things I want to teach you in this video I'm so pumped up guys I'm so pumped up to teach you and level you up look there's an ETF vdigx the reason why I want to look at it is because the performance is very stable over 10 years it's 11% which is the market return however if you were to do this plus covered calls you can probably get closer um you can get more more income for sure so let me go into the Holdings here because I want to point something out look consumer discretionary here we here we have right here it's uh 10% of the of the fund Consumer Staples financials Healthcare um it's it's pretty balanced right infot teac is 15.5 look you can also run double dividence on the higher growth stocks Microsoft Apple United Health we have Honeywell we have McDonald's Visa Texas Instruments um I would also be running on on these equities right here all right now I guess I guess the best idea that I have just period point blank is going to be Nvidia um Nvidia is going to be the highest um double dividend strategy although I'll be honest with you this is a little bit sneaky this is sneaky of me I'm being sneaky right now because Nvidia has a dividend but it's 0.02% so this is technically a double dividend strategy this is technically 100x this is a 100x dividend strategy I'm not Gna clickbait with that I imagine I click baited on my on my title 100x your dividends it would be true it would be true though because um the dividend here is so small I can just joke like that but I'm not going to joke I don't want to click bait I'm going to be honest the dividend here is very low so I'm being sneaky uh here you can 100 x your dividend obviously this is just regular covered call it's just funny because in video pays PS like I don't even know why do they even introduce a dividend that is so low I think they just wanted to say were dividend paying stock but it's like it's like a uh it's like if I said I donate to charity and I donated five sets I I I donate my mom she helps with the shelter with animals and I donate but it's definitely more than 5 cents all right I think it's funny when a millionaire or someone Rich donates a dollar they're like oh I donate it's like dude you donate but let's let's donate a little bit something meaningful same thing with Nvidia it's not a meaningful dividend but uh straight up I'm making really good money selling puts obviously the the title of this video is more so the double dividend strategy and related to covered calls so I would I would sell covered calls on Nvidia I I would I would easily sell covered calls on Nvidia I just already have a lot of Nvidia shares in both my portfolios so on Nvidia look the options are bombs they're bombs guys I would be buying Nvidia hand over fist you know bicep over tricep this stock is my number one pick it's the number one stock that I would say you got to be invested in it's it's it's a really good stock growing everything's on point I've already made videos on Nvidia so check out this channel if you want more Nvidia videos I've already done my full analysis here just getting to the point you got a 10% return in a little over three and a half months get 10% return every quarter that's 40% return per year on a high quality company you have $3 of upside this is the highest growth pick that I have in this video all right obviously Nvidia a in GPU dominance all right Nvidia is a leader in the semiconductor industry particularly in gpus uh AI gaming data centers autonomous vehicles this is the strongest intermediary I don't know if they're fully intermediary I don't know if I can say Nvidia is fully intermediary but this company provides chips that are essential I'm going to say it's essential to life because I know a lot of healthcare companies that save lives also Nvidia yeah it's rapid growth is high to exponential rise in demand for AI and technology and data processing and it's a key player so going to do covered calls on Nvidia is just the biggest no-brainer ever and um if you want to manage your portfolio properly um you want to have higher risk stocks too even if you're already retired even if you're like hey I'm good I have enough income why not make some more why not make some more income and have some exposure into a higher volatility higher income play like Nvidia so the simple answer answer is I would if you can't afford it I would dollar cost average into the high quality companies and higher growth companies like Nvidia like apple I have a whole lot of Apple guys you missed the boat you missed the boat you guys all clicking videos on just palente here and you're watching every YouTuber talk about palente here for the 50th time while I'm here making $328,000 on Apple I called Apple from the very beginning if you're invested in another Well paler did very well so I can't talk trash I have paler but I'm just saying too many of you guys are focused on the wrong stocks if you're not getting returns that are like five figures or six figures and you have a decent Siz portfolio you're not listening to the right videos you're not taking the right action having simple stocks like apple doing double dividends I don't currently have covered calls on Apple they just expired actually on um on Friday on Friday like last Last Friday they expired and I haven't sold any covered calls yet but I will be I'll be selling some covered calls and making a lot of money basically just selling covered calls and and consistently just collecting in income on high quality companies guys I don't even know what else to tell you my my one-on-one coaching is is is full I'm just telling you all this free stuff that you must copy must use for yourself this is so simple you don't need to pay anyone you don't need to smash any like buttons I would I would appreciate it if you subscribe that would be fantastic because you can see my videos but you don't need to buy nothing you don't need to do anything just do this one thing and you'll make income and you don't even need to watch 100 videos on YouTube I'm just telling you the truth I want you guys to level up your lives financially your personal life and in all areas because that's what I love doing I'm a coach for a reason I love self-improvement and I love just helping other people it grow and improve all right so you don't have to do nothing don't click no links on this video I don't need anything I want you to make more money for you to be happy and for us to just continue on this journey I'm blessed I'm happy I love what I do so um just do double dividends do covered calls and uh watch more videos on the channel if you want so catch you guys in the next one and have a fantastic rest of your week",1.0,1.0

financials Healthcare um it's it's pretty balanced right infot teac is 15.5 look you can also run double dividence on the higher growth stocks Microsoft Apple United Health we have Honeywell we have McDonald's Visa Texas Instruments um I would also be running on on these equities right here all right now I guess I guess the best idea that I have just period point blank is going to be Nvidia um Nvidia is going to be the highest um double dividend strategy although I'll be honest with you this is a little bit sneaky this is sneaky of me I'm being sneaky right now because Nvidia has a dividend but it's 0.02% so this is technically a double dividend strategy this is technically 100x this is a 100x dividend strategy I'm not Gna clickbait with that I imagine I click baited on my on my title 100x your dividends it would be true it would be true though because um the dividend here is so small I can just joke like that but I'm not going to joke I don't want to click bait I'm going to be honest the dividend here is very low so I'm being sneaky uh here you can 100 x your dividend obviously this is just regular covered call it's just funny because in video pays PS like I don't even know why do they even introduce a dividend that is so low I think they just wanted to say were dividend paying stock but it's like it's like a uh it's like if I said I donate to charity and I donated five sets I I I donate my mom she helps with the shelter with animals and I donate but it's definitely more than 5 cents all right I think it's funny when a millionaire or someone Rich donates a dollar they're like oh I donate it's like dude you donate but let's let's donate a little bit something meaningful same thing with Nvidia it's not a meaningful dividend but uh straight up I'm making really good money selling puts obviously the the title of this video is more so the double dividend strategy and related to covered calls so I would I would sell covered calls on Nvidia I I would I would easily sell covered calls on Nvidia I just already have a lot of Nvidia shares in both my portfolios so on Nvidia look the options are bombs they're bombs guys I would be buying Nvidia hand over fist you know bicep over tricep this stock is my number one pick it's the number one stock that I would say you got to be invested in it's it's it's a really good stock growing everything's on point I've already made videos on Nvidia so check out this channel if you want more Nvidia videos I've already done my full analysis here just getting to the point you got a 10% return in a little over three and a half months get 10% return every quarter that's 40% return per year on a high quality company you have $3 of upside this is the highest growth pick that I have in this video all right obviously Nvidia a in GPU dominance all right Nvidia is a leader in the semiconductor industry particularly in gpus uh AI gaming data centers autonomous vehicles this is the strongest intermediary I don't know if they're fully intermediary I don't know if I can say Nvidia is fully intermediary but this company provides chips that are essential I'm going to say it's essential to life because I know a lot of healthcare companies that save lives also Nvidia yeah it's rapid growth is high to exponential rise in demand for AI and technology and data processing and it's a key player so going to do covered calls on Nvidia is just the biggest no-brainer ever and um if you want to manage your portfolio properly um you want to have higher risk stocks too even if you're already retired even if you're like hey I'm good I have enough income why not make some more why not make some more income and have some exposure into a higher volatility higher income play like Nvidia so the simple answer answer is I would if you can't afford it I would dollar cost average into the high quality companies and higher growth companies like Nvidia like apple I have a whole lot of Apple guys you missed the boat you missed the boat you guys all clicking videos on just palente here and you're watching every YouTuber talk about palente here for the 50th time while I'm here making $328,000 on Apple I called Apple from the very beginning if you're invested in another Well paler did very well so I can't talk trash I have paler but I'm just saying too many of you guys are focused on the wrong stocks if you're not getting returns that are like five figures or six figures and you have a decent Siz portfolio you're not listening to the right videos you're not taking the right action having simple stocks like apple doing double dividends I don't currently have covered calls on Apple they just expired actually on um on Friday on Friday like last Last Friday they expired and I haven't sold any covered calls

Invest with Henry,0J_pR9NKLYw,2024-09-21T20:07:00Z,Tom Lee: THESE Stocks Are About to EXPLODE,Tom Lee,Tom Lee explained how the FED cutting its rates will set up the market for the next two to three months to have very wild returns. I guess then the risk to this Tom is that inflation comes back. I want to say that um Tom Lee believes that the recent fed fund rate cut is going to be Paving for a strong performance in the next shortterm one to three months. Lee advises basically that investors should focus on cyclical sectors like Industrials financials small cap which I don't really agree with. I'm going to have to disagree with Mr Tom Lee on the small cap stuff but he was saying that expects there to be an outperformance and economic recovery. while tech stocks like Max seven the group remains solid Lee believes that cyclicals have more room to grow. I am bullish on Industrials as is Tom Lee because of the cyclical nature of them. Chipotle let me talk about Chipotle real quick cuz when you look at stocks that are cyclical which Tom Lee said that he wants he thinks it's going to be a really good three months which I agree with guys I'm a bull. I mainly agree with Tom Lee I think that if you want to navigate this Market properly look at the cyclical stocks pick the right positions enter for for a decent price and sell covered calls for income.,1.0,0.5

I think those folks have to allocate into SI stocks especially small caps because they are not only sensitive to the cut in rates because of variable rate debt but they're going to benefit from the cyclical boost to the economy is it's mortgages the cost of mortgages drop auto loans credit cards LIF to the consumer potential m&a all these are Big Tailwinds for small caps.

Invest with Henry,W_22zOIP0NU,2024-09-19T20:07:00Z,Why I'm Buying Palantir to Get Rich in 2025,Palantir,"I'm going to show you exactly how I made $71,000 on paler there are a lot of people saying that paler is a great stock but I'm going to show you how to make real money on it in this video. In this video I'm going to be cover Palance here some news that is out there on the stock some technical analysis some fundamental analysis. I'm going to show you how I've been printing money on pal here. I'm going to show you how to actually print money with the wheel strategy on Palante here because look selling options on Palante here has literally been easy money. Just look at the stock okay over the past month this stock is up 14.87%. If you've been selling put options to enter the stock bad news you haven't been assigned that's kind of crazy right you have not been assigned that means you've been collecting a lot of income. If you have shares you're also selling covered calls with covered calls I've also been printing money. However the challenge is as paler keeps going up you have to roll up your call, the reason you have to roll it up is because you will lose your shares and we don't really want to lose shares of Palance here. I'm going to show you the technical charts on Palance here and by the way the CEO brilliant The Innovation on pal here amazing. Everything about Palance here I stand behind Innovation AI the trend the the company's fundamentals. Let's go into my paler position, it's still the same paler position that I've had for a long time now, not much has changed. I have 5,000 shares, I'm looking to acquire guys, the problem is I'm not able to acquire because the stock keeps going up. Although it's profitable it has been slightly underperforming on paler, the best strategy on paler has just been buying stock and holding on to stock and huddling it. That's what's been working for Palante here. If you look at pal here in the past 3 months this stock is up 47%. In this portfolio I have 5,000 shares I have sold some put options which have done phenomenally well. I think this is going to be a $50 stock in 2025 the next 12 to 18 months. Let's take a look at the fundamentals real quick, let's go to statistics okay. The market cap $78 billion, we're approaching 100 billion I think we'll cross 100 billion in 2025. We have a peeg ratio 1.8 that is pretty low, 1.8 is pretty good. Price of sales 33 that's a little bit on the high end but all of these metrics are high because they're growing fast. Expensive today in terms of valuation could look expensive today is not expensive tomorrow, it's not because as this company grows as it doubles Revenue as it gains more government contracts it's pretty clear that they're going to do that. They have wild connections they have great brand and once paler gets their software in a company they they just can't get away because the cost is too high. Paler is very smart Paler is genius once they get in with their software it's kind of game over because getting in costs money relationship management very strong once they get in the switch cost is is very high. Imagine implementing a software for multiple months into your organization under a contract which is you know some of their contracts are 100 million right multiple eight figures maybe nine figures. Once you make that decision you're a lifer, you're a paleron as Alex Carr put it right in his recent video. So once you're a palyan you're a palyan. So these metrics that I'm looking at are cake they look high Ford PE ratio 83 guess what I'm willing to bet that in a year it'll be 40 in another year it might be 25 in another year might be 15. All of a sudden palen here in a few years can be cheaper of course if the stock stays the same and it doesn't grow in value it can be cheaper on a PE ratio than the S&amp;P 500. The price is going to go up the price will go up to adjust for growth. The profit margin guys paler is a service-based business in many ways because they have lots of employees and those employees are going on you know side they're are implementing their Consulting their service so they're not exactly SAS. I would consider Palante here fairly high-profit margin. If you look at pound here we're at 16% so things are looking pretty good. This company has obviously entered into the S&amp;P 500 so yeah things are looking really good. The cash here is 4 billion the total debt 258 million this is very rare guys very rare to see a company have a lot of cash this is Apple level quality almost Apple level quality. Use Palance here use it and exploit it. For me Palante here is that I've been covering it since IPO guys. Paler is one of the easiest stocks to make money because of the Innovation because of leadership and because the options are very profitable. I'm going to go back to palent here. This is so simple you don't have to buy a course you don't have to do anything you don't have to pay for anything everything is free look go to December sell a I would go for 30 this is a 5% return 5% literally beautiful return. You'll never lose the full amount on a sell put it's impossible. Is pound here going to zero no it's not going to zero is it going to $10 no probably not is it going to 20 probably not is it going to 30 maybe if it goes to 30 though the Chan is looking at the Delta are .23 so there's a 23% chance that paler will grow 30 but would you be happy to buy it at 30 I hope that you're not in your head yes because that would be a good deal. I'm showing you how to get paid to enter Palante here because this strategy is so simple. If you look at the 30 strike here for pal here you can collect $177 for January passively easily. Pound tier top tier stock. I think it's important to understand when to get into pal here although I would argue that 30 is huge support massive support because we got a huge bounce off of 30 a huge bounce there was so much buying action here if I scroll in you can see that the volume was very high and we just jumped from 30 to 3460. I'm saying that the new support level uh for pal here will be $30 per share.",1.0,0.95

All of a sudden Palantir in a few years can be cheaper of course if the stock stays the same and it doesn't grow in value it can be cheaper on a PE ratio than the S&P 500, which would be very weird. Why would a company growing fast be cheaper than S&P 500? It wouldn't. That's why the PE Ratio is going to adjust because the price is going to go up, the price will go up to adjust for growth.

looks like the tech Giants future is at risk as a smartphone market runs out of steam so that's what NYU Stern Professor ashwath deadrin hopefully I pronounced the name right said about the smartphone market he's saying it's in big trouble and apple is my biggest position guys so in this video I'm going to cover Apple's options my large position which makes up 55% of my portfolio because I'm rethinking my entire position on Apple I'm rethinking it so I want to not waste your time let's watch your clip real quick I'm sick that's why my voice sounds different sorry about that let's watch a clip about Apple and after the clip I'm going to show you my portfolio and how I'm trading options let's start with apple uh the obvious uh I mean many people said okay once they yes they went through this rebirth once you get iPhones in everyone's hand what's the the metric go here a billion install base the stock is a buy massive BuyBacks what can go wrong um talk a little bit about what you think is going on here Apple's been a middle-aged company now for a decade I mean this is a new it's uh I think once we got people out of flip phones into smartphones it became a question of you know really hitting you know middle middle single digit growth I mean you get these puts around new updates but it's been a middle-aged company I think the problem though is the smartphone business seems to be running out of juice I'm stuck on the iPhone 12 I don't even have the slightest desire to even look at the iPhone 16 because not enough is different about each version of this and apple gets about 75% of its value from the iPhone now it's become heavily invested in the iPhone and the subsequent updates which means you're going to live through these update to update know Rec Corrections around the price so doesn't surprise me that people are a little disappointed but I looking longterm my bigger concern is what if the smartphone business itself starts to go into decline I mean we can argue that it already has the Bulls would say it's all about service is it's all about subscriptions and it's all about stock BuyBacks but not to put too fine a point on it what do you think the stock is worth here no I don't think the stock is massively overvalued in anywh but I do think that all of those things are good but you're trying to fill in a really big space I mean you can add the services business but the amount of money that Apple makes on its iPhones is so immense that making up for it is not going to be easy even even with three new businesses so the services business and the ecosystem that they app has to be dramatically large for it to make up for the iPhone and that's always going to be a concern when you invest in Apple as for the BuyBacks that's really not an alternative just is a return of cash and Apple has been very good about returning cash for much of the last decade I think collectively Apple has returned more than 600 billion in cash over the last decade which makes it the greatest cash machine in history so I like the company as a cash machine but not as a growth engine yeah and I think even at 188 you were saying look you know it's at 215 now we're in the neighborhood of Fairly valued not dramatically over but also not dramatically under and a lot of people are probably just going to I thought it was interesting that Burkshire sold half of their position You'd think this is the kind just sit on it forever I think that was their intention does does that sale tell you there's anything else that the margin that could really go wrong I I wish I would read a signal about Berkshire had way thinking apple is overvalued I think the reality was B was with 30% of its portfolio as Apple wow I think it was just a concentration issue which when you have a third of your portfolio trapped in one company it's a very dangerous place for anybody to be so I think the pruning really reflected that over concentration I hear you but I hear munger's words echoing in my ears when he says you don't want to you know spread you don't want you spread your eggs in different baskets you want to put them all in one basket and then watch it very carefully so I I would view that concentration as a is a as a benefit almost and and in the counter I would have to Charlie is you know I remember when he said that at his meeting would have been would you take 30% of your money now and buy anyone's stock no matter how great it is and at w youd say no so it almost seems like we have two sets of rules one for Investments we're going to make and one for Investments we've already made I think we need to be consistent no that's very interesting by the way he's hardly alone or they are in facing that kind of dilemma which a lot of investors run into I'm currently up $231,000 and this is a very big position for me of 55% on my portfolio I'm holding 7,800 shares at an average cost of $186 per share now look on Apple I have two different positions I have the 215 sell put which is expiring literally immediately and the 230 covered call which is also expiring immediately as I'm making this video now I need to do something here but I will explain to you why I'm not going to make a trade yet today first I'm going to let this option expire on 920 which is essentially tomorrow then I have a 230 covered call which also is going to expire essentially tomorrow I'm not worried at all for for Apple 215 and I'm looking to get assigned see the thing is and here's a key point that I got from the clip the greatest cash machine in history is Apple that's exactly what the stern professor said right he said that it's the greatest cash machine but it's not the greatest growth engine right now that's his exact words he said it's not the greatest growth engine which is fine with me guys we're looking for safe passive consistent income selling options that's what my brand is about that's what I been doing for years now okay so with a $100,000 portfolio or more if you're generating 3% a month that's fine that's a strong secondary source of income before you know it you get your portfolio 300K 500k you're making 3% 3% of 300K is $9,000 a month that is a fantastic income so I'm looking for consistency I don't care if uh Apple is no longer a growth engine you can make really good money off of the options from just telling them as you can see here 2155 230 Apple's almost at 215 I am not worried at all because I would like to buy more Apple even though I am cautious on Apple to some extent I I agree with NYU St Professor what he said that it's not a growth engine but this is still a cash cow apple has a lot of strong suits okay look it is true birkshire hathway reduced their position that is a troubling sign but they reduced their position they they didn't close their position and I can see why you would want to reduce your position since Apple did go up a lot it has become less attractive however less attractive doesn't mean bad okay if you look at uh Charlie Munger okay this is very interesting because Warren Buffett you know originally bought apple he bought it due to Brand due to the consistent cash flow um Charlie Monger he believes in concentration he says concentration is a benefit guys I've kind of been saying on this channel that I go against the grain I'm conservative and I look at unique opportunities in the market in trading and I go against what a majority of other people say and that's because I have a degree in this stuff I actually studied this stuff so I'm not necessarily looking to be more on the marketing side I'm looking to actually give you tips that make you money because I know if I make you money I feel good I feel good it goes well with my faith I'm I'm happy okay I want to get results I'm not looking to be pretty I'm not looking to get cute with it I'm going to be honest you don't need to have 50 stocks in your portfolio you don't need a whole lot of diversification if you have the top brands the top stocks you only need 10 stocks you can just run covered calls you can just sell puts and Charlie Monger said that concentration is a benefit he said you don't you can have a few eggs in your basket and pay very close attention to that basket I love that Apple's brand LA loyalty is unmatched with over a billion active devices creating a massive stable customer base that consistently drives the man guys and for me apple look I'm going to show you what I would do right now I'm going to go to trade Apple options here here's some things I would do if you don't have apple first of all I would just sell some put options I would just go to January 17 2025 I would easily just sell and like let's see let's take a look 200 strike price here 24 Delta this is pretty good the return here is 22% this is not a huge return so maybe I would go for 205 this is just a 3% return this is not huge and it is sometime but uh look you can do two things you can basically run what I call I mean this is actually a legit strategy it's called a coverage strangle all right coverage strangle so look this how it works basically you can sell some some put options looking to get assigned all right uh this will give you a really good entry into Apple but at the same time you can also uh do some covered calls so let's say buy apple right now you can sell a call and go for a covered call at uh 220 okay if you're looking for safety if you're looking for cushion all right this chart isn't super accurate because we're not showing you having shares so you can't lose money on the upside here this does this is not really true right here and the max loss is not it is not unlimited because uh I'm recommending that you have 100 shares of stock so it'll be a covered call so anyways this is not super accurate but uh it is interesting that you will collect $1,855 worth of premium and um yeah you'll you'll have a sell put 205 and then a 220 covered call so that 220 gives you like $430 of upside plus $12 of Premium I mean this right here essentially if you were to get a signed you have average cost of 205 uh this right here if you buy it at 2570 but you collect $12 are you kidding me $12 that's amazing it's amazing you collect 12 $1,200 in income that means your average cost is 215 minus 12 which is 203 all right so your average cost will be 203 so basically guys I'm showing you how to get apple for 20 203 205 $10 discount $10 discount you're telling me you can't you can't make money when you basically have a high quality great brand top stock sure it's not a growth engine yeah we're not going to get as rich as we are um with trades like Nvidia and palen here I mean I've made so much money on Nvidia and palen here but Apple's also I mean let me let's let's get to the facts all right let's take a look at my Apple position I'm up $230,000 guys listen listen to this also this is going to be really it's going to be really important it has to do with taxes uh I'm not a tax expert but look I have a lot of experience I've made millions of dollars trading and taxes are part of that I pay a good amount of taxes too good all right look $230,000 I can't sell sell Apple if I wanted to isn't that crazy I can't sell Apple even if I wanted to why cuz look my taxes all right yeah I'm a business owner uh I don't really reside in the US most of the year or at all I only go there to visit my family and stuff uh I have an office in Florida so my taxes are let's say about 35ish per 35% or so pretty high taxes um so if I were to sell and realize $230,000 guys 35% 35% of 100K is 35k 200k would be 70k of taxes so 23k would be like 80k of taxes essentially I'm going to lose $80,000 in taxes makes no sense absolutely like stupid for me to sell so even if I didn't like apple even if I was bearish on Apple I can't be 35% bearish 35% like no way Apple's not going to fall 35% maybe uh we could see a pull pull back just like we could see a pullback in all stock market investing I mean we we see that all the time right stocks going Cycles we have interest rate um cut and maybe the market has a little bit of panic maybe we get a pullback 5% but not 35% so when you have a big gain it doesn't really make sense to sell I'm bullish on Apple I think we have a good solid base at $25 per share and I think at 205 you're going to get a long-term return above the market",1.0,0.2

Invest with Henry,hcHdbnoW1_U,2024-09-16T20:07:00Z,"Nvidia Stock (NVDA) is About to Explode, Says Morgan Stanley",Nvidia,"Morgan Stanley analyst just covered Nvidia and he said the unthinkable so I want to go over this clip with you guys and tell you why this is so important joining us right now for more on the company in the sector is Joseph Moore Morgan Stanley's senior semiconductor analyst and uh let me just ask you Joseph what happened this week what what's pushing the momentum One Direction or the other on the stock yeah I think for me the bigger surprise was what happened in the prior couple of weeks you know the quarter was really good uh they beat by $2 billion which has never happened until Nvidia started doing it a year and a half ago and I understand they're wrestling with these expectations issues um you know and there's some gross margin questions that came about but I was really surprised at the selloff this is our top pick demand is very very strong and you know at this point focusing on this sort of product cycles and things like that it's very important we want to see the company execute to that but really the key issue is just the strength of the business and we heard that from Jensen this week at a conference we've heard that from a number now of significant Executives on the customer side how much they're committed to these workloads uh so I think this is still um you know a very compelling story and again to me I I was a little I don't know exactly why it was up this week I don't know why it was down so much last week but the stock is very reasonably valued uh with very good growth prospects here going forward Will Blackwell have lower gross M margins versus Hopper I think maybe a tiny bit uh I think that when the product was launched in March they had sort of discussed some price points um you know on CNBC at one point and that's a little bit unusual I think they're very focused on can we continue to provide value can we continue to grow the market and I think they're probably more focused on that than the specifics of gross margin there's going to be a little bit of pressure here in the next couple of quarters which is really just the early stage of that we're ramping it up there's going to be low yields initially um I think they've sort of said over the full life cycle the grow margins will be similar but they're also expanding the scope of products there's going to be a microprocessor with Grace uh there's going to be an nvlink switch that they sell into these racks there's a lot of things that they're selling that could have a little bit lower gross margin so we have gross margins down by about a point next year uh I don't think it's that big a deal in the context of How High the operating margins are and how much operating leverage there is but I think it is the answer to question is yes it is just a pad lower um but you know that doesn't change the fact that the gross margins are still very good so the stocks just under 120 you've got a $150 price Target on it what's the time frame for that cuz that's another 25% increase even if you think that they could have a a little bit of a rougher time over the next few quarters yeah look it's a 12- month price Target and guys 12month price target for 150 and there was a lot of talk actually about margin so where nvidia's business is and the story of their business I want to point out that I think Nvidia 150 is very reasonable that's actually what I like um about this video right here from Joseph Moore is he's being very realistic and I'm a big fan of selling options and creating consistent passive income and given Nvidia is slightly under 120 and I think it's going to be around 120 for some time this makes it the perfect environment for selling both puts and covered calls on Nvidia which is my bread and butter strategy this is the strategy I've been running for 7even years now so here's the trades that I would make on Nvidia before I finish off with the clip is that I would simply go to trade Nvidia options by the way let me just point out what I already have on Nvidia just to update you guys I have sold put options on Nvidia because I'm looking to acquire shares for cheaper than the current price of Nvidia right so whatever you know Nvidia is at right now 120 if it was 115 it was 110 what I'm personally going to do is I'm going to sell about 30 Delta put options and look for an optimal entry or a cheaper entry than the current price of Nvidia so I'm going to make a little bit longer of a trade here because the price Target is 12 months so there is nothing wrong with just going for a 12 Monon option okay so let's go out and pick September 19 2025 this is very interesting because guys you don't have to trade weekly and monthly to make good income you can just go for an option that expires quarterly or even yearly so this is a little bit of a weird case but I'm going to show you a very interesting twist here a very interesting Twist of how to actually collect income by making one trade per year and collecting a uh a good amount so look because Nvidia is likely to rise from the current price up towards 150 due to what this analyst thinks which I agree with I would probably give Nvidia if I had a guess I would probably say 170 180 in 12 months but let's just say 150 to be more conservative the funny thing is by selling put options these would all work because technically if it goes up you can sell a 118 however I want to give you guys a very interesting perspective to collect a bunch of cash today like literally cash in your account today this would be taxable so this would be the downside it's it's taxable income but I would literally go up and sell a put option for 140 for example just to be conservative here and you can see how I'm essentially going to collect 3.5k of income and I'm going to risk roughly $10,000 now when I say risk this would be a Max loss only if Nvidia went to zero I'm an Nvidia the chances of going down to zero are in my opinion zero they're not going to go to zero okay so by selling a put option I'm saying I'm ready to buy 100 shares and uh that's exactly what I'm going to be doing here so in this example if I go for 140 sellp put I'm going to make 3500 on 10K which is a 35% return in 12 months 35% 12 months going to double and triple the market by selling a safe put I'm I'm saying quotation safe because if Nvidia goes down you're essentially owning 100 shares this is a way to basically get assigned 100 shares so you are putting up the capital you can see the break even here is 104 so it's cheaper than the current stock price of Nvidia because 140 minus the 35 that you're collecting is 105 how would you like to buy Nvidia for $105 per share you know I think that they have a very strong 12- Monon window ahead of us you know the new products that they're shipping Blackwell are effectively U you know accounted for through 2025 so you know the question becomes kind of growth there after and that's when that's the debate it gets a little bit harder for the stock to work for me I like the stock best when there are these near-term issues that they're kind of working through because I have a lot of faith in just how strong this business is and so you know you've seen this a couple of times now over the last year and a half you saw lead times come down in the early part of this year the people sold the stock on that when there was concerned that Blackwell was almost too good and we'd have this kind of uh pause in in Hopper sales that Drew down the stock then we had the delay all those things sort of are great setups because you know you're selling picks and shovels into a gold rush and the strength of the Gold Rush is kind of the main thing here uh it doesn't you know the new products are really important and I want to get them out but you know it doesn't really change how good these numbers are so for me tactically we've liked it better when you have these issues you still have these questions overhanging the stock so I'm not necessarily calling for 150 right away but you know I think these are a good buying opportunity these issues that have been dragging on the stock of late guys craziest thing he said which is the absolute truth is selling picks and shovels wins in a gold rush it's not actually the person digging for gold that wins it's the people selling the pigs and shovels same thing with Nvidia they're not necessarily making all the plays themselves they're providing the opportunity and the chips for all the other AI companies to make the place right their chips are in such high demand that nvidia's revenue is going to keep rising at astonishingly fast rates so I would say don't miss out on Nvidia sell put options do covered calls and run the wheel strategy I have a lot of videos on this channel so make sure that you watch some more videos on my Channel about creating income from highquality companies by selling options.",1.0,0.9

I'm going to be using Nvidia but this is an example if you find a different stock that's at its high meaning it's either at the top of its Binger band it's at a 52 week high or if the RSI is very high those are all indicators that a stock is very expensive so when a stock is expensive you want to use a call Credit spread. Nvidia is also but again I'm going to have to be a lot more safe. I'm all about consistent passive income I do not want to you know put myself In Harm's Way and potentially lose a call current spread which is why I go so low on the delta so check this out if I expand the 530 call right here I'm going above and beyond guys if you think 520 is safe go 525 or 530 go higher on a call Credit spread because you want to be more safe with a call Credit spread we are saying that we don't think the stock will go this High okay in this short of a time period. you would not want to do this on a very bullish stock that you like I like Nvidia but look I want to show you a short-term trade so if I go to sell call option right I'm going to go to an expiration let's say I want to go shortterm I'm going to go for September 20 right here this is a short-term trade but if you're watching this in the future just copy the same thought process and the same logic and just do this over and over again for a stock where you see that it has resistance now for NVIDIA I'll be honest since it has pulled back a lot I'm expecting a bit of a bullish move in the short term however I'm going to show you an interesting way where you can still capitalize you can still go very out of the money so let's go for 116 nope that's too close because that Delta was too high if I go to 120 that's an 11 Delta this is actually a really good way to create income and hedge your position cuz check this out this is going to be lifechanging right if you have a lot of Nvidia you hope that it goes up right a call Credit spread will basically create income and you'll end up profitable at expiration as long as it doesn't go to your strike price so check it out if I sell a 120 call option all right I'm collecting income if Nvidia goes to 110 I'm going to be still fine I'm still collecting income if it goes to 115 and you have an Nvidia position you make a lot of money and you still get the premium that you've collected for the 120 strike price if it goes to 120 you need to close out this call Credit spread of course but you have probably made so much money on the long stock that you have so this is a fantastic way to create income and basically hedge against the position that you have so check it out if I go 120 and then I go 125 the return here is going to be fairly small at $32 and I'm going to be risking I'm putting in quotation I'll explain to you in a second risking about $460 $470 right this is about a 6% return roughly maybe 6.5% return as I'm doing the math in my head 6.5% return in about 11 days so let's just call it 10 days 6% return that's 6% per day guys you're creating 6% of income so that's a lot of money right that is actually a lot of money cuz on a $110,000 portfolio this is going to add up this will really add up now I'm probably going to bet this does not happen cuz 120 is pretty far away it's 11 Delta so you're just going to get income but again if Nvidia goes higher you're going to be making money on the long shares that you have most likely if you're investing in the shares if you have a covered call that's going to be beneficial there's so many strategies here all the strategies that you run a call card spread will help you create more income in your portfolio so I would say that I personally do this all the time I'm trying to maximize my income in my portfolio.",1.0,0.4

I would not do this on spy or QQQ because they're typically bullish.,1.0,0.0

Invest with Henry,--7laF-OZQw,2024-09-09T20:25:25Z,Make Money When Stocks Crash (Call Credit Spreads for Beginners),Meta,I'm going to take a look at meta although we have a Green Day in the market if we take a look at year to dat on meta this is going to be a very good example guys now check this out meta it has had a triple top pattern okay so I'm going to show you an example right now on meta first because actually I'm more bullish that the call Credit spread strategy will work on meta whereas with Nvidia I'm going to have to be a lot more careful now guys listen when you look at the implied volatility of an option if it's high that's good because it gets you more money all right and I'm going to show you why meta is going to be a very good play Nvidia is also but again I'm going to have to be a lot more safe so look meta it peaked right here at 527 and then in July meta again peaked at 539 all right now looking at meta it peaked at 537 just you know a few weeks ago in August now we're in September 2024 and for the next you know 2 weeks 4 weeks 6 8 weeks I really don't think that meta is going to reach an all-time high now that is based on technical analysis I've done the research before this and I can show you specifically what I'm talking about by just pulling up the chart on Yahoo finance all right you don't actually have to be a genius to read the chart and realize here that this purple line that I drew right here this is the top we had a very strong double top in fact I would argue that we had a triple top pattern on meta there is very huge resistance at this level and for that reason if I were to open up a call Credit spread it'd be very easy for me to bet that meta won't go above 520 however I'm going to do a very safe call Credit spread on both meta and on Nvidia right now because I want to be safe and conservative I'm all about consistent passive income I do not want to you know put myself In Harm's Way and potentially lose a call current spread which is why I go so low on the delta so check this out if I expand the 530 call right here I'm going above and beyond guys if you think 520 is safe go 525 or 530 go higher on a call Credit spread because you want to be more safe with a call Credit spread we are saying that we don't think the stock will go this High okay in this short of a time period This is a 4day trade now look this is actually very lucrative to do I'm going to show you right now if I were to sell the 530 okay and then I go ahead and buy the 535 you can see right here that I'm basically making $45 guys on $450 that's about a 10% return in 4 days tell me how you can't get rich and make passive consistent income selling call Credit spreads when the return is 10% so if you understand what you're doing you're going to collect really good income but look this is a 4-day trade and I would say this is a safe as it gets all right if you go out longer you do have or you do run the risk of more things happening until expiration right so if I go to an expiration here and let's say I go to October I'm going to show you a very interesting way to think about this right here to make more money and squeeze out more profits on a smaller portfolio if I were to go to the 530 okay I sell the 530 and then I go ahead and buy the 535 the return right here is going to be $170 now look check it out it's $170 because more stuff can happen from now as I'm making this video until October 18th because more stuff can happen you're going to be getting compensated a greater amount of money since there's more time and more risk you're always getting paid in proportion to the risk that you take guys you make more money when you have higher risk so you need to find balance you need to accurately look at an option and find the correct balance that suits your needs that's what I do in my Discord community and that's what I'm trying to teach you here on YouTube on how to properly open a position manage the position and close the position okay so look for here I would not do this I would not do this on October 18 because October 18 there's a lot more time so I would go higher all right the Delta there was too high if I go to 560 the Delta is still kind of high so if you want to have a lot of consistency you're going to want to go out a little bit further in terms of the strike price all right so let me go out to five 70 Here and Now check it out the Delta is4 that is going to be a lot better of a Delta however I will also point out some really interesting facts here the implied volatility is 30% so 30% implied volatility here is pretty medium all right Nvidia is going to be higher when I go over the Nvidia example the volume here is also very low but luckily check out the bid and ask spread the bid and ask spread is very tight that's a good thing that means that essentially we are going to get a good f still here even though the volume is low all right so here I'm going to go for the 570 call Credit spread feel free to copy.,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,LUayI3fUYCc,2024-09-08T17:05:00Z,DON'T BUY NVIDIA (NVDA) Until It Hits THIS PRICE! (Sell Puts Instead),Nvidia,you got to know when to buy Nvidia stock if you don't know the proper entry you're going to lose money so make sure you listen to this video because I'm going over the outlook on Nvidia my strategy I'm going to give you a trade that I literally placed for everyone which we are making money on so far and we need to talk about Nvidia because this stock has made a lot of millionaires it's also going to be possible that a lot of people lose money if they're trading Nvidia improperly because the volatility is high and there's a lot of opportunities right now a lot of billionaires are selling Nvidia right now there's a lot of doubts out there however smart investors are picking the proper entry price and their dollar cost averaging into Nvidia personally I believe that Nvidia is a gift guys it is a gift between $80 to $100 per share which is why I'm selling puts for entry to get into Nvidia at $100 or less guys this stock is a steal at $100 or less I'll explain to you why first first of all I'm going to pull up some research right now guys keep in mind here's some facts based on history the good news is NVIDIA is a long-term winning stock guys it's a long-term winning stock which is likely to keep Rising so you guys are lucky because this stock has made many millionaires without even having to really do a lot of research but now it's a very critical period because we've seen a big pullback now listen keep in mind Regulators are always saying that they're going to break up a company part of the reason why Nvidia fell post earnings is because the antitrust subpoena all this type of legal stuff which I'm not an expert on I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on the current price of Nvidia in my opinion is very fair so looking at short-term volatility it's higher meaning it's a great time to be selling options for income you actually don't need even the perfect entry on Nvidia because by selling a put option you literally get forced into an entry on Nvidia lower than the current stock price so I just want to show you guys on screen right now Nvidia $98 sellp put for $ 920 expiration okay you guys can see on the screen right here that back in September 4th I recommended selling a put option on Nvidia why because Nvidia has a lot of volatility I am a little bit nervous to buy the stock right now and for good reason guys All the people out there that are recommending Nvidia over $120 per share that was a mistake okay I did not buy it pre- earnings I was internally uneasy about nvidia's earnings and I thought that this stock is a little bit hot okay because it's a little bit hot I decided that I'm going to wait until after earnings so you can say it's 100% skill or you know 30 50% luck what whatever however you mentally think about it I personally made the decision that I am not buying Nidia stock until after earnings after earnings the stock ended up crashing and then I still guys this is genius right here all right this will change your life all right instead of buying Nvidia stock post after it has fallen down I said to myself okay I want even a better entry all right I want an even better entry than the current stock price so what I ended up doing let me show you this right now nid is at $12 per share I have several different positions Nvidia has been hurting even though I've been very conservative and I've saved myself a lot of money guys a lot of money because I could have bought this stock you know we take a look at the one mon chart you know a lot of people were hype right here 120 12 128 I said no no no no that's a little too high for me right if you look at the year- to-day chart on Nvidia there's actually a triple top pattern all right it's very simple to understand Nvidia reached the high then it had a pullback why it it had a pretty good pullback from 135 down to 118 it doesn't really matter the reason why I can visually see simply on a chart without being a genius that the stock has resistance all right it is resisting going above 130 all right it tested 130 it tested 130 again we got a big crash so when I see Nvidia stock going back to 127 that is a trap that is a trap guys because a lot of people say wow Nvidia is coming back up to the highs it's going to keep going no I want you to resist herd behavior and I've done significantly better and I've generated a lot of alpha on Nvidia because I did not buy it at high prices you guys need to wait for a pullback now that we have a pullback I'm very confident here because look Nvidia $98 we had a good support level all right it's very simple you don't have to be a stock market expert to just read the charts just read the chart here okay look Nvidia at $98 it has had a strong support it had a huge bounce okay that's why I did not buy Nvidia at these high and now I'm looking to buy Nvidia at $100 or $98 because anything under 100 is an absolute gift and you shouldn't be buying the stock until you see that price okay you can start buying it right now by the way cuz $102 is close enough and this is a high quality long-term stock so I really don't agree with with all the Bears out there guys I'm going to show you one more thing but I first want to say that I don't agree with the Bears this iron Condor right now you guys can see on the screen Nvidia iron Condor so far I'm not in the best position but let me show you right now what I think to be the best trade and how you should enter Nvidia go to trade Nvidia options doesn't matter what Brokers that you're using okay that doesn't really matter at all all right go to sell put I sold the $98 put here I collected probably some somewhere around $270 this was a few days ago so I don't remember but it doesn't really matter because today this trade is still valid it's still valid today it'll be valid tomorrow it'll be valid up until 9:20 if you're going to be selling puts on Nvidia you're going to collect more income because Nvidia has more implied volatility guys so that's how it works there you can lower your risk by the way and this strategy is safer than stocks all right so looking at the 98 put I would sell 98 put for September 20 now you can also go out until October 18 October 18 you can also sell a let's take a look here you can also go for 98 put now why 98 you can also go for 97 let me expand the option right here to give you a perspective all right the 97 put right here it has a 33 Delta meaning that if you sell this put 33 out of 100 times or 33% of the time right you're going to get a sign that's a good thing because we want to acquire shares of Nvidia we are Nvidia Bulls right here on this channel okay I'm an Nvidia bull all right so you want to acquire Nvidia at a lower price than the current stock market value current stock market value is at $102 if I'm selling a put at 97 you guys already know that you get to acquire and buy shares you'll get a sign at 97 so how do you lose guys if it's a win-win it's a win-win all right if it stays above 97 good you got the premium everything's cool you use that Capital that income that you got for whatever you like now if it went down below 97 that income is still yours but now you do have to get 100 shares per option contract of Nvidia at $97 which in my opinion would be a win so it stays above 97 you win if it goes below 97 you win relatively speaking okay relatively speaking let me explain that so if it goes below 97 you have to buy it at 97 so it could be at 90 and you would technically be down on the sell put you would have to buy shares at at 97 put it's at 90 but listen everyone who had stock suffered more than you did so I'm putting you in a winning situation now this is what I consider a non- losing situation if you want Nvidia anyway,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,1IYoQD4ElP4,2024-09-06T20:07:00Z,My Palantir Stock (PLTR) 2025 Price Target & LEAP Option Strategy,Palantir,"I got a feeling I know where Palantir is going to be in 2025. I'm going to give you some Palantir analysis and how I'm playing leap options on Palantir because given where the Palantir trend is going in 2025. Palantir stock is up 10% in the past year, that means this idea that I've had for several years now is absolutely printing money. Investors are buying Palantir hand over fist. Palantir growth profile continues to improve. Alex Karp is leading the company in a really good way. Palantir their expensive valuation looks like a key reason why analysts are giving this stock some doubt right now. The stock is hovering around $30 per share. I think this is the perfect entry into Palantir. In 2025, if we get more growth, maybe not 100% but 67% growth, this is going to be a $50 stock. People are doubting Palantir but I'm looking at the facts, the company is growing at a very fast rate. Going from $30 to $50 will be very possible in 2025. I'm expected increased Revenue which will go into their profit margins. Alex Karp is very smart so he's creating value for the marketplace, he's increasing Palantir Revenue which is going to go into the bottom line which is why stocks grow to begin with. Alex Karp is a fantastic Financial engineer so looking at his experience I think that in 2025 Palantir can likely make a lot more revenue. More importantly Palantir deal sizes are getting bigger, with the company closing 96 deals worth over $1 million or more in the previous quarter of 66 such deals in the same period last year. The number of $10 million plus deals increased by 50% year-over-year to 27. The adoption of Palantir AI platforms increases its growth rate should also pick up in 2025 because they are building relationships. Palantir also fantastic AI company, it's in a trend so not only is it in a trend it's a popular stock, it's also actually making money. Looking at the deals that they're closing they are increasing in size and quantity. Considering that Palantir will likely be a $50 stock. If you were to buy a 100 shares of Palantir for the current stock price that's going to be $3,000. I think it makes sense in this scenario to buy call options on Palantir. The options are actually pricing in a move upward, that's why the Delta is .6 even though the option the call option is at 30 and the stock is at 30 that's crazy that means that Palantir is likely to rise. If Palantir reaches $40 per share you will have a gain of $10. If Palantir goes to 45 you will now be up $15 and you've paid $5 in that case you can triple your money if Palantir goes up to the full $50 which is very very possible. Currently Palantir is such a bullish move that they haven't even made the strike price of 50 just yet. I think Palantir will be bullish. I just covered Palantir a couple of days ago so make sure to check out that video and just keep running my bread and butter safe strategies of selling puts and covered calls.

Invest with Henry,m-SPLV4fFCA,2024-09-05T20:26:39Z,Nvidia Stock (NVDA) - I'm Doing THIS Right Now (Easy Money),Nvidia,"are you guys ready to make some money on Nvidia stock because I'm going to show you the stock and the options I want to make the bull case for NVIDIA guys I am bullish on Nvidia I wasn't necessarily in Nvidia stock too much before earnings I waited until after earnings guys everyone else said buy before earnings I've had some shares but I just quadrupled my position I literally put in so much money after earnings because I'll tell you why guys this is very simple all right Nvidia has had abnormal returns for a very long time it is a very good company overall I cannot say that this company is bad I love Nvidia I think they have so much Innovation but look the facts are clear the stock is up a lot you can see right here the stock is up a lot over a long period of time a pullback is due now that we've had earnings the pullback has happened I have put up a lot of money and I've loaded or unloaded a lot of my dry powder into Nvidia stock right now so a the pullback is healthy B I'm still very bullish on Nvidia abnormal returns have been happening but due to this pullback it's finally back in the right cycle the right cycle is stocks go up stocks pull back and then they go back up I'm going to be going over Nvidia right now I'm going to go to Nvidia stock right now I'm going to point out some really interesting stuff about the options as well as the stock if you're losing money on Nvidia start learning options options are safer than stocks I'm selling 98 puts AKA if Nvidia goes down to 98 I will buy it at 98 right now nvidia's come down I'm still okay I'm completely okay I'm doing better than every YouTuber and every other investor because Nvidia is still out of theone money in comparison to my options I haven't made money on Nvidia right now but I will make money on NV I 100% 99.99% positive and I'm also losing less money than everyone else I also have sold puts 98 and 100 another portfolio which I recently opened up that's doing very well although it's showing a total return that's a loss if I were to buy it back right now in all reality I'm probably going to be making money on this 920 is the expiration on this option I still think this is a very very good play you sell some puts at 920 at 100 strike or 98 strike and you're going to be printing money on Nvidia he bought Nvidia at under $20 per share this guy has been in Nvidia under $20 per share and he told me back then he told me this was years ago this was I was still in college this is six man six years ago seven I don't know I I'm forgetting at this point it's been been quite a while but he told me Nvidia is the best play he has right and a little bit later when I was working at a hedge fund in Philadelphia I did research on Nvidia and I pitched it to my boss who was managing $9 billion and I told him to buy Nvidia at about $112 per share lo and behold he bought it he made lots of money and still this stock is going up I can't believe it this is the stock that keeps giving this is the stock that's honestly kind of defined my life in some ways because it has given me a little bit of boost in my career when I was working on Wall Street they gave me a really good uh performance bonus for kind of recommending this stock right so I was kind of phrased and I got some good reviews on this but I didn't really make much money out of my ideas long story short what I want to say about Nvidia is I've heard about this stock for years I've been following it for years I have a lot of friends that have made tons of money on Nvidia stock by buying call options which I don't fully agree with because when you're buying options you are putting on a lot of unnecessary risk in my opinion because you have to be right about Direction you have to be right about timing and that's kind of two different factors that are very difficult guys I'm just saying if you're bullish on Nvidia and you want to make a lot of fast money I would go into buying call options my recent trade was Nvidia 98 cellp put 100 cellp put for entry I prefer that over buying options now also I am looking at running the wheel strategy on Nvidia I'm just telling you the honest God truth like how I feel how I think what research I'm doing I woke up this morning I did like over an hour of research I'm just sharing with you everything that I know personally my goal and for my students is to outperform the S&P 500 I don't compare myself to others guys I look at how I can be better every single day that's the same thing that you should do if you made $2,000 this month or $3,000 or whatever amount of money that you made you should be looking to make a little bit more money next month in the following month that is the goal for trading that is the goal for becoming financially free you want your passive income to continuously rise I believe in passive income Rising steadily I don't believe in going you know $3,000 one month $50,000 the next month and then Nega $122,000 the next month what good does that do you can't travel the world you can't like live life on your own terms you can't quit your job your career your your boss right you can't fire your boss if you don't have consistent income so look my goal is to outperform the s&p500 by as much as possible because that is the Benchmark okay I compare myself to S&P 500 and I compare myself to myself how do I make less mistakes how do I keep buying Innovative companies at a good fair value how do I get below fair value and buy companies at a much better price guys so let's go into my portfolio right now I'm going to show you how I'm playing Nvidia because I do have several positions here okay let's go to Nvidia all right so Nvidia stock I have you know three different strategies in this portfolio first strategy that I got guys is the iron Condor I do have a video on this channel on iron Condors it's one of the best ways to grow a small portfolio I sell iron Condors for income all right and iron Condor plays on two different factors okay it plays on selling call Credit spreads and selling put credit spreads a call Credit spread is simply a option spread and a put credit spread is also simply an option spread if you want to visualize it in the most simple way I'm selling an iron Condor because I'm selling calls and I'm selling puts I'm selling both because I think Nvidia is going to stay somewhat range bound let me explain to you what I mean because obviously Nvidia has a lot of volatility so when people say hey you're doing an iron Condor Henry you must be crazy no I have a lot of experience and I know what I'm talking about so let me explain to you in a little bit more detail here let me let me grab my computer here let me show you guys what's up let's show you guys how to make money how to literally print money and how to do technical analysis it's literally very straightforward and I want to show you my thought process here so if I go to uh the chart on Nvidia I'm going to just put the indicators here and I'm going to go to bowling your band guys I've been using the bowling band for literally everyone else because I have a degree in statistics my degrees are in finance economics and data analytics or business analytics and statistics it's all the same thing right all three of these are basically cousins of each other data analytics I'm a master at statistics and data I love numbers I've been good at math since I was a kid I was sitting there and playing a lot of math games so you have the best coach here on YouTube make sure that you are subscribed because I am going to put money in your pocket right now Nvidia look at the Binger band The Binger band has expanded however it's still pretty clear the bottom of the Binger band is 101 you can see that right here right 101 that means that Nvidia is not going to go down below 101 guys AKA Nvidia is not going lower than 101 it's very unlikely given the Binger band The Binger band is based on simple statistics the statistics say that because Nvidia is unlikely to go below 101 it's likely to stay above this would mean guys that selling a put option would be the way to go under 100 that's exactly why I sold a 100 put option and 98 put option there's a few other reasons but I'm trying to give you guys the simplest easiest reason and thought process so you can copy me and print money I want it to be very simple so anyone can do it you don't need to get into any of my paid programs anyone else's paid programs I'm giving you guys everything for free because I care and I love what I do here I'm very passionate so this is all you have to do guys if you want to get into Nvidia don't buy it at the current stock price well you could would what I did was I did half of my position uh I bought like 2,000 shares at the stock price and then I sold numerous different options okay so I sold the 100 and the 98 guys that's all you have to do you don't have to watch lots of Nvidia videos because if you sell puts to get in you get an advantage you get a better price 100 is the bottom of the bowling band and look the moving average here actually this is not the moving average this is some lines that I drew let me go into the moving average now what I want to do is I just want to go over the 30-day moving average cuz I want to see you know what has been about the average for 30 days and you see right here it's at 115 I don't know if we're going to get back to 115 real quick guys I'm not a market predictor I'm not one of these people that's going to sit here and pretend that I know what's going to happen in the market in the short term I don't I have a very good sense of what can happen in the long term and I have a even better sense of how to make money selling options so you can see here that the stock is at 106 I'd be super happy to buy it at 100 and uh let's go back to my position on the iron Condors real quick 105 is the bottom of my iron Condor I opened this position a long time ago so the Binger band was a little bit different at that time so I'm still out of the money though so I am still I'm still excited and I'm still basically doing very very well by just holding this position until 920 so I may manage this position I may close this position we will see right now I'm staying patient because patience makes money you got to be patient you got to control your emotions all right so with this position I'm very bullish I also have some put credit spread so I'm bullish on Nvidia and then I had the 98 sold puts innovation guys it's happening very fast with Nvidia",1.0,0.9

Number one being Palance here Palance here I have six figures in the stock again Innovation I'm not going to waste your time when to get to the point Innovation and everything is really fantastic with paler wheel strategy so that's the first one I would be selling 30 30 puts all day guys all day 30 puts let me actually just pull up paler real quick here on the chart I'm going to show you that basically I have six figures in the company I'm holding 5,000 shares I'm looking to acquire some more stock right now I keep selling put options at 30 strike price I think you can sell put options 30 strike price I would go out to middle of October October 18 no problem November December now why am I giving you guys these three different plays right why am I giving you three different expirations dates is Henry confused no I'm not not at all right multiple 7 figureure portfolio 10 years of experience Goldman Sachs Etc right I don't want to not boasting here I'm just telling you that I've been doing this for a very long time you want to sell different expiration dates actually because you're diversifying across different expiration dates pretty simple because if paler has a negative move you are going to get assigned which is actually a good thing if you're selling put options when you sell put options you hope to get assigned guys I'm hoping I'm like praying please get me a signed on palen here because I know I'm going to get richer by buying paler shares because every time that it dips it recovers so it dips I get some shares and I have sold some puts I get it at $30 per share cuz that's the strike price that I'm going to sell pops up at 32 I have a covered call at 32 that's how you want to play options that's how you want to sell options that's the only strategy that I would recommend for someone that's trying to reach retirement if you're trying to get a consistent income 5,000 10,000 $15,000 a month which I've seen not with all my 4,000 students obviously I'm not going to be a scammer and say oh everyone succeeds no I mean some people have small portfolios but I would say out of 4,000 people I have over a 100 people that are making well over $10,000 $15,000 a month because they're just running a simple strategy like the wheel strategy other students make money but not everyone has a bigger portfolio so some people are still scaling up and the the boot camp student by the way that I just showed you that made over $9,000 on a firm does not have a big portfolio he just took a little bit extra risk which I'm completely fine with because if you know what you're doing with options they're way safer than stocks even buying options is a little bit obviously riskier than selling options but you can still make a ton of money especially if you catch Trend and you know what you're doing and you have a high quality company like paler so yeah 5,000 shares there I'm going to keep holding paler shares and just keep really reinvesting the money that I make off of the wheel strategy. So obviously when I'm saying I'm bullish on paler I'm buying it I'm buying it guys I'm buying it but but listen you need to have 10 to 15 stocks if you're putting all your eggs in one basket you're silly don't be a fool all right and have 10 to 15 stocks so have you know have your Palante here",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,6DIFqm2wvPQ,2024-09-04T20:07:00Z,4 Stocks I'm Buying Right Now!,A Firm,"then we're going to talk about a firm airm stock has gone up a lot guys airm fintech company in a good Trend so we're going to be talking about a firm and then also Nvidia for multiple reasons I've done a lot of research all right so first thing I want talk about is palen here all right I'm going to share my screen real quick my portfolio by the way is at $3.2 million guys number one option coach in the world right here with a lot of profits things are going very very well it's it's easy mode right now guys there's a lot of easy money in the market and I would say right now that uh I'm consistently making big money let me just take a look at let me just take a look at my onee chart here 31k all right 1% all right well that's that's pretty big money because my promise here or what I'm trying to go after is 1 to 2% per week 3 to four or 5% per month because I'm focusing on retirement strategies I like to work with folks that do have a six-figure portfolio cuz I want to scale a six figureure portfolio to seven figures I've done that with 4,000 people by the way speaking about a firm I had a student that made over $9,000 by being in a firm I think that just kind of speaks for itself because a firm as a stock right now has not only shown a lot of positive momentum but their pay later loans will soon be integrated into Apple pay guys come on let let's just let's just think about that for a second all right Apple pay is going to be using a firm that means that a firm is going to be in one of the biggest most iconic Brands and they're going to get a consistent cash flow as a company that means their revenues are going to go up their profits are going to go up their earnings is going to go up and this company basically has a forever cash flow or pretty much forever unless Apple breaks the contract which is unlikely guys when a company like apple implements a firm as a payment solution they're talking back and forth they're spending millions and millions and and hundreds of millions of dollars over their relationship over a long period of time to establish connection software it implementation guys they're not going anywhere so now that a firm has a good deal with Apple I'm really really bullish on it especially because if you look at fintech as a trend guys I'm all about being in the trend I'm all about having a high quality company Long Term and basically retiring off of the wheel strategy using it on a highquality company okay a highquality company goes up has some volatility has a very big brand and as it moves sideways a little bit up and up and up over the time you're running the wheel strategy to acquire more shares by selling put options and then you're also selling covered calls you're getting the upside you're collecting income there's just so much to like about the wheel strategy which is why I would run the wheel strategy on all four stocks that I'm covering in this video number one being Palance here Palance here I have six figures in the stock again Innovation I'm not going to waste your time when to get to the point Innovation and everything is really fantastic with paler wheel strategy so that's the first one I would be selling 30 30 puts all day guys all day 30 puts let me actually just pull up paler real quick here on the chart I'm going to show you that basically I have six figures in the company I'm holding 5,000 shares I'm looking to acquire some more stock right now I keep selling put options at 30 strike price I think you can sell put options 30 strike price I would go out to middle of October October 18 no problem November December now why am I giving you guys these three different plays right why am I giving you three different expirations dates is Henry confused no I'm not not at all right multiple 7 figureure portfolio 10 years of experience Goldman Sachs Etc right I don't want to not boasting here I'm just telling you that I've been doing this for a very long time you want to sell different expiration dates actually because you're diversifying across different expiration dates pretty simple because if paler has a negative move you are going to get assigned which is actually a good thing if you're selling put options when you sell put options you hope to get assigned guys I'm hoping I'm like praying please get me a signed on palen here because I know I'm going to get richer by buying paler shares because every time that it dips it recovers so it dips I get some shares and I have sold some puts I get it at $30 per share cuz that's the strike price that I'm going to sell pops up at 32 I have a covered call at 32 that's how you want to play options that's how you want to sell options that's the only strategy that I would recommend for someone that's trying to reach retirement if you're trying to get a consistent income 5,000 10,000 $15,000 a month which I've seen not with all my 4,000 students obviously I'm not going to be a scammer and say oh everyone succeeds no I mean some people have small portfolios but I would say out of 4,000 people I have over a 100 people that are making well over $10,000 $15,000 a month because they're just running a simple strategy like the wheel strategy other students make money but not everyone has a bigger portfolio so some people are still scaling up and the the boot camp student by the way that I just showed you that made over $9,000 on a firm does not have a big portfolio he just took a little bit extra risk which I'm completely fine with because if you know what you're doing with options they're way safer than stocks even buying options is a little bit obviously riskier than selling options but you can still make a ton of money especially if you catch Trend and you know what you're doing and you have a high quality company like paler so yeah 5,000 shares there I'm going to keep holding paler shares and just keep really reinvesting the money that I make off of the wheel strategy so when I'm making money off of the wheel strategy I'm trying to be here on camera when I'm making money on the wheel strategy essentially I'm taking that money and reinvesting it into stock because obviously all YouTubers get paid from YouTube and I don't really have an expensive lifestyle I'm here in Eastern Europe and my lifestyle is pretty cheap to be honest so besides living in the hotel that's my biggest expense everything else is like cheap as dirt so the YouTube income is just plenty to just live off of so everything I make in my portfolio I'm reinvesting and as you guys see the portfolio just continues to grow so let me real quick cover some uh some hard research some hard hard facts that I wanted to cover that are really important guys I'm pumped up I've see so many people making money with me and I love it I love making people richer I love getting richer and it's it's a really fun thing to to see cuz I'm getting a lot of good positive testimonials now from the Discord community and I don't even know I'm just I'm just happy having a good day here so affirm so Revenue surg 71% in the physical year of 2021 and then in 2022 guys it jumped up 55% so we see some diminishing returns all right some basic uh economic Concepts here economics finance and analytics degree over here so basic economics is you get diminishing returns things can't grow forever that's why my portfolio grew like 600 700% back in 2021 then it grew 100% then 50% and now yeah I'm having you know doing 4 % or so per year but it's getting harder the more money you have you get diminishing returns that's the same it's the same with building muscle you're new me at the gym you build a lot of muscle then it gets harder to build muscle all right many things are applied to this so a firm in fiscal 2023 its sales only Rose 18% so we had 71 we had 55 and then they only Rose 18% that abrupt de acceleration was caused by three major headwinds all right guys these three major headwinds are by the way a big pattern across the whole Market not just for a firm inflation consumer spending and well one of them is declining transactions there's a lot of major customers that got off of the pelaton basically in the past pandemic right so they were processing a lot of payments there and that really hurt a firm's profits there but you know also looking at Fierce competition there's there's PayPal which by the way I'm long on PayPal guys I have PayPal stock and we're doing fantastic on PayPal I hold up hold up let let me not talk about it let me not talk about it let me show you the proof in the pudding I'm not one of these YouTubers that's a YouTuber I'm actually a Trader that makes a lot of money a $113,000 profit on PayPal my options are down a little bit so I have to roll this option up I'm not going to lie I have to roll this option up but I had a lot of options expire where I was selling puts put credit spreads I was making a ton of money on PayPal now I have to roll it roll it up actually but I have a pretty big position on PayPal and it's at $71 per share with my average cost being at basically around $65 per share so PayPal competition to a firm but I'm actually long on both because I'm I'm very bullish on payment processing in general I think it's a fantastic business that has a lot of cash flow and uh I like both business models tremendously guys I love high margin business models high margin business models these are it tech companies all right I mean are you crazy just just just look at a firm guys look look at the chart all right do you see how bullish this stock is right now do you see how much Social velocity is going into the stock as well as palen here when I see social velocity when I see other YouTubers basically covering the same content I've been covering for years that means that things are becoming pretty obvious right that means there's a lot of investors in the stock that means other YouTubers are getting views because everyone understands that this stock is bullish all right so bullish stock pretty obvious look at YouTube look at uh you know a lot of news articles look at the research look at the facts look at what the CEO is saying guys come on come on now you can retire off of running the wheel strategy as well as as on a firm but obviously guys keep it Diversified keep it Diversified you don't want to have all your money in one stock so obviously when I'm saying I'm bullish on paler I'm buying it I'm buying it guys I'm buying it but but listen you need to have 10 to 15 stocks if you're putting all your eggs in one basket you're silly don't be a fool all right and have 10 to 15 stocks so have you know have your Palante here have your affirm let me move on to the next stock",1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,6DIFqm2wvPQ,2024-09-04T20:07:00Z,4 Stocks I'm Buying Right Now!,Nvidia,"let me move on to the next stock all right Nvidia guys many reasons for NVIDIA you got to listen to these reasons because if you're holding a stock and it pulls back you might sell the stock if you're not educated enough right I'm doing my job here or not job I'm doing this as a passion I get paid for it as well whatever whatever you call it I'm here as a coach Coach Henry to tell you to get educated on the stocks that you have why because if you have a stock that you think is good or Susie there on YouTube told you or or John or or Mark or whoever told you right your friend your uncle and you hold a stock and it goes up and you're celebrating oh I'm happy and you're eating good dinners with your family and then it pulls back and your mindset changes you're like oh my goodness I'm going to sell I'm going to take a loss oh boohoo I made all this money and then I lost all this money see that all the time don't be that guy don't be that woman you want to understand that a stock has a natural life cycle it goes up it goes down follow the trend all right get in at a profitable entry point look at the price to earnings ratio look at the profits of the company understand what the company does if you understand what Nvidia does and you understand the profits that they're going to be making and I'm going to give you some reasons right here you're not going to sell all right so look Nvidia CFO colet Crest said that in the company's Q2 earnings call that the black wealth platform will ramp up production beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 she also added that Nvidia expects Blackwell will generate several billion dollars with a B guys several billion dollars of Revenue in Q4 so CR basically mentioned the demand exceeds Supply the demand exceeds the supply I mean what else all right I'm getting a little bit dramatic here a trend that should extend into next year Trend should extend into next year billions of dollars of profits pretty clear so far right so investors might have been disappointed and this is very true that in missed its whisper earnings in Q2 despite beating the official Wall Street estimate numbers right so earnings happened investors were a little bit disappointed right they were like ah basically we wanted something a little bit more all right but that's short-term thinking guys if you're a long-term investor looking to retire looking for passive income and you don't mind having a time frame that's over a day right I don't like those day traders that are like hey let's make millions of dollars in one day and two days in a week I'm not about that guys grow my portfolio over a decade 10 years all right took a while but hey here I am got what I think is almost unlimited money I got unlimited money I cannot spend the money that I have so I'm working for fun for passion it's like a sport but you will get to unlimited money if you do the right things right because you can live on 10 20K a month pretty easily anywhere in the world and option trading is lucrative enough and profitable enough that over time if you invested in the right stuff it's only a matter of time until you reach you know six figures mid six figures like 500k a million plus it's just a straight formula guys it's a plug-and-play formula it's the same thing you go to the gym you eat right you sleep right you're going to build muscle you do this right with the options you're going to build income and wealth looking at Nvidia I'm very bullish now listen one more important thing all right a few more important things right and then I have last talk that I want to cover it's important to keep in mind why Blackwell and the forthcoming Innovations are so critical to nvidia's success Nvidia has to keep getting market share and keep improving their business now look there's going to be a massive migration of data centers from CPUs to gpus and that's already underway all right that's already underway I'm just looking at the research right here as as I wrote my notes here as the CEO said in q2's call 1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be accelerated Computing will be all accelerated Computing all right so Nvidia basically is on a positive trend it's a top leader it has Brand so if you're running the wheel strategy just sell puts at like 115 October November December my strategy is clear guys October November December right now you're selling puts you're selling puts a firm selling puts Nvidia all right you're trying to run the wheel strategy you were looking to collect income pretty simple right you don't even have to buy nothing you don't have to smash nothing you don't have to watch no other YouTube videos I'm telling you the game plan right in this video I'm sharing all of it point blank with you so the company also plans to buy backage shares hand over fist or bicep over tricep all right bicep over tricep so they're buying back shares what does that mean guys what does a buy back mean why why would a company even buy back its shares right now listen a company buys back its shares to create more demand why why would they create more demand because more demand pushes up the stock price so they are buying back what was it they're buying back 50 billion in a stock buyback uh which was authorized all right now listen sure the total amount of authorized stock buyback represents just 2% of nvidia's market cap which is doesn't seem like that much but guys 2% buyback that's going to compound they're going to keep buying back shares that grows the stock over a long term because there's less shares to go around basic economics guys I'm just teaching the basic economics here you don't even have to be a genius I have students that basically are like blue callar workers they're working you know in not the fanciest jobs and they're still able to collect income I got truck drivers they're driving their trucks they're just selling puts for income they're selling covered calls for income my parents are doing this my parents don't even speak English that well all right they've been in America for 30 years they've made a lot of money in America however my parents don't even speak English that well because they're picking things that make sense to do they're picking the most profitable lucrative things to invest in to to work in and my parents are I respect them I love them but they're not Geniuses all right and the same thing is with a lot of my students nobody has to be a genius with options this is not like really Innovative or anything like that options have been around for such a long time this is a proven wealth building machine it's just it's just proven it's just a fact I studied this stuff in college I've gone over the research if you sell puts to get in I would go for like 30 Delta That's The Sweet Spot obviously there's there's reasons and comment down below if you want to know why 30 Delta Del or what Delta you prefer but if I were to keep it very simple simple formula sell puts out a 30 Delta and then then just do covered calls honestly at a 30 Delta as well use technical analysis and pick high quality companies and fundamental analysis that's kind of to break down my strategy there and just to tell you everything for free because that's that's my goal is to educate I want more subscribers guys we're about to hit 300,000 subscribers on the channel so number one option trading channel in the world please subscribe and more videos like this and more

Invest with Henry,iju_oetqgLo,2024-09-03T20:07:01Z,"Retire on JUST $197,000 Using The Wheel Strategy on SPY (Pro Options Trader)",SPY,"I'll show you how to retire with just $1197 you can retire using the options wheel strategy on spy with an account with $197,000 a wheel strategy on spy can bring in 3% per month that would be $5,990 in gross monthly premium collected I'm going to be showing you the way to do this safely in consistently while also managing the position should it go against you the reason I like SP why is because it has a daily expiration and lots of volume to easily get in and get out here's a breakdown of what Spy holds which is big in safe companies meaning this one ETF is very Diversified for running the wheel strategy the Spy wheel is a great way to generate income with low risk spy is the best overall dollar for dooll investment in my opinion it provides the best return per risk most people expect an annual return of 8% to 10% from buying and holding ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index but with the wheel strategy you're getting the best of both worlds in high returns and low risk people that are sick of losing money have adopted the wheel strategy as their only strategy in their portfolio and I think that's very smart especially for the folks are looking for consistent income they're not chasing huge returns they're chasing safety and consistency spy is very stable for that the wheel strategy is a very popular option trading strategy that involves selling covered calls and cash secured puts on a particular stock or ETF in this case spy the goal of the strategy is to generate income by collecting premiums from selling these options while also potentially acquiring shares of the underlying asset at a lower price to implement the wheel strategy on spy you would start by selling a cash secured put option on the ETF at a strike price that you would be comfortable owning the shares at I like selling puts around a 20 Delta so when I'm trading SPY and I'm selling a put option I will start out by selling around a 20 Delta put option that means that four out of five times I'm going to just make money and not even get assigned anything at all so yeah the best part about spy is the income generation so selling a put option spy provides immediate income through the premium that you receive so if I go to trade spy options I'm going to pick a put option so I'm going to go to sell put then I'm going to pick an expiration there is daily expirations for spy that can be a viable strategy if you have a lot of free time on your hands however I would definitely say you want to go for more of that passive income just go out to maybe 2 to 8 weeks so I'm going to go out about 30 days from the time I'm making this video so I'm going to go to September 30th and I'm going to go down a little bit out of the money so I'm going to go for an option let's take a look at the 555 strike price aka hint hint getting assigned is still success successful because even if you get assigned no worries we want to have spy because spy has a lot of diversity um there's actually a whole lot of things inside spy it's 500 of the top stocks in United States so it's a fantastic ETF to own so if I go to 555 and I sell this put option right here you will see that I'm actually collecting almost 1% income in uh 30 days so the thing about this trade is specifically if you want higher income you would go a little bit closer to the money the risk looks pretty big but it's not actually big so there's no way for spy to really fall that much so the max loss here is 55k but you'll never lose 55k so you don't have to worry about that um what you need to know is that you're collecting $457 uh up front and then you're tying up 55k in collateral that doesn't mean that you can lose 55k I mean in theory you could if spy went to zero but I mean we'd all not be on this this planet wouldn't exist actually if it went down to zero because that means every single company went bankrupt which means like this world doesn't exist so you don't have to worry about that there's actually a defined risk so when selling a put option the maximum loss is known upfront however it's typically just whatever the support of the stock or the ETF is so for spy I mean in any given year it could fall like 7 8% at most but even in 2008 crash the market didn't even fall like really 50% or thereabouts so your defined risk is pretty clear your return is also pretty clear we get um you know 1% here in a month which means that yeah in a single year you can definitely compound this and get it over you know 12 to 15% plus if you are mixing in a little bit of spreads I'll show you that in just a moment you can collect a lot more income on spy so you can get closer to that two even 3% return per month just on spy I mean the safest retirement strategy but you know let's just say 2% uh so if you can get 2% then on $197,000 then you're basically making $4,000 a month and you know from that point it's just all about scaling up the best thing is about spy is it kind of already bakes in Market volatility during periods of Market volatility option premiums increase so as they increase you'll collect more income um and selling puts in such a condition can actually yield higher income and the best thing is I'm a maret Market bull the market has been going up for decades and decades uh so it's a wealth building machine it's the best machine basically known to man for building long-term wealth so by investing in spy you tracked S&P 500 which has historically shown a lot of resilience and growth over time any 10-year period basically has gone up so when a lot of people get nervous about getting assigned on selling a put option uh you should never be nervous about getting assigned on a short put option you should be very excited and happy that you're acquiring a highquality ETF here let me just show you real quick more about spy actually you can see the one-ear return uh is uh well it's pretty high right 2 years 5 years 10 years and that's basically the annual average return over since 1993 so it's about 10% per year so you can basically Beat It by selling put options as well as covered calls and poer at spreads I'll go over that in just a moment but yeah so 10% has been happening since 1993 so I mean that's uh essentially as long as I've been alive so it's like 30 years 30-year period it's been pretty profitable year over-year 10% compounded means you're going to double your money in about what is it like 6 years you'll double your money every 6 years or so so I mean over a 30-year period you would double and then double and then double so you would a extra money and obviously we're talking about spy the safest this channel has many videos on more higher growth higher risk strategies but if you just want to retire and keep it really simple you know maybe Chill by the beach or or have a second house or play with your kids or your grandkids this is a very viable strategy to literally do with with all the funds that you have the fees are very low the expense ratio is literally $9 per $10,000 okay $9 per $10,000 is a fee but you literally get everything at Apple Microsoft Nvidia um you save so much fees from Trading and overtrading and here the top 10 Holdings are worth 34% of the total assets so Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta uh alphabet Berkshire hathway uh alphabet a and and see their only difference here is the Voting Rights Eli Lily and then avjo or broadcom so essentially I would say that uh with spy the historical resilience is impeccable you have 10% compounded growth you can supplement your retirement income for someone with $197,000 or or 200k or or you know a couple hundred K could literally put all your money here you don't have to worry you don't have to sweat at night you can just kind of relax and know that uh over any time period you're pretty much good I mean in the short term in a week nobody knows okay no nobody knows there's no point of predicting the market or listening to news um these fed meetings Etc interest rate Cuts they affect the market however in a non-predictable way so there's no point of you trying to predict it instead dollar cost average sell puts continue to add money as much as you can until you really re reach your retirement figure when you reach your retirement figure um it just depends on how much income you need obviously this is a YouTube video so some folks will need $10,000 a month some will want more because they live in higher cost of living cities so you might want to adjust this number but I would say at 197k you can literally go to like another country and like literally live the good life I've traveled to so many countries I'm in Eastern Europe now where my roots are from and uh you can literally live like a king for $4,000 a month it's actually hard to spend that let me also show you what you can do once you do get assigned so let's go back to the example of trade sell put so I'm going to go back to an expiration date that's about let's go to October actually let's go to October 11 here now once I do get put let's say that I want to go a little bit safer uh you can go a little bit safer by going down to 550 the premium here is pretty good if you actually want to go a little bit aggressive and you actually want to acquire shares which I recommend that you do anyways um you can go even for something much closer to the money so this would be a higher Delta of. 39 um it's really preference here so you can go for 560 so here you collect uh $738 so now let's say that spy at expiration I'm basically going to show you how to manage the strategy let's say that it goes uh down to 561 well there's actually no no issues there you're not going to get a sign you're good as long as it stays above 560 uh you're fine all right no need to worry if it gets close to 560 or below 560 you might start to get a little bit panicky you might think to yourself oh should I close out the position well no you really shouldn't you shouldn't close out the position spy is a good ETF if you have the cash which you should this is a cash secured put I'm not advising or showing or recommending anyone do any naked options that would be you know not good not good I do do that but that's a more advanced strategy that I teach in my six week boot camp for folks that are a bit more advanced and have more experience uh with me and they've gone through my beginner program so I would never recommend a naked sell putut just keep it cash secured meaning you have the cash you sell a put worst that happens is it goes below 560 you get a sign there's only a few scenarios that can happen Okay first one is spy can go up and that's fine just it goes up you still get the $738 that's yours right away actually soon as you sell the option it's it's yours immediately uh if it goes down a little bit but it stays above 560 you're good just leave it alone if it goes below 560 you do have a couple choices you can just get assigned or you could also roll down so you can roll from 560 for example down a little bit uh so you can roll down from 560 by closing out the 560 and selling a 557 for example and you don't have to go for October 11 you can uh you can switch it up for a future date you can go October 18 or on my birthday October 31st or or November or really any future dates as long as you're adding time uh time is money right time is money that's the fundamental equation in finance a dollar is worth more today than it is tomorrow because of time I mean everyone I mean if you're listening to this would you prefer a dollar today or a dollar in a week or a dollar in a year you take a dollar today over a week and you take a dollar in a week over a year no rational person would take a dollar in a year that would be foolish right because time is money and everyone wants money quicker so in general because time equals money when you go out in terms of dates and expiration dates you will always get paid more why because of time more time equals more money so you can always fix a position and if you don't want to get signed you can basically roll down from the current strike price down by one two three five or even $10 I mean here let me show you an example I can go from October 11 let me go to November 15 for example so here if I go from 560 and I can go down to let's say 555 it's actually pretty interesting because this option is in the future right but the 555 is lower so it's safer it's more out of the money so it's farther away from the current price so you have less chance of getting assigned and it's worth literally more so a person today if they wanted to roll from 560 down to 555 they would improve or save themselves $5 or 500 since each option is 100 shares they would save $500 and then you would move from basically you would you would have to pay $738 but you would collect 960 right and this is the total credit here is incorrect because this is just an example right uh these are two sells I would have to actually go and go back to October uh 11th here and go to buy because if I were to buy it to close it right so let me close the 560 now you'll see a more accurate measure here so you'll see that the total credit here is $215 so you're literally uh you can buy to close a 560 and sell the 555 and you get paid for that you get paid to basically go down and strike and that's all because of time I don't typically do that because I'm okay getting assigned in most cases unless I'm using a more advanced strategy like margin then you know I don't then I'll basically yeah I'll roll it down but I don't need to in this example and because if you're looking for safe retirement and you just want to keep it really simple and easy you can always just roll lower if needed but preferably you just have the cash you have the cash it's a cash secured put you get assigned and then once you do get assigned here's what you do next okay then you can uh basically now that you have shares you would just go to sell call option and uh you would sell a future call option so let's just say uh December so you would sell something like December 20th that's in the future and you can basically sell it at let's say let's say we want to go for 570 okay this option is worth a lot of money you can collect $1,641 here uh obviously it's three months out three and a half months out or so but uh the good news is it's actually a little bit higher than the average cost so if you were to get uh you know put or assigned at 550 this call option is basically 570 so you still have some upside plus you get the premium so this is a fantastic way to essentially collect money on spy and really get to retirement even with $197,000 you can basically retire or get close to retirement or have a strong secondary source of income now let's discuss how to properly manage the wheel strategy based on various scenarios my Discord Community has asked me before what to do if the stock or spy in this example gets very low much lower than your cost basis this part gets complicated and nobody covers this but here's scenario number one let's say that the stock goes down 10% so for example you sell a $100 put option it goes down to 90 well this is actually not that hard of a position in this example because the stock is now $90 and your average cost is 100 you can actually still try to sell 100 covered call now you likely won't be able to do that in one given week because in one week that's going to have no premium whatsoever because option Traders understand that since the stock is at 90 $100 is 11% away therefore the premium will be very tiny so what you will have to do is you'll have to sell covered calls that are two three or four weeks out at a $100 strike price then you'll still be able to collect one or 2% premium while not really losing on the stock itself when it does recover now in scenario number two let's say that the stock goes down 20% this would be very insane and super unlikely for spy I mean just downright nearly impossible for spy to fall 20% in a week or two so you know I do stick to weekly trading so for it to fall 20% really that's probably not going to happen but let's just say it's a different stock so I know a lot of people like you know Tesla you know there's a bunch of stocks out there and if the stock does end up going down 20% let's go back to the example of a stock being worth 100 which is your it goes down to 80 unfortunately what you're going to have to do is wait and hope that the stock will recover and hopefully when you're selling puts and doing the wheel strategy hopefully you're picking stocks that are good to begin with because if you're not and a stock falls down 20% you start scratching your head why am I owning this thing well you have to ask yourself why did you get into that position to begin with okay so if a stock goes down 20% and it's very far away from your cost basis that's not necessarily that bad of a problem if you like the stop what you're going to have to do is number one you will probably have to wait or number two now this is very interesting say that the stock goes down to 80 you can try to salvage and create some income by selling a 90 covered call so if you sell a 90 covered call that's not ideal because if the stock were to recover you would lose some money on this position as a whole and your wheel would not be profitable but that's the price that you pay when you're doing the wheel strategy on a riskier stock so if you're doing it on riskier stocks it does end up falling 20% % what you probably have to do is you probably have to sell around the 90 strike price however it doesn't mean that you have to get rid of your shares at 90 which you can also do say that you sell a 100 put goes down to 80 you get assigned obviously and you start doing 90 covered calls say at expiration or basically a day or two before somewhere in that near to expiration time period say that the stock goes up to $91 and you're upset you're basically saying hey I don't want to lose these shares yet because my cost basis is 100 I did sell a 90 covered call let's say it was for a doll so technically you're breaking even at 91 but say you don't want to get rid of the shares what you can do then is actually roll that covered call higher so you can take that 90 covered call and close that 90 and then open up a 95 and in most cases if you do that far out enough you can still collect a credit or at least Break Even but even if you break even now at least you don't have to get rid of the stock at 90 you can get get rid of it at 955 now let's talk about the call side if a call goes into the money what will happen is you will get exercised and lose your shares in the wheel strategy right so you first of all can get assigned on the puts you have to buy stock but if you get assigned on the calls you have to sell stock so say you don't want to sell your shares what you can do again is roll and close out that position what is likely to happen most of the time is that someone will actually end up selling covered calls that are out of the money and it's perfect perfectly fine because as long as it's out of the money you're going to be collecting premium if it's in the money then you're going to lose your stock if you wait until Friday expiration or you can roll it out higher there's two things that you can basically do if you get assigned so be it if it's above your cost basis you're probably happy if you don't want to lose your shares and you are at a gain that's okay too again you can roll now one important thing that I just want to say with the wheel strategy something that people do not realize is no matter which way in which direction it's going you can still dollar cost average and sell more put options or sell more covered calls by buying more shares especially if it is below your strike price especially if it is below your cost basis so for example let's say that a stock is at 100 okay you end up selling a 90 put option okay it goes down to 95 that doesn't mean that you can't sell more put options at 90 let's say it goes down to 85 you can still sell more put options at 80 so you can continuously sell more put options the entire life cycle of running the wheel strategy and that would be dollar cost averaging the wheel strategy there's nothing wrong with that the only issue is say you have $30,000 and you put $155,000 into Apple well you can't really dollar cost more into Apple because it's already 50% of your portfolio so when you are dollar cost averaging into the wheel strategy you want to make sure that you have 5 10 15% of your entire money in a single position therefore if it does does go down you can do more of the wheel strategy on the same stock dollar cost averaging but not exceeding like 30 or 40% of your portfolio the less of your portfolio you have in one single position the better the more Diversified you are now it's very interesting because you can always roll and adjust the option wheel position if you want to learn more about rolling the best video you can watch is right here",1.0,0.9

already 50% of your portfolio so when you are dollar cost averaging into the wheel strategy you want to make sure that you have 5 10 15% of your entire money in a single position therefore if it does does go down you can do more of the wheel strategy on the same stock dollar cost averaging but not exceeding like 30 or 40% of your portfolio the less of your portfolio you have in one single position the better the more Diversified you are",0.9,-0.1
Invest with Henry,MiK2UcPGSgQ,2024-09-02T20:01:39Z,WARNING ON PLTR: DO THIS Before The Stock Market Opens! (Palantir Stock Update),Palantir,"well we're about to talk about paler and how to make money on paler options so let's jump into this video I'm going to show you guys the strategy and I don't know how many times I have to say this this is the easiest way to make money selling options on paler so I'm going to show you some examples yes I'm using my phone today because my camera broke so be on my laptop sharing my screen as usual guys showing you all my wins all my losses everything right now my portfolio is at $ 3.18 million and uh I've been organically growing this portfolio for a very long long time if you're new to the channel I'm Henry worked at Goldman Sachs many of you guys are subscribed so thank you for that my goal is to make you guys richer you don't have to buy nothing you don't have to smash nothing my only goal is to educate you guys on how I've been able to retire travel the world obviously you see me in a new hotel every single video I enjoy traveling new Cuisines and I'm going to be showing you paler because paler is one of the easiest stocks because it's growing right now it's in a trend the trend is very positive the AI trend is really good the Management's really good the options are really liquid and good let me just cover my portfolio real quick here because I've been selling options and my last let's see what my last one month return is my last one uh month return is 3% I have very low volatility as you can see the charge just steadily basically just going up it's been a very easy month this is typically what I'm doing I'm doing 3 to 4% I focus on retirement strategies I'm looking to create income and I'm not going for home runs guys I'm not buying options all I'm doing is selling options that's all you need to do you need to sell puts sell covered calls that's it before the market Market opens up 9:30 a.m. just take a quick look at the market if stocks are going down is an even better time to sell puts if stocks are going up you want to still sell puts but you want to be a little bit more cautious let me show you a little bit more about entries okay so first of all I have American Airlines sellp put Tesla sellp put Apple sellp put Amazon sellp put Bank of America let me go to actually my total return right here a lot of this is up as you can see it just all I don't know why Robin Hood makes it red but it's all look 140 gain 3.4 3.3k gain 2K gain $1,000 50 570 4.7k I mean it's easy money right now all right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into pal here I'm going to show you what strikes I'm taking a look at because listen palen here you don't even have to watch 10,000 videos you just have to understand one simple thing this one simple thing is sell puts to get in sell covered calls to get out and run the wheel strategy on paler the wheel is literally the best strategy because it's a system all right you get into a stock cheaper than the current price the current price of of pounds here is $31.5 now look if you sell a put option at 30 let me just go over my positions real quick actually so I I have 5,000 shares of pal here I'm still holding pal here I'm going to be still holding paler in a month I'm going to still hold a paler in a year I'm going to keep holding pal here for the good foreseeable future as long as the stock stays in a positive trend I'm going to be holding pal here it's not really rocket signs why this stock is good I've covered that many times so I'm not going to waste your time I'm up $49,000 and the options right right now I'm losing a little bit of money on because I've had several options actually expire recently so that has taken my you know I made gains on that now I have the options that are left that are you know at a loss so I have the 23 put although this isn't really a loss this is a gain and this is a gain my only mistake was doing a covered call a little bit too aggressive on Palance here so now it's showing me you know this this right here is a bit of a loss but you know it's not really a loss because when you do a covered call um and the stock goes up you make money on the stock you still make money on the option but hypothetically if I were to buy this option back then yes it's at a loss however I'm not buying it back so it's not really an issue I'm just going to let pal your shares sell off and I'm still selling more put options on this portfolio and my other big account portfolio so let me go to trade paler options right now now listen guys the reason why I like paler at these levels is because the valuation is actually pretty good you want to look for a company that has a decent price earnings ratio and you don't want to go for a company that has negative earnings now since paler right now is scaling their business they keep winning government contracts they're becoming more profitable this company basically just makes a lot of sense to me because the valuation is finally making more sense than it used to okay not only does it make more sense the trend is very clear so I just want to acquire more shares and this is a very easy way of doing so you go to an expiration I would pick an expiration let's say I'm actually looking at October 18 right now because something that I like to do is I like to keep options very simple I sell options like one month two months out that's very common for me because I don't want to be selling options every single day or every single even week although weekly income is very exciting it's a great opportunity for many people that are new as you become a more experienced Trader you really don't have the need of basically going for weekly income anymore because whether you make $1,000 a week or $4,000 a month it's the same thing you don't really need to be overtrading and paying too much attention I use options to create passive income and basically retire although I'm young I'm pretty much retired because I'm creating income that only takes me 1 hour a week 4 hours a month this used to be a dream for me because I used to work at Goldman Sachs and let me tell you that job was not fun a lot of people think that your life is completely made when you work for Goldman Sachs let me tell you it is actually not because working at Goldman Sachs I had to get into the office at like 6:00 a.m. I would leave the office at 6:00 p.m. or even later at 7:00 p.m. and the thing is finance culture and I think a lot of America and that's why I don't really live in America right now is because a lot of uh American culture and and this like corporate culture is just not for me it's not for me I don't want to come into the work first thing in the morning and be earlier than everyone else just to prove that I'm smart okay in the finance World on Wall Street when you come in very early you're basically showing your higher ups how how good you are at at being an employee oh I'm here earlier I'm here earlier than you that's like a a badge of honor listen my badge of honor is my results my badge of honor is I made over $3.5 million trading options my badge of results is I've trained 4,000 students on how to make consistent income I don't need to come to work at 6:00 in the morning and work till 7:00 p.m. I really don't like that culture I really don't think that's a culture that breeds Innovation and even if you look at Alex carp right he said the whole reason why paler is so successful is because they're not playing the NBA Playbook all right all these people that go to Harvard NBA Yale MBA yeah they have the Playbook right on paper like what works right these case studies guys case studies don't matter what matters is real world results I have a PhD in results and I prefer to look at companies that are also very Innovative so I like paler because they don't play by The Playbook Alex carp you know fantastic CEO he has so much Innovation and that's going to drive Revenue at the end of the day why you want Innovation is because Innovation drives revenue revenue drives profits profits drive basically the stock price to go up because more investors realize that it's a good opportunity and the stock is more valuable because each share is making more money that's the whole reason why we invest guys that's why I don't understand people that are buying companies that don't have any earnings okay I see people going into rivan into other lowquality companies and they ask me you know they come to me Henry I'm buying options on this company I say why are you holding this stock they don't know they're like oh I heard it on YouTube guys shut off the YouTube you don't really even need YouTube you need to understand that selling options works you need to pick high quality companies you don't need new companies you need the same basket of stocks that's why my Discord Community I'm using the same 20 to 30 stocks it's literally the same thing over and over it's so boring but it's so boring that everyone makes money I prefer making money on boring things instead of something really crazy okay I don't need to recreate the wheel I already run the wheel strategy on high quality companies and there's no need to get really Innovative with it all right so check this out if I go to Pal here sorry for the ramp by the way I'm just on camera today I'm feeling good uh you know got the muscles out feeling good today and I want to educate you guys want to give you guys that mindset and basically the easy simple advice and I'm not a financial adviser but the easy simple advice to scale your portfolio this is the easiest way to scale all right obviously a lot of people make videos on paler there's an oversaturation of content on paler because people realize first of all that it's an Innovative company second of all a lot of people are starting to pour into paler and third of all is just a popular stock for YouTubers to get views on okay I'm not a fan of that I want to give you guys a real advice that's why I'm not going after all the popular stocks but paler I've been in this stock before everyone else I've literally been in the stock for like 3 four years since I started this YouTube channel I've had palen here before every other YouTuber started piggybacking and B covering this topic paler is a good company from IPO and I think it's going to be a good company until it stops innovating and when they going to stop innovating I don't think they are anytime soon so what you want to do is simply sell put options sell a put option at the 30 strike y 30 let me expand the 30 put option right here all right I'm looking down on my computer the 30 put option right here has a Delta of 34 okay 34 means there's a 34% chance of you getting assigned now listen 34% chance you win why do you win because you get assigned you oh wait wait what oh did I confuse you right there you think getting assigned is a bad thing no it is actually a good thing getting assigned is fantastic when it's a highquality company now typically people get all fearful oh I got a sign I'm I'm afraid I can lose all this money look at the max loss oh my goodness that Max loss is almost $3,000 no no completely wrong let me change your mindset right now the max loss says this because that's if the stock went to zero I don't know about you guys but with a brand with hundreds or thousands of employees the stock is not going to zero okay stocks don't typically go to zero unless they are scamming all right this company not a scam many companies I invest in actually 100% of the companies I invest in all have brand none of them are a scam all right so Palante here cannot go to zero it just can't all right I'd be willing to bet basically anything uh that it can't go to zero all right it just not so the max loss is incorrect that's actually not even true all right it's if it were to go down to zero now the max profit is $130 you might be saying to yourself well that's not a lot of money well yes it is a lot of money because $30 right that's $3,000 $ 1% is $30 $120 is 4% right I'm doing the mental math very simple Mental Math here you don't need any Physics degree or math degree you can be practically a ninth grade education to make money trading options because it's really not that hard there's nothing intensive about it you just need to know one strategy selling puts to get in so if you sell a uh put option here here $130 that's about 4% it's actually a little bit over 4% here you get paid over 4% and I'm going out 6 weeks right so 6 weeks is roughly like 42 days right this is 47 days so this is 6 weeks for 4% that's almost 1% a week right but listen when you have a portfolio that's 100 Grand all right and you're basically making about 1% a week and by the way I'll talk about covered calls in just a moment you can make a little bit more with covered calls let's just stick to the point of 1% a week when you make 1% a week that's $1,000 a week on 100 K all right as you scale up as you put more money into your portfolio as more time passes on compound interest all of a sudden you're at 200k 500k 1 million this just takes time it doesn't take genius it doesn't take anything but time and strategy just like getting in good shape just takes go to the gym consistently eat properly get your sleep that's it all right same thing with getting rich it's freaking easy I'm at over $6 million in portfolio 3.5 million of the is through the appreciation of my options portfolio two portfolios and now it's easy but I'm making it look easy cuz I'm in my year 10 guys I'm in year 10 if you're in year zero year one it's okay just listen be a student be a sponge and and give it your time this takes time there's no shortcuts there is no shortcuts to investing all right there is maybe some tips there's some tricks that can make you better that can squeeze out a little bit more results but at the end of the day time in the market beats timing the market all right anyone will tell you that Warren Buffett the best investors your YouTubers won't tell you that because your YouTubers will be click baiting you with titles and thumbnails and listen I'm part of the game as well I'm just being as honest as possible with you guys at straightforward I show you my wins losses and everything now listen when you sell this put option at 30 what happens is 9:30 a.m. on Monday if paler is down you may want to go for the 29 strike okay why because as it gets closer to the current you know strike price of 30 you want to go down essentially because if pounder is at 29 you want to go for 28 if it's at 27 you want to go for 26 I go for right out of the money by this amount this amount a hair all right and that's a little bit more than a hair but I go a little bit out of the money because why I want to get assigned I want to get the shares if I go too far out of the money I won't get assigned if I go you know too in the money right if it's at 3155 and I go for uh 32 that's actually fine you can go for 32 and you'll get a sign and actually your break even here will be$ 29.75 so even selling in the money put options works it works actually pretty well because you will collect $2.23 as you can see right here but you will be assigned now again assignment's not bad so it's actually preference if you want to get assigned go for the 32 if you want to have uh you know kind of a medium chance of getting ass signed or not medium it's still high but 41 Delta here we're 4 41% chance of getting assigned then then go for 31 or 30 my personal preference is if paler opens up at 3155 in the morning I am going to go for 30 30 is a nice round number it's easy it's simple and I'm going to sell a $30 put option now listen if paler is going up that sucks all right it's so funny so many people like oh it's going up it's amazing listen it's actually not that good because when the stock goes up now it doesn't make sense to buy it it's like it's getting more expensive what are you happy about yeah you're making money on paper but are you cashing out if you cashed out go ahead and celebrate but since this is a long-term hold I actually don't like when the stock goes up because when it goes up it's getting more expensive and if it's more expensive that is a bad thing I want to see the stock on salale so when I see a stock crashing down 40% and all the uh investors are panicking and all the YouTubers are making the stock market crash videos I am celebrating I'm going like woohoo I'm making money I'm I'm getting my average dollar cost average lower I'm excited to put more money to work this is all good news unless you have no income if you're already in retirement listen I understand if you're already in retirement and got no income you got to go for the safer strategies I got strategies on this channel double dividend strategy I have several strategies in my Discord that just keep it very simple and yeah they don't they they go on stocks that don't even go up and down they just go sideways you know we got Coke we got craft Hines stuff like that that's not going to move I get it if you don't have any income and the stock goes down you're in a little bit of a rough situation at that point you just have to wait for it to recover but in other situations when you have income and you can put more money into your portfolio it's celebration time you get to dollar cost average down and by the way selling puts actually forces it forces you guys to dollar cost average so I'm telling you to sell puts because you I am forcing you to dollar cost average I'm just telling you this this uh this tip because I'm not even I'm very positive that if you dollar cost averages to a high quality company that you're going to end up gaining money so it's actually such just just simple all right so sorry if I'm rambling on a lot a little bit of a different style today I'm very happy that I got my camera here my phone camera at least cuz I haven't been on camera for a little bit all right so you sell the put $30 that's good now once you do get a signed then you want to go for covered calls the covered calls can make you a little bit more money um than 1% a week actually because a covered call uh if you do a little bit out of the money you get some built-in upside all right so if if I buy the stock for 31 let's say I bought it for 30 all right or or 3155 the current price if I was to sell it for the 33 strike price right here you can see that I'm going to collect $147 that's the premium that I'm going to get paid but also because this is a covered call meaning I got 100 shares and I'm selling a call option that is covered because if you don't have a the 100 shares and you just sell a call option A you won't be able to because your brokerage won't let you unless you're a high netw worth individual that has uh I think level three margin trading uh available all right so unless that's the case which you know that's more advanced strategy which I'm not going to cover on YouTube because too many people on a broad audience will get confused on that so I want to keep very safe my goal is that everyone makes money safely and passively but I do use margin but that's a separate topic for a different uh for a different time so 33 you have to have 100 shares sell a $33 call option get $147 and now you have some upside because you bought the stock at 30 or 3155 so either way you have some upside up until 33 if it hits 33 you're out you don't even have to do anything you'll just get a sign someone else will exercise their rights to to basically take the stock from you and you're lose a stock that's fine right because you bought the stock at let's say 30 or 3155 in 6 weeks you ended up selling a put option to get in collecting what was it like uh I forget what it was it was like $100 to get in oh no it was $130 to get in then you wait a little bit and you get $147 to get out so 130 plus 147 that's like $270 and all of a sudden you're looking at 10% in 6 weeks all of a sudden these pennies started to add up all of a sudden you're getting a lot wealthier and your portfolio is growing all of a sudden you only have one problem pay taxes now I don't have I'm not a tax adviser so I'm really good at creating income but then you got to pay the taxes right so good problems to have high quality problems to have I got problems in my life but they're all high quality problems guys so I want to give you some high quality problems get richer use the wheel strategy sell puts do covered calls use palent here also use other high quality companies I have a list of 20 to 30 stocks in my Discord Community basically I'm trading the same names guys the same names over and over and over again so that's the way I just like to do it

put option right here has a Delta of 34 okay 34 means there's a 34% chance of you getting assigned now listen 34% chance you win why do you win because you get assigned you oh wait wait what oh did I confuse you right there you think getting assigned is a bad thing no it is actually a good thing getting assigned is fantastic when it's a highquality company now typically people get all fearful oh I got a sign I'm I'm afraid I can lose all this money look at the max loss oh my goodness that Max loss is almost $3,000 no no completely wrong let me change your mindset right now the max loss says this because that's if the stock went to zero I don't know about you guys but with a brand with hundreds or thousands of employees the stock is not going to zero okay stocks don't typically go to zero unless they are scamming all right this company not a scam many companies I invest in actually 100% of the companies I invest in all have brand none of them are a scam all right so Palante here cannot go to zero it just can't all right I'd be willing to bet basically anything uh that it can't go to zero all right it just not so the max loss is incorrect that's actually not even true all right it's if it were to go down to zero now the max profit is $130 you might be saying to yourself well that's not a lot of money well yes it is a lot of money because $30 right that's $3,000 $ 1% is $30 $120 is 4% right I'm doing the mental math very simple Mental Math here you don't need any Physics degree or math degree you can be practically a ninth grade education to make money trading options because it's really not that hard there's nothing intensive about it you just need to know one strategy selling puts to get in so if you sell a uh put option here here $130 that's about 4% it's actually a little bit over 4% here you get paid over 4% and I'm going out 6 weeks right so 6 weeks is roughly like 42 days right this is 47 days so this is 6 weeks for 4% that's almost 1% a week right but listen when you have a portfolio that's 100 Grand all right and you're basically making about 1% a week and by the way I'll talk about covered calls in just a moment you can make a little bit more with covered calls let's just stick to the point of 1% a week when you make 1% a week that's $1,000 a week on 100 K all right as you scale up as you put more money into your portfolio as more time passes on compound interest all of a sudden you're at 200k 500k 1 million this just takes time it doesn't take genius it doesn't take anything but time and strategy just like getting in good shape just takes go to the gym consistently eat properly get your sleep that's it all right same thing with getting rich it's freaking easy I'm at over $6 million in portfolio 3.5 million of the is through the appreciation of my options portfolio two portfolios and now it's easy but I'm making it look easy cuz I'm in my year 10 guys I'm in year 10 if you're in year zero year one it's okay just listen be a student be a sponge and and give it your time this takes time there's no shortcuts there is no shortcuts to investing all right there is maybe some tips there's some tricks that can make you better that can squeeze out a little bit more results but at the end of the day time in the market beats timing the market all right anyone will tell you that Warren Buffett the best investors your YouTubers won't tell you that because your YouTubers will be click baiting you with titles and thumbnails and listen I'm part of the game as well I'm just being as honest as possible with you guys at straightforward I show you my wins losses and everything now listen when you sell this put option at 30 what happens is 9:30 a.m. on Monday if paler is down you may want to go for the 29 strike okay why because as it gets closer to the current you know strike price of 30 you want to go down essentially because if pounder is at 29 you want to go for 28 if it's at 27 you want to go for 26 I go for right out of the money by this amount this amount a hair all right and that's a little bit more than a hair but I go a little bit out of the money because why I want to get assigned I want to get the shares if I go too far out of the money I won't get assigned if I go you know too in the money right if it's at 3155 and I go for uh 32 that's actually fine you can go for 32 and you'll get a sign and actually your break even here will be$ 29.75 so even selling in the money put options works it works actually pretty well because you will collect $2.23 as you can see right here but you will be assigned now again assignment's not bad so it's actually preference if you want to get assigned go for the 32 if you want to have uh you know kind of a medium chance of getting ass signed or not medium it's still high but 41 Delta here we're 4 41% chance of getting assigned then then go for 31 or 30 my personal preference is if paler opens up at 3155 in the morning I am going to go for 30 30 is a nice round number it's easy it's simple and I'm going to sell a $30 put option now listen if paler is going up that sucks all right it's so funny so many people like oh it's going up it's amazing listen it's actually not that good because when the stock goes up now it doesn't make sense to buy it it's like it's getting more expensive what are you happy about yeah you're making money on paper but are you cashing out if you cashed out go ahead and celebrate but since this is a long-term hold I actually don't like when the stock goes up because when it goes up it's getting more expensive and if it's more expensive that is a bad thing I want to see the stock on salale so when I see a stock crashing down 40% and all the uh investors are panicking and all the YouTubers are making the stock market crash videos I am celebrating I'm going like woohoo I'm making money I'm I'm getting my average dollar cost average lower I'm excited to put more money to work this is all good news unless you have no income if you're already in retirement listen I understand if you're already in retirement and got no income you got to go for the safer strategies I got strategies on this channel double dividend strategy I have several strategies in my Discord that just keep it very simple and yeah they don't they they go on stocks that don't even go up and down they just go sideways you know we got Coke we got craft Hines stuff like that that's not going to move I get it if you don't have any income and the stock goes down you're in a little bit of a rough situation at that point you just have to wait for it to recover but in other situations when you have income and you can put more money into your portfolio it's celebration time you get to dollar cost average down and by the way selling puts actually forces it forces you guys to dollar cost average so I'm telling you to sell puts because you I am forcing you to dollar cost average I'm just telling you this this uh this tip because I'm not even I'm very positive that if you dollar cost averages to a high quality company that you're going to end up gaining money so it's actually such just just simple all right so sorry if I'm rambling on a lot a little bit of a different style today I'm very happy that I got my camera here my phone camera at least cuz I haven't been on camera for a little bit all right so you sell the put $30 that's good now once you do get a signed then you want to go for covered calls the covered calls can make you a little bit more money um than 1% a week actually because a covered call uh if you do a little bit out of the money you get some built-in upside all right so if if I buy the stock for 31 let's say I bought it for 30 all right or or 3155 the current price if I was to sell it for the 33 strike price right here you can see that I'm going to collect $147 that's the premium that I'm going to get paid but also because this is a covered call meaning I got 100 shares and I'm selling a call option that is covered because if you don't have a the 100 shares and you just sell a call option A you won't be able to because your brokerage won't let you unless you're a high netw worth individual that has uh I think level three margin trading uh available all right so unless that's the case which you know that's more advanced strategy which I'm not going to cover on YouTube because too many people on a broad audience will get confused on that so I want to keep very safe my goal is that everyone makes money safely and passively but I do use margin but that's a separate topic for a different uh for a different time so 33 you have to have 100 shares sell a $33 call option get $147 and now you have some upside because you bought the stock at 30 or 3155 so either way you have some upside up until 33 if it hits 33 you're out you don't even have to do anything you'll just get a sign someone else will exercise their rights to to basically take the stock from you and you're lose a stock that's fine right because you bought the stock at let's say 30 or 3155 in 6 weeks you ended up selling a put option to get in collecting what was it like uh I forget what it was it was like $100 to get in oh no it was $130 to get in then you wait a little bit and you get $147 to get out so 130 plus 147 that's like $270 and all of a sudden you're looking at 10% in 6 weeks all of a sudden these pennies started to add up all of a sudden you're getting a lot wealthier and your portfolio is growing all of a sudden you only have one problem pay taxes now I don't have I'm not a tax adviser so I'm really good at creating income but then you got to pay the taxes right so good problems to have high quality problems to have I got problems in my life but they're all high quality problems guys so I

Invest with Henry,acsOliQVt9U,2024-08-29T20:12:43Z,Buying Call Options Tutorial and Close For Profit,Apple,"first thing that you want to do is pick a stock so I'm going to be using apple right now but I'm also going to show you some different examples so using Apple the first thing I'm going to do is Click trade Apple options now you want to decide if you want to go for a short-term expiration or a long-term expiration so here I'm going to use a shorter term expiration and go for October 18th now if you scroll down further you can pick an expiration that goes out until 2025 and even out until 2026 I'm going to cover the benefits of going longer term and going for a leap option so anything that's over one year is going to be considered a leap option I'll go over that in just a second using October 18 you can see how the option chain here provides us many different strikes all of these strikes regardless of which option that you pick gives you control or leverage of 100 shares buying a call option gives you 100 shares of exposure let's go for the 235 call option right here you can see that I can purchase this call option it'll cost me around $715 now this gives me the right to buy Apple at $235 per share and this option expires October 18th so basically if Apple goes above 235 I'm going to be controlling 100 shares and I can exercise my right to buy 100 shares at any time however you don't actually want to exercise what you want to do is you want to make a profit on the option itself the whole goal of buying call options is you can buy them cheap and sell them more expensive you can see right here that if I click continue I'm going to have like a confirmation page right here so I can enter the amount of contracts that I want let's say five or 10 and right now you will see that there's a bid and ask price say that you want to buy 10 contracts of Apple call option typically there will be a bid and ask well because the stock market is full of buyers and sellers a person selling this option should want $710 a person buying this option wants to pay $6.90 if you want to get executed on this option you can either put a market order in your brokerage or if you're using really any brokerage Robin Hood then you want to put a limit price you want to put a limit price that you will get filled you can also see in my other portfolio I'm going to show you an example of Apple in the same way so if I click apple right now if you're using another brokerage is going to be basically the same exact thing so if I go to trade and then I go to open a position and then I go to option I can now enter a symbol so I can enter AAPL call and then you'll see I have all the data here very similar to Robin Hood every brokerage is very very similar so if I go to action I can buy to open you always want to buy to open if you want long exposure into a call option you're betting on it rising and if you don't have the position you buy to open now if you already have the position open then you can also sell it to close however I want to buy to open again you can pick the amount of contracts that you want so 1 2 3 and Etc here you can pick expiration date so I'm going to go for the 1018 expiration again now I'm going to pick the expiration so I'm also going to pick 235 and now you will see that the bid and the ask is basically the same thing as I just showed you on Robin Hood there would be no way that one brokerage would have better options than another brokerage because then there would be a potential for Arbitrage Arbitrage basically means that there's two different prices for the same option or the same good in general now let's talk a little bit more about strategy I like buying call options when I'm bullish I'm buying call options because I want exposure to upside you can see here on the profit loss chart right here that essentially if you're going to be buying this call option at 235 then you start making money at 24210 well why is that well it's because you're paying $710 in this example and that is going to be added to the strike price so 235 is a strike price you're paying about $7 so your break even is going to be $242 and that means that you're not going to make money unless it goes above 242 but wait you can actually make money at any time and you can take a profit on the option before expiration this right here is actually what happens at expiration so if the option goes until the last day of expiration if it's at 24210 you've broken even if it's anything above you've made a profit but actually call options are very interesting because you can make money in say a day or even an hour or even a minute that happens when the stock Rises so as you can see right here the option isn't moving that much but if Apple stock moves up by $1 then the call option right here would actually move up by about 50 that's because when the stock moves up by a dollar you can calculate how much the option will move up by simply adding the Delta multiplied by the call options by multiplying the Delta times how much the stock has gone up so if it has gone up $1 it's going to go up by 50 Cents on the option if it has gone up by $2 it's going to go up by $1 on the option you can always do that by multiplying Delta and the move higher so say that I think apple is going to be a $240 stock would I buy this call option well it depends if I think 240 will happen at expiration I would actually not buy this option because the break even price is $242 per share that means that I would actually lose $2 if I were to buy this call option and it were to go to $240 per share at expiration mind you Apple's currently at $232 as I'm making this video now if it actually went to $240 and that happened in the next one or two days then I would actually make a lot of money it would go to $240 the current price is $232 that means I would have a rise of $8 and the Delta right here would basically mean that the option would go up in value by $4 now why the difference why is it that at expiration things are so different than just a couple of days well that's because of theta okay every single day the option is expiring so in a short amount of time if the stock goes up the option will make a lot of money because Theta hasn't really kicked in but as the option approaches expiration then Theta is really kicking in it's going to take a big chunk out of your option so in this sense options can be very difficult and this is hard to calculate but the whole point of buying a call option that you make money as the stock Rises and you hope that the stock Rises very quickly let me show you a trick using Yahoo finance I'm going to show you some technical analysis if you're buying call options you want to pick a stock that has really good momentum right now if I go to Apple and I go to the three-month chart Apple actually has very amazing momentum it has gone from $27 per share all the way to $232 per share in a very short amount of time in fact if you look right here this stock was actually $27 in early August and now in basically late August that's at $232 so that has been a really big move and in fact that's part of the reason why I've actually been able to catch Apple very early and I currently have a lot of my portfolio in Apple stock and I'm Up 3 $558,000 now I'm not personally buying call options because this channel is mainly about selling options however if you were to buy some call options in apple you would be absolutely printing money the trick is you want to find a stock that has low RSI so for Apple the RSI was actually around 35ish back when Apple really dipped here in early August this was a really bad day where a lot of people were panicking this is also a fantastic day for someone that is willing to take some risk to buy a call option see call option buying is pretty risky however at the same time the rewards that you can reap from buying a call option are absolutely huge you can double triple and much more extra money by buying call options right here from 207 to 232 this was a really big move on Apple what I typically like to look for is not just low RSI I also like to see really good momentum so I personally was not able to catch Apple at this low I'd be lying if I did however I did buy Apple at 216 and I actually got a really good pop still on the upward action because once I saw that this momentum had a really big recovery I jumped in on the action that's a really good thing that you want to look for in a Stock's chart because as a stock moves up and you buy a call option your call option is going to go up in value the option rules that I go for when I'm buying call options is I limit my call option exposure to just 2% per position so say that you have $50,000 that means 2% of $50,000 would be $1,000 you wouldn't want to put more than $1,000 in a single position because when you're buying a call option and if it doesn't go in your favor you can lose part of the option's income you can lose part of what you paid for the option or even the entire amount if the option expires and it's out of the money so it becomes really interesting on how to actually manage a call option when you buy call options you have to be ready for significant risk however you don't have to lose the entire amount if the option isn't going in your favor and half of the time has gone by and the option is not up in value and let's say that it's down about about 25% here's what I mean if the option is down 25% of what you paid so for example if I go back and go for let's actually go for a longer term option let's go for January 17 2025 so if I were to buy this option right here for $14 or $1,400 this is what I would do let's say that Apple goes sideways and it's not going in my favor and this option is now worth $11.50 I'm actually taking $3.50 off of this option premium because 1/ half the option premium is 7ven and half of seven is 3 and A2 so I know that half of a half is 25% so I just did the mental math and I know internally that at around $11.50 that would be a 25% loss now for me that would be a really good time to cut this option position because if you've lost 25% on the option it could be a very good time to cut your losses and manage your risk.",1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,GMLZ-xk8Sp8,2024-08-27T20:07:00Z,How to Grow Small Accounts FAST (Iron Condor FULL Guide),Nvidia,let's just start off with Nvidia well let me pull up Nvidia on a chart let me just show you real quick some technical analysis if I go to the Chart you will see that Nvidia has shut up a lot it has increased a lot in value that is potentially it's at the top of it bowling or band that means that in the short term I don't think Nvidia is going to rise too much more in fact I'm probably going to go ahead and open open up an iron Condor play right now all right so it shot up a lot but I am bullish on it I think a lot of people are bullish I think it could come back down but it won't come back down too much the moving average is 109 and the bowling Band Middle is 112 and really good support at 95 that's the bottom all right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go a little bit higher here if I zoom out you can see there was a peak right here at 135 another Peak at 135 it's actually a very clear pattern at 135 135 you see so I don't don't think we're going to shoot up to 140 I in fact I would say 140 would be highly highly unlikely but there's also a lot of sorry this was resistance by the way I apologize support would be right around here around 103 we had a really big balance from the 9899 level and then there was just a huge rally back in the day we surpassed 100 easily this was back in in May so right now I think that Nvidia will trade between these two so I'm going to set up what's called an iron Condor so first of all I'm going to sell a put option all right so the put option I'm going to sell is going to be you know a bit lower it's going to be around that 105 level I already have the 105 opened up so I'm just going to be increasing my position since I already did this on Monday on Discord so I sold a put option now I'm going to buy a put option this put option right here that I sold is at 12 Delta it's very low very far out of the money okay so the chances of getting assigned here are very very low all right if the position goes to 105 I will look to close out the position in terms of managing the position I will look to close it out so now I'm going to go ahead and buy a put option I'm going to go ahead and buy it at 105 I like a gap of $5 here that's a you know good Gap not necessarily four or five or or 10 or any of that is better but five is just very easy to manage so on both sides I'm going to be doing that as you can see here Robin Hood has this as a put credit spread because I have sold a put option I have bought a lower strike put option um collecting a premium of $55 so far I haven't executed the trade but I'm going to be up $55 if I execute right now all right so this is a put credit spread to open up an iron Condor an iron Condor is just a combination of a put credit spread and a call Credit spread so as I mentioned I don't think it video is going to go up above 140 the option premium here is very very high likely because we do have earnings coming up so in that case I probably want to go even higher so the bowling band we're at the top it's unlikely to go to 140 but because there's already earnings coming up I'm going to be very very cautious and I'm actually going to go up and pick a very low Delta all right now I'm being more cautious than needed I think but you know I'm going to go for a 155 so let's go ahead sell the 155 and then I'm going to go ahead and buy the 160 all right and now you'll see that this is an iron Condor short iron Condor I will collect around $18 $115 let's hit continue here I'm just going to do the 15 contracts and let me go ahead and try to collect 1.12 all right a112 I can go for15 but I want to make a nice short and be efficient so there we go we got filled 15 contracts so on the putot side we sold 105 and 110 all right that is good so that is NVIDIA,1.0,0.6

I'm currently up money on American Airlines. The first stock I have is going to be American Airlines. I like Airlines because they're essential to the economy people are going to be flying this stock cannot go bankrupt because it's essential to the economy so the government won't let Airlines go bankrupt so a very good company overall because I like the brand. American Airlines as a brand is very good. You can see that it's currently right under $10, it's actually showing really good signs of momentum, has bottomed out at 9.28 and I have recently bought it for multiple different prices. I actually recommended a Buy on this at $9.50. My current position I am down down 11 Grand on this position right now and I have 11.5 covered calls that are going to be expiring. The current position has already made me $510 so I'm just going to take profit. As it's hovering around $10 per share my average cost is $13.90. I'm actually going to be increasing my position and I'm going to be selling some put options and covered calls. The first trade is going to be American Airlines, I'm going to sell a put option. I don't think American Airlines is even going to go down to the bottom of the bowling band to be honest with you, I'm going to be fairly aggressive. I collected $160 right before fees. If I go to buy American Airlines I'm going to just go ahead and buy shares, I'm going to buy let's just go for 300 shares. News flash American Airlines is $10 right now so if I have to buy at 950 I'm pretty happy to be honest with you because I'm getting a better price than what the market is giving me. I sold some put options we made $160 so far and now although my average cost is $3.54 I still want to make some income guys, I'm going to go ahead and sell a covered call option. As American Airlines kind of goes up in price you know I'm just going to kind of sit put and relax. So in add addition to the $160 now we made $559.

I also have 60 covered calls on chipot which are going to expire in September as well. I want to get a little bit more exposure into Chipotle stock so what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell a put option. I'm bullish on Chipotle why because fast casuals growing. Chipotle has 3,000 stores give or take and I think that they can build up a lot more stores. Their same store sales of how many people are coming back to Chipotle to eat at the restaurant is growing. I think supply chain is very good as well. They have a very simple menu so I would say that they're more, they're not premium but they're better than McDonald's in the sense that a more healthc conscious consumer which is the trend right now. I'm really really bullish on the business model. Now I will say that they did lose their CEO recently, you know it went over to Starbucks but hey you know I still I'm still very bullish.

I'm up $1,400 on it. I think that Apple will go up if we if we look at the three-month chart I think that this is still going to be a bull run for Apple. The peak here was around $235 per share so I would say that doing some rough estimates and without having to do too much technical analysis in this video using simple Logic the high for Apple was 235, this is a fairly safe point to sell a covered call. I do not want to lose Apple for multiple reasons, one of them being tax reasons so I want to be safe and I'm going to sell a $235 call option. If Apple goes to 235 and it hits that price I'm going to immediately roll.

Invest with Henry,Qw3KlvRInG0,2024-08-14T21:14:27Z,WARNING ON PALANTIR STOCK (PLTR) - I'm Doing This Right Now,Apple,"but if you want to own the stock anyways so say that you really like apple and you sell Apple 160 put okay going into apple right now if you were to get assigned that wouldn't be a bad thing that means that you would get apple at a good price since the stock is currently at $170 per share so when selling put options the number one thing that you want to look for is a stock that you want to own you also want to find a stock that has a good support So how do you find support you basically want to find a stock that has already been trending down or has already hit a level where it's unlikely to go below so you can see here that over the past 3 months Apple has kind of bottomed out and had a decent bounce even from the March level of 169 it is um showing some signs of just going sideways right now plus not to mention apple is a really good brand so if I were to sell a put option right now it would be on Apple so I would just go to Apple um options okay then I would go into sell put option now the best expirations for put options is it really depends on what you want to accomplish okay so if you want to go for weekly income you can sell options that are expiring every single week if you want to go for a monthly income you can go for options expiring every month one is not necessarily better than the other so whether you collect $1,000 in a week or you know $4,000 in a month it's the same amount but you get more I guess more permutations in the weekly strategy you get to see it more often you get to have more experience but in the long term as you sell options as you get more experience as this stuff becomes more easy consistent and passive for you I do recommend going for monthly expirations so I'm going to show you a one-month option expiration I'm going to make you know the option expiration right now May 24th if you're watching this in the future it doesn't really matter just copy the same logic that I'm showing you with you know put options right now my same thought process and just do it for your favorite stock whether that's Apple whether that's Google or Amazon or any stock but I will say that you don't want to do the strategy on a stock that doesn't have much liquidity I'll show you what that looks like in just a second after I finish that Apple put example so check it out if I were to go ahead and sell a put option at 160 and I um expand this right now you will see that the bid here is 176 and the ask is 182 what that means is if you were to be a buyer you would be kind of forced to buy closer to 182 and if you were to be a seller you'd have to kind of sell it closer to 176 the thing is that's not necessarily a good thing well it's actually not a good thing at all that's why you want to find a option that has a tight bit ask spread now this is is actually considered tight this is a $6 Gap here so that means that you're losing about $3 cuz you're probably going to get filled by about the midpoint okay so if you were to execute this trade you wouldn't get 176 you also wouldn't get 182 you're going to be executing somewhere in between so about $179 okay so if you were to sell this option you would get paid $179 okay by opening up one contractor the Delta here is 21 so there's a 21% chance of this happening which means that there's about a 79 % chance of this not happening so if you were to sell put option on Apple right now this is why I love the strategy so much is you would only get a sign about one out of five times that means four out of five times you win and the one out of five times that you lose you don't actually lose you just get ass signed on Apple stock this is exactly how I would open up a trade I would look for an expiration day of 28 days I would also pick a strike price that is well below the current stock price now keep in mind if you go lower then you're not going to collect as much income because the lower that I go the lower the income becomes but the closer I am to the stock price obviously it's going to be more expensive because your risk of getting assigned is also a lot more so if I go to an at the money option at the money option is basically something that's right at the same price of the stock you can see here how the Delta is 046 so that is pretty expensive now what we're going to talk about right now is how to manage a sellp put okay this is really important because a lot of people open up a position they don't know how to close it but the good news is is by selling put options is actually one of the most simplest strategies ever because when I sell a put option the only thing that I do is I wait until expiration so at expiration what happens is either it's out of the money which is cool and then I just wait over the weekend and on Monday I will sell another put option or on Monday what I'll do is if I got assigned the shares that's totally fine I wanted to get assign the shares anyways so either I can hold those you know shares of stock can wait for it to recover I can just hold for the long term or I can turn around and start generating income with those shares I'll drop you a video about covered calls that's the covered call strategy but I want to show you another example of selling puts and what I would not do as well as best tricks of how to make more money consistently by selling put options so I have a watch list right here and I would basically look at you know different stocks that I like so right now these are the stocks that I hold Apple Amazon American Airlines paler",1.0,0.8

The next thing is Amazon FBA this is pretty similar to drop shipping but you need to again buy inventory and Bowl can pay for storage fees which can be very costly so again when it comes to physical products there's a lot of upfront cost and Amazon is flooded with sellers who may have similar products so you don't really have an edge that's what makes it really difficult when you're selling products you don't have a brand necessarily you could have a brand but it's typically very hard to build a wide mode so anyone can compete with you if you're selling.,1.0,-0.8

Invest with Henry,HFjgK1jePG0,2024-08-10T17:02:11Z,Why Palantir Stock (PLTR) Will Go To $50 (HUGE NEWS),Palantir,"guys listen I've covered paler since the very beginning here's proof on the very first day that it traded that I bought it three years ago hi my name is Henry in this video we're touching base on paner which just made its Wall Street debut paner Technologies is a secretive data company best known for taking on controversial work for the US government and it's finally available on the US Stock Market the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol pltr just around 1:30 Easter at $10 per share up from the reference price listed by the New York Stock Exchange of $7.25 per share now the stock is pushing $30 per share it's been a very easy money play for me and I think we have more upward action to come on the stock especially with the Microsoft deal Microsoft and paler announced they will bundle their AI services for for US military and intelligence with Microsoft contributing GPT 4 and other open AI model and paler throwing in its targeting data analysis and action proposing tools this is the first partnership around deploying Microsoft Azure open AI service in classified environment paler CTO shyam Sankar noted in a statement though Microsoft on its own did deploy GPT for to its Azure government top secret environment in May and of course the relevant government agencies still need to buy bite Microsoft and palun say their combined Services could be used in logistics Contracting and action planning amongst other things as military.com reported last month there is little agreement among the Armed Forces regarding the use of generative AI some have security concerns such as the space force which has paused the use of the technology and the Navy the Army is reportedly more open to generative AI though it still lacks clear rules to govern its use earlier this week paler also delivered a tactical intelligence targeting access test note or Titan as abbreviation prototype to a military base in Washington state AXS reported Titan is a wheel ground station system that uses AI to assist targeting decisions based on data collected from sensors in the air on land and in space paler won $178 million Army deal a couple of months back and it will develop 10 Titan prototypes for testing bearing in mind that we're talking about what's generally seen as a data company it's remarkable that it's now delivering Hardware thanks to subcontract such as northr grummond and anderl all right guys given all of that information I'm going to show you what I'm doing on paler I've showed you a few times now but I'm going to show you a little bit in a different way right now because given how much paler is going up in terms of its bullishness I think the stock can be $42 per share I'm just placing this as an estimate because from here on out I think we can see like a 30% pop in the stock it's going to take some time it's not going to happen in a couple of weeks but I can see the stock making a really big move of 30% in the next 6 to 12 12 months so I want to show you my current position I still have the 5,000 shares I'm actually going to sell some more put options right now so I actually need to clear up some capital in my portfolio I need to close out one of my current trades because I currently have literally almost no buying power whatsoever you can see I'm currently up on paler and I've already made 98% on meta this was a play that I gave to the Discord community and what I'm going to do is I'm going to close this out for a profit cuz as you can see here I'm up 98% $582 and you know it still has $80 more but I do prefer to put this to work on paler so I'm going to buy this to close I'm going to buy all five contracts I'm going to close out the five contracts right here I'm going to have to pay maybe 16 or $17 let's just be efficient in this video and get right to the points I'm going to submit this order and that just got filled so I made a really good profit of almost what is it $5,900 minus $85 so $581 15 from May 6th so that did take a couple of months but see what I did here I just opened this position I literally did nothing and now just Clos it out for a you know a pretty big profit all you have to do is just have several of these positions in your portfolio and life is pretty good I'll tell you it's a pretty simple process of just selling puts and running the wheel strategy which is what I've been telling you guys to do on paler for a long time and as you guys saw in the beginning of the video been making paler videos with proof for 3 years I bought it actually on IPO date so been in this stock for a very long time and I still believe that running the wheel strategy is very profitable you see I have 5,000 shares and now that I have some more money at my disposal I going to sell some more put options I I currently have a 27 put 23 put and then 27 call and 25 call so I want to add some exposure because I don't currently have that much exposure since I do have covered calls of which by the way I have to roll up if you want to see a video by the way of me rolling up a covered call for a debit or even a credit I can show you both scenarios just comment down below I can make a video on rolling covered calls specifically um because I do have several covered calls that I probably should be rolling right now so let me go to September 20 I'm going to go ahead and sell put on September 20 now I'm going to look at the delta the Delta here is 02 that's very safe I'm very comfortable with that like very very comfortable so this right here represents roughly a 3% return in 42 days not that bad so this is a 3% return because you know three times the $25 is a $75 so this is almost 3% return you know in a little bit under 6 weeks so I'm going to go ahead and do this I currently have buying power of $270,000 so if I sell 10 contracts right here that's going to be roughly you know $29,000 I think I'm comfortable with honestly selling like 20 cont contracts so I'm going to sell 20 contracts for $71 collect $1,419 right now so I'm going to submit this order and it should get filled yep so I got filled so I just collected $1,437 and opened up 20 more contracts on Palante here by selling a put option at the 26 strike price",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,3bKEElxfJoU,2024-08-08T20:30:00Z,Wheel Trading: Ultimate Steady Guide To Monthly Income (BEGINNERS),Apple,"now obviously the top 10 stocks are very heavily weighted like apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta um burshard Eli Lily Broad these stocks have a very heavy waiting but nonetheless the rest of the 490 stocks that they hold add a lot of diversification Say you have $30,000 and you put $10,000 or hey $15,000 into Apple well you can't really dollar cost more into Apple because it's already 50% of your portfolio so when you are dollar cost averaging into the wheel strategy you want to make sure that you have 5 10 15% of your entire money in a single position therefore if it does go down you can do more of the wheel strategy on the same stop dollar cost averaging but not exceeding like 30 or 40% of your portfolio unless it's a really big cap stock like apple then Apple breaks rules absolutely Microsoft Amazon all these stocks can break rules but and even in that case magnificent 7 you're still taking a risk if you're overleveraging into one stock I can show you what that actually looks like right now so I can go for a stock let's say Apple going to show you an example you can sell an in the money put and that would be really interesting I have a really big position on Apple Apple's been in a really tough spot lately but I'm still up about 11% $161,000 if I show you selling a put option on Apple let's just say I'm going to go for a really shortterm put option you can see here how if I sell an in the money put okay this is in the money because if I sell a 210 put Apple stock is below 210 you can see here how I'm collecting $4 and 210 minus 4 is basically 206 so I can get below the average cost right now so at the very least you should be using options to get a better price than what the stock is trading at right now so this right here would be aggressively selling put options and then you would be very high probability of getting a sign again that's not a bad thing if you're bullish on the company and uh over overall I do go for out of- the money options so here I would go for something like maybe even 202 and a half because the Delta is going to be right around that. 3 Mark which I like so this is 0 28 Delta just a little bit lower than what I like but that's perfectly fine it's not necessarily uh Better or Worse the volume here is insane so much volume short-term expiration right again if you're watching this in the future just use the same logic the same thought process to to uh implement this strategy for yourself on any stock really so if I were to sell this you can see how I'm going to get paid $144 so you can go for in the money options or out of the money options personally would tell you that out of the money options are just way more profitable but when you're running the wheel strategy it is a profitable strategy as a whole so you can go for 50 Delta or even just a little bit higher I I wouldn't go too crazy with high Deltas though okay the Theta right here is going to eat away at this option 100% in the next three days if apple is not below 202.5 so as long as Apple kind of hovers around these levels the Theta is going to completely eat up this option which is a good thing for you if you are selling options then you get this money right now and as it decays and goes down to zero or close to zero you can actually think about closing out this option.",1.0,0.7

Invest with Henry,ZJQy3v6QIaU,2024-08-06T15:28:29Z,Palantir READY TO EXPLODE,Palantir,"guys I have said Palantir is a top pick for the wheel strategy and just in general I am bullish and we have gotten some key important information in news that I'm going to be covering this video I'm very proud of my Discord members that are holding shares and doing covered calls because this stock has provided us with some very solid income as you can see Palantir is up a lot pre-market it's up almost 10% after the earnings my members have stayed cool Cal and collected and bought the dip on the stock and being very bullish has proven to be a very smart decision the company posted $37 million in commercial Revenue up 33% from a year before and just above the 306 million fact set consensus us commercial Revenue was up 55% from a year before the bigger Topline beat came in the government business where Revenue was up 23% from a year before to come in at $371 million analysts were modeling 349 million Palantir Revenue outlook for the third quarter calls for 697 million to 701 million while analy are expecting 681 million I'm going to bet that this is just the beginning of many earnings beats Palantir is likely to continue Rising due to its relationships strong track record and Innovation I have no doubt based on the facts I've read and people I've talked to in the industry that Palantir is having a real impact on their customers product fulfillment and customer experience is the most important factor in a company's long-term growth and that is what I'm paying very close attention to this gives me a lot of long-term confidence in the stock running the wheel on Palantir has provided me with a very solid income and that's what I'm going to go over in just a moment but first I want to say that they have a very bright future and the best part is that the numbers support their Vision here's a bit about Alex Karp's vision and then I want to show you the options it is that you can build a great business be aligned with America and the West that that alignment will make you stronger and better that your software products will actually be products and not Powerpoints and that you can actually build something with the best people in the world the best investors in the world that will lead to structural advantages of course all along the way we had many many doubters we had people that thought we would never be profitable we had now we are over seven quarters in profitability I thought people that we would never be able to grow the revenue we'd never be able to re accelerate uh US the US government because of its it's often opaque but we asserted that product superiority would overcome many of the vicissitudes and difficulties of working with the over government witness re acceleration we we we asserted that uh that our products were the precursor to making llms valuable that they that we would productize how you create this value much the way hyperscalers as sham had mentioned had priortize other technical issues and that that we would give those that prioritization to our customers witness our 70% after smack quarter the third quarter in the row where we're growing at what amounts to a ridiculous rate and there's a witness the reacceleration of our Global business xact to 30% witness our backlog look at any part of our business then it is like well how are we doing this is a really long interesting question that people will dedicate their academic careers on but but we do not have time to address and it may not be learnable for everyone but we do do it Alex Karp used the word hyperscalers and that's what I think is going to happen with the stock in the next 12 to 24 months I think the stock is going to rise in price because the Palantir as a business itself is in the hyperscaler stage now let me show you some options that I'm looking at right now and obviously I've had Palantir for a very long time I currently have 5,000 shares in this portfolio I also have several thousand shares in my other portfolio this position right here makes up 5.71% of My overall portfolio and I have plenty of options right now where I'm running the wheel strategy now I want to talk about the wheel strategy and how you should implement this on Palantir given that the opening of the market will have Palantir basically up about 9 or 10% it's not clear yet as I'm making this video right before Market opens so I'm going to try to do my best to predict what can happen although I'm not the best at predicting I just want to show you a simple logic simple strategy that you can use I'm going to pick an option going out to September 20th and I'm simply going to sell puts now guys selling puts is literally the number one strategy that you should be using to enter into stocks and get a better price for the stock I've said this many times but Palantir is a very solid business I like the fundamentals of Palantir I like the technicals of Palantir and selling put options has allowed me to acquire more stock I've acquired more stock in Palantir without having to buy it at whatever the price is so let's say right now the stock opens up at 2641 I don't have to buy at 2641 I can actually go for an aggressive sellp put position like 26 strike this is actually very advantageous for a number of reasons first of all I'm going to get paid $355 that is a very large return actually very large return and specifically when I sell a put option if it goes down I'm completely okay with that now if it goes up I'm also okay with that because here you're going to get compensated so much that it doesn't really matter if Palantir Rises because you get paid in proportion to the volatility and to the expected return so what I mean by that is if Palantir is expect it rise and the whole Market is betting on it going up then basically when you're selling options you're going to get paid for part of that expectation so look here when you sell a put option you get paid if it goes up you still get to keep the premium but you won't participate and all of the upward action so for that reason that's why I'm not only running the wheel strategy I'm selling puts which is part of the wheel strategy I'm selling covered calls which is also part of the wheel strategy so I'm running both sides of the wheel strategy now technically the wheel strategy just means that you're selling put options once you get assigned you then start selling call options but for me I'm actually being even more proactive I'm running kind of three different strategies and they're very similar okay they're all related to each other first of all selling put options that's the first step of the wheel but instead of waiting to get assigned I'm also going for covered calls right now so I have 5,000 shares I plan to buy more so let's just say that I have or that you have 100 shares you can also just go for sell call option and sell a 29 call option right now you will get some upside on Palantir right as Palantir Rises but you also get premium so you'll also make $89 in this example right now this is of course before the Market opens up so I'm selling puts right now I'm selling covered calls right now and and I'm basically running the wheel and I'm being very proactive on Palantir because I've been a bull on this stock I've covered the stock actually for years if you go back in my channel and you type invest with Henry Palantir I've been covering the stock for a very long time and I've entered the stock many times throughout history and right now I'm still very very bullish I'm just very bullish for the next 12 to 24 months given what Alex Karp has said the CEO went to my high school I've Heard lots of good things from people working at the company from their customers I also know several uh customers not you know not personally but I've done my research I've talked to people I've gotten some insights which to me are just a screaming Buy on the stock I think that longterm the stock is going to continue to rise you know I'm not getting paid to promote the company I'm just simply bullish and I have my money invested here and I want to share my honest truth of what I'm invested in with you guys here as subscribers because I want you to understand what I'm investing in what I'm buying if you want a piggyback that's up to you but I'm just here to educate and I want you to get better at Option trading because this is something that has made a huge difference in my life it has given me so much freedom and when you trade options proper ly it's way safer than the stock market so for me this is basically something that I am using as my retirement strategy and Palantir you know it makes up 5% of my portfolio right now but I'm highly considering increasing my stake up to 10% of my portfolio on Palantir given all the in Innovation that they're going through as well as um you know the interview that I saw with Alex Karp as well as their earnings results as well as just mathematically speaking the numbers that they're putting out is just very bright overall so I don't want to say I told you guys so but I hope that you are going to pay attention to what I'm talking about with Palantir because there's a lot more to come.",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,tqkUC-BXK1M,2024-08-05T19:23:45Z,STOCK MARKET CRASH EXPLAINED! Should You Buy or Sell?,QQQ,I'm down 6% versus the market being down 12% or so on QQQ and I have a lot of important things that I'm about to cover on what you should be doing with the market what my opinion is of things that you should be investing in I have some notes in front of me right now I'm going to be talking about earnings I'm going to be talking about different stocks like apple meta AMD paler and first and foremost I just want to say that the FED is trying everything that they can to make sure that the market is going to be smooth and they're absolutely failing the FED is not even close to doing a good job in fact I think they're just insisting on letting everything completely collapse before they actually kind of do their job not saying they're not doing their job but taking a look at what they plan to do with interest rates and the market is basically pricing in a 50 basis point rate cut that's pretty ridiculous guys I don't think that's going to personally happen but the market is really spooked right there and uh just taking a look at my portfolio I'm not immune to this guys I'm still going down with the market however I'm down 6% whereas I'm going to talk about Starbucks I'm going to talk about some retail stocks because when you take a look at retail stocks they're in a even more trouble Starbucks and Nike in a lot of trouble in the past one month QQ is down 12% so I'm actually kind of celebrating in my community because being down 6% when everything else is down 12% is actually a huge win and that's a fact that I just showed you on the screen there's no inspect tool or nothing like that I'm literally showing you I'm down 6% % versus 12% so I'm admitting that I'm hurt but I'm hurt a lot less so there's a lot of things to learn here guys all right and specifically I want to talk about inflation right now right so inflation they're saying has eased off substantially but when you look at uh gas prices when you look at uh fueling up your car and transportation not really a lot of inflation has sort of cooled down in certain pockets of our economy but as a whole they're also manipulating our CPI okay what I mean by that is CPI is a basket of goods right they're tracking a basket of goods but they're taking certain things out of that CPI to basically manipulate the numbers to make it look like our inflation is actually going down when it really isn't okay real estate prices not really going down that much as well as fuel costs so I think there's a whole bunch of kind of Market manipulation kind of going on right now I'm not claiming anything I'm just saying that's what it looks like to me that's kind of my opinion there and also a lot of this stuff is political guys a lot of this stuff is political because it's an election year I think rate Cuts will help Democrats I think that Ray Cuts will help Democrats and that's why Democrats probably are trying to push more in that favor of a ray cut um because it's going to help them out now what the FED does will impact the market and I'm also not really clear on what's going to happen guys I'm not a genie I'm not omniscient I don't know what's going to happen but I will tell you that I am making some smart decisions right now with dollar cost averaging I am not panicking whatsoever I'm not stressed at all about the market even though I'm losing significant amounts of money I'm doing far better than the overall market so in many ways I actually want to Pat myself on the back because being down 6% when the market is down 12% is an extreme accomplishment extreme in one month 6% that's a 6% differential very very huge right there and I also want to highlight some some earnings plays guys there's a I know I'm all over the place in this video but I'm just trying to lay out out all these issues that I see and what we can do about these issues and they're just so many to list the FED inflation rate cuts and I briefly want to mention earnings okay so a recent earnings report from AMD and Microsoft were positive Apple was also positive but still we saw Warren Buffett cut his stake by was it about 50% so Burk Shar hathway has the most cash that they've ever literally had he has a lot of cash so Warren buff is basically pricing in a big crash okay he's basically pricing in a big pullback now there is some delay in information from 13f filings so when you look at what you know hedge funds and and Warren Buffett Etc are buying there is some delay there so it's not clear to me exactly why he cut a stake and it's still the biggest position in his portfolio but it's still very alarming to see an investor like Warren Buffett continuously raise more and more cash now this is actually where I disagree with Warren Buffett I don't believe in having cash at all a lot of people might call me stupid might call me crazy for not having cash but I've done just fine going to multiple s figure portfolios by not having any cash and in fact I see this as a big opportunity guys all the YouTubers there fearmongering and telling you it's it's time to sell or you should should be afraid that is incorrect it's factually incorrect it's not even just incorrect it's factually incorrect because the market when it pulls back that's literally the time to be buying it literally is the time for you to be dollar cost averaging timing the market and trying to get into cash is like the dumbest thing ever okay some people will say oh I'm going to time the market once I was right listen it's not about being right once it's about who is right in the end there's like a Russian saying it's not who laughs right now it's who laughs last okay it's all about who last last and it's all about your long-term results guys I'm trying to put the power and the knowledge in your hands okay what's going on with the FED right now very alarming but it doesn't mean that we need to sell out of our positions that means that we have to get into more high quality companies and right now you know QQ is just kind of going down a lot but in general I'm actually doing good on Chipotle okay I've sold some puts on Chipotle American Airlines is still going to be okay oil and gas like XLE I have ETF there I think that'll be okay as well and overall you can see that my portfolio and Snapchat being the bottom of my portfolio that's like my lowest position it's like makes up less than 1% of my portfolio and the top of my portfolio is Apple which makes up the biggest part of my portfolio I am still very very bullish on Apple they have tremendously good earnings but it's obviously going to be dragged down with the rest of the market as well as the Warren Buffett decision there to to kind of sell some of his shares so despite Apple having really really good earnings still going to dip guys we can't control short-term dips you really can't all right it's like a it's like like I was saying earlier it's like a flock of sheep okay a flock of sheep when one sheep kind of starts to run which is like typically the institutional investors because they do have some Insider information typically or they have some Advantage data which we don't have so the first sheep goes then more sheep are like hey why does that sheep alarm let me follow him and then the whole herd goes okay so that's what's happening right now it's herd behavior and herd psychology and that's why when I was studying in college for finance I worked the Goldman Sachs I have a finance degree I had two hedge fund experiences multiple millions of dollars in in in the stock market all the stuff that I've learned is that hurting behavior in human psychology is exactly what explains the market and I will tell you right now I am not panicking whatsoever I have zero fear zero fear even if the market goes down 50% I will actually be super excited to continue buying so more things I do want to cover though is Tom Lee this is a guy that I actually am looking at you know I'm not looking at no Jim Kramer I'm not looking at other YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about other YouTubers definitely don't know what they're talking about they're marketing experts and CNBC Jim Kramer they don't know what they're talking about either also it's all around fear mongering hype getting views getting attention now I'm in this game as well guys but I try to keep it as legit as possible as straightforward as possible no BS I'm showing you what I'm doing my gains my losses and my actual psychology not to get the views I want to actually tell you what I think and the only person I am actually looking at in terms of another person Tomley this guy is someone that I actually think he knows what what he's talking about okay so Tom Lee is more of the honest side and he was saying that basically NASDAQ could decline further that's what he was saying and he has been right about Tesla he's been right about many things and he has specifically talked about in CNBC I'm going to save you the time I'm trying to make this video quicker because I want to get this video out fast I didn't want to put the CNBC uh video here but basically he said pay attention to the vix the vixs hit 65 because the vix hit 65 that means there's elevated levels of anxiety in the market now that doesn't mean that you need to take action guys elevated vix just means that there's more premium to collect if you selling options it also means that there's more volatility in the market expect it I personally expect the vix to go down I personally think 65 is not going to happen for a very long time we were in the 14 range for very long time and now we see a very big spike and I think if you're selling at these levels mistake I think okay I think it's a mistake so I personally am selling certain stocks I'm getting out of Shopify today I got out of Shopify but I personally am not scared at all of the high quality of the tech stocks although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like you're crazy Nvidia is so bullish but we do see some of these stocks with high priced earnings ratios high price to sales ratios that are on the expensive side now pulling back and it is painful but I would not sell at these levels right now I also want to point out to you guys that if and when if and when when the recovery happens is going to recover very fast so although you're feeling a lot of pain right now today you're not really going to feel pain in 6 months from now or 12 months from now the market is going to recover markets tend to rise that's literally rule number one okay rule number one on uh from Buffett is don't lose money which is like a obvious rule right I don't need to repeat myself oh rule number one is don't lose money everyone knows that rule that's already a cliche rule my rule guys which I learned on Wall Street is markets tend to rise which is why I'm a Perma okay I'm not one of the Bears out there although I I realize that it's important to hedge your portfolio it's like right now with covered calls I'm being a little bit more aggressive to collect income not a bear by no means yes my title I need to get some clicks right because if I don't make my title market crash no one will click because everyone on YouTube does the same exact title unfortunately that is the game on YouTube but I'm being honest with you I'm delivering you the information that I personally in my heart believe which is do not panic do not sell do not cut your positions that are high quality positions this is what I believe in my heart and I'm telling you I'm literally buying more stock I'm literally going to be buying more stock there's more things I need to cover in this video a lot of important things actually kind of all over the place cuz obviously my emotions are high not from the market but from my students my Discord Community they're panicking so I feel really compelled my 45-minute call today was like an hour and 15-minute call because I want to add extra support to my subscribers to my Discord members I want to give everyone extra support right now because on a mental level this is very hard to deal with it's not hard for me at all guys this is not hard for me whatsoever financially it's also not hard for me from a belief perspective do I think we're going to recover do I have any doubts in my skills or my ability to invest not at all not at all this is to me this is actually easy mode I love to see some struggle this is actually a fantastic time for me to outperform and prove this is actually the time to prove that no other YouTuber doesn't have my results everyone is losing more money right now nobody has bought puts all the people fearmongering right now I'll do this this is the crash none of them bought puts what's up with those guys nobody bought puts nobody even has a results of -6% versus -2% those guys are down more than negative 12% way more guys people holding Nvidia stock all these people that are just pushing Nvidia I'm sorry to go off topic this not off topic I just want to point out that it can be really dangerous to be invested in just one stock Nvidia down 22% okay Tesla I don't need to prove myself all right facts speak for themselves 6% down versus 12% down on the market versus other YouTubers weigh down way more okay facts speak for themselves right U that was my Discord Community I want to talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little bit if you have the cash you should hold a little bit extra dry powder I personally don't have much dry powder but I think it it can be wise to have a little bit more dry powder just to see what happens with the FED stuff just to see what happens a little bit more with earnings you should be buying but don't just I'm going to put all my money to the market now I don't think any of you guys are doing that I think a majority of people watching my video and a majority of people investing right now are more on the cautious side they're more scared oh I'm going to sell everything no don't be that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I hated waking up in the morning I hated having a boss and I hated getting paid 85k to 120k it was really not that much money when I can make more money myself trading options I literally make way more money than that and I don't have any rules I don't have any regulations I don't have to worry about any of the any of the nonsense uh you know all those you know what I'm talking about I think this is a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm not going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not not 50 basis points 50 basis points going to be a bit high but the market is actually pricing in a higher percentage so we'll see on that now I want to talk about some interesting points which is low data uh there there's low data in terms of people are saying right now that employment numbers are really bad but I think there's low data points because why I think a lot of people are leaving the workplace but if you look at social media everyone is starting a new business so I think what's actually going on is employment numbers are low because nobody wants to work for a company for a big Corporation slaving their life away especially at the lower level positions okay that's also a big reason why Starbucks is in a lot of trouble Nike in trouble a lot of retail companies are in trouble I was looking at CNBC I like CNBC I just don't like I don't like the people always talking on CNBC I I do like uh that CNBC did a really deep dive Research into Starbucks and they were saying how stores keep opening up but same store sales are going down guys same store sales going down I don't even know like I want to take a bottle and like just like I I want to point to you how important how dire of a situation this is when you see same store sales going down this is the end of the world this is that is the end of the company now Starbucks is not going to go out of business but that is the end of that company Rising higher now Starbucks is going for very good valuation but I am no longer bullish on Starbucks I really want to buy it as well as Nike but same store sales going down guys this is Redline awful this is essentially you have a 100 customers come to your restaurant and then the next day 99 next day 98 next day '97 96 95 94 your restaurant's literally dying that's what's happening to Starbucks unfortunately not unfortunat I don't really care we don't have any Star we don't have much of a Starbucks position we've done fine on Starbucks but I'm just telling you I'm pointing out the fact that retail stocks are in big trouble big trouble huge trouble don't don't be invested in Starbucks Nike don't be invested in retail uh you need Big Brand right now Big Brand and Nike and Starbucks is obviously Big Brand but it's retail big Big Brand which is no go for me right now no go absolutely not uh Nike same thing with their shoes too much competition too much competition and I think small businesses right now are opening up uh you know for example luck and coffee I know they had like this whole scam but in China luck and coffee surpassed Starbucks same thing with in China there apple is not doing as well in China right now same thing with the Chinese automobiles hackling Tesla so guys right now it's a very interesting time to be invested in the market because I actually think it's a stock Pickers Market AKA it's my market it is my market right now I picked I picked Apple I picked many other good stocks which have led me to beat the market by a lot it's a stock pi Pickers market right now as well doing well on Palance your uh wheel strategy it's down but more or less I'm still doing better than the market due to the options themselves because the options allow me to get premium and income so the stock is down but the options are generated income which is hedging and protecting my portfolio and giving me that stability in the portfolio and like looking at small businesses that's where it's at right now small businesses is where it's at and that's going to hurt some of the big brands for sure hands down so startbucks Nike good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's fantastic because Amazon's more of that Marketplace they're not really yes they have a brand of course but it's not like they have a big YouTube channel or big social media presence they do but it's really the marketplace it's really the product business that's doing so well for Amazon it's literally demand for the Amazon Marketplace so brands are on Amazon so I'm not making an individual bet on a brand I'm just making a bet on a Marketplace and then being a middleman so that's why Amazon is fantastic stock right now whereas individual brands are kind of hard to bet on because they go up and they go down and they can go out of business fairly quickly so I don't really think we're going to get a 50 basis point cut I think we're going to be at about 25 I would say be logical be logical please do not get emotional I'm here on YouTube to educate to help I'm here to support you comment I'm going to read the comments of course my Discord Community has access to me I am here to support and to help you not lose money to invest money wisely to get to retirement that save passive income that's it that's my whole goal in life that's what I want please don't I mean if you want to panic and sell that's up to you my opinion is be strong right now be smart right now all right catch you guys in the next video,1.0,0.0
Invest with Henry,tqkUC-BXK1M,2024-08-05T19:23:45Z,STOCK MARKET CRASH EXPLAINED! Should You Buy or Sell?,Apple,I'm going to be talking about different stocks like apple meta AMD paler and first and foremost I just want to say that the FED is trying everything that they can to make sure that the market is going to be smooth and they're absolutely failing the FED is not even close to doing a good job in fact I think they're just insisting on letting everything completely collapse before they actually kind of do their job not saying they're not doing their job but taking a look at what they plan to do with interest rates and the market is basically pricing in a 50 basis point rate cut that's pretty ridiculous guys I don't think that's going to personally happen but the market is really spooked right there and uh just taking a look at my portfolio I'm not immune to this guys I'm still going down with the market however I'm down 6% whereas I'm going to talk about Starbucks I'm going to talk about some retail stocks because when you take a look at retail stocks they're in a even more trouble Starbucks and Nike in a lot of trouble in the past one month QQ is down 12% so I'm actually kind of celebrating in my community because being down 6% when everything else is down 12% is actually a huge win and that's a fact that I just showed you on the screen there's no inspect tool or nothing like that I'm literally showing you I'm down 6% % versus 12% so I'm admitting that I'm hurt but I'm hurt a lot less so there's a lot of things to learn here guys all right and specifically I want to talk about inflation right now right so inflation they're saying has eased off substantially but when you look at uh gas prices when you look at uh fueling up your car and transportation not really a lot of inflation has sort of cooled down in certain pockets of our economy but as a whole they're also manipulating our CPI okay what I mean by that is CPI is a basket of goods right they're tracking a basket of goods but they're taking certain things out of that CPI to basically manipulate the numbers to make it look like our inflation is actually going down when it really isn't okay real estate prices not really going down that much as well as fuel costs so I think there's a whole bunch of kind of Market manipulation kind of going on right now I'm not claiming anything I'm just saying that's what it looks like to me that's kind of my opinion there and also a lot of this stuff is political guys a lot of this stuff is political because it's an election year I think rate Cuts will help Democrats I think that Ray Cuts will help Democrats and that's why Democrats probably are trying to push more in that favor of a ray cut um because it's going to help them out now what the FED does will impact the market and I'm also not really clear on what's going to happen guys I'm not a genie I'm not omniscient I don't know what's going to happen but I will tell you that I am making some smart decisions right now with dollar cost averaging I am not panicking whatsoever I'm not stressed at all about the market even though I'm losing significant amounts of money I'm doing far better than the overall market so in many ways I actually want to Pat myself on the back because being down 6% when the market is down 12% is an extreme accomplishment extreme in one month 6% that's a 6% differential very very huge right there and I also want to highlight some some earnings plays guys there's a I know I'm all over the place in this video but I'm just trying to lay out out all these issues that I see and what we can do about these issues and they're just so many to list the FED inflation rate cuts and I briefly want to mention earnings okay so a recent earnings report from AMD and Microsoft were positive Apple was also positive but still we saw Warren Buffett cut his stake by was it about 50% so Burk Shar hathway has the most cash that they've ever literally had he has a lot of cash so Warren buff is basically pricing in a big crash okay he's basically pricing in a big pullback now there is some delay in information from 13f filings so when you look at what you know hedge funds and and Warren Buffett Etc are buying there is some delay there so it's not clear to me exactly why he cut a stake and it's still the biggest position in his portfolio but it's still very alarming to see an investor like Warren Buffett continuously raise more and more cash now this is actually where I disagree with Warren Buffett I don't believe in having cash at all a lot of people might call me stupid might call me crazy for not having cash but I've done just fine going to multiple s figure portfolios by not having any cash and in fact I see this as a big opportunity guys all the YouTubers there fearmongering and telling you it's it's time to sell or you should should be afraid that is incorrect it's factually incorrect it's not even just incorrect it's factually incorrect because the market when it pulls back that's literally the time to be buying it literally is the time for you to be dollar cost averaging timing the market and trying to get into cash is like the dumbest thing ever okay some people will say oh I'm going to time the market once I was right listen it's not about being right once it's about who is right in the end there's like a Russian saying it's not who laughs right now it's who laughs last okay it's all about who last last and it's all about your long-term results guys I'm trying to put the power and the knowledge in your hands okay what's going on with the FED right now very alarming but it doesn't mean that we need to sell out of our positions that means that we have to get into more high quality companies and right now you know QQ is just kind of going down a lot but in general I'm actually doing good on Chipotle okay I've sold some puts on Chipotle American Airlines is still going to be okay oil and gas like XLE I have ETF there I think that'll be okay as well and overall you can see that my portfolio and Snapchat being the bottom of my portfolio that's like my lowest position it's like makes up less than 1% of my portfolio and the top of my portfolio is Apple which makes up the biggest part of my portfolio I am still very very bullish on Apple they have tremendously good earnings but it's obviously going to be dragged down with the rest of the market as well as the Warren Buffett decision there to to kind of sell some of his shares so despite Apple having really really good earnings still going to dip guys we can't control short-term dips you really can't all right it's like a it's like like I was saying earlier it's like a flock of sheep okay a flock of sheep when one sheep kind of starts to run which is like typically the institutional investors because they do have some Insider information typically or they have some Advantage data which we don't have so the first sheep goes then more sheep are like hey why does that sheep alarm let me follow him and then the whole herd goes okay so that's what's happening right now it's herd behavior and herd psychology and that's why when I was studying in college for finance I worked the Goldman Sachs I have a finance degree I had two hedge fund experiences multiple millions of dollars in in in the stock market all the stuff that I've learned is that hurting behavior in human psychology is exactly what explains the market and I will tell you right now I am not panicking whatsoever I have zero fear zero fear even if the market goes down 50% I will actually be super excited to continue buying so more things I do want to cover though is Tom Lee this is a guy that I actually am looking at you know I'm not looking at no Jim Kramer I'm not looking at other YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about other YouTubers definitely don't know what they're talking about they're marketing experts and CNBC Jim Kramer they don't know what they're talking about either also it's all around fear mongering hype getting views getting attention now I'm in this game as well guys but I try to keep it as legit as possible as straightforward as possible no BS I'm showing you what I'm doing my gains my losses and my actual psychology not to get the views I want to actually tell you what I think and the only person I am actually looking at in terms of another person Tomley this guy is someone that I actually think he knows what what he's talking about okay so Tom Lee is more of the honest side and he was saying that basically NASDAQ could decline further that's what he was saying and he has been right about Tesla he's been right about many things and he has specifically talked about in CNBC I'm going to save you the time I'm trying to make this video quicker because I want to get this video out fast I didn't want to put the CNBC uh video here but basically he said pay attention to the vix the vixs hit 65 because the vix hit 65 that means there's elevated levels of anxiety in the market now that doesn't mean that you need to take action guys elevated vix just means that there's more premium to collect if you selling options it also means that there's more volatility in the market expect it I personally expect the vix to go down I personally think 65 is not going to happen for a very long time we were in the 14 range for very long time and now we see a very big spike and I think if you're selling at these levels mistake I think okay I think it's a mistake so I personally am selling certain stocks I'm getting out of Shopify today I got out of Shopify but I personally am not scared at all of the high quality of the tech stocks although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like you're crazy Nvidia is so bullish but we do see some of these stocks with high priced earnings ratios high price to sales ratios that are on the expensive side now pulling back and it is painful but I would not sell at these levels right now I also want to point out to you guys that if and when if and when when the recovery happens is going to recover very fast so although you're feeling a lot of pain right now today you're not really going to feel pain in 6 months from now or 12 months from now the market is going to recover markets tend to rise that's literally rule number one okay rule number one on uh from Buffett is don't lose money which is like a obvious rule right I don't need to repeat myself oh rule number one is don't lose money everyone knows that rule that's already a cliche rule my rule guys which I learned on Wall Street is markets tend to rise which is why I'm a Perma okay I'm not one of the Bears out there although I I realize that it's important to hedge your portfolio it's like right now with covered calls I'm being a little bit more aggressive to collect income not a bear by no means yes my title I need to get some clicks right because if I don't make my title market crash no one will click because everyone on YouTube does the same exact title unfortunately that is the game on YouTube but I'm being honest with you I'm delivering you the information that I personally in my heart believe which is do not panic do not sell do not cut your positions that are high quality positions this is what I believe in my heart and I'm telling you I'm literally buying more stock I'm literally going to be buying more stock there's more things I need to cover in this video a lot of important things actually kind of all over the place cuz obviously my emotions are high not from the market but from my students my Discord Community they're panicking so I feel really compelled my 45-minute call today was like an hour and 15-minute call because I want to add extra support to my subscribers to my Discord members I want to give everyone extra support right now because on a mental level this is very hard to deal with it's not hard for me at all guys this is not hard for me whatsoever financially it's also not hard for me from a belief perspective do I think we're going to recover do I have any doubts in my skills or my ability to invest not at all not at all this is to me this is actually easy mode I love to see some struggle this is actually a fantastic time for me to outperform and prove this is actually the time to prove that no other YouTuber doesn't have my results everyone is losing more money right now nobody has bought puts all the people fearmongering right now I'll do this this is the crash none of them bought puts what's up with those guys nobody bought puts nobody even has a results of -6% versus -2% those guys are down more than negative 12% way more guys people holding Nvidia stock all these people that are just pushing Nvidia I'm sorry to go off topic this not off topic I just want to point out that it can be really dangerous to be invested in just one stock Nvidia down 22% okay Tesla I don't need to prove myself all right facts speak for themselves 6% down versus 12% down on the market versus other YouTubers weigh down way more okay facts speak for themselves right U that was my Discord Community I want to talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little bit if you have the cash you should hold a little bit extra dry powder I personally don't have much dry powder but I think it it can be wise to have a little bit more dry powder just to see what happens with the FED stuff just to see what happens a little bit more with earnings you should be buying but don't just I'm going to put all my money to the market now I don't think any of you guys are doing that I think a majority of people watching my video and a majority of people investing right now are more on the cautious side they're more scared oh I'm going to sell everything no don't be that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I

a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm not going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not

competition and I think small businesses right now are opening up uh you know for example luck and coffee I know they had like this whole scam but in China luck and coffee surpassed Starbucks same thing with in China there apple is not doing as well in China right now same thing with the Chinese automobiles hackling Tesla so guys right now it's a very interesting time to be invested in the

good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's

guys I'm still going down with the market however I'm down 6% whereas I'm going to talk about Starbucks I'm going to talk about some retail stocks because when you take a look at retail stocks they're in a even more trouble Starbucks and Nike in a lot of trouble in the past one month QQ is down 12% so I'm actually kind of celebrating in my community because being down 6% when everything else is down 12% is actually a huge win and that's a fact that I just showed you on the screen there's no inspect tool or nothing like that I'm literally showing you I'm down 6% % versus 12% so I'm admitting that I'm hurt but I'm hurt a lot less so there's a lot of things to learn here guys all right and specifically I want to talk about inflation right now right so inflation they're saying has eased off substantially but when you look at uh gas prices when you look at uh fueling up your car and transportation not really a lot of inflation has sort of cooled down in certain pockets of our economy but as a whole they're also manipulating our CPI okay what I mean by that is CPI is a basket of goods right they're tracking a basket of goods but they're taking certain things out of that CPI to basically manipulate the numbers to make it look like our inflation is actually going down when it really isn't okay real estate prices not really going down that much as well as fuel costs so I think there's a whole bunch of kind of Market manipulation kind of going on right now I'm not claiming anything I'm just saying that's what it looks like to me that's kind of my opinion there and also a lot of this stuff is political guys a lot of this stuff is political because it's an election year I think rate Cuts will help Democrats I think that Ray Cuts will help Democrats and that's why Democrats probably are trying to push more in that favor of a ray cut um because it's going to help them out now what the FED does will impact the market and I'm also not really clear on what's going to happen guys I'm not a genie I'm not omniscient I don't know what's going to happen but I will tell you that I am making some smart decisions right now with dollar cost averaging I am not panicking whatsoever I'm not stressed at all about the market even though I'm losing significant amounts of money I'm doing far better than the overall market so in many ways I actually want to Pat myself on the back because being down 6% when the market is down 12% is an extreme accomplishment extreme in one month 6% that's a 6% differential very very huge right there and I also want to highlight some some earnings plays guys there's a I know I'm all over the place in this video but I'm just trying to lay out out all these issues that I see and what we can do about these issues and they're just so many to list the FED inflation rate cuts and I briefly want to mention earnings okay so a recent earnings report from AMD and Microsoft were positive Apple was also positive but still we saw Warren Buffett cut his stake by was it about 50% so Burk Shar hathway has the most cash that they've ever literally had he has a lot of cash so Warren buff is basically pricing in a big crash okay he's basically pricing in a big pullback now there is some delay in information from 13f filings so when you look at what you know hedge funds and and Warren Buffett Etc are buying there is some delay there so it's not clear to me exactly why he cut a stake and it's still the biggest position in his portfolio but it's still very alarming to see an investor like Warren Buffett continuously raise more and more cash now this is actually where I disagree with Warren Buffett I don't believe in having cash at all a lot of people might call me stupid might call me crazy for not having cash but I've done just fine going to multiple s figure portfolios by not having any cash and in fact I see this as a big opportunity guys all the YouTubers there fearmongering and telling you it's it's time to sell or you should should be afraid that is incorrect it's factually incorrect it's not even just incorrect it's factually incorrect because the market when it pulls back that's literally the time to be buying it literally is the time for you to be dollar cost averaging timing the market and trying to get into cash is like the dumbest thing ever okay some people will say oh I'm going to time the market once I was right listen it's not about being right once it's about who is right in the end there's like a Russian saying it's not who laughs right now it's who laughs last okay it's all about who last last and it's all about your long-term results guys I'm trying to put the power and the knowledge in your hands okay what's going on with the FED right now very alarming but it doesn't mean that we need to sell out of our positions that means that we have to get into more high quality companies and right now you know QQ is just kind of going down a lot but in general I'm actually doing good on Chipotle okay I've sold some puts on Chipotle American Airlines is still going to be okay oil and gas like XLE I have ETF there I think that'll be okay as well and overall you can see that my portfolio and Snapchat being the bottom of my portfolio that's like my lowest position it's like makes up less than 1% of my portfolio and the top of my portfolio is Apple which makes up the biggest part of my portfolio I am still very very bullish on Apple they have tremendously good earnings but it's obviously going to be dragged down with the rest of the market as well as the Warren Buffett decision there to to kind of sell some of his shares so despite Apple having really really good earnings still going to dip guys we can't control short-term dips you really can't all right it's like a it's like like I was saying earlier it's like a flock of sheep okay a flock of sheep when one sheep kind of starts to run which is like typically the institutional investors because they do have some Insider information typically or they have some Advantage data which we don't have so the first sheep goes then more sheep are like hey why does that sheep alarm let me follow him and then the whole herd goes okay so that's what's happening right now it's herd behavior and herd psychology and that's why when I was studying in college for finance I worked the Goldman Sachs I have a finance degree I had two hedge fund experiences multiple millions of dollars in in in the stock market all the stuff that I've learned is that hurting behavior in human psychology is exactly what explains the market and I will tell you right now I am not panicking whatsoever I have zero fear zero fear even if the market goes down 50% I will actually be super excited to continue buying so more things I do want to cover though is Tom Lee this is a guy that I actually am looking at you know I'm not looking at no Jim Kramer I'm not looking at other YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about other YouTubers definitely don't know what they're talking about they're marketing experts and CNBC Jim Kramer they don't know what they're talking about either also it's all around fear mongering hype getting views getting attention now I'm in this game as well guys but I try to keep it as legit as possible as straightforward as possible no BS I'm showing you what I'm doing my gains my losses and my actual psychology not to get the views I want to actually tell you what I think and the only person I am actually looking at in terms of another person Tomley this guy is someone that I actually think he knows what what he's talking about okay so Tom Lee is more of the honest side and he was saying that basically NASDAQ could decline further that's what he was saying and he has been right about Tesla he's been right about many things and he has specifically talked about in CNBC I'm going to save you the time I'm trying to make this video quicker because I want to get this video out fast I didn't want to put the CNBC uh video here but basically he said pay attention to the vix the vixs hit 65 because the vix hit 65 that means there's elevated levels of anxiety in the market now that doesn't mean that you need to take action guys elevated vix just means that there's more premium to collect if you selling options it also means that there's more volatility in the market expect it I personally expect the vix to go down I personally think 65 is not going to happen for a very long time we were in the 14 range for very long time and now we see a very big spike and I think if you're selling at these levels mistake I think okay I think it's a mistake so I personally am selling certain stocks I'm getting out of Shopify today I got out of Shopify but I personally am not scared at all of the high quality of the tech stocks although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like you're crazy Nvidia is so bullish but we do see some of these stocks with high priced earnings ratios high price to sales ratios that are on the expensive side now pulling back and it is painful but I would not sell at these levels right now I also want to point out to you guys that if and when if and when when the recovery happens is going to recover very fast so although you're feeling a lot of pain right now today you're not really going to feel pain in 6 months from now or 12 months from now the market is going to recover markets tend to rise that's literally rule number one okay rule number one on uh from Buffett is don't lose money which is like a obvious rule right I don't need to repeat myself oh rule number one is don't lose money everyone knows that rule that's already a cliche rule my rule guys which I learned on Wall Street is markets tend to rise which is why I'm a Perma okay I'm not one of the Bears out there although I I realize that it's important to hedge your portfolio it's like right now with covered calls I'm being a little bit more aggressive to collect income not a bear by no means yes my title I need to get some clicks right because if I don't make my title market crash no one will click because everyone on YouTube does the same exact title unfortunately that is the game on YouTube but I'm being honest with you I'm delivering you the information that I personally in my heart believe which is do not panic do not sell do not cut your positions that are high quality positions this is what I believe in my heart and I'm telling you I'm literally buying more stock I'm literally going to be buying more stock there's more things I need to cover in this video a lot of important things actually kind of all over the place cuz obviously my emotions are high not from the market but from my students my Discord Community they're panicking so I feel really compelled my 45-minute call today was like an hour and 15-minute call because I want to add extra support to my subscribers to my Discord members I want to give everyone extra support right now because on a mental level this is very hard to deal with it's not hard for me at all guys this is not hard for me whatsoever financially it's also not hard for me from a belief perspective do I think we're going to recover do I have any doubts in my skills or my ability to invest not at all not at all this is to me this is actually easy mode I love to see some struggle this is actually a fantastic time for me to outperform and prove this is actually the time to prove that no other YouTuber doesn't have my results everyone is losing more money right now nobody has bought puts all the people fearmongering right now I'll do this this is the crash none of them bought puts what's up with those guys nobody bought puts nobody even has a results of -6% versus -2% those guys are down more than negative 12% way more guys people holding Nvidia stock all these people that are just pushing Nvidia I'm sorry to go off topic this not off topic I just want to point out that it can be really dangerous to be invested in just one stock Nvidia down 22% okay Tesla I don't need to prove myself all right facts speak for themselves 6% down versus 12% down on the market versus other YouTubers weigh down way more okay facts speak for themselves right U that was my Discord Community I want to talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little bit if you have the cash you should hold a little bit extra dry powder I personally don't have much dry powder but I think it it can be wise to have a little bit more dry powder just to see what happens with the FED stuff just to see what happens a little bit more with earnings you should be buying but don't just I'm going to put all my money to the market now I don't think any of you guys are doing that I think a majority of people watching my video and a majority of people investing right now are more on the cautious side they're more scared oh I'm going to sell everything no don't be that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I hated waking up in the morning I hated having a boss and I hated getting paid 85k to 120k it was really not that much money when I can make more money myself trading options I literally make way more money than that and I don't have any rules I don't have any regulations I don't have to worry about any of the any of the nonsense uh you know all those you know what I'm talking about I think this is a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm not going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not not 50 basis points 50 basis points going to be a bit high but the market is actually pricing in a higher percentage so we'll see on that now I want to talk about some interesting points which is low data uh there there's low data in terms of people are saying right now that employment numbers are really bad but I think there's low data points because why I think a lot of people are leaving the workplace but if you look at social media everyone is starting a new business so I think what's actually going on is employment numbers are low because nobody wants to work for a company for a big Corporation slaving their life away especially at the lower level positions okay that's also a big reason why Starbucks is in a lot of trouble Nike in trouble a lot of retail companies are in trouble I was looking at CNBC I like CNBC I just don't like I don't like the people always talking on CNBC I I do like uh that CNBC did a really deep dive Research into Starbucks and they were saying how stores keep opening up but same store sales are going down guys same store sales going down I don't even know like I want to take a bottle and like just like I I want to point to you how important how dire of a situation this is when you see same store sales going down this is the end of the world this is that is the end of the company now Starbucks is not going to go out of business but that is the end of that company Rising higher now Starbucks is going for very good valuation but I am no longer bullish on Starbucks I really want to buy it as well as Nike but same store sales going down guys this is Redline awful this is essentially you have a 100 customers come to your restaurant and then the next day 99 next day 98 next day '97 96 95 94 your restaurant's literally dying that's what's happening to Starbucks unfortunately not unfortunat I don't really care we don't have any Star we don't have much of a Starbucks position we've done fine on Starbucks but I'm just telling you I'm pointing out the fact that retail stocks are in big trouble big trouble huge trouble don't don't be invested in Starbucks Nike don't be invested in retail uh you need Big Brand right now Big Brand and Nike and Starbucks is obviously Big Brand but it's retail big Big Brand which is no go for me right now no go absolutely not uh Nike same thing with their shoes too much competition too much competition and I think small businesses right now are opening up uh you know for example luck and coffee I know they had like this whole scam but in China luck and coffee surpassed Starbucks same thing with in China there apple is not doing as well in China right now same thing with the Chinese automobiles hackling Tesla so guys right now it's a very interesting time to be invested in the market because I actually think it's a stock Pickers Market AKA it's my market it is my market right now I picked I picked Apple I picked many other good stocks which have led me to beat the market by a lot it's a stock pi Pickers market right now as well doing well on Palance your uh wheel strategy it's down but more or less I'm still doing better than the market due to the options themselves because the options allow me to get premium and income so the stock is down but the options are generated income which is hedging and protecting my portfolio and giving me that stability in the portfolio and like looking at small businesses that's where it's at right now small businesses is where it's at and that's going to hurt some of the big brands for sure hands down so startbucks Nike good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's fantastic because Amazon's more of that Marketplace they're not really yes they have a brand of course but it's not like they have a big YouTube channel or big social media presence they do but it's really the marketplace it's really the product business that's doing so well for Amazon it's literally demand for the Amazon Marketplace so brands are on Amazon so I'm not making an individual bet on a brand I'm just making a bet on a Marketplace and then being a middleman so that's why Amazon is fantastic stock right now whereas individual brands are kind of hard to bet on because they go up and they go down and they can go out of business fairly quickly so I don't really think we're going to get a 50 basis point cut I think we're going to be at about 25 I would say be logical be logical please do not get emotional I'm here on YouTube to educate to help I'm here to support you comment I'm going to read the comments of course my Discord Community has access to me I am here to support and to help you not lose money to invest money wisely to get to retirement that save passive income that's it that's my whole goal in life that's what I want please don't I mean if you want to panic and sell that's up to you my opinion is be strong right now be smart right now all right catch you guys in the next video,1.0,0.0
Invest with Henry,tqkUC-BXK1M,2024-08-05T19:23:45Z,STOCK MARKET CRASH EXPLAINED! Should You Buy or Sell?,AMD,I'm going to be talking about different stocks like apple meta AMD paler and first and foremost I just want to say that the FED is trying everything that they can to make sure that the market is going to be smooth and they're absolutely failing the FED is not even close to doing a good job in fact I think they're just insisting on letting everything completely collapse before they actually kind of do their job not saying they're not doing their job but taking a look at what they plan to do with interest rates and the market is basically pricing in a 50 basis point rate cut that's pretty ridiculous guys I don't think that's going to personally happen but the market is really spooked right there and uh just taking a look at my portfolio I'm not immune to this guys I'm still going down with the market however I'm down 6% whereas I'm going to talk about Starbucks I'm going to talk about some retail stocks because when you take a look at retail stocks they're in a even more trouble Starbucks and Nike in a lot of trouble in the past one month QQ is down 12% so I'm actually kind of celebrating in my community because being down 6% when everything else is

that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I hated waking up in the morning I hated having a boss and I hated getting paid 85k to 120k it was really not that much money when I can make more money myself trading options I literally make way more money than that and I don't have any rules I don't have any regulations I don't have to worry about any of the any of the nonsense uh you know all those you know what I'm talking about I think this is a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm not going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not not 50 basis points 50 basis points going to be a bit high but the market is actually pricing in a higher percentage so we'll see on that now I want to talk about some interesting points which is low data uh there there's low data in terms of people are saying right now that employment numbers are really bad but I think there's low data points because why I think a lot of people are leaving the workplace but if you look at social media everyone is starting a new business so I think what's actually going on is employment numbers are low because nobody wants to work for a company for a big Corporation slaving their life away especially at the lower level positions okay that's also a big reason why Starbucks is in a lot of trouble Nike in trouble a lot of retail companies are in trouble I was looking at CNBC I like CNBC I just don't like I don't like the people always talking on CNBC I I do like uh that CNBC did a really deep dive Research into Starbucks and they were saying how stores keep opening up but same store sales are going down guys same store sales going down I don't even know like I want to take a bottle and like just like I I want to point to you how important how dire of a situation this is when you see same store sales going down this is the end of the world this is that is the end of the company now Starbucks is not going to go out of business but that is the end of that company Rising higher now Starbucks is going for very good valuation but I am no longer bullish on Starbucks I really want to buy it as well as Nike but same store sales going down guys this is Redline awful this is essentially you have a 100 customers come to your restaurant and then the next day 99 next day 98 next day '97 96 95 94 your restaurant's literally dying that's what's happening to Starbucks unfortunately not unfortunat I don't really care we don't have any Star we don't have much of a Starbucks position we've done fine on Starbucks but I'm just telling you I'm pointing out the fact that retail stocks are in big trouble big trouble huge trouble don't don't be invested in Starbucks Nike don't be invested in retail uh you need Big Brand right now Big Brand and Nike and Starbucks is obviously Big Brand but it's retail big Big Brand which is no go for me right now no go absolutely not uh Nike same thing with their shoes too much competition too much competition and I think small businesses right now are opening up uh you know for example luck and coffee I know they had like this whole scam but in China luck and coffee surpassed Starbucks same thing with in China there apple is not doing as well in China right now same thing with the Chinese automobiles hackling Tesla so guys right now it's a very interesting time to be invested in the market because I actually think it's a stock Pickers Market AKA it's my market it is my market right now I picked I picked Apple I picked many other good stocks which have led me to beat the market by a lot it's a stock pi Pickers market right now as well doing well on Palance your uh wheel strategy it's down but more or less I'm still doing better than the market due to the options themselves because the options allow me to get premium and income so the stock is down but the options are generated income which is hedging and protecting my portfolio and giving me that stability in the portfolio and like looking at small businesses that's where it's at right now small businesses is where it's at and that's going to hurt some of the big brands for sure hands down so startbucks Nike good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's fantastic because Amazon's more of that Marketplace they're not really yes they have a brand of course but it's not like they have a big YouTube channel or big social media presence they do but it's really the marketplace it's really the product business that's doing so well for Amazon it's literally demand for the Amazon Marketplace so brands are on Amazon so I'm not making an individual bet on a brand I'm just making a bet on a Marketplace and then being a middleman so that's why Amazon is fantastic stock right now whereas individual brands are kind of hard to bet on because they go up and they go down and they can go out of business fairly quickly so I don't really think we're going to get a 50 basis point cut I think we're going to be at about 25 I would say be logical be logical please do not get emotional I'm here on YouTube to educate to help I'm here to support you comment I'm going to read the comments of course my Discord Community has access to me I am here to support and to help you not lose money to invest money wisely to get to retirement that save passive income that's it that's my whole goal in life that's what I want please don't I mean if you want to panic and sell that's up to you my opinion is be strong right now be smart right now all right catch you guys in the next video,1.0,0.5
Invest with Henry,tqkUC-BXK1M,2024-08-05T19:23:45Z,STOCK MARKET CRASH EXPLAINED! Should You Buy or Sell?,Palantir,I'm going to be talking about different stocks like apple meta AMD paler and first and foremost I just want to say that the FED is trying everything that they can to make sure that the market is going to be smooth and they're absolutely failing the FED is not even close to doing a good job in fact I think they're just insisting on letting everything completely collapse before they actually kind of do their job not saying they're not doing their job but taking a look at what they plan to do with interest rates and the market is basically pricing in a 50 basis point rate cut that's pretty ridiculous guys I don't think that's going to personally happen but the market is really spooked right there and uh just taking a look at my portfolio I'm not immune to this guys I'm still going down with the market however I'm down 6% whereas I'm going to talk about Starbucks I'm going to talk about some retail stocks because when you take a look at retail stocks they're in a even more trouble Starbucks and Nike in a lot of trouble in the past one month QQ is down 12% so I'm actually kind of celebrating in my community because being down 6% when everything else is down 12% is actually a huge win and that's a fact that I just showed you on the screen there's no inspect tool or nothing like that I'm literally showing you I'm down 6% % versus 12% so I'm admitting that I'm hurt but I'm hurt a lot less so there's a lot of things to learn here guys all right and specifically I want to talk about inflation right now right so inflation they're saying has eased off substantially but when you look at uh gas prices when you look at uh fueling up your car and transportation not really a lot of inflation has sort of cooled down in certain pockets of our economy but as a whole they're also manipulating our CPI okay what I mean by that is CPI is a basket of goods right they're tracking a basket of goods but they're taking certain things out of that CPI to basically manipulate the numbers to make it look like our inflation is actually going down when it really isn't okay real estate prices not really going down that much as well as fuel costs so I think there's a whole bunch of kind of Market manipulation kind of going on right now I'm not claiming anything I'm just saying that's what it looks like to me that's kind of my opinion there and also a lot of this stuff is political guys a lot of this stuff is political because it's an election year I think rate Cuts will help Democrats I think that Ray Cuts will help Democrats and that's why Democrats probably are trying to push more in that favor of a ray cut um because it's going to help them out now what the FED does will impact the market and I'm also not really clear on what's going to happen guys I'm not a genie I'm not omniscient I don't know what's going to happen but I will tell you that I am making some smart decisions right now with dollar cost averaging I am not panicking whatsoever I'm not stressed at all about the market even though I'm losing significant amounts of money I'm doing far better than the overall market so in many ways I actually want to Pat myself on the back because being down 6% when the market is down 12% is an extreme accomplishment extreme in one month 6% that's a 6% differential very very huge right there and I also want to highlight some some earnings plays guys there's a I know I'm all over the place in this video but I'm just trying to lay out out all these issues that I see and what we can do about these issues and they're just so many to list the FED inflation rate cuts and I briefly want to mention earnings okay so a recent earnings report from AMD and Microsoft were positive Apple was also positive but still we saw Warren Buffett cut his stake by was it about 50% so Burk Shar hathway has the most cash that they've ever literally had he has a lot of cash so Warren buff is basically pricing in a big crash okay he's basically pricing in a big pullback now there is some delay in information from 13f filings so when you look at what you know hedge funds and and Warren Buffett Etc are buying there is some delay there so it's not clear to me exactly why he cut a stake and it's still the biggest position in his portfolio but it's still very alarming to see an investor like Warren Buffett continuously raise more and more cash now this is actually where I disagree with Warren Buffett I don't believe in having cash at all a lot of people might call me stupid might call me crazy for not having cash but I've done just fine going to multiple s figure portfolios by not having any cash and in fact I see this as a big opportunity guys all the YouTubers there fearmongering and telling you it's it's time to sell or you should should be afraid that is incorrect it's factually incorrect it's not even just incorrect it's factually incorrect because the market when it pulls back that's literally the time to be buying it literally is the time for you to be dollar cost averaging timing the market and trying to get into cash is like the dumbest thing ever okay some people will say oh I'm going to time the market once I was right listen it's not about being right once it's about who is right in the end there's like a Russian saying it's not who laughs right now it's who laughs last okay it's all about who last last and it's all about your long-term results guys I'm trying to put the power and the knowledge in your hands okay what's going on with the FED right now very alarming but it doesn't mean that we need to sell out of our positions that means that we have to get into more high quality companies and right now you know QQ is just kind of going down a lot but in general I'm actually doing good on Chipotle okay I've sold some puts on Chipotle American Airlines is still going to be okay oil and gas like XLE I have ETF there I think that'll be okay as well and overall you can see that my portfolio and Snapchat being the bottom of my portfolio that's like my lowest position it's like makes up less than 1% of my portfolio and the top of my portfolio is Apple which makes up the biggest part of my portfolio I am still very very bullish on Apple they have tremendously good earnings but it's obviously going to be dragged down with the rest of the market as well as the Warren Buffett decision there to to kind of sell some of his shares so despite Apple having really really good earnings still going to dip guys we can't control short-term dips you really can't all right it's like a it's like like I was saying earlier it's like a flock of sheep okay a flock of sheep when one sheep kind of starts to run which is like typically the institutional investors because they do have some Insider information typically or they have some Advantage data which we don't have so the first sheep goes then more sheep are like hey why does that sheep alarm let me follow him and then the whole herd goes okay so that's what's happening right now it's herd behavior and herd psychology and that's why when I was studying in college for finance I worked the Goldman Sachs I have a finance degree I had two hedge fund experiences multiple millions of dollars in in in the stock market all the stuff that I've learned is that hurting behavior in human psychology is exactly what explains the market and I will tell you right now I am not panicking whatsoever I have zero fear zero fear even if the market goes down 50% I will actually be super excited to continue buying so more things I do want to cover though is Tom Lee this is a guy that I actually am looking at you know I'm not looking at no Jim Kramer I'm not looking at other YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about other YouTubers definitely don't know what they're talking about they're marketing experts and CNBC Jim Kramer they don't know what they're talking about either also it's all around fear mongering hype getting views getting attention now I'm in this game as well guys but I try to keep it as legit as possible as straightforward as possible no BS I'm showing you what I'm doing my gains my losses and my actual psychology not to get the views I want to actually tell you what I think and the only person I am actually looking at in terms of another person Tomley this guy is someone that I actually think he knows what what he's talking about okay so Tom Lee is more of the honest side and he was saying that basically NASDAQ could decline further that's what he was saying and he has been right about Tesla he's been right about many things and he has specifically talked about in CNBC I'm going to save you the time I'm trying to make this video quicker because I want to get this video out fast I didn't want to put the CNBC uh video here but basically he said pay attention to the vix the vixs hit 65 because the vix hit 65 that means there's elevated levels of anxiety in the market now that doesn't mean that you need to take action guys elevated vix just means that there's more premium to collect if you selling options it also means that there's more volatility in the market expect it I personally expect the vix to go down I personally think 65 is not going to happen for a very long time we were in the 14 range for very long time and now we see a very big spike and I think if you're selling at these levels mistake I think okay I think it's a mistake so I personally am selling certain stocks I'm getting out of Shopify today I got out of Shopify but I personally am not scared at all of the high quality of the tech stocks although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like you're crazy Nvidia is so bullish but we do see some of these stocks with high priced earnings ratios high price to sales ratios that are on the expensive side now pulling back and it is painful but I would not sell at these levels right now I also want to point out to you guys that if and when if and when when the recovery happens is going to recover very fast so although you're feeling a lot of pain right now today you're not really going to feel pain in 6 months from now or 12 months from now the market is going to recover markets tend to rise that's literally rule number one okay rule number one on uh from Buffett is don't lose money which is like a obvious rule right I don't need to repeat myself oh rule number one is don't lose money everyone knows that rule that's already a cliche rule my rule guys which I learned on Wall Street is markets tend to rise which is why I'm a Perma okay I'm not one of the Bears out there although I I realize that it's important to hedge your portfolio it's like right now with covered calls I'm being a little bit more aggressive to collect income not a bear by no means yes my title I need to get some clicks right because if I don't make my title market crash no one will click because everyone on YouTube does the same exact title unfortunately that is the game on YouTube but I'm being honest with you I'm delivering you the information that I personally in my heart believe which is do not panic do not sell do not cut your positions that are high quality positions this is what I believe in my heart and I'm telling you I'm literally buying more stock I'm literally going to be buying more stock there's more things I need to cover in this video a lot of important things actually kind of all over the place cuz obviously my emotions are high not from the market but from my students my Discord Community they're panicking so I feel really compelled my 45-minute call today was like an hour and 15-minute call because I want to add extra support to my subscribers to my Discord members I want to give everyone extra support right now because on a mental level this is very hard to deal with it's not hard for me at all guys this is not hard for me whatsoever financially it's also not hard for me from a belief perspective do I think we're going to recover do I have any doubts in my skills or my ability to invest not at all not at all this is to me this is actually easy mode I love to see some struggle this is actually a fantastic time for me to outperform and prove this is actually the time to prove that no other YouTuber doesn't have my results everyone is losing more money right now nobody has bought puts all the people fearmongering right now I'll do this this is the crash none of them bought puts what's up with those guys nobody bought puts nobody even has a results of -6% versus -2% those guys are down more than negative 12% way more guys people holding Nvidia stock all these people that are just pushing Nvidia I'm sorry to go off topic this not off topic I just want to point out that it can be really dangerous to be invested in just one stock Nvidia down 22% okay Tesla I don't need to prove myself all right facts speak for themselves 6% down versus 12% down on the market versus other YouTubers weigh down way more okay facts speak for themselves right U that was my Discord Community I want to talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little bit if you have the cash you should hold a little bit extra dry powder I personally don't have much dry powder but I think it it can be wise to have a little bit more dry powder just to see what happens with the FED stuff just to see what happens a little bit more with earnings you should be buying but don't just I'm going to put all my money to the market now I don't think any of you guys are doing that I think a majority of people watching my video and a majority of people investing right now are more on the cautious side they're more scared oh I'm going to sell everything no don't be that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I hated waking up in the morning I hated having a boss and I hated getting paid 85k to 120k it was really not that much money when I can make more money myself trading options I literally make way more money than that and I don't have any rules I don't have any regulations I don't have to worry about any of the any of the nonsense uh you know all those you know what I'm talking about I think this is a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not not 50 basis points 50 basis points going to be a bit high but the market is actually pricing in a higher percentage so we'll see on that now I want to talk about some interesting points which is low

because the options allow me to get premium and income so the stock is down but the options are generated income which is hedging and protecting my portfolio and giving me that stability in the portfolio and like looking at small businesses that's where it's at right now small businesses is where it's at and that's going to hurt some of the big brands for sure hands down so startbucks Nike good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's fantastic because Amazon's more of that Marketplace they're not really yes they have a brand of course but it's not like they have a big YouTube channel or big social media presence they do but it's

and I will tell you right now I am not panicking whatsoever I have zero fear zero fear even if the market goes down 50% I will actually be super excited to continue buying so more things I do want to cover though is Tom Lee this is a guy that I actually am looking at you know I'm not looking at no Jim Kramer I'm not looking at other YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about other YouTubers definitely don't know what they're talking about they're marketing experts and CNBC Jim Kramer they don't know what they're talking about either also it's all around fear mongering hype getting views getting attention now I'm in this game as well guys but I try to keep it as legit as possible as straightforward as possible no BS I'm showing you what I'm doing my gains my losses and my actual psychology not to get the views I want to actually tell you what I think and the only person I am actually looking at in terms of another person Tomley this guy is someone that I actually think he knows what what he's talking about okay so Tom Lee is more of the honest side and he was saying that basically NASDAQ could decline further that's what he was saying and he has been right about Tesla he's been right about many things and he has specifically talked about in CNBC I'm going to save you the time I'm trying to make this video quicker because I want to get this video out fast I didn't want to put the CNBC uh video here but basically he said pay attention to the vix the vixs hit 65 because the vix hit 65 that means there's elevated levels of anxiety in the market now that doesn't mean that you need to take action guys elevated vix just means that there's more premium to collect if you selling options it also means that there's more volatility in the market expect it I personally expect the vix to go down I personally think 65 is not going to happen for a very long time we were in the 14 range for very long time and now we see a very big spike and I think if you're selling at these levels mistake I think okay I think it's a mistake so I personally am selling certain stocks I'm getting out of Shopify today I got out of Shopify but I personally am not scared at all of the high quality of the tech stocks although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like you're crazy Nvidia is so bullish but we do see some of these stocks with high priced earnings ratios high price to sales ratios that are on the expensive side now pulling back and it is painful but I would not sell at these levels right now I also want to point out to you guys that if and when if and when when the recovery happens is going to recover very fast so although you're feeling a lot of pain right now today you're not really going to feel pain in 6 months from now or 12 months from now the market is going to recover markets tend to rise that's literally rule number one okay rule number one on uh from Buffett is don't lose money which is like a obvious rule right I don't need to repeat myself oh rule number one is don't lose money everyone knows that rule that's already a cliche rule my rule guys which I learned on Wall Street is markets tend to rise which is why I'm a Perma okay I'm not one of the Bears out there although I I realize that it's important to hedge your portfolio it's like right now with covered calls I'm being a little bit more aggressive to collect income not a bear by no means yes my title I need to get some clicks right because if I don't make my title market crash no one will click because everyone on YouTube does the same exact title unfortunately that is the game on YouTube but I'm being honest with you I'm delivering you the information that I personally in my heart believe which is do not panic do not sell do not cut your positions that are high quality positions this is what I believe in my heart and I'm telling you I'm literally buying more stock I'm literally going to be buying more stock there's more things I need to cover in this video a lot of important things actually kind of all over the place cuz obviously my emotions are high not from the market but from my students my Discord Community they're panicking so I feel really compelled my 45-minute call today was like an hour and 15-minute call because I want to add extra support to my subscribers to my Discord members I want to give everyone extra support right now because on a mental level this is very hard to deal with it's not hard for me at all guys this is not hard for me whatsoever financially it's also not hard for me from a belief perspective do I think we're going to recover do I have any doubts in my skills or my ability to invest not at all not at all this is to me this is actually easy mode I love to see some struggle this is actually a fantastic time for me to outperform and prove this is actually the time to prove that no other YouTuber doesn't have my results everyone is losing more money right now nobody has bought puts all the people fearmongering right now I'll do this this is the crash none of them bought puts what's up with those guys nobody bought puts nobody even has a results of -6% versus -2% those guys are down more than negative 12% way more guys people holding Nvidia stock all these people that are just pushing Nvidia I'm sorry to go off topic this not off topic I just want to point out that it can be really dangerous to be invested in just one stock Nvidia down 22% okay Tesla I don't need to prove myself all right facts speak for themselves 6% down versus 12% down on the market versus other YouTubers weigh down way more okay facts speak for themselves right U that was my Discord Community I want to talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little bit if you have the cash you should hold a little bit extra dry powder I personally don't have much dry powder but I think it it can be wise to have a little bit more dry powder just to see what happens with the FED stuff just to see what happens a little bit more with earnings you should be buying but don't just I'm going to put all my money to the market now I don't think any of you guys are doing that I think a majority of people watching my video and a majority of people investing right now are more on the cautious side they're more scared oh I'm going to sell everything no don't be that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I hated waking up in the morning I hated having a boss and I hated getting paid 85k to 120k it was really not that much money when I can make more money myself trading options I literally make way more money than that and I don't have any rules I don't have any regulations I don't have to worry about any of the any of the nonsense uh you know all those you know what I'm talking about I think this is a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm not going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not not 50 basis points 50 basis points going to be a bit high but the market is actually pricing in a higher percentage so we'll see on that now I want to talk about some interesting points which is low data uh there there's low data in terms of people are saying right now that employment numbers are really bad but I think there's low data points because why I think a lot of people are leaving the workplace but if you look at social media everyone is starting a new business so I think what's actually going on is employment numbers are low because nobody wants to work for a company for a big Corporation slaving their life away especially at the lower level positions okay that's also a big reason why Starbucks is in a lot of trouble Nike in trouble a lot of retail companies are in trouble I was looking at CNBC I like CNBC I just don't like I don't like the people always talking on CNBC I I do like uh that CNBC did a really deep dive Research into Starbucks and they were saying how stores keep opening up but same store sales are going down guys same store sales going down I don't even know like I want to take a bottle and like just like I I want to point to you how important how dire of a situation this is when you see same store sales going down this is the end of the world this is that is the end of the company now Starbucks is not going to go out of business but that is the end of that company Rising higher now Starbucks is going for very good valuation but I am no longer bullish on Starbucks I really want to buy it as well as Nike but same store sales going down guys this is Redline awful this is essentially you have a 100 customers come to your restaurant and then the next day 99 next day 98 next day '97 96 95 94 your restaurant's literally dying that's what's happening to Starbucks unfortunately not unfortunat I don't really care we don't have any Star we don't have much of a Starbucks position we've done fine on Starbucks but I'm just telling you I'm pointing out the fact that retail stocks are in big trouble big trouble huge trouble don't don't be invested in Starbucks Nike don't be invested in retail uh you need Big Brand right now Big Brand and Nike and Starbucks is obviously Big Brand but it's retail big Big Brand which is no go for me right now no go absolutely not uh Nike same thing with their shoes too much competition too much competition and I think small businesses right now are opening up uh you know for example luck and coffee I know they had like this whole scam but in China luck and coffee surpassed Starbucks same thing with in China there apple is not doing as well in China right now same thing with the Chinese automobiles hackling Tesla so guys right now it's a very interesting time to be invested in the market because I actually think it's a stock Pickers Market AKA it's my market it is my market right now I picked I picked Apple I picked many other good stocks which have led me to beat the market by a lot it's a stock pi Pickers market right now as well doing well on Palance your uh wheel strategy it's down but more or less I'm still doing better than the market due to the options themselves because the options allow me to get premium and income so the stock is down but the options are generated income which is hedging and protecting my portfolio and giving me that stability in the portfolio and like looking at small businesses that's where it's at right now small businesses is where it's at and that's going to hurt some of the big brands for sure hands down so startbucks Nike good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's fantastic because Amazon's more of that Marketplace they're not really yes they have a brand of course but it's not like they have a big YouTube channel or big social media presence they do but it's really the marketplace it's really the product business that's doing so well for Amazon it's literally demand for the Amazon Marketplace so brands are on Amazon so I'm not making an individual bet on a brand I'm just making a bet on a Marketplace and then being a middleman so that's why Amazon is fantastic stock right now whereas individual brands are kind of hard to bet on because they go up and they go down and they can go out of business fairly quickly so I don't really think we're going to get a 50 basis point cut I think we're going to be at about 25 I would say be logical be logical please do not get emotional I'm here on YouTube to educate to help I'm here to support you comment I'm going to read the comments of course my Discord Community has access to me I am here to support and to help you not lose money to invest money wisely to get to retirement that save passive income that's it that's my whole goal in life that's what I want please don't I mean if you want to panic and sell that's up to you my opinion is be strong right now be smart right now all right catch you guys in the next video,1.0,-0.8
Invest with Henry,tqkUC-BXK1M,2024-08-05T19:23:45Z,STOCK MARKET CRASH EXPLAINED! Should You Buy or Sell?,Nike,however I'm down 6% whereas I'm going to talk about Starbucks I'm going to talk about some retail stocks because when you take a look at retail stocks they're in a even more trouble Starbucks and Nike in a lot of trouble in the past one month QQ is down 12% so I'm actually kind of celebrating in my community because being down 6% when everything else is down 12% is actually a huge win and that's a fact that I just showed you on the screen there's no inspect tool or nothing like that I'm literally showing you I'm down 6% % versus 12% so I'm admitting that I'm hurt but I'm hurt a lot less so there's a lot of things to learn here guys all right and specifically I want to talk about inflation right now right so inflation they're saying has eased off substantially but when you look at uh gas prices when you look at uh fueling up your car and transportation not really a lot of inflation has sort of cooled down in certain pockets of our economy but as a whole they're also manipulating our CPI okay what I mean by that is CPI is a basket of goods right they're tracking a basket of goods but they're taking certain things out of that CPI to basically manipulate the numbers to make it look like our inflation is actually going down when it really isn't okay real estate prices not really going down that much as well as fuel costs so I think there's a whole bunch of kind of Market manipulation kind of going on right now I'm not claiming anything I'm just saying that's what it looks like to me that's kind of my opinion there and also a lot of this stuff is political guys a lot of this stuff is political because it's an election year I think rate Cuts will help Democrats I think that Ray Cuts will help Democrats and that's why Democrats probably are trying to push more in that favor of a ray cut um because it's going to help them out now what the FED does will impact the market and I'm also not really clear on what's going to happen guys I'm not a genie I'm not omniscient I don't know what's going to happen but I will tell you that I am making some smart decisions right now with dollar cost averaging I am not panicking whatsoever I'm not stressed at all about the market even though I'm losing significant amounts of money I'm doing far better than the overall market so in many ways I actually want to Pat myself on the back because being down 6% when the market is down 12% is an extreme accomplishment extreme in one month 6% that's a 6% differential very very huge right there and I also want to highlight some some earnings plays guys there's a I know I'm all over the place in this video but I'm just trying to lay out out all these issues that I see and what we can do about these issues and they're just so many to list the FED inflation rate cuts and I briefly want to mention earnings okay so a recent earnings report from AMD and Microsoft were positive Apple was also positive but still we saw Warren Buffett cut his stake by was it about 50% so Burk Shar hathway has the most cash that they've ever literally had he has a lot of cash so Warren buff is basically pricing in a big crash okay he's basically pricing in a big pullback now there is some delay in information from 13f filings so when you look at what you know hedge funds and and Warren Buffett Etc are buying there is some delay there so it's not clear to me exactly why he cut a stake and it's still the biggest position in his portfolio but it's still very alarming to see an investor like Warren Buffett continuously raise more and more cash now this is actually where I disagree with Warren Buffett I don't believe in having cash at all a lot of people might call me stupid might call me crazy for not having cash but I've done just fine going to multiple s figure portfolios by not having any cash and in fact I see this as a big opportunity guys all the YouTubers there fearmongering and telling you it's it's time to sell or you should should be afraid that is incorrect it's factually incorrect it's not even just incorrect it's factually incorrect because the market when it pulls back that's literally the time to be buying it literally is the time for you to be dollar cost averaging timing the market and trying to get into cash is like the dumbest thing ever okay some people will say oh I'm going to time the market once I was right listen it's not about being right once it's about who is right in the end there's like a Russian saying it's not who laughs right now it's who laughs last okay it's all about who last last and it's all about your long-term results guys I'm trying to put the power and the knowledge in your hands okay what's going on with the FED right now very alarming but it doesn't mean that we need to sell out of our positions that means that we have to get into more high quality companies and right now you know QQ is just kind of going down a lot but in general I'm actually doing good on Chipotle okay I've sold some puts on Chipotle American Airlines is still going to be okay oil and gas like XLE I have ETF there I think that'll be okay as well and overall you can see that my portfolio and Snapchat being the bottom of my portfolio that's like my lowest position it's like makes up less than 1% of my portfolio and the top of my portfolio is Apple which makes up the biggest part of my portfolio I am still very very bullish on Apple they have tremendously good earnings but it's obviously going to be dragged down with the rest of the market as well as the Warren Buffett decision there to to kind of sell some of his shares so despite Apple having really really good earnings still going to dip guys we can't control short-term dips you really can't all right it's like a it's like like I was saying earlier it's like a flock of sheep okay a flock of sheep when one sheep kind of starts to run which is like typically the institutional investors because they do have some Insider information typically or they have some Advantage data which we don't have so the first sheep goes then more sheep are like hey why does that sheep alarm let me follow him and then the whole herd goes okay so that's what's happening right now it's herd behavior and herd psychology and that's why when I was studying in college for finance I worked the Goldman Sachs I have a finance degree I had two hedge fund experiences multiple millions of dollars in in in the stock market all the stuff that I've learned is that hurting behavior in human psychology is exactly what explains the market and I will tell you right now I am not panicking whatsoever I have zero fear zero fear even if the market goes down 50% I will actually be super excited to continue buying so more things I do want to cover though is Tom Lee this is a guy that I actually am looking at you know I'm not looking at no Jim Kramer I'm not looking at other YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about other YouTubers definitely don't know what they're talking about they're marketing experts and CNBC Jim Kramer they don't know what they're talking about either also it's all around fear mongering hype getting views getting attention now I'm in this game as well guys but I try to keep it as legit as possible as straightforward as possible no BS I'm showing you what I'm doing my gains my losses and

about Tesla he's been right about many things and he has specifically talked about in CNBC I'm going to save you the time I'm trying to make this video quicker because I want to get this video out fast I didn't want to put the CNBC uh video here but basically he said pay attention to the vix the vixs hit 65 because the vix hit 65 that means there's elevated levels of anxiety in the market now that doesn't mean that you need to take action guys elevated vix just means that there's more premium to collect if you selling options it also means that there's more volatility in the market expect

you're selling at these levels mistake I think okay I think it's a mistake so I personally am selling certain stocks I'm getting out of Shopify today I got out of Shopify but I personally am not

talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little

they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I

delay in information from 13f filings so when you look at what you know hedge funds and and Warren Buffett Etc are buying there is some delay there so it's not clear to me exactly why he cut a stake and it's still the biggest position in his portfolio but it's still very alarming to see an investor like Warren Buffett continuously raise more and more cash now this is actually where I disagree with Warren Buffett I don't believe in having cash at all a lot of people might call me stupid might call me crazy for not having cash but I've done just fine going to multiple s figure portfolios by not having any cash and in fact I see this as a big opportunity guys all the YouTubers there fearmongering and telling you it's it's time to sell or you should should be afraid that is incorrect it's factually incorrect it's not even just incorrect it's factually incorrect because the market when it pulls back that's literally the time to be buying it literally is the time for you to be dollar cost averaging timing the market and trying to get into cash is like the dumbest thing ever okay some people will say oh I'm going to time the market once I was right listen it's not about being right once it's about who is right in the end there's like a Russian saying it's not who laughs right now it's who laughs last okay it's all about who last last and it's all about your long-term results guys I'm trying to put the power and the knowledge in your hands okay what's going on with the FED right now very alarming but it doesn't mean that we need to sell out of our positions that means that we have to get into more high quality companies and right now you know QQ is just kind of going down a lot but in general I'm actually doing good on Chipotle okay I've sold some puts on Chipotle American Airlines is still going to be okay oil and gas like XLE I have ETF there I think that'll be okay as well and overall you can see that my portfolio and Snapchat being the bottom of my portfolio that's like my lowest position it's like makes up less than 1% of my portfolio and the top of my portfolio is Apple which makes up the biggest part of my portfolio I am still very very bullish on Apple they have tremendously good earnings but it's obviously going to be dragged down with the rest of the market as well as the Warren Buffett decision there to to kind of sell some of his shares so despite Apple having really really good earnings still going to dip guys we can't control short-term dips you really can't all right it's like a it's like like I was saying earlier it's like a flock of sheep okay a flock of sheep when one sheep kind of starts to run which is like typically the institutional investors because they do have some Insider information typically or they have some Advantage data which we don't have so the first sheep goes then more sheep are like hey why does that sheep alarm let me follow him and then the whole herd goes okay so that's what's happening right now it's herd behavior and herd psychology and that's why when I was studying in college for finance I worked the Goldman Sachs I have a finance degree I had two hedge fund experiences multiple millions of dollars in in in the stock market all the stuff that I've learned is that hurting behavior in human psychology is exactly what explains the market and I will tell you right now I am not panicking whatsoever I have zero fear zero fear even if the market goes down 50% I will actually be super excited to continue buying so more things I do want to cover though is Tom Lee this is a guy that I actually am looking at you know I'm not looking at no Jim Kramer I'm not looking at other YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about other YouTubers definitely don't know what they're talking about they're marketing experts and CNBC Jim Kramer they don't know what they're talking about either also it's all around fear mongering hype getting views getting attention now I'm in this game as well guys but I try to keep it as legit as possible as straightforward as possible no BS I'm showing you what I'm doing my gains my losses and my actual psychology not to get the views I want to actually tell you what I think and the only person I am actually looking at in terms of another person Tomley this guy is someone that I actually think he knows what what he's talking about okay so Tom Lee is more of the honest side and he was saying that basically NASDAQ could decline further that's what he was saying and he has been right about Tesla he's been right about many things and he has specifically talked about in CNBC I'm going to save you the time I'm trying to make this video quicker because I want to get this video out fast I didn't want to put the CNBC uh video here but basically he said pay attention to the vix the vixs hit 65 because the vix hit 65 that means there's elevated levels of anxiety in the market now that doesn't mean that you need to take action guys elevated vix just means that there's more premium to collect if you selling options it also means that there's more volatility in the market expect it I personally expect the vix to go down I personally think 65 is not going to happen for a very long time we were in the 14 range for very long time and now we see a very big spike and I think if you're selling at these levels mistake I think okay I think it's a mistake so I personally am selling certain stocks I'm getting out of Shopify today I got out of Shopify but I personally am not scared at all of the high quality of the tech stocks although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like you're crazy Nvidia is so bullish but we do see some of these stocks with high priced earnings ratios high price to sales ratios that are on the expensive side now pulling back and it is painful but I would not sell at these levels right now I also want to point out to you guys that if and when if and when when the recovery happens is going to recover very fast so although you're feeling a lot of pain right now today you're not really going to feel pain in 6 months from now or 12 months from now the market is going to recover markets tend to rise that's literally rule number one okay rule number one on uh from Buffett is don't lose money which is like a obvious rule right I don't need to repeat myself oh rule number one is don't lose money everyone knows that rule that's already a cliche rule my rule guys which I learned on Wall Street is markets tend to rise which is why I'm a Perma okay I'm not one of the Bears out there although I I realize that it's important to hedge your portfolio it's like right now with covered calls I'm being a little bit more aggressive to collect income not a bear by no means yes my title I need to get some clicks right because if I don't make my title market crash no one will click because everyone on YouTube does the same exact title unfortunately that is the game on YouTube but I'm being honest with you I'm delivering you the information that I personally in my heart believe which is do not panic do not sell do not cut your positions that are high quality positions this is what I believe in my heart and I'm telling you I'm literally buying more stock I'm literally going to be buying more stock there's more things I need to cover in this video a lot of important things actually kind of all over the place cuz obviously my emotions are high not from the market but from my students my Discord Community they're panicking so I feel really compelled my 45-minute call today was like an hour and 15-minute call because I want to add extra support to my subscribers to my Discord members I want to give everyone extra support right now because on a mental level this is very hard to deal with it's not hard for me at all guys this is not hard for me whatsoever financially it's also not hard for me from a belief perspective do I think we're going to recover do I have any doubts in my skills or my ability to invest not at all not at all this is to me this is actually easy mode I love to see some struggle this is actually a fantastic time for me to outperform and prove this is actually the time to prove that no other YouTuber doesn't have my results everyone is losing more money right now nobody has bought puts all the people fearmongering right now I'll do this this is the crash none of them bought puts what's up with those guys nobody bought puts nobody even has a results of -6% versus -2% those guys are down more than negative 12% way more guys people holding Nvidia stock all these people that are just pushing Nvidia I'm sorry to go off topic this not off topic I just want to point out that it can be really dangerous to be invested in just one stock Nvidia down 22% okay Tesla I don't need to prove myself all right facts speak for themselves 6% down versus 12% down on the market versus other YouTubers weigh down way more okay facts speak for themselves right U that was my Discord Community I want to talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little bit if you have the cash you should hold a little bit extra dry powder I personally don't have much dry powder but I think it it can be wise to have a little bit more dry powder just to see what happens with the FED stuff just to see what happens a little bit more with earnings you should be buying but don't just I'm going to put all my money to the market now I don't think any of you guys are doing that I think a majority of people watching my video and a majority of people investing right now are more on the cautious side they're more scared oh I'm going to sell everything no don't be that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I hated waking up in the morning I hated having a boss and I hated getting paid 85k to 120k it was really not that much money when I can make more money myself trading options I literally make way more money than that and I don't have any rules I don't have any regulations I don't have to worry about any of the any of the nonsense uh you know all those you know what I'm talking about I think this is a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm not going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not not 50 basis points 50 basis points going to be a bit high but the market is actually pricing in a higher percentage so we'll see on that now I want to talk about some interesting points which is low data uh there there's low data in terms of people are saying right now that employment numbers are really bad but I think there's low data points because why I think a lot of people are leaving the workplace but if you look at social media everyone is starting a new business so I think what's actually going on is employment numbers are low because nobody wants to work for a company for a big Corporation slaving their life away especially at the lower level positions okay that's also a big reason why Starbucks is in a lot of trouble Nike in trouble a lot of retail companies are in trouble I was looking at CNBC I like CNBC I just don't like I don't like the people always talking on CNBC I I do like uh that CNBC did a really deep dive Research into Starbucks and they were saying how stores keep opening up but same store sales are going down guys same store sales going down I don't even know like I want to take a bottle and like just like I I want to point to you how important how dire of a situation this is when you see same store sales going down this is the end of the world this is that is the end of the company now Starbucks is not going to go out of business but that is the end of that company Rising higher now Starbucks is going for very good valuation but I am no longer bullish on Starbucks I really want to buy it as well as Nike but same store sales going down guys this is Redline awful this is essentially you have a 100 customers come to your restaurant and then the next day 99 next day 98 next day '97 96 95 94 your restaurant's literally dying that's what's happening to Starbucks unfortunately not unfortunat I don't really care we don't have any Star we don't have much of a Starbucks position we've done fine on Starbucks but I'm just telling you I'm pointing out the fact that retail stocks are in big trouble big trouble huge trouble don't don't be invested in Starbucks Nike don't be invested in retail uh you need Big Brand right now Big Brand and Nike and Starbucks is obviously Big Brand but it's retail big Big Brand which is no go for me right now no go absolutely not uh Nike same thing with their shoes too much competition too much competition and I think small businesses right now are opening up uh you know for example luck and coffee I know they had like this whole scam but in China luck and coffee surpassed Starbucks same thing with in China there apple is not doing as well in China right now same thing with the Chinese automobiles hackling Tesla so guys right now it's a very interesting time to be invested in the market because I actually think it's a stock Pickers Market AKA it's my market it is my market right now I picked I picked Apple I picked many other good stocks which have led me to beat the market by a lot it's a stock pi Pickers market right now as well doing well on Palance your uh wheel strategy it's down but more or less I'm still doing better than the market due to the options themselves because the options allow me to get premium and income so the stock is down but the options are generated income which is hedging and protecting my portfolio and giving me that stability in the portfolio and like looking at small businesses that's where it's at right now small businesses is where it's at and that's going to hurt some of the big brands for sure hands down so startbucks Nike good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's fantastic because Amazon's more of that Marketplace they're not really yes they have a brand of course but it's not like they have a big YouTube channel or big social media presence they do but it's really the marketplace it's really the product business that's doing so well for Amazon it's literally demand for the Amazon Marketplace so brands are on Amazon so I'm not making an individual bet on a brand I'm just making a bet on a Marketplace and then being a middleman so that's why Amazon is fantastic stock right now whereas individual brands are kind of hard to bet on because they go up and they go down and they can go out of business fairly quickly so I don't really think we're going to get a 50 basis point cut I think we're going to be at about 25 I would say be logical be logical please do not get emotional I'm here on YouTube to educate to help I'm here to support you comment I'm going to read the comments of course my Discord Community has access to me I am here to support and to help you not lose money to invest money wisely to get to retirement that save passive income that's it that's my whole goal in life that's what I want please don't I mean if you want to panic and sell that's up to you my opinion is be strong right now be smart right now all right catch you guys in the next video,1.0,0.5

Should You Buy or Sell?,Chipotle,and right now you know QQ is just kind of going down a lot but in general I'm actually doing good on Chipotle okay I've sold some puts on Chipotle American Airlines is still going to be okay oil and gas like XLE I have ETF there I think that'll be okay as well and overall you can see that my portfolio and Snapchat being the bottom of my portfolio that's like my lowest position it's like makes up less than 1% of my portfolio and the top of my portfolio is Apple which makes up the biggest part of my portfolio I am still very very bullish on Apple they have tremendously good earnings but it's obviously going to be dragged down with the rest of the market as well as the Warren Buffett decision there to to kind of sell some of his shares so despite Apple having really really good earnings still going to dip guys we can't control short-term dips you really can't all right it's like a it's like like I was saying earlier it's like a flock of sheep okay a flock of sheep when one sheep kind of starts to run which is like typically the institutional investors because they do have some Insider information typically or they have some Advantage data which we don't have so the first sheep goes then more sheep are like hey why does that sheep alarm let me follow him and then the whole herd goes okay so that's what's happening right now it's herd behavior and herd psychology and that's why when I was studying in college for finance I worked the Goldman Sachs I have a finance degree I had two hedge fund experiences multiple millions of dollars in in in the stock market all the stuff that I've learned is that hurting behavior in human psychology is exactly what explains the market and I will tell you right now I am not panicking whatsoever I have zero fear zero fear even if the market goes down 50% I will actually be super excited to continue buying so more things I do want to cover though is Tom Lee this is a guy that I actually am looking at you know I'm not looking at no Jim Kramer I'm not looking at other YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about other YouTubers definitely don't know what they're talking about they're marketing experts and CNBC Jim Kramer they don't know what they're talking about either also it's all around fear mongering hype getting views getting attention now I'm in this game as well guys but I try to keep it as legit as possible as straightforward as possible no BS I'm showing you what I'm doing my gains my losses and my actual psychology not to get the views I want to actually tell you what I think and the only person I am actually looking at in terms of another person Tomley this guy is someone that I actually think he knows what what he's talking about okay so Tom Lee is more of the honest side and he was saying that basically NASDAQ could decline further that's what he was saying and he has been right about Tesla he's been right about many things and he has specifically talked about in CNBC I'm going to save you the time I'm trying to make this video quicker because I want to get this video out fast I didn't want to put the CNBC uh video here but basically he said pay attention to the vix the vixs hit 65 because the vix hit 65 that means there's elevated levels of anxiety in the market now that doesn't mean that you need to take action guys elevated vix just means that there's more premium to collect if you selling options it also means that there's more volatility in the market expect it I personally expect the vix to go down I personally think 65 is not going to happen for a very long time we were in the 14 range for very long time and now we see a very big spike and I think if you're selling at these levels mistake I think okay I think it's a mistake so I personally am selling certain stocks I'm getting out of Shopify today I got out of Shopify but I personally am not scared at all of the high quality of the tech stocks although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like you're crazy Nvidia is so bullish but we do see some of these stocks with high priced earnings ratios high price to sales ratios that are on the expensive side now pulling back and it is painful but I would not sell at these levels right now I also want to point out to you guys that if and when if and when when the recovery happens is going to recover very fast so although you're feeling a lot of pain right now today you're not really going to feel pain in 6 months from now or 12 months from now the market is going to recover markets tend to rise that's literally rule number one okay rule number one on uh from Buffett is don't lose money which is like a obvious rule right I don't need to repeat myself oh rule number one is don't lose money everyone knows that rule that's already a cliche rule my rule guys which I learned on Wall Street is markets tend to rise which is why I'm a Perma okay I'm not one of the Bears out there although I I realize that it's important to hedge your portfolio it's like right now with covered calls I'm being a little bit more aggressive to collect income not a bear by no means yes my title I need to get some clicks right because if I don't make my title market crash no one will click because everyone on YouTube does the same exact title unfortunately that is the game on YouTube but I'm being honest with you I'm delivering you the information that I personally in my heart believe which is do not panic do not sell do not cut your positions that are high quality positions this is what I believe in my heart and I'm telling you I'm literally buying more stock I'm literally going to be buying more stock there's more things I need to cover in this video a lot of important things actually kind of all over the place cuz obviously my emotions are high not from the market but from my students my Discord Community they're panicking so I feel really compelled my 45-minute call today was like an hour and 15-minute call because I want to add extra support to my subscribers to my Discord members I want to give everyone extra support right now because on a mental level this is very hard to deal with it's not hard for me at all guys this is not hard for me whatsoever financially it's also not hard for me from a belief perspective do I think we're going to recover do I have any doubts in my skills or my ability to invest not at all not at all this is to me this is actually easy mode I love to see some struggle this is actually a fantastic time for me to outperform and prove this is actually the time to prove that no other YouTuber doesn't have my results everyone is losing more money right now nobody has bought puts all the people fearmongering right now I'll do this this is the crash none of them bought puts what's up with those guys nobody bought puts nobody even has a results of -6% versus -2% those guys are down more than negative 12% way more guys people holding Nvidia stock all these people that are just pushing Nvidia I'm sorry to go off topic this not off topic I just want to point out that it can be really dangerous to be invested in just one stock Nvidia down 22% okay Tesla I don't need to prove myself all right facts speak for themselves 6% down versus 12% down on the market versus other YouTubers weigh down way more okay facts speak for themselves right U that was my Discord Community I want to talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little bit if you have the cash you should hold a little bit extra dry powder I personally don't have much dry powder but I think it it can be wise to have a little bit more dry powder just to see what happens with the FED stuff just to see what happens a little bit more with earnings you should be buying but don't just I'm going to put all my money to the market now I don't think any of you guys are doing that I think a majority of people watching my video and a majority of people investing right now are more on the cautious side they're more scared oh I'm going to sell everything no don't be that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I hated waking up in the morning I hated having a boss and I hated getting paid 85k to 120k it was really not that much money when I can make more money myself trading options I literally make way more money than that and I don't have any rules I don't have any regulations I don't have to worry about any of the any of the nonsense uh you know all those you know what I'm talking about I think this is a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm not going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not not 50 basis points 50 basis points going to be a bit high but the market is actually pricing in a higher percentage so we'll see on that now I want to talk about some interesting points which is low data uh there there's low data in terms of people are saying right now that employment numbers are really bad but I think there's low data points because why I think a lot of people are leaving the workplace but if you look at social media everyone is starting a new business so I think what's actually going on is employment numbers are low because nobody wants to work for a company for a big Corporation slaving their life away especially at the lower level positions okay that's also a big reason why Starbucks is in a lot of trouble Nike in trouble a lot of retail companies are in trouble I was looking at CNBC I like CNBC I just don't like I don't like the people always talking on CNBC I I do like uh that CNBC did a really deep dive Research into Starbucks and they were saying how stores keep opening up but same store sales are going down guys same store sales going down I don't even know like I want to take a bottle and like just like I I want to point to you how important how dire of a situation this is when you see same store sales going down this is the end of the world this is that is the end of the company now Starbucks is not going to go out of business but that is the end of that company Rising higher now Starbucks is going for very good valuation but I am no longer bullish on Starbucks I really want to buy it as well as Nike but same store sales going down guys this is Redline awful this is essentially you have a 100 customers come to your restaurant and then the next day 99 next day 98 next day '97 96 95 94 your restaurant's literally dying that's what's happening to Starbucks unfortunately not unfortunat I don't really care we don't have any Star we don't have much of a Starbucks position we've done fine on Starbucks but I'm just telling you I'm pointing out the fact that retail stocks are in big trouble big trouble huge trouble don't don't be invested in Starbucks Nike don't be invested in retail uh you need Big Brand right now Big Brand and Nike and Starbucks is obviously Big Brand but it's retail big Big Brand which is no go for me right now no go absolutely not uh Nike same thing with their shoes too much competition too much competition and I think small businesses right now are opening up uh you know for example luck and coffee I know they had like this whole scam but in China luck and coffee surpassed Starbucks same thing with in China there apple is not doing as well in China right now same thing with the Chinese automobiles hackling Tesla so guys right now it's a very interesting time to be invested in the market because I actually think it's a stock Pickers Market AKA it's my market it is my market right now I picked I picked Apple I picked many other good stocks which have led me to beat the market by a lot it's a stock pi Pickers market right now as well doing well on Palance your uh wheel strategy it's down but more or less I'm still doing better than the market due to the options themselves because the options allow me to get premium and income so the stock is down but the options are generated income which is hedging and protecting my portfolio and giving me that stability in the portfolio and like looking at small businesses that's where it's at right now small businesses is where it's at and that's going to hurt some of the big brands for sure hands down so startbucks Nike good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's fantastic because Amazon's more of that Marketplace they're not really yes they have a brand of course but it's not like they have a big YouTube channel or big social media presence they do but it's really the marketplace it's really the product business that's doing so well for Amazon it's literally demand for the Amazon Marketplace so brands are on Amazon so I'm not making an individual bet on a brand I'm just making a bet on a Marketplace and then being a middleman so that's why Amazon is fantastic stock right now whereas individual brands are kind of hard to bet on because they go up and they go down and they can go out of business fairly quickly so I don't really think we're going to get a 50 basis point cut I think we're going to be at about 25 I would say be logical be logical please do not get emotional I'm here on YouTube to educate to help I'm here to support you comment I'm going to read the comments of course my Discord Community has access to me I am here to support and to help you not lose money to invest money wisely to get to retirement that save passive income that's it that's my whole goal in life that's what I want please don't I mean if you want to panic and sell that's up to you my opinion is be strong right now be smart right now all right catch you guys in the next video,1.0,0.7

quality of the tech stocks although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like you're crazy Nvidia is so bullish but we do see some of these stocks with high priced earnings ratios high price to sales ratios that are on the expensive side now pulling back and it is painful but I would not sell at these levels right now I also want to point out to you guys that if and when if and when when the recovery happens is going to recover very fast so although you're feeling a lot of pain right now today you're not really going to feel pain in 6 months from now or 12 months from now the market is going to recover markets tend to rise that's literally rule number one okay rule number one on uh from Buffett is don't lose money which is like a obvious rule right I don't need to repeat myself oh rule number one is don't lose money everyone knows that rule that's already a cliche rule my rule guys which I learned on Wall Street is markets tend to rise which is why I'm a Perma okay I'm not one of the Bears out there although I I realize that it's important to hedge your portfolio it's like right now with covered calls I'm being a little bit more aggressive to collect income not a bear by no means yes my title I need to get some clicks right because if I don't make my title market crash no one will click because everyone on YouTube does the same exact title unfortunately that is the game on YouTube but I'm being honest with you I'm delivering you the information that I personally in my heart believe which is do not panic do not sell do not cut your positions that are high quality positions this is what I believe in my heart and I'm telling you I'm literally buying more stock I'm literally going to be buying more stock there's more things I need to cover in this video a lot of important things actually kind of all over the place cuz obviously my emotions are high not from the market but from my students my Discord Community they're panicking so I feel really compelled my 45-minute call today was like an hour and 15-minute call because I want to add extra support to my subscribers to my Discord members I want to give everyone extra support right now because on a mental level this is very hard to deal with it's not hard for me at all guys this is not hard for me whatsoever financially it's also not hard for me from a belief perspective do I think we're going to recover do I have any doubts in my skills or my ability to invest not at all not at all this is to me this is actually easy mode I love to see some struggle this is actually a fantastic time for me to outperform and prove this is actually the time to prove that no other YouTuber doesn't have my results everyone is losing more money right now nobody has bought puts all the people fearmongering right now I'll do this this is the crash none of them bought puts what's up with those guys nobody bought puts nobody even has a results of -6% versus -2% those guys are down more than negative 12% way more guys people holding Nvidia stock all these people that are just pushing Nvidia I'm sorry to go off topic this not off topic I just want to point out that it can be really dangerous to be invested in just one stock Nvidia down 22% okay Tesla I don't need to prove myself all right facts speak for themselves 6% down versus 12% down on the market versus other YouTubers weigh down way more okay facts speak for themselves right U that was my Discord Community I want to talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little bit if you have the cash you should hold a little bit extra dry powder I personally don't have much dry powder but I think it it can be wise to have a little bit more dry powder just to see what happens with the FED stuff just to see what happens a little bit more with earnings you should be buying but don't just I'm going to put all my money to the market now I don't think any of you guys are doing that I think a majority of people watching my video and a majority of people investing right now are more on the cautious side they're more scared oh I'm going to sell everything no don't be that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I hated waking up in the morning I hated having a boss and I hated getting paid 85k to 120k it was really not that much money when I can make more money myself trading options I literally make way more money than that and I don't have any rules I don't have any regulations I don't have to worry about any of the any of the nonsense uh you know all those you know what I'm talking about I think this is a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm not going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not not 50 basis points 50 basis points going to be a bit high but the market is actually pricing in a higher percentage so we'll see on that now I want to talk about some interesting points which is low data uh there there's low data in terms of people are saying right now that employment numbers are really bad but I think there's low data points because why I think a lot of people are leaving the workplace but if you look at social media everyone is starting a new business so I think what's actually going on is employment numbers are low because nobody wants to work for a company for a big Corporation slaving their life away especially at the lower level positions okay that's also a big reason why Starbucks is in a lot of trouble Nike in trouble a lot of retail companies are in trouble I was looking at CNBC I like CNBC I just don't like I don't like the people always talking on CNBC I I do like uh that CNBC did a really deep dive Research into Starbucks and they were saying how stores keep opening up but same store sales are going down guys same store sales going down I don't even know like I want to take a bottle and like just like I I want to point to you how important how dire of a situation this is when you see same store sales going down this is the end of the world this is that is the end of the company now Starbucks is not going to go out of business but that is the end of that company Rising higher now Starbucks is going for very good valuation but I am no longer bullish on Starbucks I really want to buy it as well as Nike but same store sales going down guys this is Redline awful this is essentially you have a 100 customers come to your restaurant and then the next day 99 next day 98 next day '97 96 95 94 your restaurant's literally dying that's what's happening to Starbucks unfortunately not unfortunat I don't really care we don't have any Star we don't have much of a Starbucks position we've done fine on Starbucks but I'm just telling you I'm pointing out the fact that retail stocks are in big trouble big trouble huge trouble don't don't be invested in Starbucks Nike don't be invested in retail uh you need Big Brand right now Big Brand and Nike and Starbucks is obviously Big Brand but it's retail big Big Brand which is no go for me right now no go absolutely not uh Nike same thing with their shoes too much competition too much competition and I think small businesses right now are opening up uh you know for example luck and coffee I know they had like this whole scam but in China luck and coffee surpassed Starbucks same thing with in China there apple is not doing as well in China right now same thing with the Chinese automobiles hackling Tesla so guys right now it's a very interesting time to be invested in the market because I actually think it's a stock Pickers Market AKA it's my market it is my market right now I picked I picked Apple I picked many other good stocks which have led me to beat the market by a lot it's a stock pi Pickers market right now as well doing well on Palance your uh wheel strategy it's down but more or less I'm still doing better than the market due to the options themselves because the options allow me to get premium and income so the stock is down but the options are generated income which is hedging and protecting my portfolio and giving me that stability in the portfolio and like looking at small businesses that's where it's at right now small businesses is where it's at and that's going to hurt some of the big brands for sure hands down so startbucks Nike good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's fantastic because Amazon's more of that Marketplace they're not really yes they have a brand of course but it's not like they have a big YouTube channel or big social media presence they do but it's really the marketplace it's really the product business that's doing so well for Amazon it's literally demand for the Amazon Marketplace so brands are on Amazon so I'm not making an individual bet on a brand I'm just making a bet on a Marketplace and then being a middleman so that's why Amazon is fantastic stock right now whereas individual brands are kind of hard to bet on because they go up and they go down and they can go out of business fairly quickly so I don't really think we're going to get a 50 basis point cut I think we're going to be at about 25 I would say be logical be logical please do not get emotional I'm here on YouTube to educate to help I'm here to support you comment I'm going to read the comments of course my Discord Community has access to me I am here to support and to help you not lose money to invest money wisely to get to retirement that save passive income that's it that's my whole goal in life that's what I want please don't I mean if you want to panic and sell that's up to you my opinion is be strong right now be smart right now all right catch you guys in the next video,1.0,0.0

Should You Buy or Sell?,Snapchat,American Airlines is still going to be okay oil and gas like XLE I have ETF there I think that'll be okay as well and overall you can see that my portfolio and Snapchat being the bottom of my portfolio that's like my lowest position it's like makes up less than 1% of my portfolio and the top of my portfolio is Apple which makes up the biggest part of my portfolio I am still very very bullish on Apple they have tremendously good earnings but it's obviously going to be dragged down with the rest of the market as well as the Warren Buffett decision there to to kind of sell some of his shares so despite Apple having really really good earnings still going to dip guys we can't control short-term dips you really can't all right it's like a it's like like I was saying earlier it's like a flock of sheep okay a flock of sheep when one sheep kind of starts to run which is like typically the institutional investors because they do have some Insider information typically or they have some Advantage data which we don't have so the first sheep goes then more sheep are like hey why does that sheep alarm let me follow him and then the whole herd goes okay so that's what's happening right now it's herd behavior and herd psychology and that's why when I was studying in college for finance I worked the Goldman Sachs I have a finance degree I had two hedge fund experiences multiple millions of dollars in in in the stock market all the stuff that I've learned is that hurting behavior in human psychology is exactly what explains the market and I will tell you right now I am not panicking whatsoever I have zero fear zero fear even if the market goes down 50% I will actually be super excited to continue buying so more things I do want to cover though is Tom Lee this is a guy that I actually am looking at you know I'm not looking at no Jim Kramer I'm not looking at other YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about other YouTubers definitely don't know what they're talking about they're marketing experts and CNBC Jim Kramer they don't know what they're talking about either also it's all around fear mongering hype getting views getting attention now I'm in this game as well guys but I try to keep it as legit as possible as straightforward as possible no BS I'm showing you what I'm doing my gains my losses and my actual psychology not to get the views I want to actually tell you what I think and the only person I am actually looking at in terms of another person Tomley this guy is someone that I actually think he knows what what he's talking about okay so Tom Lee is more of the honest side and he was saying that basically NASDAQ could decline further that's what he was saying and he has been right about Tesla he's been right about many things and he has specifically talked about in CNBC I'm going to save you the time I'm trying to make this video quicker because I want to get this video out fast I didn't want to put the CNBC uh video here but basically he said pay attention to the vix the vixs hit 65 because the vix hit 65 that means there's elevated levels of anxiety in the market now that doesn't mean that you need to take action guys elevated vix just means that there's more premium to collect if you selling options it also means that there's more volatility in the market expect it I personally expect the vix to go down I personally think 65 is not going to happen for a very long time we were in the 14 range for very long time and now we see a very big spike and I think if you're selling at these levels mistake I think okay I think it's a mistake so I personally am selling certain stocks I'm getting out of Shopify today I got out of Shopify but I personally am not scared at all of the high quality of the tech stocks although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like

any regulations I don't have to worry about any of the any of the nonsense uh you know all those you know what I'm talking about I think this is a grow scare I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in September and August it's probably going to be a bit shaky I'm not going to lie to you the vix is high for a reason I think it's going to be a bit shaky not much we can do there my thoughts on the 50 basis point cut in September goodness sometimes I feel like when I sit I'm I'm I kind of look fat but uh let me sit up straight I just want to make sure I'm still on camera here 50 basis point cut in September that's what the market is pricing in I personally don't think so mark my words we're going to get a 25 basis point cut not not 50 basis points 50 basis points going to be a bit high but the market is actually pricing in a higher percentage so we'll see on that now I want to talk about some interesting points which is low data uh there there's low data in terms of people are saying right now that employment numbers are really bad but I think there's low data points because why I think a lot of people are leaving the workplace but if you look at social media everyone is starting a new business so I think what's actually going on is employment numbers are low because nobody wants to work for a company for a big Corporation slaving their life away especially at the lower level positions okay that's also a big reason why Starbucks is in a lot of trouble Nike in trouble a lot of retail companies are in trouble I was looking at CNBC I like CNBC I just don't like I don't like the people always talking on CNBC I I do like uh that CNBC did a really deep dive Research into Starbucks and they were saying how stores keep opening up but same store sales are going down guys same store sales going down I don't even know like I want to take a bottle and like just like I I want to point to you how important how dire of a situation this is when you see same store sales going down this is the end of the world this is that is the end of the company now Starbucks is not going to go out of business but that is the end of that company Rising higher now Starbucks is going for very good valuation but I am no longer bullish on Starbucks I really want to buy it as well as Nike but same store sales going down guys this is Redline awful this is essentially you have a 100 customers come to your restaurant and then the next day 99 next day 98 next day '97 96 95 94 your restaurant's literally dying that's what's happening to Starbucks unfortunately not unfortunat I don't really care we don't have any Star we don't have much of a Starbucks position we've done fine on Starbucks but I'm just telling you I'm pointing out the fact that retail stocks are in big trouble big trouble huge trouble don't don't be invested in Starbucks Nike don't be invested in retail uh you need Big Brand right now Big Brand and Nike and Starbucks is obviously Big Brand but it's retail big Big Brand which is no go for me right now no go absolutely not uh Nike same thing with their shoes too much competition too much competition and I think small businesses right now are opening up uh you know for example luck and coffee I know they had like this whole scam but in China luck and coffee surpassed Starbucks same thing with in China there apple is not doing as well in China right now same thing with the Chinese automobiles hackling Tesla so guys right now it's a very interesting time to be invested in the market because I actually think it's a stock Pickers Market AKA it's my market it is my market right now I picked I picked Apple I picked many other good stocks which have led me to beat the market by a lot it's a stock pi Pickers market right now as well doing well on Palance your uh wheel strategy it's down but more or less I'm still doing better than the market due to the options themselves because the options allow me to get premium and income so the stock is down but the options are generated income which is hedging and protecting my portfolio and giving me that stability in the portfolio and like looking at small businesses that's where it's at right now small businesses is where it's at and that's going to hurt some of the big brands for sure hands down so startbucks Nike good valuation right now but this is not a stock that I want to personally dollar cost into I would dollar cost into Nvidia I think Apple's great Amazon went down so much guys I think Amazon's fantastic because Amazon's more of that Marketplace they're not really yes they have a brand of course but it's not like they have a big YouTube channel or big social media presence they do but it's really the marketplace it's really the product business that's doing so well for Amazon it's literally demand for the Amazon Marketplace so brands are on Amazon so I'm not making an individual bet on a brand I'm just making a bet on a Marketplace and then being a middleman so that's why Amazon is fantastic stock right now whereas individual brands are kind of hard to bet on because they go up and they go down and they can go out of business fairly quickly so I don't really think we're going to get a 50 basis point cut I think we're going to be at about 25 I would say be logical be logical please do not get emotional I'm here on YouTube to educate to help I'm here to support you comment I'm going to read the comments of course my Discord Community has access to me I am here to support and to help you not lose money to invest money wisely to get to retirement that save passive income that's it that's my whole goal in life that's what I want please don't I mean if you want to panic and sell that's up to you my opinion is be

Invest with Henry,tqkUC-BXK1M,2024-08-05T19:23:45Z,STOCK MARKET CRASH EXPLAINED! Should You Buy or Sell?,Nvidia,although they are down significantly as well as Nvidia which good friend of mine he has uh bought puts on Nvidia and I was looking at him like you're crazy Nvidia is so bullish but we do see some of these stocks with high priced earnings ratios high price to sales ratios that are on the expensive side now pulling back and it is painful but I would not sell at these levels right now I also want to point out to you guys that if and when if and when when the recovery happens is going to recover very fast so although you're feeling a lot of pain right now today you're not really going to feel pain in 6 months from now or 12 months from now the market is going to recover markets tend to rise that's literally rule number one okay rule number one on uh from Buffett is don't lose money which is like a obvious rule right I don't need to repeat myself oh rule number one is don't lose money everyone knows that rule that's already a cliche rule my rule guys which I learned on Wall Street is markets tend to rise which is why I'm a Perma okay I'm not one of the Bears out there although I I realize that it's important to hedge your portfolio it's like right now with covered calls I'm being a little bit more aggressive to collect income not a bear by no means yes my title I need to get some clicks right because if I don't make my title market crash no one will click because everyone on YouTube does the same exact title unfortunately that is the game on YouTube but I'm being honest with you I'm delivering you the information that I personally in my heart believe which is do not panic do not sell do not cut your positions that are high quality positions this is what I believe in my heart and I'm telling you I'm literally buying more stock I'm literally going to be buying more stock there's more things I need to cover in this video a lot of important things actually kind of all over the place cuz obviously my emotions are high not from the market but from my students my Discord Community they're panicking so I feel really compelled my 45-minute call today was like an hour and 15-minute call because I want to add extra support to my subscribers to my Discord members I want to give everyone extra support right now because on a mental level this is very hard to deal with it's not hard for me at all guys this is not hard for me whatsoever financially it's also not hard for me from a belief perspective do I think we're going to recover do I have any doubts in my skills or my ability to invest not at all not at all this is to me this is actually easy mode I love to see some struggle this is actually a fantastic time for me to outperform and prove this is actually the time to prove that no other YouTuber doesn't have my results everyone is losing more money right now nobody has bought puts all the people fearmongering right now I'll do this this is the crash none of them bought puts what's up with those guys nobody bought puts nobody even has a results of -6% versus -2% those guys are down more than negative 12% way more guys people holding Nvidia stock all these people that are just pushing Nvidia I'm sorry to go off topic this not off topic I just want to point out that it can be really dangerous to be invested in just one stock Nvidia down 22% okay Tesla I don't need to prove myself all right facts speak for themselves 6% down versus 12% down on the market versus other YouTubers weigh down way more okay facts speak for themselves right U that was my Discord Community I want to talk about the opportunity in September because in August you should be dollar cost averaging you should buy more shares however you should have some dry powder I'm going to contradict myself a little bit if you have the cash you should hold a little bit extra dry powder I personally don't have much dry powder but I think it it can be wise to have a little bit more dry powder just to see what happens with the FED stuff just to see what happens a little bit more with earnings you should be buying but don't just I'm going to put all my money to the market now I don't think any of you guys are doing that I think a majority of people watching my video and a majority of people investing right now are more on the cautious side they're more scared oh I'm going to sell everything no don't be that guy listen to me 6% down versus 12% down in the market and YouTubers down if they were transparent like I am showing my portfolio exactly how I'm showing they're not doing it because they can't they can't they don't have the experience they don't have same results as me please don't sell now I want to talk about the growth scare Tom Lee says this is just a growth scare okay Tom Lee said that he thinks that the market right now is just a growth scare and everything will cover I fully agree I fully agree I think this is just a growth scare my personal opinion coming from just Henry just guy in the internet who is successful but I don't have any credentials credentials although I have more experience than everyone else I don't have credentials guys I don't have a CPA a CFA I don't have those things because I wanted to be a coach I wanted to help people and I don't want to stop and work on Wall Street I don't enjoy working on Wall Street I hated my job I hated uh being in finance I hated

Invest with Henry,rL4t3G8O1kY,2024-08-03T14:02:27Z,PLTR. DO THIS BEFORE MONDAY,Palantir,"this video is going to be about paler stock how I'm running the wheel strategy on paler stock and why I think that you should ignore the recession because overall if you stick to the wheel strategy you're going to make income regardless I do want to go into paler right now I'm going to cover several pieces of news that I think you have to understand as well as what strikes I will pick for paler wheel strategy now keep in mind the stock has earnings so I quickly want to talk about some things that I did see on X about palen here and uh one of them is that satin nadela the CEO of Microsoft says that a Q2 earnings call basically the number of paid models in service customers more than doubled quarter over quarter and we're seeing increased usage by leaders in every industry from Adobe and Bridgestone Etc now paler getting a mention from SAA as a leader in their industry is quite special so look you have other CEOs basically talking about Alex karp and uh the leadership that he has in AI I don't think Microsoft can buy uh paler or anything like that but him you know getting kind of like a shout out just kind of says a lot the second piece of news I want to talk about is Kathy Wood I mean she has just bought paler which just from a news perspective I think is really interesting and then most important important thing I want to cover right now is I know everyone's like worried about a stock market crash but look Q2 earnings are coming out on Monday for paler and I firmly believe like if you look at the price right here at 2465 I think we're at a very very good level just to Simply get in using the wheel strategy to generate income on this stock I mean I think there's just so much opportunity here by selling put options to to jump in I would definitely jump in at the $24 level I'll explain to you why in just a moment but you can see here the Delta is 39 very high implied volatility that is because of earnings so let's just quickly talk about what I basically expect to happen during earnings now the first one is AI demand is real and disruptive now this is a fact AI is going to be the future and the fact that paler has a stake in AI I think makes this stock a really powerful stock to be invested in not even running the wheel strategy necessarily just owning stock only pounder provides value in AI That's not really that true there's a lot of companies in AI without ontology your LMS are useless so ontology is something that's really important it's another growing Trend and palen here has uh its hands in the pockets of ontology all right so everyone is focused on the chat but the values and AI agents uh another thing that palen here is working on it's pretty interesting in terms of AI right and and focusing on chat but obviously a lot of this stuff is kind of jokes so let's keep moving on to what I think is important obviously 1,000 Roi see is not going to happen we humiliate other Solutions in the market now to a certain degree this is actually true paler does humiliate other solutions they do have more brand they have more relationships so in terms of competition it's slim to not kind of switch down here this is such a huge one this is actually part of the reason why paler has such a big valuation is because AI in manufacturing is going to replace a lot of jobs and that's going to save companies a lot of money and that's going to create a lot of income for paler Consulting Services there's a whole bunch of stuff on this list you can just take a look at it obviously I don't think a lot of this is going to matter for paler stock but I already talked about the most important one which is AI so going back here what I'm going to suggest or recommend here is that uh the 24 put is a very good entry into paler just look just look at actually the chart here on Palante here this stock actually has a lot of support so if I go to the three months chart right now you can see here how yes the stock was a lot higher was actually pushing towards $30 per share but there is very strong support very hard bounce here from the June uh 21st level at around the high 23 so let's just call it $24 per share so palen here has now retracted along with the rest of the market the analysts did adjust pounder stock price Target ahead of earnings now this is something that I was actually doing when I was working on Wall Street I was looking at earnings adjustments and those are very very important actually taking a look at an earnings adjustment is basically say that an analyst thought that they were going to report 8 cents on average there's like 10 analysts and it's 8 cents on average and now a bunch of analysts change their opinion and uh they're now going to report 10 cents that is a big difference from 8 to 10 cents doesn't sound like a lot but it's actually like a 20% difference so basically let's just kind of go over this real quick so Alex carp was saying that I think it's fair to say that we crushed q1 in the US all right so that's cool so what's going to happen in Q2 as to why the data analysis software provider co-founder by the billionaire investor Peter the 2003 is winning in the US carp said paler built software infrastructure that allows Enterprises both commercial and government to move Beyond chat move Beyond self-pleasuring to actually produce things that are valuable I dare remind people that there was a time when no one thought we'd be profitable when no one thought we could crack commercial where Revenue per person was called into question he said and now by the way Revenue per person is something that's very important because when you have a lot of employees and low Revenue then you can't really be valued as a high company I mean sure Walmart is valued pretty highly but um in general per Revenue per employee is very low so they have a lot of employees whereas that's not the case of paler paler is not going to get a bunch of store clerks and cashiers paler has the very high level Consultants AI professionals data analysts Etc so they need to have very high Revenue per person and that was called into question before not anymore carp said the company does face headwinds in Europe where 16% of its business is located Europe is gliding toward 0% GDP growth over the next couple of years he said that is a problem for us there is no easy remedy for that it is also the case though that Us by comparison surpassed the US European commercial and we see that as favorable while the company sales are driven largely by helping the US government with its counterterrorism efforts paler has also pushed more deeply into managing interpreting and Reporting data for large companies data is the new oil and data is absolutely why I am bullish on pal here and I have a degree in data analytics I have a degree in finance economics data analytics or business analytics it was pretty much the same thing data and business analytics that's what I studied Drexel and I had some time at pen uh so paler CEO super proud of the results carp said there were a lot of questions about why we are so active in defending the value of the West well because he makes money off of the West anyways long story short given all of this news given what is going on with Kathy Wood given Q2 earnings are coming out very very shortly on Monday I would say that the biggest bet that you can make in terms of paler is just simply sticking to the wheel not really paying attention to all the news of market crash Market's going to go up and down",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,QflccIcTaqk,2024-08-01T22:17:54Z,"Learn to Sell Put Options for $10,000 Monthly Passive Income",PayPal,Let's take a look at a stock like PayPal I think PayPal has really good support levels right now so I'm going to go to PayPal and I'm going to trade PayPal options You can see right now that PayPal actually has gone down a little bit it was as high at $67 now at 61 so given that it has pulled back down quite a bit um I'm going to go ahead and show you an example of selling an outof the- money option and the profitability that I would have um from selling an out of the money option so let's go for something like July you can go for an expiration date that is two weeks out 3 weeks out four weeks out anything around that one month Mark is the ideal time for selling puts if you want safe passive consistent income all you have to do is just sell out of the money options that expire few weeks out okay on high quality companies so for PayPal we're going to go to sell put option and I'm going to scroll down and for example let's just say that I'm going to go really really safe now this would be a very conservative play I'm going to sell the 57 A2 put you can see here how my Delta is 0. 21 and my chance of profit is 79.8 7% given the very high chance of profit this basically means again that I'm going to be winning eight out of 10 times on this trade however I actually consider myself winning 10 out of 10 Trad trades on this specific trade because for example even if this trade goes into the money I'm happy to purchase PayPal at $575 that would be a very good value for me so I don't mind collecting $73 to be forced to buy PayPal at $575 I'm literally getting paid to buy a stock for a lot less than the current price that the stock is going for in the market given that I think selling put options is an absolute no-brainer strategy that can create that passive income and actually force you into buying high quality good stocks good value stocks that you want to own anyways so in the worst case scenario you will have to basically buy PayPal 57 A5 if it is above 575 then you do not have to buy it this option will simp expire on July 19th and on July 22nd that Monday this option won't exist in your portfolio anymore so the $73 is yours right away as soon as you sell the option from that point on you don't really have to do anything all you have to do is hold this position until expiration and it'll expire worthless if it's above 572 if it's below 572 you will be assigned 100 shares per contract that you have sold so if I've sold one contract then I'm going to get assigned um 100 shares per one contract okay,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,IuC4UbaXORY,2024-07-31T20:40:59Z,Make 10% Monthly on Small Accounts With This Covered Call Options Strategy,Apple,"Apple Apple has been one of my top stocks and it's been going absolutely parabolics you can actually see right here I have apple and I have a $222,000 gain on Apple but I'm going to be showing you a poor man's cover call example on Apple right now so specifically the poorman's cover call strategy is one of the best if you don't have that much money to work with now you can also use the poor man's covered call strategy even if you have a 50k portfolio 100K portfolio a TK portfolio this is a very versatile strategy which is why I love it so much I think it's good for uh pretty much all option investors and specifically the poor man's cover call strategy gives you the ability to have a lot of exposure to a stock without having to put up that much um Capital into it so you know if we were to buy 100 shares of apple right now it would cost 21,000 but with a pman covered call strategy I'm going to buy a call option that is going to expire on March 21st 2025 now the reason why I'm going so far out into the future is because I'm looking to buy a call option out in the future to mimic owning stock okay I wanted to literally be very similar to owning a stock and for that reason I'm going to pick an in the money call option that's expiring way way out into the future you can go six months you can go 12 months you can go yeah 12 months is perfectly fine that's probably like the textbook um standard would be 12 months so I'm going to go ahead and buy a call option uh so what we're going to do is I'm going to expand this 160 right here you can see the Delta is 093 that's a little bit Overkill it's a little bit too much in the money I don't need that much I'm going to go for the 170 90 Delta a little bit too much I'm going to go for the 180 uh 86 Delta is pretty good it's still kind of like on the high end so let me go for like it's actually pretty interesting how high the Delta is I'm surprised because I know Apple's like above 200 but still I didn't know that the chances of being above 190 would be so high Delta right here is going to be if I go ahead and buy this it's telling me to buy it all in one swoop but what I want to do is I want to create a two option order so what I'm going to do instead right now is I'm just going to go and buy uh I think it was 190 right uh yes it was 190 so I'm going to go ahead and buy the 190 but now I'm going to go to sell and I'm going to sell a different expiration date with the PO man's comfor call strategy you want to sell shorter term call options so you can go for for weekly income which I don't really recommend because it is a whole lot of management you can also go for monthly expirations which is probably the sweet spot for me I like one to six weeks but for poor man's covered call definitely four to six weeks would be much more ideal even 8 weeks is perfectly fine so especially if an option is expiring in one year you can go for every eight weeks because that's two months and then you can do that basically six times in a year so the goal is actually very interesting with a poor man discovered call strategy let's take a look at the call option itself so if you just have a call option it can rise in value and the short calls can lose money basically that's what can happen right you can lose money on the short call you can make money on the long call or you can lose money on the long call and make money on the short call so it's a little bit interesting because you're either losing on one or the other however what if I told you you can win on both so that is very possible and that's what I aim to do and here's how I find The Sweet Spot of managing the strategy to make both happen basically I pick a stock that is bullish right Apple has been bullish um then I will sell a option that is expiring in two months so let's just go for August 16 just copy this logic if you're watching this in the future so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to sell a call option I'm going to sell out of the money so I bought an in the money covered call I'm going to explain to you how this all works in just a second I know it's a little bit confusing this is a little bit harder of a strategy than a typical like spread or um other covered call strategy this is a little bit more complex lies but I promise I'm going to explain everything to you so if you do a sell call you can sell an out- ofth money call if I was going to do a two-month out call I wanted to have like an 80% chance of success or higher so I'm going to pick the 235 right now so this this 235 uh call option basically has a Delta of .19 which is really good it means 80% of the time I'm going to win and 19% of the time this option is going to go in the money so that's a good thing I'm going to end up choosing this option right here so the 235 so now you can see that I'm going to be selling the 235 call and I'm going to be buying the 190 call so here's how it works let's just kind of re reverse engineer what can happen so the first thing that could happen is let's say that Apple just stands still okay the long call option is going to lose some value because obviously like a call option benefits When the stock goes up and if a stock doesn't do anything this option will lose some value but the 235 short call will just Pro at $22 so at $816 you will make $25 so that's $215 and you're putting up roughly right it's like $3,400 so you can make like 7% in two months that's pretty good if the stock did nothing you're literally making 7% now the other thing that can happen is obviously the stock can go down in that case you're going to end up losing money this is a bullish strategy so you will lose money if the stock goes down just being honest with you you're going to lose money if the stock stands still you're going to see a small return okay so although you're going to make $218 or $215 the option the long option may lose half of that so it may lose 100 you may make 200 so you're going to end up making $100 on 3,000 so you're going to make three three and a half% so sorry you're not going to make the 7% because you're going to make 7% but the long call option is going to be losing some value right it's losing and it's decaying because nothing's happening okay so you're going to make 3 and a half% in 2 months not too bad all right but here is where this strategy is strong okay I know I haven't been doing Justice yet because I've been basically talking about this this strategy losing or breaking even but look if Apple goes up by just 2% 2% would be roughly $5 if Apple goes up 2% this strategy right here is going to print money okay so what's going to happen is the 190 call is probably going to go up in value a little bit it's going to probably go up by a very small amount not that much it's not going to go up a lot because well two months will go by and it'll experience some Decay but if Apple goes up just 2% that's $5 this long call option probably going to go up in value by a dollar or two okay so Apple will be up five this will be up say two about $2 but this call option right here will expire and you're going to make another or $2 so this is where you're going to make $4 or yeah $400 on this position which is only 3,400 so you're going to make an over 10% return now if Apple goes up by $10 which is a 5% move right roughly 5% this is what would happen now because this call option is gaining Delta it's gaining Delta because the more in the money it is the more correlated it is by the way I'm being very conservative now that I think about it since this is an in the money option the 190 you're probably going to make more than $2 but let's just stick to $2 another example now if it goes up $10 this option has 80 Delta right 80 Delta so 8080 Delta time $10 is $8 so you're going to make $8 on the long call option minus some Decay so let's just call it $7 and the short call option is still out of the money so it expires worthless and you can do it again right you can sell another call option so basically you're going to make 8 $7 right plus the two so you're going to make $9 on 3,400 that's a 30% return so if Apple stock goes up 5% you're making 30% so basically you have a 6X leverage factor in this example if Apple goes up 15% or 20% things get very very interesting so if it goes up 20% obviously you will have a loss on the short call option the short call option is actually going to um cost you some money you're going to have to close it out because 20% more of Apple's current price is going to be like $250 so this will be $15 in the money so you're probably going to have to close it out for $15 because that's going to be the cost there's not going to be any more time value at expiration of the August 16 expiration is just going to be $15 negative however the long call option will go absolutely Bonkers so if Apple went to 250 this would now have a intrinsic value right 250 minus 190 would be $60 not even counting the time okay so right now there's a whole lot of time to this option there's a lot of time right because Apple's nowhere near um you know 190 plus 36 in premium as you can see here Apple's not near 226 right now so there's quite a lot on this option 50% of the option is like time premium right now or more so if it went to 250 you would have 60 intrinsic value and probably another 30 extrinsic value meaning the time that there's still left in the option there a lot more can happen not to mention Apple if it goes up 20% that means volatility in increased and this long call option benefits from higher volatility so basically the long call option can be 60 intrinsic value and then like 30 extrinsic value extrinsic in time but there's going to be more because it will increase because of the Greeks right there's Delta there's Theta there's gamma there's Vega and so on so forth that's not that important what's important to understand is options go up if your long call options they go up with more volatility there's going to be time left it's going to be $60 in the money basically long story short this is going to be like $110 worth so it's going to be like 11 Grand so you're going to make 11 Grand but the short call option you're going to lose $1,500 so you're going to make $99,500 which is pretty wild given that um this option is worth like 3,400 so you can basically triple up your money however you're probably going to have to like roll and manage this position along the way because as it goes up you're going to want to close out to 235 okay you're going to want to close out to 235 and roll it to 240 250 Etc okay um but long story short the poor man's cover call strategy will have huge results huge benefits if you pick a stock that's going up so this is basically the best strategy that I would use on a bullish stock so if you look at Nvidia um you're going to have a lot of profits versus buying Nvidia stock that was very expensive now Nvidia has had a stock split so it's a lot cheaper but before the poor man covered call shot you would have literally printed money on Nvidia you would have made so much money you would have retired had you put in even like 10 grand into Nvidia um the poor man's cover call strategy would basically give you probably multiple six figures right now on Nvidia if you have been using the poor man's C call strategy and you've been selling out of the money options well out of the money options of course because when you're looking at volatile stocks you want to go for out of the money for example I can kind of edit this position right now you can see here so let's say that I was very bullish on Apple or whatever stock we're using Apple in this case I don't have to do 235 I can go higher out of the money to 240 because if the option goes into the money that's not that good because there is a chance of assignment and when the option is in the money and it's close to expiration not that good because your chance of assignment continues to increase as you approach expiration therefore you want to pick your strike very closely you want to be very smart with your strike and basically you want to pick a strike that has good resistance so let's say apple has good resistance at 235 you still may want to go very safe and sell like a 240 cuz that is going to be higher than 235 so whatever you think you need to do always be safer and more conservative than what you have to do because options are leverage there are risks with options generally speaking when I'm doing covered calls and selling puts that's safer than Stock Investing that's safer than any other Forex crypto whatever that is the safest thing period for retirement I have so many students that are retired selling options but when it comes to the poor man's cover call strategy it is a leveraged option strategy so yes you can make a lot of money but you can also lose some money now I'm not going to say this is that that risk of a strategy because it's not if you have let's say 10 to 15 positions you should have like different stocks that you're invested in and if there's a bare Market the poor man's cover call strategy will suffer but everyone will suffer in a bare market so I'm just telling you all the truth I'm telling you everything that you need to know about the poorman's covered call strategy and for me again the long call has to be about a year the short call can be a month two months you have to pick stock that you really really like so this was an example on Apple I'm going to give you another example right now we're going to go into my portfolio and look at some other examples by the way right now I have apple I have Amazon I have American Airlines I have pener I have Target I have Walmart PayPal Shopify and QQQ",1.0,0.9

ASAP!,McDonald's,Today actually during my coaching call that I do Mondays and Wednesdays live for 45 minutes I ended up selling a put option on McDonald's so if I go to Total return right here you will see that today I sold a put option on McDonald's I literally opened this up today and I'm up so far $830 which is my community we're up today 2 hours ago it says 2 hours ago I opened this up why brand I specialize in building Brands that's what I've did for a very long time technology Brands okay those are the two things I know McDonald's has a fantastic brand as you guys know I'm traveling the world I enjoy living a freedom lifestyle have all the money that I need I still like making more money but that's not my driver my driver is freedom Health friends and having a good time and enjoying what there is in this life being thankful and grateful for what we have right I'm sitting here in mdova which is where my parents are from like Moldova is next to Ukraine and essentially we have McDonald's here okay and I just noticed that McDonald's is very busy so no matter where I go into the world right I've been all over where the Olympics are right now and in Paris uh I've been through all the countries in Europe I've been in in Asia as well I've been to Thailand I want to visit Vietnam I've been to many places and everywhere I go I see McDonald's is full I was just in Warsaw Warsaw Poland McDonald's is very full people keep going there it's like a it's where the people go during the day um is where people go at night whether they're drinking and getting drunk you guys know I don't drink I don't smoke take Health very seriously I I want to make be very clear of that because I take this YouTube stuff very seriously I take education very seriously and I take educating you guys very seriously I like to have fun but I don't smoke don't do drugs nothing like that I don't know why I want to say that but I've gotten a few comments doesn't matter anyways when you look at McDonald's brand same store sales guys same store sales okay giving you lots of Education some of you guys don't like that I ramble but honestly I don't care I'm giving you all the education possible and I'm telling you stuff that no other YouTuber will because no other YouTuber they're all YouTubers they don't have Financial experience to the point to the degree that I have even if they have a CFA even if they have a CPA doesn't matter I have more experience than a CFA or a CPA I purposely don't have those credentials because those credentials would mean that I wouldn't be able to uh talk and be a coach and help you because you're restricted if you're a financial adviser you're restricted from marketing yourself all right so more nuances for you guys to understand but brand okay fundamentals if you look at the price earnings ratio on McDonald's let me pull up McDonald's real quick McDonald's has a very good price earnings ratio 21 21 is very good that means that basically essentially you paying $21 to make $1 you're probably thinking what that doesn't sound that good well you're paying $21 to make a dollar that's what a price earnings ratio is your the price is 21 over one is 21 21 over 1 is one price to earnings ratio price to earnings so you're earning a dollar and you're paying 21 for it okay so you might be thinking to yourself it's not that good but it's actually pretty good it's pretty good because if you even look at something like a Chipotle which by the way today CMG I also invested in Chipotle if Nvidia will look at Nvidia in just a moment they have much higher price Rings ratios so Chipotle is 48 guys Chipotle and McDonald's are very similar they're both I don't know if they're both fast casual so McDonald's would be fast food whereas Chipotle is more fast casual it's kind of like a little bit higher than McDonald's I would say but not by much the price tag or the average order value is probably about the same I have to look at the annual reports of both companies and take a look at it but nonetheless these companies are pretty comparable yes they're in a different kind of you know food you know one's Mexican one is more of the American style food but one is worth twice as much for Chipotle you literally have to pay $48 to make $1 not that good so you see why I am investing in companies that have lower,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,SXd-v1z5AY8,2024-07-25T16:20:46Z,Options Trading for Beginners FULL FREE COURSE (4 Hours),Apple,"say you buy a share of stock of Apple when the company you know raises its value so does that one share of stock that you bought.
let's say that you want to buy one apple option contract.
I'm going to search up Apple and click trade Apple options.
going to type in AAP so AAP once I click into that you can see I do have 7,000 shares right now I'm going to go into trade right here on the bottom right in trade options.
let's talk about buying a call option on Apple.
it will give me the option to buy Apple 190 call for 1017 expiration.
that's basically where I want Apple to go to so if Apple goes to 190 that means I'm going to break even all right if it goes above 190 that's where I can make money.
if Apple went up to $200 all right you would have a total profit of $15 you have put in two so you went from $2 to $15 you have multiplied your money over seven times whereas a stock investor if the stock goes from 182 to 200 he has made 10% whereas you have made 700% so you can see how valuable an option can be.
Apple's at 181 if I were to buy a call option that's at 180 it's going to be more expensive if I buy something that's 175 it's even more expensive because right here it already has intrinsic value.
there is a chance that Apple will go up and specifically as you see on the screen right here the Delta is2 that means there's a 12% chance that this option will go into the money.
if Apple was extremely volatile and it went up and down by 10 20 $50 a day trust me this option would not be worth a couple of dollars it would be worth tens if not $20 because people would be scared who in their right mind would sell an option on Apple you know right around where it's trading at right now if the stock was moving from 200 down to 100 down to 50 if it was going like this trust me that premium would be very high.
it's different from just regularly buying 100 shares of Apple stock because if I want to buy 100 shares of Apple stock that's going to be $17,000.
Apple is one of my favorite positions.
Apple is my top play I was just listening to Warren Buffett have his discussion on Apple they had a little bit of a cut they had some sale at birkar hathway where they did get rid of $100 million worth of Apple but he had stated that that's just because of rebalancing and other things that are very normal he doesn't he didn't actually lose his confidence in apple.
what I'm going to do is on Apple I'm going to go out for June 21 actually I can also go really short term so again if you're watching this in the future just go for something short term it's fine you go for shortterm or longer term you actually get compensated in proportion to the amount of time that there is s expiration so whether you get paid $1,000 a week or $4,000 a month it's basically give or take the same thing so I'm going to go for a sell put I'm going to go for the 1775 strike price my average cost right now is 182 intraday actually Apple was above my um average cost and now it's you know it's a little bit below 177 and a half is perfectly reasonable for me because I'm actually going to be dollar cost averaging and getting a better price I'm going to be reducing the price that I'm paying per share that I paid in the past so for me it's a good decision I'm going to go ahead and sell 10 contracts right now so I'm going to go for 10 contracts and I'm going to execute this for a112 so I'm going to collect $1,120 right now and boom we just got filled so that's amazing right there so we got filled for Apple so we're going to add that to how much money we have made.
all right so you can actually see here that I have had some difficulties with apple with a $33,000 loss again it's not really a loss because I've been rolling quite often so let me just show you a covered call example okay this will be a covered call example since I don't have any cell puts that are actually losing right now this is my biggest position right now which is Apple at the current time I'm making this video I have two portfolios in this portfolio it's a lot of apple and I think there's nothing wrong with having low diversification once you get really good option trading and you have a big bet that you want to make on a big safe stock like an apple it's really not an issue to put in more of your Capital especially if you're going to trade something like spy which is an index fund so s S&amp;P 500 spy is an ETF as well as QQQ QQQ is the NASDAQ ETF it has a big basket of a lot of stocks so for me spy and QQQ are two ETFs that you can put 100% of your money into and just trade those two things without even having to trade stocks and option trading works the same way on those two they're basically like stocks but within those stocks there's a lot of different companies inside of them okay so Apple um we're going to have to switch our mind a little bit and with a covered call you want the opposite to happen okay so when you're selling puts you want to go down you want to get a lower price okay cuz you know like I showed you if Apple was in the money I would roll it down from 177 to 175 now in the case of a covered call we actually want to move up because remember a call when you're buying a call you're betting on a stock going up when you're selling a covered call you are making income on a stock that you own because it's covered but if it goes above right it moves above you will lose your shares for me I do not want to lose my shares of Apple I'm actually making money on Apple and if I were to lose my shares I don't want to lose them for a couple reasons one of them is taxes I do not want to pay taxes now when I say I don't want to pay taxes I mean legally if I don't sell the stock I don't have a gain that means I don't have to pay taxes okay so that's really important for me cuz I am in a very high tax bracket so what I want to do is I want to roll this position up therefore I do not lose my shares and I don't get assigned on this position so you can see that apple is currently at 18290 whereas my covered call is at 175 so what I'm going to do is I have a loss here I'm going to click roll this position now.
what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to show you how I can roll this option that's expiring on May 24th okay in Just 2 weeks I can roll this into the future so I can go from let's say may um 24th I'm going to go to Ju July 21st so again I'm running the dog strategy the strategy that I basically came up with and called the dog strategy I can move out by 30 days and by $5 so right here you will notice that I can move from 175 to for example 180 now this right here will cost a debit so we're going to go over a couple examples right now this right here is a debit I still have to pay money why why do I still have to pay money well in this scenario I moving up by $5 which is actually a lot of money because I have 70 contracts 5 * 70 * 100 shares each option contract is 100 shares this is going to be $35,000 in 28 days I'm going to improve by $35,000 and the total debit here I'm paying is $88,000 so I'm paying $88,000 to make $35,000 that's why in this example example it will be actually somewhat expensive to close out this position and roll it it'll cost $8,000 however if you don't want to pay at all what you can do is if you increase the time so if I go to 73 days away and now I pick a 180 covered call you will see now due to time due to the extra you know 30 days or so now going from 1 month to 2 months you will actually notice that I'm now collecting a next credit of $2,800 so I went from spending $8,000 to making $35,000 to now collecting 2,800 to make $35,000 that's how rolling works and you can play around with different strike prices so let's say that you want to move up by $10 because when I move up by five I'm still in the money so if I wanted to move up by 10 my total debit would be very big right cuz I'm moving up by a lot so now my debit would be 16 okay if I wanted to roll up by a lot lot more my total debit would be 46,000 okay it does not make sense you want to make small adjustments that's why when a stock does go parabolic it moves up a lot it falls down a lot rolling is not your get out of jail free card it's not going to get you out of every single situation at the end of the day if a stock moves against you completely you will have to wait patiently to actually make your money back you won't always be able to roll and fix every single position however I will say that rolling for me fix fixes 90% of positions so as long as the market isn't crashing as long as you're picking high quality companies you're going to make money rolling and in this example with the covered call I've already made money it's already above my average cost and I've already collected income as a covered call the only thing that I'm really paying for here the debit is to not lose my shares and to step up in my cost basis and by the way I advise well not a financial adviser of course I'm just the guy in the internet but I advise or tell my clients my students and my Discord that they can roll unlimited times guys you can roll indefinitely month after month after year after year forever for the rest of your life without ever having to actually pay money for taxes you can keep stepping up in your cost bases is actually one of my unlimited profit potential strategies that I use with rolling I just roll indefinitely forever.
I've also traded many other stocks Apple Google Microsoft I personally like to stick to technology companies because using spreads on tech companies gives you the best of both worlds it gives you high implied volatility which means the stocks are moving up a lot you can make a lot of money quickly gives you good risk reward ratio which is also very important for me and honestly like I really love the limited risk that I have with spreads.
the covered call is best used on really high quality companies so for me that's Apple that's Google that's Microsoft that's other highquality companies that are in the S&amp;P 500.
let's go over an example right now I'm going to use Apple stock so I'm going to click apple right here and then I'm going to open up a put credit spread actually you can see right here how I'm up 380k on the stock and it does make up a significant portion of my portfolio again if you want to see all of my picks I do have a link in the description where you can actually check out my community where I post every single trade that I make now let's go to trade Apple options.
what I'm specifically looking at right now is Delta I want to sell a low Delta the lower the Delta the lower the chances are that the option is going to expire in the money which is a good thing if you're an option seller going to move up right now to the 220 strike and you can see right here that the Delta is9 which is pretty good that means that I'm going to win about 80% of the time and 20% of the time this option will go into the money so that's perfectly fine with me I'm going to go sell put option and then I'm going to click right here now if I were just to make this trade right now you can see here on the top right it says cash secured put so I'm just selling a put option but to actually make this a spread now we have to go ahead and buy a put option so first we sold a put option now we're going to buy a put option for me I like to buy a put option one leg down typically I really like the width of $5 a $5 width is pretty much the best I'll tell you why if you're doing spreads that are $1 worth it's not ideal because every time you're trading you are actually losing a little bit of money because there's something called the bid and ask spread here the bid is 1.3 and the ask is 1.35 that means every time that you're trading there's a little bit of a difference actually a couple of dollars that you're losing out on so if you're doing many a lot of quantity of you know $1 $2 spreads that's not ideal I'd rather do a $5 spread and do a little bit lower quantity but lose less money when I'm making the trade there is implicit cost and explicit cost this is going to be an implicit cost because it's not really factored in but you could Factor it in yourself because now you know so I'm going to go ahead and buy this 215 strike price and now you will see something very interesting so now it says put credit spread and the difference is $5 you can see here I have a net credit of $75 or roughly $75 to $80 that is actually going to be my Max profit my Max profit profit is what I collect on this option trade right here so let's just say $80 is how much I'm making and I can lose $420 now why is it$ 420 and not 500 well when I'm making a $5 with spread that means I'm risking $500 but because I'm collecting $80 that means that the difference is going to be $420 so at most I can lose $420 my Max profit is 80 my Max loss is 420.
you will see that Apple has gone up a lot so it's actually not ideal to trade right now on the iron Condor so I'm actually going to go to something else because I want you to pick a stock that is more predictable for an iron iron Condor strategy.",1.0,0.9

now that I have Robin Hood open I'm going to search up Apple and click trade Apple options.
you can see here there is a Max cost in my program and my Discord Community I'm teaching people how to mainly sell options for income but for this example right here this is a buying strategy now I don't love buying strategies because buying strategies are very high reward but also a lot higher on the risk versus selling strategies we'll talk more about that later in this video but in this example this will cost you $900 3 there's a little 3C fee regulation fee from Robin Hood now that they just recently implemented.
Robin Hood is kind of mispricing this by 2 cents here but at that point that's where you break even.
I'm going to jump into my Robin Hood right now and I'm going to show you an example of how I would run a buy put on Starbucks.
Robin Hood won't let you do that and many other brokerages also won't let you do that based on your account size as well as your level of trading ability.
you can see on Robin Hood that we're going to look at some of these Greeks and we're going to go over them and uh what they mean and how to actually use them.
Robin Hood though gives you the ability to roll both selling puts and covered calls these are the only two things that you can roll on this platform now other platforms which I'm not an expert on on do probably I think many of them do let you roll in one transaction even if it is a spread because some of those platforms are paid platforms whereas Robin Hood is free it's not necessarily free there are some other issues but that is a topic for a different video.",1.0,0.1

I have actually traded meta quite a bit and meta seems to have a really strong bounce here you can actually see how I'm up about $11,000 on a sell put that I already have on meta so I can just go for that again I can go for future expiration here I'm going to go to sell putut I'm going to go for I'm going to go for something a little bit longer so we have already showed you guys that I can go for a zero DT trade now I'm going to go for an August trade it's about 100 days out you know it's not too bad at all I'm going to go down to say 410 this is a 22 Delta it's a little high for me you can go 40405 20 Delta it's about you know it's about right I think this is fine right here check out the bid ass spread it's 1180 12 by the way the reason why I'm not always looking at technical analysis and you know is because I'm following these stocks on a very regular basis I'm very close with all my stocks on my watch list so I'm paying attention to the stocks and I know that meta has really really good support around 400 so you can see here how this is 405 but my break even is 393 so my break even is below the support line so if it hits support I'll actually get exercised I'll actually have to buy shares of meta but I'll be pretty happy because I'm going to be buying shares below what is support so I'm actually going to be owning shares and still be in a profit because 393 the average uh cost here is going to be below what the stock will trade out so so if the stock goes down to 400 I'm going to get exercised but my break even is 393 so I'm really not going to care okay I'm going to be in a in a positive so I'm going to go ahead and sell the 405 here and I'm going to go for a probably decent Siz position going go for five contracts and um I will go ahead and execute for um 1180 and just if you guys weren't sure I wasn't sure how much money I have made I don't see it on the screen at the moment but yeah this trade itself is going to bring in $5,800 so I think I'm going to pass the trading check challenge that we just had so there you go I submit it so we're going to add $ 5,899 185 or 5900 to our trading challenge here and there you have it we have made a grand total of this amount of money on screen right now by selling put options.
meta has good profit margins yep so here's an example of a beautiful business this is something that Warren Buffett would look at something that he would own because you know the profit margin here is is really big it's 36% on large volume because it's a big software company profit margin is 36%.",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,SXd-v1z5AY8,2024-07-25T16:20:46Z,Options Trading for Beginners FULL FREE COURSE (4 Hours),Tesla,"like take Tesla for example Tesla is a pretty volatile stock because the price goes up and down a lot so the premium for Tesla is going to be more expensive than a stock which is very stable say craft hindes.
if you're buying options well Tesla moves up and down a lot so you could make a lot of money.
I do want to look at a different scenario so I'm going to look at a stock like at Tesla because Tesla has had some volatility and I have actually bought it very recently so you can see here how Tesla is actually now consistently below the moving average if I go to let's go to three months here Tesla is below the moving average here it had a really sharp Decline and here you can actually see on the RSI it actually became very low it almost hit 20 it almost hit oversold but you can see here how it was 24 and because it was so low this was a fantastic time to into the stock because low RSI says that the stock is oversold too many people are negative there's too much skepticism out there this is a fantastic time to do the opposite to be a you know conservative investor to go against the grain and to make a decision to buy so this right here at 140 was actually a price that I didn't get it at 140 but I started buying it at 150 I had 150 sell puts by the way so you already know right now what a sell put is so I've sold puts at 150 and that's because I wanted to buy Tesla for $150 so now I'm actually very happy because I got ass signed for $150 and currently the stock is at 184 so I ended up making really really good money like 20% return in like a month so it was a actually phenomenal decision to sell puts so yeah so what I would look at right here is we're below the moving average and now Tesla has popped up above the moving average so now we have strong momentum I would still jump into the stock right now and I would use some option strategies and I would use a bull call spread which we will talk about later in this course because when it comes to buying options there's some really interesting strategies that you can use you can put up a very small amount of money get a very big return so I would use uh some different spread strategies on Tesla actually how was able to go one year from $100,000 to $700,000 back in 2021 was I was using a lot of spreads and a lot of small account strategies which you will learn about on Tesla I saw there was a lot of momentum I traded Tesla very heavily and I made you know 100K into $700,000 I made $600,000 that year it was a fantastic here and it was mainly it was a lot of Tesla trading as well as other technology companies as well.
if you take a look at Tesla just to give you guys a different perspective of other companies and how expensive they are you can see here that Tesla has a very interesting scenario Tesla actually has a PE ratio of 47 right now but in the future because actually it looks like analysts are expecting their earnings to actually slow down and because they expect it to actually slow down you can see here the forward PE ratio is actually more expensive this is a signal that Tesla can actually be a very bad stock if Tesla doesn't experience enough growth this could be a stock that has to go down in value because the PE Ratio is just way too expensive now also the PEG ratio is also very expensive the PEG ratio here is 3.27 NVIDIA seems very expensive and it's going up a lot and and Tesla is going down a lot but the fact of the matter is it actually looks like Tesla is a worse value it actually looks like this stock that's falling is worse and Nvidia is better because in the future envidia is likely to grow more based on analyst estimates whereas Tesla looks like it's going to slow down and because it's slowing down the PEG ratio here is actually worse it's actually a lot more expensive to buy Tesla now they taking a look at the next metric is price to sales price to sales is simply how much is the price of the stock how much revenue do they have and those two numbers are divided so for example you can see that the market cap for Tesla is $580 billion and let's say that their sales is 100 billion so if it's 100 billion you take the market cap of 5.89 divided by 100 billion you get 5.89 here we have a ratio 6.8 which means that Tesla has just probably under about $100 billion do worth of sales per year.
I was using spreads on Tesla to multiply my money quickly although Tesla was one of my biggest contributors I've also traded many other stocks Apple Google Microsoft I personally like to stick to technology companies because using spreads on tech companies gives you the best of both worlds it gives you high implied volatility which means the stocks are moving up a lot you can make a lot of money quickly gives you good risk reward ratio which is also very important for me and honestly like I really love the limited risk that I have with spreads.
let's use Tesla and show you a Poor Man's covered call I'm going to buy a call option that's going to expire well into the future all right so I'm going to buy one that's almost one year out for June 20 2025 okay now I'm going to buy something that has around 70 Delta you can see here this has 78 Delta perfect I can also go a little bit higher the 210 this has 76 Delta so this is good all right so I'm going to go ahead and buy this you see here how the total cost is $7,900 well that's a lot better than buying 100 shares of Tesla because Tesla 100 shares would be $25 $5,000 so you're basically getting like 1/4 of the price which is very very good.
we can actually use Tesla because Tesla has had a lot volatility recently and yeah Tesla has gone up a lot um but it doesn't really matter what stock you use I'm just giving you this as an example.",1.0,0.4

Invest with Henry,SXd-v1z5AY8,2024-07-25T16:20:46Z,Options Trading for Beginners FULL FREE COURSE (4 Hours),Microsoft,"Microsoft is currently trading at $410 per share right now let's say that you think Microsoft is at a low right now and you don't think it's going to go much lower in the next 30 days so what you want to do is you want to sell a put option contract on it You picked the strike of $45 which means if Microsoft does happen to fall below 405 you have to be comfortable to buy 100 shares at that price but you won't mind that because you think Microsoft is going to be going up you love Microsoft long term you think that it's at a pretty good good low so you will be happy to buy it at 405 it's currently at 410 so you're going to get paid to buy it for $5 cheaper than where the market is at right now.
let's open up Robin Hood and see what I would actually get paid if I decided to sell the put option so let's pick a strike price of 405 all right so I'm going to go to trade options as I usually do trade options and then I will go for something very short term so I'm going to go very short term here we'll go actually to you know we'll give it a little bit of time so let's just go to the end of the month which is just a couple of weeks so if I go to 405 right here you will see that the premium collected is $480 or $480 so right here I can actually make a 1% return now I know this is 1% because I'm putting up 405 and then 1% of 405 is going to be about $45 so this actually over 1% return I'm getting paid over 1% and under 30 days to buy a stock that is going to be a very good buy at 405 in fact this is actually under 30 days if I were to go to about 30 days I would be a lot closer to actually almost 2% so you can see right here that it's actually $75 so if I were to execute this option one contract here would give me about7 $15 actually you will see here that I was actually on buy a put option but I need to be on sell so actually the price will be a little bit different it's going to be $65 which is still amazing I noticed that because I saw there was a Max profit and that was a bit weird and this strategy actually has a max loss although the max loss here will look extremely scary you might be thinking just oh my goodness why would you ever collect $615 with the max loss of$ 39,000 this Max loss is actually you know it's not really correct in theory it is correct but what it means is if Microsoft went down to zero you lose $339,000 you know I don't know about you but Microsoft is not going to go down to zero I think the world has to literally end for the stock to fall that much there is no way a company decides of Microsoft will go bankrupt there's actually almost no way that stock will even fall 50% yet Al loone and most years it doesn't even fall 10% or it doesn't even fall at all the stock is rising right so although the max loss is very scary this is the equivalent of you getting into your car and the max loss says well you may not live today so you know yes that's scary but most people still have to drive to work we still have life to live and we still take that very very small risk to go into a car every single day it's the same thing here so it has a very big Max loss but you know in all reality this is a very very safe trade that I've been doing for the past 10 years you know I've you know worked for Goldman Sachs as well as a couple other hedge funds I have a degree in this I've sat with many experts on this I've talked to many financial advisers I've talked to hedge fund managers this is a very standard easy strategy that basically every single person in the world does I've seen billionaire portfolios as well this is just a typical strategy that they are using so basically let's do some scenario analysis if Microsoft goes up to say 420 you're totally safe you're going to be making money if Microsoft goes up to anything really if it goes up at all you're going to be making money if Microsoft actually goes down a little bit towards 405 you're still actually going to make money as long as Microsoft stays above 4 now at 405 if Microsoft were to hit 405 you would now be in assignment territory meaning that you will get assigned at expiration if it's in the however you still made a gain because you are collecting $65 here okay so we have 615 so really if it's at 405 you're good if it's at 404 you lose a dollar but you still collect the 615 so you are still positive 515 in fact your break even here would have to go 405 minus the premium that you collect so the break even here would be 3.99 or actually 39885 I'm doing the math in my head so at 39885 that's your break even Point okay you will be buying Microsoft at 405 or below but at 39885 that's actually your break even so if it goes lower than that you will be at a slight loss even considering the premium that you collected which is totally okay because you may deem to yourself that I want to buy Microsoft I'm very happy and by the way this is the truth this is not just an example this is exactly a trade that I would make and as you'll see shortly I'll make trades that look very similar to this so you know if Microsoft goes down past 405 you'll have to buy 100 shares of Microsoft but it's not even that bad because you want to own the stock anyways.
I'm looking at Microsoft sellp put 415 for June 14 the previous example that we were um looking at earlier in this course so you will see here that the Delta is 48 that means that this option has a 48% chance of expiring in the money.
I've also traded many other stocks Apple Google Microsoft I personally like to stick to technology companies because using spreads on tech companies gives you the best of both worlds it gives you high implied volatility which means the stocks are moving up a lot you can make a lot of money quickly gives you good risk reward ratio which is also very important for me and honestly like I really love the limited risk that I have with spreads.
the covered call is best used on really high quality companies so for me that's Apple that's Google that's Microsoft that's other highquality companies that are in the S&amp;P 500.
let me go to Microsoft for them you know when they can save money it is a big deal Microsoft should have some really good profit margins actually meta has good profit margins yep so here's an example of a beautiful business this is something that Warren Buffett would look at something that he would own because you know the profit margin here is is really big it's 36% on large volume because it's a big software company profit margin is 36% you can see here how the share short is very very low I mean you'd be kind of silly to short Microsoft on the long-term basis because you know when I was working on Wall Street one of the analysts told me stocks just like to go up and the longterm they're always Rising so any 15-year period 99% of the time stocks are going up so it's really kind of a bad idea to buy put options on large stable companies in the long term maybe in the short term you can gamble with that but I would not recommend it you can see here how the shares short is very low the price of sales ratio here is 13 which is very high and that's because the market knows that Microsoft has a very stable good business and then they're willing to pay a higher price for the sales and you can see here how the p ratio is actually 30 so it's not bad that means that you put in $30 you get $1 worth of earnings or an earnings yield of about 3.3% so in general 3.3% per year what I'm doing how to get that 3.3 is I reverse 30 and I reverse it I put 30 on the bottom one so 1 divid 30 the earnings of $1 for $30 that you're putting in is about 3.3% so why would would you settle for 3.3% well that 3.3% is going to be growing every single year so Microsoft is improving its business and earnings are growing so the 3.3% will get more as time goes on and that's why people buy stocks they want those earnings as well as dividends there's a lot of dividend paying stocks especially the bigger stocks they will pay you an annual dividend so here you can see that the Ford annual dividend yield is 73% so it's not really high you're not really going to get rich off the dividend but hey some stocks can pay you 3 or 4% dividend so that does add up you get the dividend plus you get upside plus if you're doing something that I call the double dividend strategy which is dividend paying stocks two covered calls you get a double dividend you get paid dividends from the stock as well as you get paid from the covered call you can do that on a quarterly basis basically collect two dividends there and that's a really good way to retire that's a really good way to make you know $110,000 a month $30,000 every quarter $120,000 a year you can get into that retirement Zone pretty quickly with option trading of course you need some Capital it'll take you some time but you know I've been able to achieve that and basically get into the retirement Zone by you know just simply doing strategies like covered calls selling puts as well as some other small account strategies of course.",1.0,0.9

so currently don't have any sell put are losing you know it's a strategy that's working as you can see but we can go for a hypothetical example as well let's go down and use something like paler so let's say that right here paler is losing okay so right here you can see it's it's winning but you know since I don't have any losing trades let's just pretend that this is losing so here's another example and this is already expiring quite a bit out into the future and by the way I can actually show you my history the reason why it's probably expiring in July is most likely that I have already rolled this so whenever you see expirations that are kind of far out into the future that's typically because I rolled okay so I did not roll pounds here but let me find a position that I did roll because I do roll all the time we will want to see this through an example.
I do have pounds here I am currently um doing pretty well on pounds here $113,000 on the stock I'm down a little bit on the options it's a little bit difficult for me to trade this right now it's up 7% so I don't think I want to sell puts as well as they do have earnings as I'm making this video so selling puts before earnings can be smart but often times there's a lot of volatility before earnings so I typically don't like to sell options into earnings I typically like to actually buy options buying options is better.
so that could be pal here that could be anything that you can afford 100 shares of or vice versa if you're just going to sell a put option to get into the strategy then again you need to have that cash laying around.",1.0,0.5

Now one of my other top plays is American Airlines this is a much cheaper play specifically because American Airlines is about $14 per share now this is my top plan my Discord but right now I'm a little bit upset cuz as I'm making this video I'm literally like 2 hours too late because the stock is skyrocketing I have Shar I've have covered call I have sold a put option but it's a little bit frustrating to see the stock go up because basically when a stock goes up the put option premium goes down they become it becomes less valuable because you know as the stock goes up it's becoming further out of the money so right now what we're going to do is we're going to go a little bit riskier I'm going to show you a little bit shorter term of a trade I'm going to go for the 14 and a half again my goal is to actually get assigned I do want to get assigned if I don't get assigned that's fine I collect income if I do get assigned that's also fine with me because I still get to collect income but now I have the shares and I can run something called The Wheel strategy which we will cover later on or you know check out my channel for the wheel strategy this is a very powerful strategy so I'm going to go for selling a put option right now I'm going to go for uh since this is very cheap I'm going to go for 20 contracts here okay so I'm going to go for just $17 per contract and this is hopefully going to get filled for me since I did go towards the bid price there you go I got filled so I made a dollar so we're going to add that to the bottom of how much money I have made so that is the second trade which is going to be American Airlines by the way the reason why I like American Airlines so much I didn't show you the technical analysis I've been literally trading this since I started my program back in 2021 so it's been three years since I've been running Discord and I have been literally trading American Airlines since the very beginning it's because American Airlines has some of the most consistent Returns the stock doesn't actually move up or down a whole lot so over the past one year you can see how it actually started at 1402 now at 1461 so over a whole year period it has gone nowhere it's still at exactly where it has been which means that there's lot of volatility but really no Direction so when there's no direction that makes a perfect candidate for selling options in general because options love volatility and when you're selling options you hope that there isn't any big big moves typically so this is a very profitable strategy that I've been running from the very beginning and the reason why is because right here we're right in the middle of exactly what American Airlines has been historically valued at so it's unlikely to get a whole lot cheaper it's also unlikely to get a whole lot more expensive so selling options on American Airlines is my top play right now that's why I decided to just sell 20 20 contracts now I do have some more contracts actually in my portfolio I have 35 contracts 30 more contracts here so keep in mind I do already have some of this position.
we see American Airlines completely exploding up towards the upside now that's interesting so we'll see what happens there.
you can go $1 out of the money that could be really good for a cheap stock like American Airlines that could also be not that far out of the money for a more expensive stock like Tesla.
that would be $1,400 if the strike is 14 so a covered call means that you already have the cash set aside in the account as well.",1.0,0.8

the covered call is best used on really high quality companies so for me that's Apple that's Google that's Microsoft that's other highquality companies that are in the S&amp;P 500.
all right so the first thing that I want to do is I want to look at Google Google is one of my favorite stocks I'm very bullish on Google Now in the past 3 months the stock did go up about 15% I am going to be looking at technical analysis as well I'm going to be showing you what I'm looking for Technically when I am placing a trade like at what strike do I pick it why and all that whole process so this is going to be like the most valuable thing that you can see because I've been doing this for 10 years this exactly how I make my decisions so if I go to Google I go to charts you can see right here I'm going to get rid of these quick lines these were drawn so if you can see right here actually the stock has gone up I'm using something called the Binger band as well as the moving average both of these are very important for me and I like to look at the six-month view so here you can see that Google is basically at the more higher end of its range it did have an over reaction here and had a pullback however you can see that the Binger band right at the middle is 161 now the RSI is not very high but it's also not very low it's at 63 which is a little bit higher than average so this is actually a perfect candidate for selling a put option not that it's perfect for selling a put option because it's a little bit higher but it's perfect because I don't know when Google's going to pull back and if I want to invest in Google today selling a put option is much better because I'm getting a cheaper price than what the stock is at currently Stock's at 168 as I'm making this video I'm going to sell a put option that is going to be towards the middle of the bowling band of 161 162 so I'm just going to go for 162 and a half now I am going to pick an expiration day that's going to go out at least 30 days this strategy is a little bit more boring it's a little bit more chill it's a you know a bit more relaxed of a strategy the whole goal was just to collect some income be hands off and be very passive with it as well as safe so I'm going to go for June 21 so it's going to be about you know 5 six weeks from today making this video I'm go to sell put and I am going to sell a put option for the 162 so I don't want to be too heavy on my exposure so I'm going to probably go for contract size of about five so I'm going to risk quite a bid here and I'm going to collect ,500 on this trade I'm going to go for a bid price of 305 now I will be honest with you I could put in 3.1 I can start playing around and waiting but for time purposes I want to be very efficient with this video I want to respect your time I'm just going to go for 305 but if you want to make some extra money you can play around with the bid app ask I could have asked for 310 and I may have actually gotten filled for 310 so that's kind of up to you so so far we've made $1,525 so far by selling a put option on Google.",1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,SXd-v1z5AY8,2024-07-25T16:20:46Z,Options Trading for Beginners FULL FREE COURSE (4 Hours),Nvidia,"if I go to a company like Nvidia it's very high because Nvidia is an AI company that's pricing in a lot of future growth a lot of investors are very bullish on it and you will see right here that the trailing PE ratio is 77 which is pretty insane it's really really insane so to get $10 worth of earnings you are paying $770 so if you put up $770 this company will earn you $10 per year so that is a pretty bad return when you look at it at face value but the thing is you can now see the next metric which is forward PE ratio you can see here how Nvidia goes from 77 to 38 now how does that happen or what does that mean well that means the trailing PE ratio right now is 77 again video is making let's say $10 and it's trading for $770 in all reality it's trading for $899 which means that it's probably having an earnings of $12 13 or $4 or so give or take right now in the 4p ratio means one year from today what will the PE Ratio be based on estimates based on analyst estimates so what's really interesting here is that Nvidia is going from 77 to 38 what's crazy about that and what's really cool is that means that analysts are literally predicting that Nvidia will double earnings so if it doubles earnings then the PE Ratio will be 38 and in the future as these earnings come in investors will say hey this company is growing so quickly I think 38 is a very cheap PE ratio I'm going to buy it and this is actually what drives stock prices up they go up because the expectations of the market are that the stock is going to continue to earn more money and investors are willing to pay more money for the stock price and as they're buying up shares this increases the value of the stock so the stocks value goes up so as you can see the forward PE ratio here is 38 maybe in another year it will be 19 maybe in another year it'll be 9 and A2 maybe in another year it'll be 4.5 4.5 would be a steal so if this price of the stock were to stay the same and this stock kep doubling its earnings then in 1 year 19 in 2 years 9 and a half in 3 years 4.25 who doesn't want to you know put in $425 and get $100 back you're basically having a price earnings ratio of four by the way if you flip the ratio the p is the four if you flip it you get 1/4 earnings over price so you're going to get $1 for every $4 that you put in or a return of 25% now I don't know about you but the banks are not paying 25% bonds aren't paying 25% nothing in the world gives you a guaranteed percentage of 25% per year so technically speaking in just a few years Nvidia if it were to be doubling would be an amazing value at 25% now another year after that it would go from 25% to 50% % per year in returns now what does that mean does that mean that you're going to get 50% returns not necessarily all this means is if Nvidia were to keep doubling the PE Ratio would continue to go down and become so cheap it wouldn't make any sense the only way it would make sense is if the stock price Rises because that makes the P bigger therefore the valuation continues to stay stable maybe it's not going to be 77 maybe it's not going to be 38 but as it keeps doubling in my example it will go to four but let's say investors think it should be 20 PE ratio so the PE Ratio here could go down to 20 and that means that the stock would 5x in the next 4 years in this example if it were to continue doubling now with that being said Nvidia is not going to continue doubling because if you go to the financials it's very unlikely to do so so you can see here how and I said it's unlikely to do so but it is it went from 16 billion in 2021 in 2022 I'm under the financials tab by the way in 2022 went to 6 billion which is almost a double 2023 actually it just made slightly more but in 2024 we had a Skyrocket of more than double so if you take the growth rate here it's not quite doubling but it is going up and it can double but it's unlikely to continue to double all the time as you can also see here Nvidia has beaten earnings over and over and over again that's typically a positive sign of high momentum on the technical and the fundamental aspect this is kind of somewhere both that many earnings beats is a very positive sign for a company so this is a very good thing and as you can see here the annual revenue just continues to Skyrocket and the earnings have actually skyrocketed as well actually the earnings went from 4 billion up to 29 billion so analysts think that the earnings can double again meaning that the price to earnings ratio is going to continue to fall if you want to know what the average price to earnings ratio is it's between 20 to 30 that's what the S&amp;P 500 General stock market index is is give or take roughly so you want to look for a PE ratio around 20 to 30 however if you see a high PE ratio that isn't necessarily mean that it is a Bad Company it just means that the company most likely has high growth and investors are predicting that the stock will go up and that's why it is trading for expensive levels.
NVIDIA seems very expensive and it's going up a lot and and Tesla is going down a lot but the fact of the matter is it actually looks like Tesla is a worse value it actually looks like this stock that's falling is worse and Nvidia is better because in the future envidia is likely to grow more based on analyst estimates whereas Tesla looks like it's going to slow down and because it's slowing down the PEG ratio here is actually worse it's actually a lot more expensive to buy Tesla now they taking a look at the next metric is price to sales price to sales is simply how much is the price of the stock how much revenue do they have and those two numbers are divided so for example you can see that the market cap for Tesla is $580 billion and let's say that their sales is 100 billion so if it's 100 billion you take the market cap of 5.89 divided by 100 billion you get 5.89 here we have a ratio 6.8 which means that Tesla has just probably under about $100 billion do worth of sales per year.
let's say that you bought Nvidia shares 2 or 3 years ago and it was 20% of your portfolio Okay so let's say you had $100,000 you bought $20,000 worth of Nvidia and now after 3 years Nvidia has gone up by 10x so your $20,000 has turned into $2 200,000 and let's say the rest of your portfolio the other $80,000 didn't really go anywhere so now your portfolio is $28,000 $200,000 being Nvidia and $80,000 being other positions so as you can imagine it's not that good in general to have too much of one stock because you're not properly Diversified something that I learned in finance school when I studied Finance basically you want diversification a good Diversified portfolio has 10 to 15 positions that perfect number is around 12 because in Risk Management terms 12 gives you that good variability in your portfolio in terms of like having different stocks giving you that upside but also minimizing risk and as you add more positions Beyond 12 then then your risk does go down but you have something called diminishing returns so diminishing returns basically is this if you're super hungry and I offer you a cheeseburger you are going to be very happy to eat that cheeseburger that first one is going to be let's assign a 10 out of 10 score you're going to have a 10 out of 10 experience CU you're very hungry and let's say you didn't eat for one day now if I offer you a second cheeseburger you are going to probably have nine or 8 out of 10 satisfaction it's still going to taste really good if you're hungry but you're not as hungry now the third cheeseburger if you're full is going to have a very small value it's going to have a three out of 10 and then a fourth one is just going to not really be you know something that you want at all so it might be a 1 out of 10 so the the rate at which you are enjoying the hamburger will go down because you are less hungry and the same thing applies with diversification so if you have one stock you have a lot of risk here and adding a second stock will greatly reduce risk adding a third stock will also greatly reduce risk but to a little bit lesser of a degree okay and so on and so forth at 12 you can think about it as having the two cheeseburgers you're satisfied you're good so let's go back to the example that I used with Nvidia so if in Nvidia we have $200,000 worth of Nvidia because it has grown so much and $80,000 worth of other stocks then what you would want to do is you want to want to basically take some chips off the table you want to take chips off the table because you have quite a bit of exposure into one stock and even if you like that stock as an overall basket of your wealth it's still good to diversify so what you can do is you would sell covered calls.
let's pick Nvidia right now Nvidia is going to be very interesting because obviously the stock has been in a very big bull run let me show you what a stradle would look like.
Nvidia is actually perfect I'll tell you why so I used the Binger band which is a period of 20 days and two standard deviations this is basically the blueprint for what I use to understand where a stock is trading within you can see right now that Nvidia is right in the middle of its bowling or band that means that the stock is neither expensive nor cheap based on statistics the Binger band just uses statistics to understand volatility and price movement all right so right now it is in the middle and you can see the top of the Binger band is 135 guess what when I open up an iron Condor my top end will be 136 and you can see the bottom of the Binger band is 11951 so guess what the bottom of my Binger band or you know this is going to tell me that the bottom end of my iron Condor is going to be 119 so basically right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to pick um these strike prices based on the Bowling band I keep it super super simple this is all you need you don't need any other technical indicators actually you can see right now oh my goodness you guys can actually see right now that I actually have an iron Condor and looks like it's working out very very well so far I'm up $5,610 on the iron Condor and this is actually expiring next couple of days so this has been a pretty interesting strategy that I've been running in my Discord Community because I do focus on small medium and large portfolios I'm coaching a variety of students majority are beginners but I do have some intermediates as well so let's start off with selling a put option I'm going to sell a put option let's just say uh you know pretty short term here if you're watching this in the future again doesn't matter just copy this logic copy and paste it and print money make money by copying exactly what I'm doing right same logic same thought process now I'm going to sell a put option I said that the bottom is going to be around 1119 now that that is actually a 20-day Binger band so I'm actually going to go out a little bit further on this options now let's pick the 119 all right so I'm going to go down pick 19 boom and I'm going to make this a $5 width okay $5 width is what I like to do so I'm going to um you know sell the 119 and then I'm going to buy the 114 all right so this is a put credit spread but now I'm going to open up a call Credit spread cuz I'm going to be selling both sides that's what an iron Condor is now the top of the Binger ban is $ 13595 so I'm going to go for 136 I'm going to sell the 136 now I'm going to go ahead and buy and I'm going to go five up right I'm going to go $5 width 141 so boom now we have a short iron Condor you can see here how my maximum profit is 275 and my maximum loss is 225 so I am making like literally can like double my money in such a short amount of time by running the strategy over and over as long as uh Nvidia stock stays within this range which again based on the bowling or band it is likely to do so then you are going to make money which is fantastic right if the stock goes up a little bit down a little bit you're still going to be in this green profit Zone which is is amazing right it's very very important to stay within here now let's talk a little bit about um the break even points let's talk about risk management and how much you should allocate to the strategy so in terms of Break Even points you will see here that uh if Nvidia stock goes to 13875 then basically you're going to start seeing uh some some losses right on the downside if it's 11625 now why is it different well it's different because you're actually collecting a lot of Premium so you actually even have more room for buffer to make money now in terms of risk management I would say that if it hits one of your legs uh one of your break even prices then an iron Condor is better to close out because you have two options that you're working with um in fact four option legs that you're working with so if it goes into the money I just simply keep it simple I don't roll it I don't do anything crazy I just close out the iron Condor and I move on and I do it on on a different stock.",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,SXd-v1z5AY8,2024-07-25T16:20:46Z,Options Trading for Beginners FULL FREE COURSE (4 Hours),Chipotle,"now if I go to Chipotle this is a stock that I really like however it is very expensive so I do look to trade spreads on it however I can't even really trade spreads on it and I'll show you exactly why again talking about the bid ask spread and this really important tip when you're trading options on market cap size which has to do with fundamental analysis so if I go into let's say I want to sell a put okay if I were to sell a put and this is very similar to selling a put credit spread but let's just go for a put let's go for July so if I were to go to I don't know even something like near the money you can see here how the bid in the ask is so bad look it's 73 and 79 that's a $6 Gap that's $600 so if you were to get filled for this you're probably going to get filled somewhere in the middle and that Middle Point is $300 away from the bid and $300 away from that ask give or take so you're literally losing $300 now granted you are going to collect a good amount of money here you're going to collect $7,000 if you were to make a trade like this but the bid ask is absolutely terrible and the volume here is zero and the open interest is five so this right here would be an example of a really bad option and you know I'll give you some foreshadowing right now for what a spread is but if I were to sell one put and then if I were to buy another put right below this wouldn't even make any sense all right so this is going to have a really really hard time getting filled look at the bid it's negative 380 and ask is 750 so this is so bad in terms of bid ask that you want to be really careful and chipotle is actually a big company but this is an example of when volume is low and when bid ask spreads are very wide that does not make a good stock for trading options.
maybe Chipotle $3,000 okay you buy a long put option strike price okay and you buy a put option for $2,900 so the stock is at $3,000 you buy $2,900 put and uh you pay $100 for the rights basically of buying this put option okay now let's say that the stock does fall below your strike price it falls from to 2850 okay so the stock was at $3,000 you bought a $2,900 put and now the stock falls down to$ 2850 so you're in the money by $50 but here's how the scenario unfolds with the stock price falling down to 2850 and act actuality you are in the money by $50 however because you have paid $100 in premium to get into the option right you bought the option for 100 even though it's in the money by 50 you actually still end up losing because the premium you couldn't compensate for you couldn't make enough money on the downside to compensate for the premium so in this scenario when the stock goes down from 300 to 2850 and your strike price is 2,900 yes you're in the money by 50 but because the premium pay was 100 okay the 100 per share the net profit here would actually be a loss of $50 because you have $50 in profit but you paid $100 in premium per contract since each option contract is 100 shares that means that this would be a net loss of $5,000 so buying put options can actually be really expensive and you can lose quite a lot of money so you want to be very careful to have proper position sizing and risk management in place which I will talk about very shortly in this video actually let's talk about it now.
now Chipotle has had a stock split so this isn't as good of an example but before and I'll show you what I mean by this but before when this stock was really expensive um it was extremely hard to trade for example the bid and ass spread was very wide now check this out this bid and as spread is actually 15 cents off which is $15 off very different from Apple Apple was like $5 off this is 15 that means every time you trade although your brokerage could be free this is still going to be an expense of like over $5 $7 $8 potentially so this is really really bad especially if you're opening up multiple legs now check this out this is going to be completely what you don't want to do all right so let's say I want to sell a put I'll show you exactly why do $5 worth so these are really weird because of the stock split so check this out let me go for uh 62 let's do 62.3 all right I'm going to sell this and then I'm going to buy let's say 62.1 let me show you how whack this is going to be this like look at this you see it doesn't even show you a risk because these options are so illiquid they're so bad like you see 460 and 730 that is so bad in fact it's so bad that Robin Hood is telling you that there's a maximum profit of $50 and no no Max loss but that's incorrect you're just not going to get filled like if I click continue here you'll see that the bid is- 230 and the ask is 330 like literally it is going to be very very difficult for you to get assigned or even like place this trade you're just not going to get filled on the trade that's really really bad so it says 0.5 here and um you know if I were to enter 05 the chances of this actually getting filled are very very slim to none so I mean if I were to put in 0.2 yes maybe maybe maybe this would work point2 but still uh this would be an example of a very bad uh bid ask spread to trade so it's really important to pick the high quality companies and it's really important to pay attention to bit out spread.",1.0,-0.4

me personally I use options fi as a software to track potential earnings beats because an earnings beats will make sure that a company probably Rises and then you can make a lot of money however I will also say that just because I use options F software and I get an idea of if an earnings report will beat or not it's still doesn't guarantee that the stock will move in a certain direction so you have to be careful because a stock can beat earnings and it can still go down for other reasons.",1.0,0.7

even when I was working at Goldman Sachs we did some studies and we saw that many options will actually dip into the money and over 40% of the time I think the statistic might be even higher than that the option will come back out so if it even dips into the money you may not want to close you may think about closing you may decide to yourself that I may be looking to close potentially if continues to go down but that doesn't mean that you want to close just yet it's totally okay for an option to go into the money and for you to hold that position in fact for me I typically hold positions up until expiration even if they do go into the money because I've noticed that I get higher raw returns which means that I get more returns more money by holding until expiration however it is very difficult so this is a mental game this is a very emotional game that you have to be very aware of that if it goes into the money that's okay unless something has fundamentally changed or on the technical chart as you will learn very soon has completely shifted then it's okay to continue holding.
after working for Goldman Sachs looking at lots of research reports what I realized was that selling options is way more profitable than buying options.
I've seen this used at Goldman Sach where clients have really big stock positions you can decide to just sell covered calls at say 70 or 80 Delta which is a very high Delta for part of your position.
when I was working on Wall Street one of the analysts told me stocks just like to go up and the longterm they're always Rising so any 15-year period 99% of the time stocks are going up so it's really kind of a bad idea to buy put options on large stable companies in the long term maybe in the short term you can gamble with that but I would not recommend it.",1.0,0.6

watch list if you want to be a successful investor you don't want to look at whatever is hype you want to look at a specific stock list that you build of stocks that you really like and that you believe in so for example I actually want to take a look at Starbucks because recently if I look at the one month chart you can see that Starbucks went down 177% in the past month they didn't do so well now some people might say oh wow the stock is going down but look nobody actually knows what happened in the past is the past what's going to happen in the future nobody knows not Warren Buffett not a billionaire really nobody but I'll tell you this when a stock goes down by 177% in 1 month that's actually a very good time to potentially use the option buying strategy of buying a call option because let's say that this stock may have a shift in momentum okay what that means is stock is going down down down down and instead of buying shares which could be a little bit scary some people call call this a falling knife okay it's a falling knife the stock is going down you don't want to catch it you might feel that pain you might say oh I I bought it at 73 and now it's at 63 it goes down $10 more you might feel stupid you might feel that this is really risky and in many ways it is but a call option would be very different here a call option you put up just you know a couple hundred as we mentioned and let's say that the stock reverses and it goes back from you know 73 back up to you know let's not get overly optimistic and say it's going to go back up to 88 but let's just say that in the you know not too far future it might go back up to you know maybe 83 84 something like that heck even 80 that's fine as well so here's what you would do you'll go to trade trade options and in fact I'm actually very very interested in purchasing an option like this I think that it's a very good idea especially right after a stock has a lot of disappointment because what happens is when a stock has a lot of disappointment and the whole Market basically sells off that stock a lot of people lose confidence well that price is already really depressed people went from enthusiasm and ecstasy and excitement down to to really depression and not having any hope that's actually a good part a good time to buy a stock or a good time to buy an option because that option is undervalued in many ways okay and in many cases people are not so optimistic and when they become more optimistic about the stock the stocks price you know will go up and the option will also go up in value so again I'm going to look at an expiration now this stock went down a lot really quickly so what I want to do is I don't want to pick a short-term expiration if I were to pick an expiration really shortterm I'm not giving myself enough time for the option to actually make money or the stock to recover so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pick an expiration day that gives me some time so let's go for July 19th so as I'm making this video that's going to give me about you know 2 months all right so again I said that I think this stock can go back up to you know maybe $80 all right maybe $8 per share so what I would do is I would buy call as you can see here I'm at buy call and I can have a few different options okay I can go for an in the money option so I can go for 65 okay you can see here the break even would be $74 I can also go for 70 I can go for 75 I can go for 80 but 80 wouldn't make any sense right cuz we just said that our base case scenario is that we think the stock will go back up to $80 so buying an $80 call doesn't make any sense because if it just goes to 80 we can't make any money it's not going past 80 therefore we're not going to make money since we're not going to be in the money at expiration now a common question is why don't you just keep going lower why don't you just buy something like the $40 call well the truth is you actually can you can buy a $40 call and you can see here the break event is actually pretty good it's at 73 okay now the thing is you do have to put up more money so you can see here that the premium here is $35 which would actually be $3,500 because um each option is worth 100 you know shares so you wouldn't really want to do that you would want to pick a kind of a sweet spot so that sweet spot for me would be about 70 or 75 let's use 75 as an example so if I were to buy the $75 call here which would probably be my number one choice I would go for this this would be a slightly out-of-the money option so if I buy the $75 call and I spend $224 for it that means that if the stock goes up to 80 here I'm going to have a $5 gain okay I'm putting up $224 so I'm basically turning $224 into $5 doubling my money so if I go into this right here I just buy 10 contracts I can put in $2,240 and my maximum gain will actually be $5,000 and I just said maximum gain I meant we will make $5,000 if it goes to 80 our actual maximum gain is going to be unlimited you can see right here the maximum profit is unlimited because if Starbucks goes to 85 90 200 a th000 you keep making money as long as the stock is going up so you don't have a cap on how much money you can make however you do have to understand that there is no way that Starbucks will be $500 per share by you know next couple of months there is absolutely no way that is actually impossible because the stock I'll show you how to actually think about this if you look at Starbucks right now you can see if I scroll down here that there's a different statistics and the market cap is 82 billion there's no way that a stock can basically double its market cap if it's already a big company so this company Starbucks can't go from 82 million billion to 164 billion that's just not going to happen so you do have to be logical with how you're trading options you have to understand where the stock can potentially go and we will talk about that in this course when we go over the tech technical analysis section so let's go over some scenarios so you understand exactly what can happen different scenarios and how they can play out so again we're going to go to the July 19 expiration and if I click the 75 here let's go over what can potentially happen Okay so if the stock is say below 75 let's say that Starbucks actually goes down in value from the current $738 to 71 69 65 whatever all of that is going to be meaning that you're going to lose the $2 24 that you put up you're going to lose it if Starbucks is below 75 you're done you've lost the money okay that's the first scenario if it's below the strike price you will lose money now if it hits 75 you actually still lose money because even at 75 you have paid $224 if it is at 76 you've made a dollar but you've spent $224 so you still lost $124 if it goes to $77 then you have made $2 but you paid $224 so now you lost4 so you see you need the stock to go to $772 to break even and then you are making money from that point on so if the stock goes to 80 you made $5 you paid $224 if it goes to $90 you have made $15 okay and so on and so forth you can use this basic math to understand how much money you make.
let's go through some examples right now A put option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to sell Starbucks at the price that you choose the strike price within a specified period of time this means that if the price of the underlying asset decreases below the strike price the holder can still sell at the higher strike price thereby profiting from the decline in the asset assets value I'm going to give you an example right now so Starbucks stock price $73 and you buy a long put option with a strike price of 70 okay you pay a premium for the put option let's just say you pay $1 hypothetical example as Starbucks Falls to $65 per share here's what it's going to look like with the stock price dropping below the put option strike price of 70 the put option becomes in the money so for a put option it's in the money when the stock drops below the strike you know for a call option it's in the money when it goes above the strike so for a put option you want it to go down when it goes down you are making money so this means that the holder of a put option now has the right to sell Starbucks shares at the higher strike price of 70 so if Starbucks comes Crashing Down You're perfectly fine with that because you get to sell it at 70 no matter what because you own that put option even though the market price declines and it goes down to 65 that's perfectly okay so the put option holds can buy shares at the market price of 65 and then he can sell at a higher price of 70 realizing a profit of $5 since each option contract typically you know in all cases represents 100 shares the total profit would actually be $500 the $5 time 100 shares so deducting the premium paid for the option which we said was $1 or $100 that means we have $500 of profit minus the $100 that we paid which gives us $400 of profit that's the first example and the first scenario I have two more for you about how a put option works if you're buying them by the way before I get into the second and the third example I want to say this is a really good time for you to subscribe I would really appreciate it plus it will really help you out because I have a lot of videos that are coming out on a frequent basis teaching you how to make money option trading that's all I really ask.
I'm going to show you an example of how I would run a buy put on Starbucks okay so I'm going to go to trade options and what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to pick a put option for the future so let's say that I'm going to just go out for something like July 19th let's say that I think Starbucks is going to fall further for whatever reason let's say that I think that people are going to drink less coffee I think that the balance sheet isn't looking good they have a lot of debt whatever the case is you want to find a stock that you are bearing SE it's also really good to find stocks that have bearish momentum on the downside so talking about technical analysis which you know we'll get into a little bit later.
I want to look at something like potentially like a Starbucks Starbucks did pull back quite a lot here so this could be a good trade to make I want to see what other stocks I may have here that I am very bullish on in the longer term because right now I gave you a very short-term trade I want to go for a very longterm trade.",1.0,0.0
Invest with Henry,SXd-v1z5AY8,2024-07-25T16:20:46Z,Options Trading for Beginners FULL FREE COURSE (4 Hours),PayPal,"So now I do want to make another trade I think that I would love to make a PayPal trade I think that the stock is going for a really good valuation however I will say that I currently do already have a decent size position of 99.69% and for that reason selling puts would not be smart because then I wouldn't have proper risk management I would be way too invested in one stock which would be very dangerous so instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to look for other stocks.
if I pull out PayPal PayPal was a $300 stock it has pulled back tremendously and that is the reason why I bought the stock so if I go to the Chart right now you can see here that in the past 5 years the this is a very interesting chart the stock went up all the way to $38 if we take a look this happened in 2021 and then since then the stock has absolutely gotten decimated and has crashed down to just $66 now taking a look at the past 6 months the stock has really not done a whole lot which is really interesting that means the stock was trading at very high levels has pulled down tremendously now it's going sideways which means that this is a very interesting stock for a selling strategy such as a covered call a sell put specifically would work very well here because it's very unlikely that PayPal is going to fall lower for example if you look at the Binger band The Binger band low is 61 um the Binger band high is 68 so this stock is trading in a very specific range so this sideways action is actually very good for covered calls selling puts it's also very good for an iron Condor strategy which we will talk about once we go over spreads so this is very interesting from the perspective of technical analysis because you can understand where the stock was trading at and where it was trading at right now.
first of all the market cap here is 68 bill billion dollar that is a pretty big company which is good for option trading I don't recommend people trade options on companies that have lower than a two billion valuation typically those options are very IL liquid meaning that there's not a lot of volume and when there's low volume that means that the bid in the ask spread I can go over an example of this real quickly the bid in the ask spread is going to be very wide okay here's what I mean by that a bid and ask is exactly what you're paying for or you're collecting in terms of when you're buying or selling options so for example if I go to trade PayPal options and I go to buy a call and let's say that I just buy a 70 call here you can see that the bid is 5 cents and the ask is 6 cents that's amazing that's very good that means they're very very close and when you're trading you don't really experience any slippage no costs you're getting a good fill rate you're going to get filled on this right and the volume is very high.
the PE ratio for PayPal right now is 16 that just means that when you take price of you know $66 and you divided by the earnings okay you get a ratio of 16.",1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,yZRYS590Di0,2024-07-24T23:25:52Z,Palantir Wheel Income Strategy,Palantir,"what's going on guys in this video I'm going to be talking about paler and selling options for consistent income I'm going to give you some alerts and I'm also going to give you a strategy I'm actually going to cover different trades that you should be making if you like paler if you're neutral on paler and I don't think we have any paler bears but so we'll focus on neutral and bullish strategies on paler with options right now let's jump into my portfolio right here you will see that Palance here is going towards $30 per share guys been right on the stock for a very long time I've made a boat load of money I don't have many picks but when I do have a pick it hits all right so it's all about hitting and hitting hard I currently have 5,000 shares of paler as you can see on my screen and I have a $34,000 gain on paler and it makes up about 5% of my portfolio with an average cost of $21.67 by the way if you're wondering why do I keep filming videos in hotels it's because the wheel strategy and selling options on paler and other stocks in my portfolio gives me enough income to travel so I want to let you know that you can do it regardless of where you are in your Journey right now selling options works it creates income and with that income you have more freedom and life is about Freedom that's why you keep seeing me film in different places because I'm traveling I've been to every country in Europe as well as many other countries so look take advantage of selling options and make money on paler it doesn't matter how small you start start somewhere and start running the wheel strategy selling puts and covered calls let me show you how I would do it step by step right now all right so here's the first thing paler is up like 29% in the past 3 months that is 29% let me just tell you I'm an option Trader there's channels about options I'm the number one option channel to watch but to be honest you don't always need options you can just buy the stock and hold it but you know that's a little bit boring what you can also do on a bullish stock like paler you can also run bull call spreads all right so that's the only buying strategy that I'm going to cover because the title of this video is selling options Etc right selling options creates income however you still want to have a little bit of buying options at your disposal basically for me I think I would go like 90% selling 10% buying when I say buying I mean Poor Man's covered call which I covered on this channel bull call spreads and then you know maybe just holding long stock something like that okay so here's what you can do I'm going to cover bull call spread sellp put covered call the wheel and how to just generate income listen if you have any fear around this stuff I'm going to calm me down and get your fear out of the way because being fearful procrastinating that's not going to help you make money okay I get it this stuff could be a little bit scary or whatever I'm going to show you why this is actually way safer than literally anything else out there with my 9010 split okay I think paler will reach $30 per share in the near future I'm saying this I'm not going to waste your time but you've seen my videos I think the Management's good I think their financials are good I think the trend is good I think that they're working very well with AI I think the government contracts are fantastic there's just a lot to like about pal here not to mention the CEO Alex carp went to my high school I went to a good high school have a good education finished College all that stuff even though I don't know if I really use my degree I think paler is going to reach about $30 in the next 30 to 60 days right I really don't know because well I can't predict the future all I can do is put myself in a good position to make money I make money by selling options selling options works because options are overpriced I've said that many times on this channel I don't think paler is going to go down I am going to sell a put option at 26 why 26 why not 27 why not 25 because 26 feels right yes I said feels right why I'm going to look at the Delta it's 0.25 that's perfectly a good Delta all right anything below 50 is already profitable why any out of the money option has lower than 50% chance of expiring in the money AKA anything under 50 Delta will be more than a 50% chance of winning and if you're more than 50% chance of winning that's a good thing what's the worst that can happen when you sell a put option then you are saying I'm ready to buy Palante here I'm ready to purchase Palante here that's what selling a put option means okay people get confused and they think that a put option means the stock will go down yes buying a put option is betting a stock will go down selling a put option means that someone else is betting that the stock will go down and you are betting that the stock won't go down if it does you will buy 100 shares now there is nothing wrong with buying 100 shares if Palante is at 28.50 and you have to buy 100 shares at $26 can you tell me what's bad about that you have a house you have a neighborhood of houses which are all 100 Grand okay they're all 100 Grand and now I'm telling you I want you to buy that house which is identical to all the other houses in the neighborhood for 90 grand dude it's 9 it's 10 grand off it's 10% off same thing with pal here this sellp put option okay is 10% out of the money AKA you have a 10% discount 30 days 10% off but wait let me sound like an infomercial okay but wait it gets better here's more buy this but wait you get paid $88 you paid $88 all right guys I'm not even joking with you this is the only strategy that you need you don't need to watch any more videos on any other topic when it comes to investing you simply sell puts and I'll talk about selling covered calls I'll talk about the wheel and I'll talk about bull call spread promise this video will be all you need all right so although I'm giving you a longer explanation you might be like hry is rambling on for a long time I'm just trying to paint you the full picture so you understand the psychology and the thought process Because by the way in my coaching what I typically do is I explain things in a very weird way why when I'm being weird and I when I say something in a very weird way it's more memorable people don't forget and when you don't forget it's better you get more results so look you sell a put option 26 you get paid $88 don't worry about the max loss this Max loss says if the stock goes down to zero I may lose $2,500 is it going down to zero probably not is Starbucks going down to zero probably not is McDonald's probably not is paler probably not and when I say probably not I mean 99.99999% definitely not so long story short you don't have to worry about the maximum loss all you have to think about is I'm getting paid $88 to potentially purchase paler at $26 per share and in your mind you should think wow this is a good price all right if you don't like palen here or if you don't like the price go lower that's the whole point of what I tell students in my boot camp we focus on risk management we focus on asset allocation we focus on margin we focus on option Basics we focus on everything from the very very fundamentals of someone who's like I don't know what the heck I'm doing that's why focus on on by the way if you guys think that I focus on only millionaires that is not true because there's very few millionaires by definition in the world and the millionaires out there that already have lots of money they don't need me they're already millionaires so I'm trying to help the average person basically this channel is made for myself when I was 10 years ago when I first started trading when I didn't know what I was doing I had no idea I had this Indian guy friend who I was studying with he pulled up his account he had half a m won't mention his name for security purposes right he had half a m and I was like l story short this this is what happened I myself okay I was like damn that's a lot of money I'm like that is a lot of money I'm like this guy's Rich right I want to be like that guy I want money why because I grew up poor and it sucks and not having things that you want sucks but money does not equate to happiness I have tons of money and doesn't really matter okay you just need enough money I didn't know that at the time but I was like my number one goal in life from 19 to 25 was to become a millionaire and then I think it happened at around 25 26ish that that was my only goal I sacrificed happiness I sacrificed friends I sacrificed relationships I sacrificed fun guys I don't drink I don't smoke someone on my videos like Henry looks tired well sometimes I'm tired but I definitely I don't drink I don't smoke I don't do drugs my whole goal in life from 18 to 25 was to get rich right got rich now my whole goal in life is to have fun be healthy teach others that's literally all I do those three things I try to hit the gym try to have a good time in life and then try to teach you guys because I have a lot of free time and I want to help others that is my purpose that's my mission all right keep it simple $26 puts to get rich not $26 puts but you get what I'm saying go out of the money 20 to 30 delta pick a high quality company pal here and then the Market opens up in an hour it's like 8:22 a.m. so I can't I can't execute this otherwise I would now when you get put the stock okay you got put what do you do next next this is the simple strategy you sell puts to get in all right you know there's this video that that went very viral it's like um uh the woman she says looking for a man in finance trust fund hedge fund blue eyes 65 right I messed that up a little bit but this is this is this is my version of that song okay she said I'm looking for a man in finance trust fun 65 blue eyes all right this is my plan sell puts to get in sell covered calls to get out sell puts to get in run the wheel strategy sell cover calls to get out that's it you don't need anything else almost nothing else all right I'm trying to simplify this as much as possible because I just want you to I hope you're enjoying this video and I also hope that you just remember this in a funny way because this is literally like 90% of the equation by the way when I was working at a hedge fund we I had we had a multiactor model that was looking at different factors on how to invest and how to buy a stock how to properly get in how to get out how to make money right had 48 factors one of the factors and I can talk about this in another video comment if you want to know the factor I can go over that factor but there was one factor that explained it was like 91% of the returns of the hedge fund 48 factors but one was 91% worth of all the returns so the 47 didn't even practically matter just one mattered the most all right what matters here you pick a low Delta 20 to 30 when you're selling puts pick a high quality company the expiration date is 30 days out once you get assigned you switch over to covered calls so you go to sell call and now you switch over to selling covered call options so you would sell for example let's say the P here went down you had shares you can sell a 30 covered call so look you got you got paid $88 to get in you bought it for 26 and then you sell above your average cost to get out and you get paid so it's $172 right here you get paid which is a little bit higher on the on the call side and that's I guess it's because the Market's a little bit bullish on pounds here but it's also because 30 is a little bit closer to the current price versus 26 so not that important again 25 Delta perfectly fine to sell puts 25 Delta perfectly fine to sell covered calls let's talk about bull call spreads okay by the way the process of selling a put getting assigned you want to get assigned you don't not you're not upset to get a sign guys you're not upset I have videos on rolling so if you're getting a sign you're like I don't know if I want this stock you change your mind have a video on rolling invest with Henry rolling okay if you have any questions comment down below I reading all your questions this would love to see your questions okay rolling is fine but beyond the scope of this video I'm trying to keep it super simple all right you do not need to roll you're happy getting a signed that's the wheel you're happy to get uh ass signed on the put you're happy to get a signed on the cover to call there's a little bit issues on the covered call stuff because I personally like to roll up more because I don't want to pay taxes but I'm in a high tax bracket again there's other topics I talk about I don't mean to sound like a broken record but I have a community for a reason because there's topics I don't cover on this YouTube channel on the boot camp there's topics that I don't cover because it's very personalized it's like coaching one-on-one six weeks I go over every single trade I go over strategies go over everything if you want to learn more first l in the description I teach you how to do yourself okay I also show you through my trades and signals typical stuff nothing nothing nothing crazy all right sell covered call 25 30 Delta cool you got that all right cool now what can you do with 10% of your money to grow it fast to grow it faster to get bigger results this is what I did on Tesla this is how I went from 100K to 700k in one year on Tesla Tesla Tesla Tesla all right so here we go I'm going to show you a bull call spread on Tesla because I think this strategy specifically is very interesting I have a 230 puts looks like I'm going to get assigned for this week looks like Tesla's down a whole bunch not surprised and luckily I don't have a huge huge position in Tesla I have a few shares and then this so anyways looks like it's down a whole lot but look I don't really care why I'm running the wheel shot ofy before I show you the bull call spread do I look stressed to you well I don't know 230 put I'm going to get assigned do I look upset no I'm not upset it's fine I'm going to be buying Tesla for 230 uh per share by the way I did get paid for that I got paid I got paid the $1,975 I got paid $395 per share so technically I'm I'm down very very little long story short once I get a signed I'm going to sell covered calls exactly what I've been talking about for the past 19 minutes or so now now now no now now let's go bull call spread Tesla is down at 225 let's say hypothetically we think that it's going to be down in the next 30 days it'll be at 230 230 okay not even that much higher right that's like 2% higher here's what you do you pick a 30-day option why 30 days because 30 days is really simple simple I love simple and it's because just simple is better it's all about scale you know I took some notes Here what I wanted to tell you guys was start small scale up if you have a medium portfolio scale up if you have a large portfolio scale up it's all about scaling up and finances there's no rocket science here take the emotions out of the game guys take the emotions out of the game we're not in traffic we're not in a fight we're not uh we're not arguing with our spouses we're not in in a in a honeymoon in in in whatever in in Monaco or I don't freaking know I'm stuttering like Biden stutters but you know you see what I'm saying keep it simple and scale up use pain as a motivator guys use pain if you're not where you want to be get to where you want to be don't be mad at me don't be mad at CNBC don't be mad at the who's in the office right now the our the the president who can't can't freaking speak don't be mad at politics don't don't look at yourself in the mirror and take action take the pain that you feel can you not afford your kids a college good make some more money can you not go to a fancy restaurant every day good go make some more money invest wisely use the strategies I'm teaching you and invest wisely to grow your account where going out to dinner doesn't matter are you living in United States which is a majority of you guys I do not live in the United States why because there are better countries out there in many different aspects there's no one perfect country but you should be traveling you should have the freedom to do what you want if you don't you are not rich enough or you are not free enough okay so use the pain I only have a few notes Here use pain use fear keep it simple and scale your portfolio using the wheel strategy and last but not least let me wrap up the video bull call spreads all right you buy a 225 call and then you sell a 230 call why because I said we think it's going to go to 230 all right do what you think for example if Tesla is going to 235 sell a 235 call you are selling the option that you think is the peak of the stock all right you don't think the stock is going to go higher how do you determine that by the way you use um Binger band so let me show you the Binger band real fast all the stuff that I do in my live coaching Monday and Wednesday I do the bowling or band analysis I'm keep it very very simple I'm not going to go into too much detail Tesla right now is not a good bowling band analysis because the bowling band has expanded because volatility has expanded so this is not going to be the best stock right now to do this type of analysis this would need more fundamental analysis again that would be too long for this video all right let's just say 230 you would buy 225 you would sell a 230 and um here the total cost is actually pretty high this is not it's not that good figure out why it's so high okay the bid ass spread here is very bad so t so this is what I did by the way in 2021 to go from 100K to 700k however Tesla right now does not have good options unfortunately what I'm looking at right here is very bad because the bid is 29 the ask is 3150 granted the market is not open yet so it could tighten up a lot but this is actually not a good option because uh 14 volume is very low so this tells me this would actually not be a good option to pick I'm going to go for September 20 the third Friday of every month is actually the traditional expiration so let me see if the 225 here is better it's a little bit tighter right now you can see the volume is higher at six uh well the volume is 64 which is not that high open interest is a little bit higher though at 3685 bid ask here is better so let me just exit out of this bull call spread that won't be a good bull call spread let me buy the 225 now and then sell the 230 this is better so the total cost is now going to be 340 which is decent decent decent again you can't even see here Robin Hood saying the max loss is 285 because the bid ass spread is kind of uncertain at this moment especially because the market hasn't opened up if I click continue you can see that the bid is 230 Das is 340 so actually does looks like the midpoint is 285 so if I were to buy this it would be about 285 and if Tesla ends at 230 then my 285 would turn into 500 so I basically double my money in 58 days AKA bull call spreads are very bit higher on the risk for sure and very high in the return you can double up your money every 30 to 60 days if you're right on the stock okay you can go even more by the way I can buy the 225 and I I just like gaps of $5 they're easy but I can go from 225 to 235 and now you can see that uh it's 570 so I I won't quite double my money here but I can go from 225 to let's go to 250 250 all right so now I can invest again I'm going to get roughly a double of my money here at most so now I can invest 1300 and to make 2,500 so but the higher up you go the lower premium you collect cuz this option you're selling but you get more upside so here like you can clearly see I'm getting a lot more upside I can go from uh the 225 to 275 so I can make like you know quite a lot a lot more you can see the max gain here is going to be 2,800 I'm only investing 2100 so you can more than double your money more than double your money but I would pick a balance point it's I usually use technical analysis for that so without making this video too long do 10% of your money on bull call spreads SL Poor Man's covered calls so just typ invest with Henry Poor Man's covered call I would have 10% of my money in buying strategies 90% of my money in selling options all right so 90% selling options 10% buying strategies high quality companies have 10 to 15 stocks don't just use paler don't just use Tesla have high quality companies mix it up use the different strategies and grow and scale your portfolio so you have freedom to do as you wish thank you so much for watching hope that you guys enjoyed this

scale your portfolio using the wheel strategy and last but not least let me wrap up the video bull call spreads all right you buy a 225 call and then you sell a 230 call why because I said we think it's going to go to 230 all right do what you think for example if Tesla is going to 235 sell a 235 call you are selling the option that you think is the peak of the stock all right you don't think the stock is going to go higher how do you determine that by the way you use um Binger band so let me show you the Binger band real fast all the stuff that I do in my live coaching Monday and Wednesday I do the bowling or band analysis I'm keep it very very simple I'm not going to go into too much detail Tesla right now is not a good bowling band analysis because the bowling band has expanded because volatility has expanded so this is not going to be the best stock right now to do this type of analysis this would need more fundamental analysis again that would be too long for this video all right let's just say 230 you would buy 225 you would sell a 230 and um here the total cost is actually pretty high this is not it's not that good figure out why it's so high okay the bid ass spread here is very bad so t so this is what I did by the way in 2021 to go from 100K to 700k however Tesla right now does not have good options unfortunately what I'm looking at right here is very bad because the bid is 29 the ask is 3150 granted the market is not open yet so it could tighten up a lot but this is actually not a good option because uh 14 volume is very low so this tells me this would actually not be a good option to pick I'm going to go for September 20 the third Friday of every month is actually the traditional expiration so let me see if the 225 here is better it's a little bit tighter right now you can see the volume is higher at six uh well the volume is 64 which is not that high open interest is a little bit higher though at 3685 bid ask here is better so let me just exit out of this bull call spread that won't be a good bull call spread let me buy the 225 now and then sell the 230 this is better so the total cost is now going to be 340 which is decent decent decent again you can't even see here Robin Hood saying the max loss is 285 because the bid ass spread is kind of uncertain at this moment especially because the market hasn't opened up if I click continue you can see that the bid is 230 Das is 340 so actually does looks like the midpoint is 285 so if I were to buy this it would be about 285 and if Tesla ends at 230 then my 285 would turn into 500 so I basically double my money in 58 days AKA bull call spreads are very bit higher on the risk for sure and very high in the return you can double up your money every 30 to 60 days if you're right on the stock okay you can go even more by the way I can buy the 225 and I I just like gaps of $5 they're easy but I can go from 225 to 235 and now you can see that uh it's 570 so I I won't quite double my money here but I can go from 225 to let's go to 250 250 all right so now I can invest again I'm going to get roughly a double of my money here at most so now I can invest 1300 and to make 2,500 so but the higher up you go the lower premium you collect cuz this option you're selling but you get more upside so here like you can clearly see I'm getting a lot more upside I can go from uh the 225 to 275 so I can make like you know quite a lot a lot more you can see the max gain here is going to be 2,800 I'm only investing 2100 so you can more than double your money more than double your money but I would pick a balance point it's I usually use technical analysis for that so without making this video too long do 10% of your money on bull call spreads SL Poor Man's covered calls so just typ invest with Henry Poor Man's covered call I would have 10% of my money in buying strategies 90% of my money in selling options all right so 90% selling options 10% buying strategies high quality companies have 10 to 15 stocks don't just use paler don't just use Tesla have high quality companies mix it up use the different strategies and grow and scale your portfolio so you have

Invest with Henry,dXkKSdkIO-E,2024-07-23T21:27:56Z,Generate Weekly Income with this Options Strategy - How to Sell Put Options Beginners,SPY,"I specifically want to show you how to sell put options on spy Spy is a position that I have in my portfolio in fact I have a very large position on spy if I click into spy right now I'm going to show you that I have over a million $100,000 in spy right now and the reason why I like spy so so much is because the options are amazing now in this video what I want to show you is even if you have a small account let's say it's just a couple thousand you can still sell put options on spy I'm going to show you a loophole with this loophole you can basically sell puts on spy without needing to have all the collateral or Capital to actually dump into spy so let me just show you an example so if I go to trade spy options I'm going to show you this loophole so essentially the thing that I mentioned that I like about spy is the liquid options now you may be like what are liquid options so let me back up for a second let me tell you what liquid options are let me tell you what expiration points I like for spy and then also I need you to understand how to close this position it's really important because so many people enter into positions and they don't end up closing the position properly that's probably the number one mistake that so many beginner options Traders are doing they're either entering positions with no plan to exit or they're just exiting with you know not enough profits so that's what I'm going to change for you in this video so make sure that you do stick to the very end um but if you look at the options right here so let's go to sell put options so I like selling put options a lot because they bring in premium and also because I'm kind of bullish on spy especially because the market has been crashing I want to sell puts I want to be out out there making money on fear and there is a lot of fear in the market right now and the higher the fear goes well the more expensive these premiums become so the better selling put options becomes selling put options is a very basic strategy where you're just selling one put and you're collecting money for selling the option the worst thing that can happen is a stock can fall down and then essentially you're forced to buy 100 shares but but again that's not so bad if you're bullish on the stock and the second thing is if you sell an out-of-the money option you really make your chances small for the stock to fall down to that strike price and again spy is an expensive stock it's $374 so let me show you an example let's say that the expiration date for October 7th which would be tomorrow we're going to sell a put option for let's go to chance of profit I like to look at my chance of profit and and 88% so this is good if I expand this option right now the Delta is2 so very small Delta this2 Delta means there's only a 12% chance of this option expiring in the money so let's go ahead and sell the 367 put option on spy and you're going to see the first problem that I come into and the problem that I'm going to solve for you in this video so if I sell this it's going to be $59 now that is cool $59 is great however the problem is that I would need to have 100 shares of this stock and that means that I would need to have $ 36,6 41 at my disposal and this is a lot of money obviously most people don't just have 36 Grand sitting in their portfolio but don't don't worry because I'm going to be solving this problem and also just so you know you don't need a lot of money to grow a small portfolio it's not like I started with a lot of money I started with just $2,000 and it did take me a lot of time to grow but that's why I'm here on YouTube I'm here to share my knowledge to make sure that you can do a similar path to me but hopefully a little bit shorter and a little bit less painful so how do I solve this problem of needing $336,600 when selling a put option all right so we're going to do this example on October 7th and let me just expand this option expiration dates just to take a look I want to see if there's any better expiration dates now what I do want to point out for you um is that spy actually has expiration days on Monday Wednesday and Friday so actually this is Friday this is Monday Wednesday Friday Monday Wednesday Friday this is really unusual and it's actually why spy is so popular it's such a big ETF that so many people have in their portfolio and the options are just purely a dream they are so nice because of multiple factors not only do they expire three times a week so you can basically sell options or buy options on a very short amount of time you can do it for the next day or you can do same day options which by the way I also want to show you in this video but the options are so abundant and they're expiring very often now one thing that you will notice when I expand this option is aside from the Delta which okay that's cool is the volume okay the volume is massive 21,000 volume for spy that's what I mean when I said liquid in the beginning of the video liquid means that there's a lot going on imagine this imagine if you're trying to sell a car and you have a Rolls-Royce or a Lamborghini Huracan 2010 okay it is not as easy to sell a luxury vehicle than it is to just sell a simple Toyota Corolla there's a lot of people in the market for Toyota Corollas and a lot of people have 8 to 10 grand to spend on a used Toyota Corolla so you can easily sell a used Toyota Corolla in probably like a couple days especially if you set the right price if you're just $500 below the market someone's going to call you up and say I want that Toyota Corolla but for a Lamborghini Huracan it might take 3 weeks 3 months it's really difficult to find a buyer and even if you lower the price by $5,000 it's still a luxury Niche vehicle and not everyone's going to be able to afford it obviously only a few select people maybe like the 1centers can afford that type of car so you're going to have a hard time selling it even if it is for a discount that's basically the same thing with options for spy it's like a Toyota Corolla there's always like a buyer there's always a seller there's always so many people looking to buy and sell the stock and the options are just really liquid because everyone's also looking at the options and they're also trying to buy and sell the options so that's why the bid in the ask spread if you see right here it's 0.59 and then the ask is 61 that's amazing CU it's so tight as a beginner you really need tight bit ask spreads it's going to help you lose less money which basically means that you're going to make more money in the long term while trading options now I can show you this option that expires on Friday however when this video comes out I want you to have some time to actually potentially make this trade so instead I'm going to go out until Wednesday super cool and unique cuz I've never showed a Wednesday option on this YouTube channel but let's go until Wednesday so basically that gives us a few trading days and gives us the weekend as well so I'm going to go down to a reasonable strike price and for me that's going to be analyzing the option chain so again I want to look for an option around an 88 chance of profit because that 88 chance of profit also means that the Deltas are around2 and that's because the chance of profit is inverse to the Delta meaning that a 10 Delta means 90% chance of profit a 5 Delta means a 95 chance of profit so I already know that and I know how Robin Hood platform works and I also know that I like a sweet spot of around 10 to 14 Delta so 12 Delta is fine and the volume here is 2,400 so not as much let's go up a little bit 3,812 volume that's really good let's go up one more and it's also 2,000 volume 15 Delta that's a little aggressive so I like the 362 the volume is pretty good the Delta is pretty good and the bid ask spread is amazing it's exactly a dollar so let's go ahead and sell this option right now I'm going to sell this for a dollar it says $99 but it's going to be a dollar because the midpoint of 99 and A1 and one is going to be a dollar so yeah the midpoint is $1 so I'm going to sell this for a dollar and again we have a problem of 36 Grand so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to try to to get rid of this Max loss and the way that I'm going to do it is I'm going to buy a put option that is way below so I'm going to tell you the risks about this trade as well but first of all let's go buy a put option okay so we're currently at 362 now obviously I can just buy the 361 however this only gives us a total credit of $10 that is not that unique this is basically a put credit spread but that's only $10 that's not that good compared to the $99 or the $100 that we wanted to collect originally so instead of going down one leg I'm going to go down a bit further so I can actually go all the way down to 352 now going down to 352 you can see here that the Delta is 04 the volume is 2800 and the bid and ask is still very very tight in fact it's even tighter it's only $1 apart so that is great now if if we will notice Things become really interesting so basically I can sell the 362 put Robin Hood is fine with that and any broker is fine with that however if you don't have the collateral you won't be able to actually fill this trade but now that I am buying the 352 I'm basically creating a floor for myself if the stock were to drop it cannot drop below 352 well if it does it's not a problem because now my buy put is going to protect my 362 cellp put now I can pay $31 that's not that much money compared to 100 and I can take home a total credit of $69 so it says right here my Max profit is roughly $70 but my Max loss is $ 930 that is true you can lose up to $930 and you're making $70 however this is basically the same thing as selling a put option on sp1 you still have a very similar risk profile you're still collecting a really good sum of money and now you don't need $336,000 you need less than $1,000 to enter into this position now the risk to this position and how to close this position two really important things you need to know first of all the risk of this position there's a few different risks the first risk is if the stock ends up falling you can get into this Red Zone if you get into this red zone then you're going to end up losing some money and then you're going to have to close the position now before I tell you exactly how to close the position the number one risk of this position would be someone that would open up too much of it if you open up too much of this position right here on Spy it would most likely work out well but the one time it doesn't work out well you could end up losing a lot of money in fact a very significant amount of money however that may only happen if I expand this 3 52 about 4% of the time so if you were to do this 100 times literally 96 times you're going to end up making $70 for less than $11,000 worth of risk and that $70 is going to represent an over 7% return in just a few days so obviously if you were to do this in theory 96 times in a row you would have like a th000 or 5,000% gain so you'd be able to scale your portfolio from like $11,000 to basically $7,000 something crazy like that right you'd be able to 7x your portfolio in 5 days around a 100 times so that would be in like a year and a half so you could take a portfolio of ,000 to $7,000 or $110,000 into $70,000 but there is a caveat four times out of 100 you're going to have an issue this position would go into this red area so four times out of 100 you're going to have to close the position this is very important depending on how well you close is really going to depend on what type of return that you have now you can have a 7,000 per return right from 10K into 70 or if you don't close properly then you can turn $10,000 into $122,000 so really big difference very huge difference from 10 to 12 and then 10 to 70 grand and I'm not going to lie I'm not per myself I don't know the exact perfect time to close but there are rules that I follow that are very useful for me and the first rule that I personally follow is when I'm doing this type of position for example the share price for spy is $374 that is the current share price what I personally do is if the stock goes down to say $363 per share okay right outside of my strike zone I put a warning on this position I watch it very closely like a hawk and I tell myself okay it is in a dangerous point it's very close to being in the money and as soon as this position basically looks like the momentum isn't so good if I don't see the chart going back up or there being a really good support level at 363 as soon as it goes down to 362 I will jump ship and I will close this position I will close this position for either a gain or a loss and it depends if this position gets really close to October 12th let's say it is actually October 12th and this position reaches 362 well actually that's not that big of a problem because it's the last day and because Theta is so high let me expand this option and show you Theta is basically time Decay and because this is so huge I will keep watching this position like a hawk and not really close it until very end of the day on the expiration date which here would be Wednesday so on Wednesday I'm going to keep waiting as long as this is at 362 actually don't need to close it because it's on the last day I'm only going to close it if the option goes to like 361 or 360 and then the option turns negative as soon as it turns negative I'm going to be looking to cut my loss at a 10% loss what that means is for example if this position has made me $70 as soon this down like $7 which is really close right I'm going to just cut the position all right and I'll end up having like a 7 or $10 loss a very very small loss I will end up closing the position however let's say the stock goes down to 362 before October 12 like really really soon that's really rare that might happen even less than four out of 100 times maybe it only happen one out of 100 times or one out of 300 times still I will look to close the position in a very similar way I will end up closing at around $362 per share if it goes into the negative and close at around a 10% loss now sometimes when I have a lot of belief in the stock I won't close for a 10% loss I will close for around a 25% loss and in some extreme scenarios like Tesla where I really want to hold in until the last day I will decide not to close it early and instead to hold the option until the last day of expiration and then then close on the last day of expiration so that's exactly how I would treat and close a position like this one right here this is exactly how you can go around selling put options with a small portfolio and actually still scale a small portfolio",1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,MnDxRlWOwss,2024-07-17T21:14:08Z,Urgent: AVGO Stock,Broadcom (AVGO),"broadcom hitting a new record intraday hide today following strong earnings also a 10 for one stock split hey maybe it could even push out Tesla and the mag 7 you should be putting yet more money into a broadcom into an Nvidia into some other AI play this hyper growth phase in the 7s will probably go on for years broadcom is pretty much giving investors what they wanted all you need to know is that Nancy Pelosi bought a ton of broadcom stock last week she's long on avgo and she purchased over 20 call options that are expiring in June of 2025 but that's not why I'm buying the stock although All Eyes seem to be focused on anything and everything having to do with artificial intelligence and one of wall Street's hottest Trends right now which I am investing in I'm betting avgo post stock split amongst other reasons will continue to rise or at least have very strong bullish momentum in the next 6 to 12 months you see I was sticking to Nvidia stock but avgo really caught my attention I did a lot of digging into research reports and I want to explain what this company does why it's important and how I'm playing evgo stock I'm going to be looking at the technical analysis as well momentarily so let's look at the chart right now and I'll show you what's been going on with this stock so this stock had a stock split that's why the chart looks kind of ridiculous right now but now the stock is at $169 per share which makes it a lot more affordable for investors to basically buy up the stock it also means that the stocks 10 to one split May the options split 10 to one as well now if you look at the last 6 months before the stock split you can basically see that the stock had really good strong momentum the stock was you know around $1,200 per share and then it Peak that $1,800 per share before kind of pulling back to around the $1,700 level broadcom stock has risen about 20% since announcing its stock split on June 12 2024 it still has some room to run to reach the historical average gain Bank of America research suggests even before broadcom announced its first ever stock split billionaire money managers were pulling in Based on data provided by Form through TF filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission six prominent billionaire investors opened a new position in broadcom or added to their existing stake in the first quarter so a lot of big names are buying this stock I'm going to go to the statistics tab right here this is a pretty big company like really really big I mean it's almost a trillion dollars in market cap the PE Ratio is very high however check this out the Ford PE ratio is a lot lower the Ford PE ratio actually makes sense price of sales is also pretty high like I'm not going to lie this stock is a kind of aggressive growth stock at the moment I mean it's priced in for Perfection but at the same time there is just so many reasons to buy it I would say this is a stock that can compete with Nvidia for the next 12 months of returns I think the stock can have really high growth r rates poly year-over-year growth to 16% now it's not going to beat Nvidia on growth but it's going to potentially beat Nvidia because profit margins will rise significantly the earnings growth can be really huge like you can see here year-over-year the earnings growth is 172% they do have decent amount of cash per share but they also have a lot of debt now I want to show you what avjo options are like because I think once the stock split is finalized that the options are going to be very attractive especially given that there is some selling pressure right now it's going to be a very interesting time to buy some bull call spreads I mean do your own technical analysis don't even have to use avjo this is just a new stock that I want to cover in this channel to mix up the content for avjo I think the stock makes a lot of sense basically there's so much traffic going through AI right now there's a lot of people gaining interest in Ai and AI generally is growing a lot and avgo and other chip makers like Nvidia and Intel these companies are going to have a lot of profits because chips and and internets because let me show you the profile here basically what this company does Brom designs develops and supplies various semiconductor devices with focus on complex digital and mixed signal complimentary metal oxide semiconductor conductor based devices and analog 3 to five based products worldwide being honest with you I'm not a semiconductor expert but it doesn't take a genius understand that semiconductors are used in technology and you know whether it's AI or just simple ethernet switching and routing custom silicone

Invest with Henry,fTbD3zLpKoc,2024-07-17T18:45:51Z,Tesla Option Strategies,Tesla,"what's going on guys in this video I'm going to be talking about Tesla and Tesla's options I'm going to be giving you a number of different strategies from the poor man's covered call to leaps to covered calls to spreads you guys are in store for so much in this video that's going to be very informational and let's just get to the point right now and not waste any time all right so first of all I'm going to look at the chart on Tesla because to be honest with you since the stock has Skyrocket a lot it is difficult to say what it's going to do so I'm just going to tell you the different strategies that I think are interesting right now and you pick which one is best for you based on your view because I don't want to necessarily tell you what to do I just want you to think for yourself all right so first things first let's pull up Tesla's options I'm going to pull up Tesla I'm going to go to the option chain so let's go to trade Tesla options now the first thing that I would do is given the meteor or the meteoric rise or however you say that word right the stock is up a lot I think you can make a case and say that Tesla is likely to continue Rising due to high momentum due to investor sentiment and the stock has pulled back so it's likely to potentially go up or down a lot either direction which is why I think a straddle is also very good let me teach you step by step strategy all right so the first one is going to be the bull call spread the bull call spread is going to look like this you're going to pick an expiration date that is going to be you know into the Future Let's just say 23 days all right nothing crazy 3 weeks out all right now I would pick the first out ofth the- money option it doesn't necessarily have to be I I'll tell you the difference right but first of all 255 Delta here is 055 what you can do is you can simply buy a 255 and sell at 260 this right here would be a bull call spread giving you $5 of upside you're risking about $230 to make $270 so you can double your money now if you want to make a little bit more of a long shot bet let's say that you think Tesla is going to go up a little bit more then you can actually go more out of the money so you can go for let's say 280 you can buy a 280 and then you sell a 285 so remember you're always going to be buying the closer to the money leg and selling the farther from the money leg so it's always going to be a debit this is going to cost you money that's why it's called a call debit spread or a bull call spread however here you will see that because you are making more of a long shot and the market and other investors they understand this right I mean they know that these options are farther out of the money there's a less chance of this happening like if I expand this the Delta is34 so the Delta is lower the option is more out of the money and you were taking taking on kind of a bigger Hail Mary right this is like less less certain like if we're going to make a football analogy instead of a pass this is more of like a like a long distance throw right someone is like 30 yards away or whatever right so you get what I'm saying right higher risk higher risk well guess what higher reward so the max loss here is less 123 your maximum profit is 377 so now you should be able to conceptualize in your head that the further out of the money you go the higher the risk so is that better or worse well the risk to return is better but the chances of this happening is lower so it's actually about the same all right so let me get rid of this buy and sell let me actually show you something uh really interesting so let's go for it all right so in the money you can buy 245 bull call spread and then sell the 250 so this is going to have you see how you're risking 280 only to make 220 you might say oh well this is lower this is worse risk to return well this is actually in the money so even if Tesla goes sideways now and it goes nowhere you're actually getting like a 80% return or something really really big so this is another interesting strategy right here that you can use on on Tesla this can help you basically almost double your money based on your view all right so that is the bull call spread a bull call spread again it benefits if a stock goes up and it could actually benefit if a stock goes sideways as you just saw with the bull call spread you can manipulate it in many different ways depending on the strike that you pick all right so that is the first one now the next thing that you can do is you can just jump into Tesla with a leap option all right so what is a leap a leap is a long longterm option all right it's long-term in nature around 12 months so I can buy something that is roughly 12 months away or even more that's what a leap is so here is the September 19 2025 and this would be very expensive I'm going to show you how to make a leap option less expensive but first of all let's start off with just a leap option all right so you can buy an out ofthe money leap so we can go for let's say 300 all right this would be a pretty out of-the money leap but if Tesla goes to 400 you'll double your money Tesla goes to 500 well you'll basically triple your money so you will get a pretty crazy return here depending on if Tesla goes up and how much it goes up here the Delta is pretty high so the market is actually expecting Tesla to rise in the long term CU see here how your upside is actually Unlimited in the case of a leap option you're basically buying a call option a leap option is a call option we just call it a leap because it's very long-term in nature this option right here is going to cost $55,000 so that is that now let me show you a little bit closer to the money leap option all right or actually in the money so let's go for let's say 230 here the Delta is very high it's 71 that's a good thing if you're bullish because basically for every dollar that the stock moves up the option is going to move up in this scenario by 71 cents so you're going to get a very good upside exposure you are going to make good money if the stock goes up so this is a good thing all right so the 230 call right here you can see how it's going for 7900 this is going for 7900 right again unlimited upside everything is basically the same except that you have a higher Delta there's a higher chance of Tesla being 230 I mean it's already at 252 so that's why this option cost more it's going to cost more because it's in the money it's likely to stay in the money and uh it has more upside exposure so it's going to cost more but actually it doesn't cost that much more so for me I showed you first of all the example of an adom the money call at 300 but I would much prefer the 230 I would greatly much prefer the 230 now how do you make this cheaper well actually the good news is you can actually sell call options against a leap option and this would be called the poor man's covered call strategy it's called the poor man's covered call strategy because you don't have to buy 100 shares you can basically be a poor man and use the long call option just like you can use 100 shares so you don't need 100 shares that's what makes this strategy amazing fantastic so let's go for a 90 days expiration here so this is going to be 3 months out and let's just say we think Tesla is going to go up but we don't think is going to go up that much it's going to go to 285 let's say so that's reasonable to bet that it won't go too much higher than 10% up so here's a crazy and cool thing about the poor man's covered call basically you can start selling covered calls and now you will still make upside you will still make money as the stock goes up you will literally benefit as the stock goes higher but at 285 this is an interesting inflection point here you will start to lose a little bit money lose a little bit of profits not lose money but lose some of the gains okay that's because this 285 covered call will act against you but good news is it's expiring in 90 days so even if it goes up you can still close out this position for a game right now instead of putting up 7900 you're only putting up 5,800 which is the same thing that I just showed you with the 300 call and the crazy thing is this is only going out three months so you can do the strategy four times for example collect 2,000 2,000 2,000 you know four times that's A8 Grand you can completely pay for this long call option you can make it free all right so I mean that's in theory right that's if Tesla continues to go up and behaves properly now obviously if it goes down you are going to lose money just like everyone in the world is going to lose money on a regular stock so this is a bullish strategy you can see how you will lose money if the stock goes down so that is a given and you will make money if the stock goes up and even if it goes above 285 you simply close out uh the position as a whole okay close out the position as a whole close out both contracts close out the 230 and the 285 to make life simple but if you want to get a little bit more complicated you can roll up the $285 call option I will add the rolling videos for you guys in the description but you can also just type in invest with Henry rolling and then you will see exactly um how to roll up a position now I can also show you rolling if you just want me to comment down below I can make a followup video to this on rolling a poor man's covered call so anyways I've got your back but basically I typically close out the position as a whole or I roll it higher now the other strategy that I want to show you is going to be a put credits spread now this is something that I like to use all the time in my community on Discord I am using put credit spreads however I will say that I don't really like put credit spreads on Tesla right now and that's because Tesla has gone up a lot 60% in the past 3 months and if it pulls down it will pull down heavy so I don't think it makes that much sense to use a selling strategy like a put cdit spread but I want to show you a put credit spread quickly and then I want to show you what selling a put option will look like on Tesla and which strike price I would pick because one is good and one kind of isn't that good at the moment so let's go for you know in the middle of August here and I'm going to to basically just set up a quick put credit spread and this could work by the way if you go very out of the money 220 I mean this is not bad I mean it's not too bad if you sell a 220 and then you buy a 215 all right so selling and buying here you can see how you know you'll collect pretty good income $100 on 400 you'll get a 25% return and basically you hope that Tesla doesn't fall below 220 that could work now also what I would say is you can simply just you know sell the 220 and leave it as is here if you sell the 220 you can start running the wheel shot of Che by basically you know you sold this option you get $500 and now you're ready to take ownership of Tesla if it pulls back down to 220 I would say this is really good because selling a put option is goes hand in hand with the wheel strategy you sell a put option to get in and then you do a covered call to get out I would absolutely favor this strategy completely so I would say this is a fantastic strategy now the last strategy I'll show you is going to be like a lottery strategy this is where you can multiply your money many many many times and it's a little bit riskier and I don't personally do it all the time but I just want to show it to you all right so what you can do is you can sell a put option let's say that we're going to use the 250 and then you can basically buy a put option that's let's say let's go up by 20 okay let's go up by 20 to 270 then we're also going to use to the 250 as a reference point we went up to 270 we went up by 20 but now we're going to go back to 250 and use this as a reference to go down by 20 we're going to pick up the 230 here okay now this is going to look a little bit weird all right so we bought bought and sold now what you want to do is you want to go to custom ratio right here all right and you you want to create an even amount of cells for each buy I want there to be two cells and then buy and buy right here you will see that this is a very interesting strategy where you'll basically benefit if Tesla doesn't do anything so maybe you're one of these investors out here that says hey Tesla gone up a lot and now I don't see anything happening with Tesla I think it's going to move sideways well here we go you can basically risk $360 to make $1600 all right so this is where you can basically more than Forex your money in a month so if you were to do this in a year and let's just hypothetically say you were to win this type of trade 12 months out of the Year well you can already imagine that you're going to get like a 20x return in a year all right so you can 20 extra money with a strategy but it's a very difficult strategy to manage because there's four legs there's four bit ask spreads but this could be a really good strategy to mix in if you are very neutral on a stock you don't have to use Tesla you can just pick any neutral stock but I will say I do not personally teach this strategy in my coaching my Monday and Wednesday coaching calls or any of the trades I'm making I don't personally run the strategy due to the heavy amount of management that the strategy takes so personally wouldn't use it but I want you to have a good understanding of more strategies on this video I know I seen your guys comments you you've been asking me to make videos that are closer to my old style so we'll see how this video does um hope that you guys really enjoy it and make sure that you watch my video on rolling and also make sure that you watch my small account playlist because there I talk about spreads I talk about iron Condors I have an Ultimate Guide to trading spreads which I'll actually just leave up on this video right now so you can

eventually grow your account size to a large portfolio so catch you guys in the next video make sure to keep watching",1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,X-PuZQkqG1s,2024-07-15T18:00:16Z,How to Make $10K Per Month and Retire on SPY (Step by Step),SPY,"hey guys today I'm going to be talking about spy and just retiring on trading SPY by itself no other stocks keeping it super simple and making $10,000 or more this is my full blueprint this is what I would do if I was looking to retire I was fairly lazy and I didn't want to mess around with technical analysis fundamental analysis and I wanted a diversify portfolio without having any issues set it forget it collect a bunch of dividends collect a bunch of income from options and just have a good lifestyle this is going to be a very unique thought process on sp1 and for those of you guys that don't know spy is basically an index fund with 500 of the largest companies now back when I was in college I was learning that index funds are the most efficient way to invest and I'm actually going to agree that yes spy and I'll be talking about QQQ I'll also be talking about zero dce trading I'm going to be talking about a lot of stuff in this video but let's start off with one thing first okay I'm going to educate you a lot so make sure you stick out through the end spy is a diversified ETF with 500 largest companies these companies are the everyday companies that you probably encounter you definitely encounter not probably encounter in United States now the Spy also has a lot of international exposure which I'm going to be covering in this video as well so look the Spy is composed of IBM Coca-Cola Apple Microsoft Google and lots of other stocks that are in healthcare that are in technology there are materials transportation and the list goes on I'm going to set some clear goals and expectations for you if you have a decent chunk of money and you're looking to retire spy could literally be all you need you don't really even have to focus on single stocks you don't have to focus on the market because spy has buil in diversity it has every single thing within the economy that you encounter every day driving to work eating healthare education and everything else in between I'm going to be talking about how much money to put in into spy and what your strategy should be so look first of all cash when it sits and does nothing loses to inflation so we know we have to invest how much should you invest into spy well the truth is you can invest all of your wealth into spy in my personal opinion I don't even have any real estate I don't have anything going on aside from the money that I have in my portfolios now I have a number of different portfolios and I have my money spread across four different brokerages but the thing is I don't do anything else but option trade because it provides the most steady passive income if you're looking for the simplest way to build wealth an ETF like spy can get the whole job done the first strategy that I would run on the Spy would be a covered call strategy and the second strategy would be selling puts I'm going to go into detail but first let's discuss how to actually put your money to work in spy so first of all you have to have a brokerage account it doesn't matter which brokerage account that you use any brokerage account does the same job it's like a vehicle it gets you from point A to point B now for spy the thing is you can have 100% of your money in it but how should you actually put that money to work should you put all of it all at once or should you put it in over time well actually when I was working for Goldman Sachs when people would sell their companies right I worked with many CEOs actually that had exits that are 60 million to $500 million when a CEO or some high netw worth individual and by the way you don't have to be rich to watch this video it doesn't matter when you have a chunk of money they would put that to work over a 10-week period okay what that means is if you personally have $50,000 you would put $5,000 $5,000 and so on and so forth over a 10we period why this is called dollar cost averaging and it actually protects you from making a bad timing mistake so we all know that you can't time the market that's why watching a bunch of YouTube videos or paying attention to the news isn't really that useful yes it gives you some insight into what other people are thinking into what's going into our economy but at the end of the day nobody can time the market which is why if you have a chunk of capital the smartest thing that you can do is put it to work over a 10-week period into a high quality stock or an ETF like spy now me personally this is a little bit controversial but I personally don't like holding any physical assets I don't like gold I don't like silver I don't like real estate this is because if you put all your money into something like the Spy you can generate from 1 to two or even 3% per month very safely now if you're going to be running the spread strategy or iron Condors or any of the smaller account strategies that I do teach on this channel as it comes to option trading you can make 5 10 or even more perc per month now just being honest with you the more money you make per month really just depends on how much risk you're willing to take spy you don't need to diversify you don't have to have any other stocks because it has built-in diversification spy and QQQ are were very similar by the way spy is just the 500 largest company whereas the NASDAQ or the QQQ just follows more of a tech focused large cap stocks so specifically NASDAQ versus sp500 very very similar they basically have the same things just there's a higher weighted focus on the technology companies such as Netflix Tesla Etc so that's why the QQQ has a little bit more volatility but overall the returns are very similar and if I were to make a bet over the next 10 years they're going to be within 50% % of each other now I get it 50% of each other is actually pretty wide I actually believe QQQ can outperform spy so we'll talk about QQQ in just a little bit but the whole reason is because the more risk that you take well the more return that you get so spy QQQ both very high quality ETFs yes if you want to make a higher return over a 10-year period I would probably say QQQ is good but for the purpose of this video Let's just assume they're about the same because they really are about the same except for again there's a higher Tech pH focus on the NASDAQ or the QQQ so look when it comes to risk management because I get a lot of questions in my Discord Community I get a lot of questions from you guys on this YouTube channel I'm going to educate you from A to Z on how to trade spy and make income and retire on it you want to think about risk management because if you're thinking about retiring you probably have a decent amount of money right or even if you're not close to retiring but you want to retire one day you're starting off with a certain amount of money today you're thinking how do I protect myself how do I manage this amount of money and what should I be doing with this money to actually set myself up for the future so whether you have 5,000 $50,000 or $500,000 today you still have to think about risk management because when it comes to single stocks you need to know how to hedge you need to know when to exit you need to know when to enter into a stock right but when it comes into the Spy you truly can be as dumb or as smart as a monkey you really don't have to be a genius you don't have to have any education you can practically be a 18-year-old person without ever actually studying anything you get what I'm trying to get at right not being disrespectful to anyone I'm just being straight you don't need any education whatsoever to just put your money in spy over 10 weeks and then from that point how do you risk manage it well you just hold on to it for the very long term okay you keep adding money to it there was a research study done and there's several research articles that I've read and I've seen so many throughout my you know 10 years of experience here if you dollar cost average you will beat any person trying to time the market even if person that perfectly times the market over a 10e span of course unless there's some anomaly or some 2008 event or some financial crisis you are going to outperform a person that times the market meaning that you no longer need to pay attention to the fluctuations of the market instead what you need to focus on is getting Capital where you're using it and putting it into a strategy like spy covered calls and selling puts now what should you do with your salary well for me personally when I was working on Wall Street I was making like $75,000 a year which is not a whole lot of money I was putting in every single dollar that I could into my portfolio because if you have a smaller portfolio let's say you have $20,000 and you can add $1,000 to your portfolio that is a 5% increase to day on your wealth now for me I have over $5 million in both of my portfolios as well as some other money in other portfolios I've you know had businesses I do Consulting I've done a lot of stuff in my life and for me the risk management that I follow is very simple add as much money as possible to the safe strategies and let this money make you wealthy over time I believe in getting rich slowly not getting rich quickly so I Do cover stocks here on this channel that can get you rich a lot quicker but at the end of the day it is your choice you can get rich quicker you can get rich slower and these two choices are very important to balance out and I'm just saying I'm personally not doing this strategy on spy because I personally like taking on more risk I personally enjoy having paler Tesla Apple in my per folio I'm actually going to talk about why I have 63% or more of my money in apple right now but specifically you need to weigh your options it depends where you are in life and I'm trying to make this video as specific to you as possible for you to open up your mind and think about this because if you're closer to retirement or your RIS tolerance is lower or you're very busy you're a family person you're a family man you have a family to take care of you're busy at work it actually may make sense for you to just have your money in spy versus watching a whole bunch of YouTube videos and trying to get really fancy in fact you can keep keep it very simple and the first strategy that I already alluded to is going to be the covered call strategy for me the best Delta to pick for a covered call is going to be 30 now why is it 30 well because 30 is really The Sweet Spot I've done a lot of research and if you look at 50 Delta well that's a very high Delta right you're going to get you're going to lose your shares you're going to incur a taxable event you're going to have to sell your shares of spy now if you have a very low Delta well you're just not going to collect that much income because when a Delta is very low that means that the covered call with the call option that you're selling is very far away and the farther an option is the lower premium that you get so for me 30 is that sweet spot I've been asked a lot about zero DTE options should you trade short-term options and how do I get into spy properly well the thing is you can sell a put option to get into spy it's actually very simple you can also go for a roughly 30 Delta now of course I'm simplifying this right now because you know if I were to go into detail then this video would be like an hour long but that's not that important because around 30 Delta is basically where it makes the most sense to sell put options so if you go for a 30 Delta sell put well basically three out of 10 times you are going to get assigned why three out of 10 well 30 Delta also Delta it measures how much an option moves but Delta also just gives you the chances that an option will expire in the money so a 30 Delta is basically 30% and 30% is three out of 10 times right three1 all right so if you sell a put option you can get into spy one of my recommendations or you know obviously I'm not a financial adviser I've been working in the field for a long time but just a guy in the internet if it was me I would be selling puts on spy on a consistent basis even going into margin now this is a very tough topic because margin is also very controversial but hey I didn't really get rich by taking the safe road so for me I believe in using margin I believe in actually putting a lot of money to work all of the money I have to work into stocks into options so I want you to really think about this because you can make a huge difference in your life by investing today because this money does compound now in present day you know both my portfolios are at 5 million I have another portfolio and seven figures I am pushing bigger numbers and it's much easier to build wealth as I continue to compound that's because compound interest is one of the strongest forces and that's something that will really build your wealth but that happens towards the later stages of your life now I'm lucky enough to be fairly young to start seeing a lot of this huge wealth come in but I want to say that every one still has time you will get to your goal as long as you're investing properly as long as you're being patient as long as you're not losing money and you're sticking to a proper strategy now the last thing I want to say is I personally have a lot of money in Apple stock and right now I am uncovered why two reasons okay first of all Apple stock is very similar to the Spy and QQQ Apple stock is a huge component of spy and it is a huge component of QQQ that's because apple is a large Diversified company and it's one of the biggest companies in the world so both of those ETFs are holding Apple so for me I prefer trading a single stock because there's more volatility and with more volatility I can make more option premium with that being said I currently don't have any options or covered calls on Apple actually I do in my portfolio it's 235 covered call but there was actually two weeks where I didn't have a covered call and the reason for that is because in a bull market like we are in right now it's actually not that good to do covered calls now I know I've been preaching options for 5 years now I know I'm like one of the Godfathers here of teaching option education and here we have a huge family and a l large subscriber base where we are trading options however I will say that covered calls are not good in a bullish Market actually in a bullish Market it's probably much better just to sell puts and get acquired on the stock and just hold a lot of stock and ride the momentum higher so in my opinion my humble opinion you don't need a financial adviser you don't need a bunch of YouTube videos you don't really need any courses you don't need any programs all you need to do dollar cost average into spy sell covered calls sell puts watch the videos on this channel I literally give everything for free but if you do want to work with me if you want to see how I'm

Invest with Henry,Cbf_Nl1AXnA,2024-07-15T15:22:01Z,3 Stocks Congress Members Can’t Stop Buying,Amazon,this last bonus stock is Amazon the clearest headwind for the current and prospective Amazon investor is the likelihood that us could go through a recession and it wouldn't even matter because a recession could take shape in a not too distant future we see that there is some data pointing to that I'm not going to predict the future I don't know although US economic data has remained relatively strong if it were to be a market recession Amazon is going to Faire very well look the reason why I would invest in Amazon is the same reason that I am personally investing in apple Tesla Google it's because of brand people want Simplicity and when there's a company that gives you a simple solution money is not a problem I personally believe that money is super abundant there are many ways to make money and rich people will definitely be spending money on Amazon poor people will also definitely be spending money on Amazon because of convenience especially the American Consumer convenience is such a huge part of the American Consumer we're so used to that we can't even get away from Amazon even though a lot of people are spending a lot of their paychecks on Amazon including you know Whole Foods which they own so while recessions can be scary the important thing to remember is if you're invested in highquality companies it doesn't really matter in the 78 plus years since World War II ended nine out of the 12 us recessions were resolved in less than 12 months this means consumer facing companies like Amazon are going to be just fine along with the other stocks that I cover on this channel for the most part.,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,81dsgvR5T3Y,2024-07-13T18:40:14Z,URGENT: Market Reset Incoming,Tesla,specifically Tesla it went to the Moon it went to $270 per share and then it had a pullback of over $20 so a lot of my students in the Discord Community have asked me is it a good buy right now and I think not just Tesla you need to look at you need to look at the overall technology market right now yes I am putting money to work on Tesla but specifically I think that the General market right now is overpriced in certain pockets and actually underpriced in other Pockets. The whole reason I cover paler Tesla recently I'm covering other stocks like apple. you can see that on Tesla I am having a 63% allocation in this portfolio. because Tesla is a very interesting company we have seen that uh they did have a delay in the robo taxi event and that's all a very big reaction from Tesla now typically when there's a big reaction in the market that's actually a good thing because volatility goes up and volatility is higher option premiums are also higher so it's a fantastic time to be trading options in general because volatility actually helps options they become more expensive and if you're an option seller you are going to be making more money selling options. I want to jump into my portfolio and show you my positions like paler Apple Tesla I don't have Google and a couple of other stocks I talk about on this channel because I have two different portfolios. Tesla Robo taxes they're going to transform completely Uber lift they might out of business altogether who knows right now this Market is evolving very fast technology is evolving very fast AI is involving very fast which is why Nvidia is a good stock that a lot of my students have we have made tremendous money on Invidia. we are seeing some pullbacks in stocks like Tesla I think it's an interesting time to dollar cost average into Tesla now I wouldn't just dump a bunch of money in because yeah I mean the stock was better by at $180 per share I actually you know let me actually show you what I had on Tesla I have Tesla in both my portfolios I made tremendous money on Tesla in this portfolio specifically I had a 155 put option so so that's very very out of the money I was selling put options hoping to buy Tesla 155 that's what a sellp put strategy is a sell put means that I am willing to buy the stock at that strike price which is 155. So right now what I'm looking to do is as soon as the market opens up Monday morning I am going to be buying some Tesla and I'm going to be running the wheel strategy on Tesla in a safe way meaning I'm not going to be putting more than 10% of my money in Tesla stock right now. I have a majority of my money in apple and palen here but Tesla is something I'm going to be adding to the list so let me know in the comment down below are you guys currently holding Tesla what is your view on Tesla in the next 5 to 10 years is Robo taxis going to completely transform the way that we drive the way that the taxi industry works and last but not least please comment down below which stocks you want me to cover because right now I paying very close attention to making money and getting my portfolio to $3 million.,1.0,0.7

I want to jump into my portfolio and show you my positions like paler Apple Tesla I don't have Google and a couple of other stocks I talk about on this channel because I have two different portfolios. I am personally also having Amazon American Airlines palen here PayPal is actually an really interesting one because I like the valuation the valuation is very interesting now. I have a majority of my money in apple and palen here but Tesla is something I'm going to be adding to the list.,0.9,0.7

Invest with Henry,fszLacO2K44,2024-07-12T22:20:14Z,I'm Buying Tesla AND Palantir Stock (Here's Why),Tesla,"I'm buying palen here and Tesla stock right now I think this is some really big news what's going on with Tesla the stock absolutely skyrocketed and now we have seen a pullback due to a delay in Robo taxi meeting this is very important and I'm actually putting a lot of money to work right now on Tesla stock. but honestly why would you even be looking at making $350 per day when you can make like $3,500 per day on Tesla obviously I'm not going to put all my money into Tesla but listen up Tesla has pulled back hard the technicals were absolutely insane on the stock the stock went up basically to the Moon we can see that right here on the chart the stock went to almost $270 per share now I don't know about you but it's looking like Tesla can go up to like $1,000 given this momentum but right now you can see the bowling or band has completely expanded this is what I look at as an option Trader and now that it's pulling back I think this is a very interesting opportunity what I'm going to be looking at right now is a few different option strategies on Tesla as well as I'm going to give you my opinion on Tesla stock in general. now look if you don't have any Tesla stock at all I think this is a stock that you must own I don't think you should go all in on this stock like I did back in 2021 where I made over $700,000 but I think this is a very interesting place specifically I was looking at the news there's a few things that I don't absolutely love about Tesla because Tesla the EV Market it's its share and the overall EV Market is a little bit below 50% now you know they do have competition obviously and they're still doing fantastic but there's four there's Kia there's Hyundai there's BMW there is a lot of competitors in the space and competition does bring down the margins however I think that Tesla has a strong foothold specifically because they have a fantastic brand and right now they have a fantastic brand sentiment is finally very positive for the stock. Elon Musk this guy he doesn't give up Elon Musk has not mentally checked out this man unlike some other CEOs other people out there this man is not checking out he is all in on Tesla and that's what I like to see I like to see a CEO founder an entrepreneur that is Allin doesn't give up no matter what Elon Musk has that and that's why I am very bullish on Tesla stock. now looking at the news you know they have a reported delay that was highly anticipating um a robo taxi event right the robo taxi event has a lot to do because Tesla's specifically going to have a lot of profits Robo taxis are going to be self-sufficient and there's not going to be a driver so this could disrupt Uber this could disrupt lift this could disrupt just taxis in general so there's a whole lot of opportunity here and I think a lot of investors are looking forward to this event and it being delayed has caused the stock to pull back now this pullback to me presents an opportunity specifically with a few different option strategies. now again I said I'm not really minding that the brand strength or that other brands are competing I think the brand strength is enough for Tesla so what I'm going to be doing right now is I want to show you a few different option strategies on Tesla that I would be doing right now and I'm going to give you a few specific pieces of advice obviously not Financial advice but my opinion here uh if you have a small portfolio if you have a medium portfolio if you have a large portfolio because my job is to make you money that's literally why I created this channel so I'm going to be show showing you how I think about creating income using Tesla options. now look obviously Elon Musk he's not relaxing he is not a chill dude this guy has not mentally checked out he's going to continue running Tesla and I think Tesla is going to be rising over the long term now in the short term I think that the stock could potentially move sideways because we've had a huge run up now we have a pullback I think that we're going to see investors kind of scratch their head and say hey I'm not sure which direction we're going to go here we're going to see some people jumping into the stock as well as some other people selling so there's going to be selling pressures there's going to be buying pressures which is kind of why I don't see a clear Direction on the stock right now and because of that reason I think it's smart right now to dollar cost average by selling put options I would not recommend or I would probably tell people not to do put credit spreads because specifically a put credit spread you can get a lot of trouble when a stock has a lot of volatility right now I'd be dollar cost averaging into Tesla buying up shares the Market's about to open in five minutes here as I'm recording this video and I think what I want to do is I want to start dollar cost averaging you can see here that I made $1,825 on Tesla stock by selling some put options today I'm going to be putting money to work as soon as the Market opens up I'm going to be selling some more put options so I can get a bigger exposure into Tesla stock. for Tesla it's Robo taxis it's expansion into the uh International Market it's their brand strength. so let's jump into Tesla right now I'm going to show you what a poor man's covered call looks like. all right the poor man's covered call right here this is going to be a bullish strategy this is a bullish strategy where we're going to be buying a call option that is going to be expiring in the future I'm going to go for March 21st because Tesla is an expensive stock this is the best way to jump into Tesla without having to spend too much money okay I'm going to buy an in the- money call option now typically I'm going to show you typically I'm going for 70 or 80 Delta actually this perfectly meets my criteria right here 200 uh strike price is 76 Delta so this is pretty good however I will say that this is still pretty expensive so what you can do is you can actually go this is going to be a little bit of a mixture of a poor man's covered call and the bull call spread this is the most interesting strategy right here I think I have for a smaller portfolio to get massive upside um with some medium risk okay this is not a lowrisk strategy guys if you want low risk you're going to follow my wheel strategy you're going to follow my uh covered call strategy my sellp strategy you're not necessarily going to love this one but I would say if you want aggressive growth this is this is the right thing to do so uh right here the 225 I'm going to go for 22567 Delta this is still pretty expensive okay but you know it's not too bad given that Tesla is a bullish run so I'm going to go ahead and buy this now to run the poor man's Comfort call basically it's called Poor Man's covered call because you're not buying 100 shares you're buying a call option it's a lot cheaper it's $5,500 instead of over $20,000 so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell a uh covered call for October 18 90 days out roughly give or take and now you'll see that I'm going to give it some room because I don't it's hard to manage the poor man's covered call as a downside of the strategy if you're too close but 270 is pretty good for 90 days out Tesla could go to 270 but let's just say that in the short term we're going to go sideways as I mentioned so here's a sell call $270 and I can make $20 $19 right so $1,900 and I'm only putting up $3,600 so I'm making basically like a 50% return I can make like almost $3,000 here if the stock goes up you can almost double your money in 90 days is a little bit riskier but this is what I would be doing with a portion of my Capital 10 20% of my money this is exactly what I would be doing to make money right now on Tesla stock.",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,fszLacO2K44,2024-07-12T22:20:14Z,I'm Buying Tesla AND Palantir Stock (Here's Why),Palantir,"I'm buying palen here and Tesla stock right now. now look yesterday I was discussing the wheel strategy on pal here I was saying how making $350 per day but honestly why would you even be looking at making $350 per day when you can make like $3,500 per day on Tesla. I just want to say that I am personally investing a lot of money into palen here as well as Tesla right now because I'm very bullish on AI. for paler it's AI it's the management just like Elon Musk Alex carp has a big Vision big runway for the company to grow and to gain government contracts. so for me these are the two stocks I want to be invested in because at the end of the day yes I have a ton of money in my portfolio but I'm still looking to get richer I still am a human being I still want to make more money so what I'm looking at is I want to aggressively grow my portfolio I've been a little bit more stable but now that I see so much opportunity I'm hungry I'm excited to do some option strategies here on Tesla and on paler. I'd also be doing this on paler stock but for paler you should watch yesterday's video where I talk about the wheel strategy.",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,K_8kw6Ze2FY,2024-07-11T19:04:34Z,Palantir Wheel Income Strategy,Palantir,"I will show you how to make a few hundred a day running the wheel strategy on paler. I recently mentioned that there has been a lot of direct purchases of paler stock from insiders such as Alex karp S car the co-founder Steve Cohan and the chief Revenue officer so this is a very bullish sign. I'm going to show you right now my paler position how I'm holding it how I'm running this strategy and a step-by-step guide basically to doing this wheel strategy. I'm up $33,000 on paler and you can see here how I have a whole lot of different options. We're going to be using pal here since it's a highquality company it's not that expensive so this strategy is not going to require that much cash. I'm personally making over $350 per day just on pal here. For me paler is currently at $28 and let's just say hypothe ically I'm happy to buy at 25. You will buy 100 shares of pounds here at 26 so you'll have $2,600 invested. In this example if pal here goes to 29 or above you will have to sell the shares. If the assignment happens and pal your drops to 24 you have the stock at 24 as your average cost and you sell a covered call if pound around that same level you can sell a covered call for say 26 and so on and so forth you can basically play around with the strike prices. You don't have to use pounds here I would also use High growing stocks that have good quality fundamentals.",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,peC8XSbAZQI,2024-07-08T22:05:34Z,Palantir: Insider Transactions News,Palantir,"hey everyone we have some important negative and positive news to discuss today about paler this is a core holding in my portfolio and it's looking ready to rip right now there's a bull flag pattern forming as well as some key insights I've gained speaking to a worker at the company now I don't have any Insider info but I do know someone there and I've been following the stock so listen to this video there has been different purchasing of the stock from Alex carp Sankar the co-founder Steve Cohan and the cro I'm looking at their strong focus on on data integration I'm looking really closely at what's happening at the company I'm looking at Insider purchases I'm looking at what the management is doing I'm also trying to get as much information as possible to give you guys the objective truth on the stock The Good the Bad and where I think the stock is heading I have a significant amount of money here and I'm specifically looking at their strong focus on data integration and analytics pal here's core strength lies in its ability to integrate process and analyze vast amounts of data from disparate sources this capability is crucial for AI applications that require large data sets to train models and derive insights Ai and machine learning applications thrive on large diverse data sets paler expertise in integrating and processing data from various sources means that they can provide the robust data sets necessary for training Advanced AI models this position's palent here as a key player in the AI ecosystem we've seen Nvidia rip it like crazy we've seen other AI companies that are making a lot of money right now and paler has already proved in the recent in the past month that this stock is going to the moon now of course there's risks but for me if you use an appropriate asset allocation it's almost crazy not to be invested in this company many companies struggle with Silo data and fragmented systems Pal's ability to unify these desperate data sources gives them a competitive Advantage businesses are looking to leverage their data more effectively and this will turn paler solution into a basic necessity and that's going to help them Drive Revenue growth their competitive Advantage is once they come into a company it is game over they have a contract basically for life one other Factor about pal here that makes me invest a lot of money here multiple six figures is the customization and scalability that they have Pounder software is highly customizable and scalable making it suitable for a wide range of Industries and applications they're not just going for government they're not just going for private sector they're literally going after every single industry where the company is big enough to give them money all right just straight up they are making money hand over fist and that revenue is going to continue to grow and it is going to trickle down to the bottom line eventually this flexibility allows organizations highly customizable and scalable software is what allows organizations to tailor the AI tools to their specific needs okay it's not a product it's not like hey hey this is you know here's a product buy it paler literally goes in and gives them specific and applicable advice I'm just telling you that paler is literally a company that goes in and customizes solutions that's how you should deliver to a customer you should deliver a customized solution not a product by improving data integration and analytics paler can help organizations operate more efficiently and make better informed decisions AKA they're helping companies make more money now this can also lead to cost savings okay not only do they make companies make more money they also help them save cost and increase productivity for clients making Pounders offering more attractive and justifying a higher price model this is really interesting because Alex karp went to my high school I know I mentioned that and he knows what he's doing he's a genius okay he's the Elon Musk in this space paler has a track record of tackling complex high stakes problems particularly in areas such as National Security defense advance and intelligence that type of money isn't going anywhere the country is only getting more dangerous unfortunately and paler is going to be protecting USA they're also abroad they're expanding internationally and this expertise is handling honestly the most intricate areas and challenges that is going to position paler as a leader in developing sophisticated AI Solutions and this coworker that I've talked to a paler he's been everywhere this guy has been to New York he's been to Silicon Valley he's worked at so many different companies he has a computer science degree and after talking to him I'm just so bullish I didn't get any private info but just seriously what they're doing on the internal side of the company is kind of mind-blowing it's very Cutting Edge so paler attracts top talent in the field of data science Ai and software engineering I mean this guy had like perfect grades and he was working at Google and Amazon all these other big tech companies and when a company like paler can attract Talent like that that is the biggest game Cher because these tech companies they need talent okay their asset is literally their talent so they need to attract the best of the best because that type of brain power the IQ the the skill set that these employees bring is what helps paler have its competitive Advantage win more contracts and make more company and make more money the company also invests heavily in research and development again you need the top talented people because otherwise who's going to be researching and developing you need really smart people to do that smart people equals more research and development more research and development equals competitive Advantage competitive Advantage equals winning more contracts winning more contracts equals more money and more money means that the company's stock goes up that's why I'm invested in palons here that's why I'm running specifically a few different strategies that I'm going to get into in moment here's what I'm going to be doing in 2024 and specifically as well as 2025 this is a long-term bet for me I am going to be dollar cost averaging and buying more paler stock first of all I want to own more stock I want to increase my position position currently I have over $130,000 in one portfolio as well as six figures in my other more private portfolio where I share in the Discord community and I plan to just keep adding more shares now the first strategy I'm going to run covered call very simple I'm going to be selling covered calls to generate income on paler I'm also going to be selling put options I think you can make $5 to $10,000 even if you don't have a massive seven figure portfolio you can have a medium siiz portfolio and still generate a very good living wage on Palance here but for me I think it's smart to have 10 15 maybe even 20% depending on your risk tolerance in a company like this that has AI that has many Trends behind it that is going for a good valuation um is growing and me specifically I do have a good average cost on paler I've showed you guys the position but but even at these levels I would say that paler is a good purchase",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,oBOD0M_6jEk,2024-07-04T21:00:34Z,OPTIONS - The Only 7 Basics You MUST Know,Tesla,for instance if you buy a Tesla call option with a strike price of 100 and a premium of let's say a doll the break even price is going to be 101 and if Tesla hits the price by expiration you are at your break even well Tesla's at $200 right now so let's just say if if it went to you know $200 and $1 if you went to 2011 that would be your break even if it goes higher then you are in profit territory so if it goes to 205 and uh your call options at$ 200 and you bought it for $1 well basically that's a $4 gain right because you have $5 in the money but you paid $1 for that option,1.0,0.6
Invest with Henry,nbrFFqy3et8,2024-07-03T15:39:16Z,"$130,000 Palantir Position News",Palantir,"paler is a stable growth stock and today I'm going to be covering my $130,000 position and update you on the stock and the options as you can see my portfolio has been doing actually very well I'm currently at $2.6 million in this portfolio and I'm going to jump into my paler position right now I'm going to show you exactly what I'm holding in my main portfolio so I have a $130,000 position on paler my average cost is $ 2167 makes up currently 5% of this portfolio I do have some more pounds here in my other portfolio 5,000 shares and I'm currently running a few different option positions so my overall paler position is actually pretty big and this portfolio and the other portfolio when you take the aggregate full amount it's over A4 million dollar and for me I'm very bullish on this company there has been a lot of recent news from investors and speculators and they have had some serious doubts about the stock and they've been saying basically that something feels off don't rush into the stock and this stock is not worth it well I'm not here to say that this stock is a good stock or a bad stock I'm just going to give you the objective truth and facts about what paler is doing and my opinion on the stock so the first reason why I have such a heavy position in paler is their expansion into Ai and machine learning I do have a degree in data analytics along with Finance paler advancement and Ai and machine learning have attracted investors looking for exposure to cuttingedge technology and that's for a really good reason because AI is a trend and it is a trend because I actually think it's going to become a big part of our economy and a company like paler is part of this big Trend that is continuing to grow very rapidly and paler platform is increasingly integrated with AI capabilities which are critical for businesses seeking Advanced data analytics Solutions so data is literally the new oil data is very powerful for making decisions it gives businesses pricing power it gives businesses a competitive advantage and the most important thing right now is data and the more data that companies are generating right now they don't know what to do with it so a company like paler is enabling businesses to make more money of course this is more so on the government side so you know obviously paler has crushed it they have new government and commercial contracts paler continues to secure these and they have significant new contracts both with government entities and private sector companies recently high-profile deals demonstrate the trust and reliability on paler technology now let's talk about global expansion the company's expansion into International markets has opened up new revenue streams Pal's ability to adapt its solutions for diverse regulatory environment and industries around the world is seen as a growth driver and that is very true I traveling internationally now in fact I haven't been to the United States in a few years and I have several homes across the world and I do see that International markets are growing very quickly there's so many economies out there that are growing double digits just look at India there is a lot of global expansion and that's actually something that I really look for when I'm investing in a company is I don't want to just be invested in the domestic Market of United States because I already hold all my money in US dollars so I want to be more Diversified and have access and exposure to the global market so that is another big positive of palent here and also looking at their product Innovation like ongoing product Innovation they have is actually tremendous you know looking at Foundry and Gotham platforms stuff like this has just been continues to evolve and the technology that paler is putting out is very strong because once they get into a company because the technology is at a higher level the company actually doesn't know how to get rid of paler which is kind of interesting right so once the company goes in they basically have a long-term perspective or they have a long-term relationship which is very powerful for the cash flow of the company it's very powerful for the financial performance in fact that's actually one of the best things about software and that's why software companies do go for much larger valuation for example if you look at a company that really doesn't have a whole lot of you know is more of a commodity right like oil and gas their valuation the price earnings ratio is going to be low however if you look at the price to earnings ratio of adobe software Adobe has a very high price earnings ratio because um recurring software companies are basically the most valuable thing that um investors like because of the consistent cash flow over a very long period of time it's very consistent it's very reliable key word reliable oil and gas is not that reliable because it relies on a commodity going up and down and there's things that can um basically replace oil and gas right electric hydrogen other other factors right but for a technology company um if you look at recurring Revenue then in most cases that is very strong especially if you look at a churn rate again that's really kind of more business terms here but if you look at churn rate if the turn rate's low then the company's going to be worth a lot and let me tell you paler has very low turn rates in its customers okay they have contracts are like 10 years and then those contracts are very likely to get uh fulfilled again so another 10 years or 15 years and um that's very powerful for the company and that does go down to the financial performance so improved Financial metrics is a big thing that I'm looking at with paler. When I look at financials what I'm looking for is revenue growth I'm looking for profitability I'm looking for positive cash flow and these are some of the big key factors that are important to me especially when I'm looking at a company that I'm Trading long term so investors are encouraged by Pal's ability to translate its technological advances and all these you know government contracts into actual dollars so when you look at the actual dollars I think this company makes a lot of sense and they're very difficult to replace on the financial side you really can't get a whole lot better when you're working with the government as well as AI machine learning as I mentioned Global expansion and just general product Innovation now you know I do want to say that you know before I show you all the options of what I'm doing and you know go deeper into my thought process of where I think support and resistance is I just want to quickly say that the leadership and the vision of pal here is just super strong the leadership team particularly the CEO Alex karp he did go to my high school I went to Central High School in Philadelphia where I graduated from and uh I did continue to study University of Pennsylvania Drexel I am from Philadelphia so um you know looking at Alex karp you know he has a lot of relationships he has grown a large Network you know he has powerful connections and connections do mean a lot now connections didn't mean a lot to me personally because I have I'm very proud to say I'm self-made came from nothing my parents are from mova and basically I do think that um having relationships though and networking is the most powerful thing and it's the most powerful predictor of wealth in America so if you look at um Rich families the reason why their kids are also very likely to make a lot of money is because most of the time men specifically fathers pass down their connections to sons that is a very common thing to happen you can see that with Donald Trump his father gave him a million dollars but it actually wasn't the million dollars that made Trump successful like we saw that the small loan a million dollars but it was actually the relationships the experience that was passed down to Trump from his father so looking at CEO Alex carp there is a lot of power there okay and I like to make those type of bets I like to look at Founders that are strong in fact even if I didn't look at Palante here and he just told me that Alex karp is going to lead this business this would be a big um deciding factor for me to invest in the company because a Founder that has had a successful exit who has become a billionaire who starts another company is likely to do that again success makes more success so Alex harp is viewed as a Visionary and he's capable of steering the company through through complex challenges which is very important in this market the market is always complex all right people ask me is this a good time to invest in the market is he going to get uh is he going to go down is going to go up well the truth is the Market's always going to be complex it's always going to have volatility because if it didn't life would be easy and uh that's just not how life works so in complex times which is all times you do need a CEO who is a Visionary who is like a Steve Jobs who can take like a company to Apple levels now I don't think paler can be apple levels but it doesn't have to be the company can double and triple it could be a $50 stock it can be a $100 stock this decade in the next 6 years right it's 2024 we can have a lot of significant growth so the Strategic decisions that he's making the long-term Vision that he has is very important to me and I believe in the vision which is why I invest in the stock and then last but not least uh increase demand for data security data security is very very important and actually something about me that I don't mention on the channel is I've had a lot of jobs I've actually tried many different jobs and one of the jobs that I've had I was like a kind of like a job Hopper and I wanted to get a lot of experience because I always knew that I wasn't going to work for someone else I was always going to be an investor or deep down I already knew I was going to work for myself start a business or just invest trade Etc right so for me I job hopped a lot and I've tried many different things and one of my jobs was working for IBM and I was uh there as a consultant and I was a technology consultant and I actually got to learn a lot about data security and privacy and Palance here is very strong here which is another Trend now it's not a mainstream Trend by the way data security and privacy is actually not a mainstream Trend but I know that it's very very important for companies and it makes a lot of money in fact Amazon I have many friends many students who um I've coached over the years that work for Amazon Google Microsoft Nvidia Adobe I have many engineers and um just in general data security and privacy I know for a fact is growing very very fast because I can see by the salaries of Engineers as well the demand continues to rise so with that being said let's jump into my paler position let's go to trade options I'm going to show you specifically few simple strategies that I would use and if you're a beginner with options that's perfect because I focus on beginners I focus on helping beginners gain um access to the strategies and the simple method of basically selling options for income I think at anyone can do this anyone even if you've never traded an option before can learn how to trade and generate income whether it's even if it's you've never done it before I honestly believe that and I've seen it all the time because that's basically the type of person that I help so let's pick an expiration date I'm going to go for August I'm going to go to sell call okay so the sell call that I'm going to do right now is basically a way to generate income if you had 100 shares of Palante here all you really need to do this is like literally the only strategy that you can use to make money is you can just sell covered calls so you can see here how currently uh pal here is at 26 okay I would say that you can sell the nearest to the money call so this is the 27 call you can see the strike price 27 and you can see here that the bid price or just the premium here is $1.78 so this $1.78 is how much you would get paid if you were to sell this call option now I think selling this call option basically will be very good because selling a call option means that you make the money right now the 178 and now you have 100 shares and you have a call option which is covered by your 100 shares so if hener moves up then you know it's okay you basically will have to sell it at 27 but that's really not that bad if you bought it for 26 you can buy it right now for 26 and sell it for 27 and you will still get this $1.78 which is $178 so you'll get paid to answerer this position and you'll get paid to basically um get rid of the stock uh in August 16 as I'm making this video video but basically just go out um between 4 to 6 or even 8 weeks out on a covered call option so this is exactly what I would do I would run covered calls on paler right now that is what I'm doing myself and it's working out very well",1.0,0.9

here here we go let's get a little Flex in on the biceps and uh little Flex in on the Apple okay and uh yeah I started taking 200 milligrams of testosterone I'm just joking I'm actually natural and I just been working really hard taking it seriously so apple look at me not being so humble on this channel guys look at me what's wrong with me I'm supposed to be more humble all right cracking myself up today self-Amusement is pretty important all right so um we have Apple Apple stock and um yeah so uh it's my favorite stock because it has the best brand okay brand brand brand brand brand even just brand is the most important things I I see I literally see stupid YouTubers who have no Financial background but they got tons of views because they know how to build a brand The favorite YouTubers that you're watching I'm not going to mention the names you're subscribed to them they literally have no experience with investing they're just very talented at speaking using teleprompters or just actually just talented at speaking there's nothing wrong with using teleprompters they don't honestly know all the time what they're talking about and not to talk trash I'm just saying brand brand brand brand brand brand brand building a big brand is what makes money okay building a brand is the most important thing when it comes to investing it's the most important thing when it comes to business it's the most important thing on YouTube creators make money even if they don't know what they're talking about as long as the audience thinks that they know what they're talking about kind of sad and drives me crazy drives me crazy I wish we can just lay out results and just go off of results who built the biggest portfolio who has experience but yeah it doesn't matter what I'm trying to say though is Apple is my top pick I can invest all my money into Apple because of brand and also help other brands that's why I'm so crazy when so passionate and fired up right now because what I actually do most of the day is I actually think about my brand what I can do as a contentcreator providing value on the internet as well as helping other brands because I started enjoying that a lot more since I got into the retirement zone I have a lot of free time so I enjoy either hitting the gym or helping business owners because I think by helping business owners I can positively contribute to the most amount of people in this world imagine if I started helping Tony Robbins I would indirectly touch so many people in the world so if I can that's basically my kind of personal goals and Mission nowadays but Apple brand Adobe brand Amazon brand alphabet brand uh JP Morgan um I already made $6,800 on this so um this option is going to expire out of the money meta brand and meta also goes along with my big bullish case scenario on social media in general I think people on social media way too much if I can go back in the day and just it was so much more simple before there was Instagram before there was meta and Facebook I miss old days even though I'm not that old I kind of wish that I was born in like 1950 or 1960 because things were just a lot more simple you go to the bar you meet people in person you do manly things masculinity and and uh just iners stuff and now everyone's sitting on the internet on their on their computers and social media testosterone is falling a lot my testosterone's pretty low by the way although I'm doing decent on the muscle Department I uh got my testosterone checked I'm 42 which is not that high know also there's total testosterone free testosterone stuff like that but kind of missed the old days and unfortunately I have a big bet on social media it's only going to continue I think obesity rates are going to continue I think social media trends are going to continue so I might as well profit from it so we got meta oh gosh it's kind of cold in this my my studio right here yeah I mean I think social media is just going to continue and uh it's going to keep keep growing so yeah by the way if you want to follow me on Instagram uh it's invest W Henry there's there's several accounts that are pretending to be me please don't get scammed guys I don't need the money I'm not going to ask you for Bitcoin so please follow my Instagram if you want my personal life and everything um that'd be cool and uh but please don't fall for any scams or anyone trying to like uh message you I'm not going to message you first I I don't message people first uh unless I think you're my future wife then maybe I'll message you first but uh that's um my you guys are more male audience here because investing topics are more for uh for men in U us we have women as well and I love educating women I love but just the facts is I think the channel is 96% male or 95 all right so anyways meta is going to keep growing and uh yeah Instagram in the description if you want to follow it Tesla all right um Elon Musk was like I think that's uh what is this cyborgs uh blanking on the the what he was saying but it's going to be like a 25 trillion opportunity he was saying the Cyber robots right I'm like I don't know about that but um even if it's one trillion that's going to that's going to benefit because I think Tesla in general is just a good stock as you can see I'm very just Tech focused on this portfolio this portfolio is so simple a dog can copy it so simple anyone can copy it because like look it's just Apple Adobe Amazon Google JP Morgan which honestly doesn't even count because it just put options we got meta got Microsoft we got Tesla and then I do have um QQQ I have 1.9 million in QQQ I just want to have a big bet so this portfolio is very stable it's very boring I don't usually pull it up and to be honest I Implement margin trading in this portfolio it's not even something I cover in my Discord Community because uh ha I'm trying to make money well I do have a big team that has to be paid so I do try to make money but I do it cuz uh I I like it the 1.9 the $1.9 million in QQQ I just just keep it simple this portfolio I use margin I don't teach margin in Discord not cuz I want to make money but because I think it's just too complex of a strategy and I think you can get into a lot of hot water like you can get into so much hot water if you try to do margin so don't use margin unless you have extensive experience trading options extensive I have a covered call which is not going that well right now at all so um I will have to roll this position up higher we're in a bull market so I have to keep rolling positions higher because well when there's a bull market covered calls are going to underperform the market so option trading is good on a long-term basis but on a short-term basis if the stock market is just up a lot then um cover calls are going to underperform so I am underperforming uncovered calls being honest with you all right so I'm underperforming and I'm going to have to uh roll this higher although uh I'm still making money just making a little bit less money than I could have because this position is going against me um but I will roll it up and I'm very confident that I will be able to easily roll it up to like 480 and out to September and I will probably do that in the next couple of weeks then we have spy sell puts that's also going very well so that is this portfolio this portfolio I use margin and I'm a bit more risky with it and to be honest I've grown it super aggressively so I've had it at like 1.8 million now it's at 2.6 so that is like 40% or more this year on this portfolio it's a good year and I'm being pretty aggressive as uh I feel like I'm able to take the risk and handle the volatility not always Pleasant to handle volatility but that's that and then uh the Robin Hood portfolio as you guys know you guys watch the videos if you're not subscribed you got to subscribe you got to subscribe I uh would love to have a million subscribers I don't think that's going to happen ever because that's a lot that's a lot but um yeah if you subscribe I'd be very happy and appreciative if you're ever in my city always happy to grab coffee um I pretty much always do that so if you ever want to message me on Instagram I do respond to all the messages cuz I have time and uh I like my audience a lot love you guys so yeah uh this portfolio I have apple meta uh Nvidia and Nvidia is going to be really really really interesting because um I thought I was in big trouble with this position but it turns out that Nvidia is under 130 so these call Credit spreads are going to go well these calls are going to go go very well and it's in the last day I wait until the very last day which is pretty insane it just shows you that patience is super super important okay have patience um patience is very very important all right uh we're going to look at some other stocks that I hold uh I did get a signed to sauna today here's my

Now one of my other top plays is American Airlines this is a much cheaper play specifically because American Airlines is about $14 per share now this is my top play in my Discord but right now I'm a little bit upset cuz as I'm making this video I'm literally like 2 hours too late because the stock is skyrocketing I have shares I have covered call I have sold a put option but it's a little bit frustrating to see the stock up because basically when a stock goes up the put option premium goes down they become it becomes less valuable because you know as the stock goes up it's becoming further out of the money so right now what we're going to do is we're going to go a little bit riskier I'm going to show you a little bit shorter term of a trade I'm going to go for the 14 and a half again my goal is to actually get assigned I do want to get assigned if I don't get assigned that's fine I collect income if I do get assigned that's also fine with me because I still get to collect the income but now I have the shares and I can run something called The Wheel strategy which we will cover later on or you know check out my channel for the wheel strategy this is a very powerful strategy so I'm going to go for selling a put option right now I'm going to go for since this is very cheap I'm going to go for 20 contracts here okay so I'm going to go for just $17 per contract and this is hopefully going to get filled for me since I did go towards the bid price there you go I got filled so I made a dollar so we're going to add that to the bottom of how much money I have made so that is the second trade which is going to be American Airlines by the way the reason why I like American Airlines so much I didn't show you the technical analysis I've been trading this since I started my program back in 2021 so it's been 3 years since I've been running Discord and I have been literally trading American Airlines since the very beginning it's because American Airlines has some of the most consistent Returns the stock doesn't actually move up or down a whole lot so over the past one year you can see how it actually started at 1402 now it's at 1461 so over a whole year period it has gone nowhere it's still at exactly where it has been which means that there's a lot of volatility but really no Direction so when there's no direction that makes a perfect it for selling options in general because options love all ility and when you're selling options you hope that there isn't any big big moves typically so this is a very profitable strategy that I've been running from the very beginning and the reason why is because right here we're right in the middle of exactly what American Airlines has been historically valued at so it's unlikely to get a whole lot cheaper it's also unlikely to get a whole lot more expensive so selling options on American Airlines is my top play right now that's why I decided to just sell 20 20 contracts now I do have some more contracts actually in my portfolio I have 35 contracts 30 more contracts here so keep in mind I do already have some of this position now we have done Google we have done American Airlines.,1.0,0.9

low right now and you don't think it's going to go much lower in the next 30 days so what you want to do is you want to sell a put option contract on it You picked the strike of $45 which means if Microsoft does happen to fall below 405 you have to be comfortable to buy 100 shares at that price but you won't mind that because you think Microsoft is going to be going up you love Microsoft long term you think that it's at a pretty good low so you will be happy to buy it at 405 it's currently at 410 so you're going to get paid to buy it for $5 cheaper than where the market is at right now seems pretty much like crazy right like why would someone do this well someone else out there in the world thinks that the stock might go down a lot lower they may be right or they may be wrong either way you are happy making this strategy in this trade and let's open up Robin Hood and see what I would actually get paid if I decided to sell the put option so let's pick a strike price of 405 all right so I'm going to go to trade options as I usually do trade options and then I will go for something very short term so I'm going to go very short term here we'll go actually to you know we'll give it a little bit of time so let's just go to the end of the month which is just a couple of weeks so if I go to to 405 right here you will see that the premium collected is $480 or $480 so right here I can actually make a 1% return now I know this is 1% because I'm putting up 405 and then 1% of 405 is going to be about $45 so this actually over 1% return I'm getting paid over 1% in under 30 days to buy a stock that is going to be a very good buy at 405 in fact this is actually under 30 days if I were to go to about 30 days I would be a lot closer to actually almost 2% so you can see right here that uh it's actually $75 so if I were to execute this option one contract here would give me about $75 actually you will see here that I was actually on buy a put option but I need to be on sell so actually the price will be a little bit different it's going to be $615 which is still amazing I noticed that because I saw there was a Max profit and that was a bit weird and and this strategy actually has a max loss although the max loss here will look extremely scary you might be thinking just oh my goodness why would you ever collect $615 with the max loss of 39,000 this Max loss is actually you know it's not really correct in theory it is correct but what it means is if Microsoft went down to zero you would lose $39,000 you know I don't know about you but Microsoft is not going to go down to zero I think the world has to literally end for the stock to fall that much there is no way a company decides of Microsoft will go bankrupt there's actually almost no way the stock will even fall 50% yet alone in most years it doesn't even fall 10% or it doesn't even fall at all the stock is rising right so although the max loss is very scary this is the equivalent of you getting into your car and the max loss says well you may not live today so you know yes that's scary but most people still have to drive to work we still have life to live and we still take that very very small risk to go into a car every single day it's the same thing here so it has a very big Max loss but you know in all reality this is a very very safe trade that I've been doing for the past 10 years you know I've you know worked for Goldman Sachs as well as a couple other hedge funds I have a degree in this I've sat with many experts on this I've talked to many financial advisers I've talked to hedge fund managers this is a very standard easy strategy that basically every single person in the world does I've seen billionaire portfolios as well this is just a typical strategy that they are using so basically let's do some scenario analysis if Microsoft goes up to say 420 you're totally safe you're going to be making money if Microsoft goes up to anything really if it goes up at all you're going to be making making money if Microsoft actually goes down a little bit towards 405 you're still actually going to make money as long as Microsoft stays above now at 405 if Microsoft were to hit 405 you would now be in assignment territory meaning that you will get assigned at expiration if it's in the money however you still made a gain because you are collecting $6.5 here okay so we have 615 so really if it's at 405 you're good if it's at 404 you lose a dollar but you still collected 615 so you are still positive 515 in fact your break even here would have to go 405 minus the premium that you collect so the break even here would be$ 3.99 or actually 39885 I'm doing the math in my head so at 39885 that's your break even Point okay you will be buying Microsoft at 405 or below but at 39885 that's actually your break even so if it goes lower than that you will be at a slight loss even considering the premium that you collected which is totally okay because you may deem to yourself that I want to buy Microsoft I'm very happy and by the way this is the truth this is not just an example this is exactly a trade that I would make and as you'll see shortly I'll make trades that look very similar to this so you know if Microsoft goes down past 405 you'll have to buy 100 shares of Microsoft but it's not even that bad because you want to own the stock anyways.",1.0,0.9

(Selling put options for beginners),Google,"the first thing that I want to do is I want to look at Google Google is one of my favorite stocks I'm very bullish on Google Now in the past 3 months the stock to go up about 15% I am going to be looking at technical analysis as well I'm going to be showing you what I'm looking for Technically when I am placing a trade like at what strike do I pick it why and all that whole process so this is going to be like the most valuable thing that you can see cuz I've been doing this for 10 years it's exactly how I make my decisions so if I go to Google I go to charts you can see right here I'm going to get rid of these quick lines these were drawn so if you can see right here actually the stock has gone up I'm using something called the Binger band as well as the moving average both of these are very important for me and I like to look at the six-month view so here you can see that Google is basically at the more higher end of its range it did have an overreaction here and had a pullback however you can see that the Ballinger band right at the middle is 161 now the RSI is not very high but it's also not very low it's at 63 which is a little bit higher than average so this is actually a perfect candidate for selling a put option not that it's perfect for selling a put option because it's a little bit higher but it's perfect because I don't know when Google's going to pull back and if I want to invest in Google today selling a put option is much better because I'm getting a cheaper price than what the stock is at currently Stock's at 168 as I'm making this video I'm going to sell a put option that is going to be towards the middle of the bowling band of 1611 62 so I'm just going to go for 162 and2 now I am going to pick an expiration day that's going to go out at least 30 days this strategy is a little bit more boring it's a little bit more chill it's a you know a bit more relaxed of a strategy the whole goal was just to collect some income be hands off and be very passive with it as well as safe so I'm going to go for June 21 this going to be about you know 5 6 weeks from today making this video I'm go to sell put and I am going to sell a put option for the 162 so I don't want to be too heavy on my exposure so I'm going to probably go for contract size of about five so I'm going to risk quite a bit here and I'm going to collect ,500 here on this trade I'm going to go for a bid price of 305 now I will be honest with you I could put in 3.1 I can start playing around and waiting but for time purposes I want to be very efficient with this video I want to respect your time I'm just going to go for 305 but if you want to make some extra money you can play around with the bid ask I could have asked for 310 and I may have actually gotten filled for 310 so that's kind of up to you so so far we've made uh $1,525 so far by selling a put option on Google.",1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,eXTscWLM2Xs,2024-05-23T23:37:45Z,Buying Call Options Explained Simple,Nvidia,"we're going to be talking about Nvidia in this video because Nvidia specifically has very strong momentum when a stock is moving up is actually a very good idea to buy a call option the reason why it's good to buy a call option versus buying shares is a call option gives you huge leverage so you can make a lot of money quickly on a call option by putting up very little money into it versus having to buy 100 shares if you buy a 100 shares of Nvidia you're going to have to pay $95,000 now most people don't just have $95,000 laying around however in many scenarios and if you look at the option premium it's only 10 bucks to control 100 shares of Invidia stock so you can literally pay $1,000 instead of $95,000 to get the same benefit that's okay as long as Nvidia goes up in this example okay so starting off you're going to be down $10 okay and if you buy the 950 strike okay that's why I have 950 right here we're going to use the strike price of 9 50 okay what you want to happen is you want Nvidia to go up in value you want the stock to rise so if the stock Rises then you're going to be profiting with the stock however the option is actually going to profit a lot more I'm going to show you some different scenarios what's going to happen to the call option if you are buying the call option so see how this right here you lost $10 no matter what happens as long as Nvidia is below 950 so when the stock is below 950 your call option can can't be exercised you can't really do anything with it it's worthless because it's out of the money or otm out of the money okay but once it goes to 950 it quickly starts to increase in value it starts to make money okay so as Nvidia goes up then the price of this option also goes up and it's going to specifically break even right here now this break even point right here is going to be 960 that's because your strike price is 950 you pay $10 and $950 + $10 is going to be 960 all right so this right here is going to be 960 all right so that's when your break even points is but now you have unlimited upside okay with a call option you have unlimited upside it keeps increasing in value as much as the stock goes up okay but again you have a really big leverage Factor I'm going to give you different scenarios of how much money you can make here okay so specifically if Nvidia goes to 970 okay if it goes to 970 then you will have a profit of 970 minus 950 okay you have a profit of $20 but you've paid $10 okay because you've paid $10 and you now have a profit of 20 you have actually doubled your money you went from $10 to $20 in profit so you have a double when the stock just basically moved up by you know just a couple percentage points so a 2% move or a 3% % move sometimes in a stock can give you a one or two times return on your money now if Nvidia were to go to a th000 and we know that this is possible okay Nvidia has very strong momentum this stock actually has earnings in the near future or you can also use this example on any stock so taking a look at Nvidia this is a high momentum stock you want to pick a stock that's actually near its 52 we high this might sound crazy to you but a stock that keeps going up is likely to continue going up which is why that could be a really good candidate for buying call options now specifically if Nvidia goes to $1,000 then this is going to be very interesting because now you made $1,000 okay our strike price again is $950 all right $950 so we have made $50 while we've only invested 10 so you can take a $10 investment into $50 or five extra money and that can happen in four or five days if you play this during earnings and for example let's just say right now that that Nvidia you bought the call option let's say it's a twoe call option okay on a non- earnings event all right so two weeks call option and this stock is you know it was it was trending somewhere around 950 but then that stock is somewhere around you know 925 okay if the Stock's at 925 your chances of going to 950 are going to be Slimmer and Slimmer as time goes on you see you don't want to hold call options if you don't think a stock is going up if you don't think a stock is going up it's showing negative signs it's really going sideways you do not want to hold a call option because every day that you hold a call option it's actually losing value okay you're losing value the reason why you're losing value is options have something called Theta or time Decay okay option buying can be risky because Theta in time Decay works against you okay every single day these options are losing in value okay so if it's not near 950 then it's losing a lot more value that data is going to be a lot higher okay the Theta is going to be high it's going to be kicking in now Theta can also be high at the money okay specifically when it's at the money and expiration is approaching it will also be very high but if there's 2 weeks left okay 2 weeks it's at 925 this option has lost 20 or 30% of its value you don't think it's going to go to 950 or higher then it can be very smart move just cut this position and take a loss okay I will prefer taking a loss of 30 40 or even 50% is okay as long as you don't take a full 100% loss because when you take a 100% loss it is very difficult to recoup your money again this strategy can give you a return of two 5x I've seen the strategy return 10x I mean we've seen stocks that have popped up so much specifically Nvidia had you bought it like a few months ago when it was at $600 you bought a $700 call you would probably be up 50x 100x when a stock has so much momentum like in Nvidia that's when you can make real money by buying call options",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,5DZt854EMXk,2023-09-23T17:07:31Z,Covered Strangle Option Strategy,Palantir,"hey guys what's going on it's Henry and in this video I want to show you a strategy that I'm utilizing on paler stock this is going to be called a covered strangle strategy and it's really fantastic for small portfolios it's also really good for medium and large size portfolios as well you currently see that there's a palen here 16 and 14 and a 12 strangle okay so let me like kind of draw this for you right now paler is sitting at $15.15 okay so as long as paler is in the middle of the strangle that's really good but even if paler goes outside of this strangle it's still completely fine okay let me explain first of all what I'm betting on palen here is that I think it's going to go sideways if it goes up a bit that's perfectly fine and also if it goes down a bit that's also perfectly fine I decided that I wanted to use a strangle on palen here because it is fairly range bound like if I go into Yahoo finance and I show you what the chart looks like because obviously technical analysis is really important you guys already know in a recent video that I launched technical analysis boot camp that's also in the description below um you can schedule a call there and basically technical analysis is how I select my strike prices a lot of people are confused how do I get into um the proper strike how do I enter a stock well you know if you go to chart right here I'm going to show you a very simplified version sometimes I'll use candlesticks I'll see if a stock has broken out above a certain range and then it you know typically does Gap down so I'll just take a look at the candlesticks but then I'll also just you know simply look at a line right this uh line chart right here we'll show you the price action of a company okay how it's been moving in in its history and I'm taking a very close look at bowling her bands because again Binger band is one of the most important things that you can really look at Binger band tells you the tendency the central tendency of where a stock is like to trade within so let me explain if you're you know obviously 5' 10 your s's going to be about 5' 10 that's how exactly the Binger band works so right now palen here is in the middle of its bowling band as you can see on the bottom side of the bowling band it's at 1427 in the top top is 1621 so I expect paler to stay within this band now it could exit this band but that would be unusual there would have to be some you know earnings event or some bad news or some really good news either way I think that the stock is going to trade sideways because well for about 3 weeks now it's been trading sideways and if you're watching this in the future you can always just copy and paste the logic that I have that I'm teaching you in this video and you can paste it for any other stock or any other time period in the future when you're watching this but as you can see actually there seems to be a really good base um at like $15 and like literally 25 where the stock is literally at right now ever since paler really had this dip in August um on some really heavy volume like you can see right here there's some pretty heavy volume 3 days of uh you know really massive selling just really big volume so you know I guess a lot of people that were longtime Bulls may have uh cashed out for whatever reason they may have cashed out for a gain or loss maybe they have lost confidence but they ended up you know basically cutting paler stock and now it's still around uh you know $15 so you know I would be really surprised to see a drop below $14 per share I I think that the stock has crazy support but also I don't think it's going to break out Beyond 1633 so that's where the coverage triangle strategy um comes into place I already have shares of Palance here I have 400 shares it makes up about uh 69% of my portfolio so I don't have a massively crazy positional pance here right now I probably could I could probably increase this position quite a bit but one of my risk management rules is I don't really like more than 5% of my portfolio in anyone's stock of course I'm breaking those rules with apple but then again you know if I take a look at Apple it's a huge Diversified company just a great overall stock so I I love Apple in many ways and that's why I'm I'm ready to break some rules plus I also consider Apple more like an ETF it's such a big company and it also makes up so much percentage wise of S&amp;P 500 as well as triple Q so I'll break some rules for um Apple but um for my paler position I can actually increase it quite a bit and I probably will and uh something that you guys will notice right now is that my average cost on pal here is actually $15 and that's because I ended up selling a put option I sold a put option I got a signed so it's not a bad thing people think that getting ass signed is like really bad it's not it's perfectly fine I like pal here at $15 per share so I got it signed and my average cost is 15 and I'm actually already up on the stock itself so I'm up you know $56 and then I'm up just a little bit on the coverage strangle strategy here so essentially to run the coverage strangle strategy you're going to want to have 100 shares of the cuz it's kind of very similar to uh a covered call okay this might be a little bit confusing but I promise it's not that bad a coverage triangle is just your selling a covered call and you're selling a put option okay now why would you do that well let's say that I have pounds here at $15 per share so I ended up doing a $16 covered call so if it goes from 15 to 16 then I get $100 okay because from 15 to 16 I get a profit plus I'm collecting some premium so I collected some premium and I'm benefiting from 15 to 16 now if the stock Falls from 15 to 14 1/2 okay cuz that's my put option right here you see if it falls to 14 1/2 that's also not really a bad thing because um at 14 and a half I'm ready to buy more of this stock and if I end up buying more of it uh for four contracts here I sold four contracts and I also have 400 shares I'm actually going to be dollar cost lowering okay so what that means is I have a 15 average cost okay 400 shares now if I buy 400 more shares at 14.5 I have all of a sudden 400 shares at 15 400 shares at 14 and a half it's actually going to meet in the middle and my average cost will now be $14.75 so now $14.75 would actually reduce my average cost plus only one of these can happen okay either 16 happens or 14 and a half happens both cannot happen it's called a mutually exclusive event if it goes to 14 A2 totally fine I'm reducing my average cost I still get the premium from selling the put and I get the premium from a covered call now in the other scenario if it goes up okay I'll sell it at $16 but I get premium at the 16 covered call and I sold a put option so I'm getting the premium from a 14 1 12 put option so I'm I'm basically making money now I basically want to show you what this visually looks like I'm going toh go ahead and open a position like this again step number one you need to buy 100 shares of a certain stock could be pal here maybe it's Tesla maybe it's another stock that you really like okay so you obviously want to like this stock because this is a bullish strategy bu strategy meaning that uh you benefit if the stock Rises but this is a fairly neutral strategy as well because if it just goes sideways you're just collecting premium on both sides okay this is basically covered calls and selling puts on steroids all right I guess this is why this is one of my favorite strategies that I've been utilizing for a long time it just never really showed up in Robin Hood actually let me just show you real fast it usually doesn't show up in Robin Hood as a uh strangle or coverage strangle because I'm usually opening it up separately so Robin Hood doesn't realize that it's a coverage strangle for example if I go to let's just say apple I have apple 175 put right here and then you can see I have another covered call right here so I'm pretty much already running this strategy in a lot of my portfolio but it doesn't seem that way again because I'm not opening it up in one trade if I was opening it up in one trade then it's going to be realized as a two option strategy so you see here it says paler two option strategy so let me click into this right now actually let me go back to paler let me open up this position from scratch you have 100 shares of the stock you would go to trade paler options first thing that you would do is you would sell a covered call so I'm going to go to uh sell call option then I'm going to pick an expiration date uh I'm going to go 30 days out there's nothing wrong with 30 days I I like weekly trading I like you know trading every two weeks I also like trading every four weeks and the analogy I give is would you rather make $1,000 per week or $4,000 per month well of course they're the same thing right it's an equivalent right so it doesn't really matter and I like 30-day trading cu the Theta DK the DK that this option is going down is still really fast and you have to do less work and it's just really simple and it's really easy and it allows you to work on the other areas of your life and not have to be a full-time Trader cuz I'm definitely not a full-time Trader I want to make this as consistent passive safe you know and steady as possible and I want to do it every single month I don't necessarily want to day trade or anything like that but I do swing trade a little bit I you know either I use options fight to get some ideas or I'll look at candlesticks or I'll look at some technical analysis sometimes I'll make some swing trades but for the most part I am more like a weekly Trader to a monthly Trader okay so let's just go for monthly though here just for Simplicity 30 days out you know let's just say I have 100 shares at $15 or even 154 okay what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell a 15.5 covered call and then that's it I've sold a covered call and now I'm also going to sell a put option okay so say my average cost is 15 or or even 1514 doesn't really matter I'm going to go ahead and now sell a put option so I'm going to go sell a 14 1 12 put option and what you'll notice right now is uh you know Robin Hood is still thinking this is a custom order but this is already called a strangle so a strangle looks like this basically you've probably seen this before it's just a interesting strategy where you're gaining a lot of the money um if the stock stands still and then if it uh you know has volatility to either side you end up losing money however with a covered strangle this is just a strangle uh you really can't do a strangle like this because it it involves unlimited risk and that's why it says Max loss unlimited because it's a short call option so if it's not covered you don't have the shares in theory on the call side it could go up unlimited amounts and you could end up losing money which is why I wouldn't open this position in it of itself what I would do is I would buy 100 shares and then I would open up this position Robin Hood doesn't realize or right now it's not showing that I have 100 shares so in the chart that's not going to be reflected but take my word or call your broker obviously have a conversation with them if you uh you know want advice because I'm not a financial adviser but you know what's going to happen is you have 100 shares and then you sell a covered strangle it's going to be covered because of the shares that you have the 100 shares so it's not going to be an unlimited loss you're basically just collecting $134 from this type of position which is a really high amount because the amount that I'm investing for 100 shares is about $1,500 so this is a very high return $134 now if the stock goes up okay you will lose your shares yes you can close the position yourself you can just close one side of the position to close out the covered call and then you wouldn't lose your shares then you would just have some shares and then you would have a put option that's fine but in most scenarios what I would do is I would just treat this as a standalone position and uh you know if it goes really high up you can close it but I probably wouldn't I would just leave it alone of course some brokerage accounts though you have to be careful they may treat this as a stand loan position so you definitely want to talk to your broker about that because if this position goes up they may decide to close out just the strangle and not the share so that could be I don't want to say dangerous because yes you would lose money on the strangle but you made a lot of money on the stock itself so it really kind of depends how you look at it and um overall I think this is a really good strategy as you can see I'm not making like crazy amounts of money on this but again I'm not tying up a lot of capital so if I wanted to um increase the amount of capital that I'm investing with then this would be worth quite a lot of money and that's what I've been doing on Apple stock and right here on Palante here I'm up $16 so far and I just opened up this position on the 18th it's been 2 days so I mean not bad $8 a day for a very small amount of money I'm very happy with the strategy and I've been running it for a long time so if you want to follow all my trades then go ahead and click the

apple but then again you know if I take a look at Apple it's a huge Diversified company just a great overall stock so I I love Apple in many ways and that's why I'm I'm ready to break some rules plus I also consider Apple more like an ETF it's such a big company and it also makes up so much percentage wise of S&amp;P 500 as well as triple Q so I'll break some rules for um Apple but um for my paler

Invest with Henry,b6lncrmvMWM,2024-06-14T21:11:10Z,10X Your Money Using These CHEAP Option Trading Strategy,Palantir Technologies,"we're going to be using paler as an example paler Technologies is a really good long-term bullish stock but if I go to the 3-month Chart this stock has honestly not gone anywhere now I do have 5 ,000 shares which is 5% of my folio I'm up $10,000 on the stock itself as well as I'm playing several different options here but the most important thing that you need to realize is that paler is going up it's going down but in the short term it's not really doing a whole lot so the first strategy that I want to show you is going to capitalize on a stock moving sideways it's also able to capitalize if a stock is range bound so here is the first strategy on palen here I'm going to be picking an option that's going to expire not that far into the future I picked July 5th but if you're watching this video in the future it really doesn't matter as you can copy and past the same logic and run the same strategy to make money over and over again so I'm going to get rid of the selections that I have right now I'm just going to show you how this position would look like if I were to open this position from absolute scratch so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to start by selling a call option so this call option is going to be very important because this call option right here is telling me where I think the peak is going to be now I said that I'm slightly bullish on Palante here in the short term in the long term I am bullish but because this option is going to expire in just 22 days as I'm making this video this would be a shortterm play so I'm going to sell a call option at 24 that's because I think Palance here can go up just a little bit but in the the short term probably not that much and because it's probably not going to go up that much and as we just saw on the chart the stock is absolutely just moving sideways in the past 3 months it hasn't made much money I'm going to be selling the 24 call option so this call option right here if you will notice has pretty good volume volume is very important in general when you are trading options because if there is no volume you won't be able to get filled on a position and if you do get filled pay attention right here to this bid and ask this is called a bid and ask spread the difference here is 5 cents that's pretty good because you want to look for an option that has a very tight spread otherwise you're going to be losing money in fact as you can see here the Mark is 825 which is actually the Middle Point here of the bid and ask so if you want to get executed on a trade you're probably not going to you know be able to buy it for the bid price here which is8 you're also not going to be able to sell it for 085 but anyways let's go on with the strategy I just wanted you to understand on a deep level how this actually works so I'm going to sell the 24 and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy a different option right now so I'm actually going to go down by one okay so I ended up selling the 24 now I'm going to buy the 23 all right but I'm also going to go up higher than the 24 and I'm going to buy the 25 so the only thing that needs to be changed now is that I'm going to create a custom order and if you're using a different brokerage doesn't really matter what you want to pay attention to is you want to have an equal amount of sells for each buy so by having an equal amount of sells for each buy this is going to be a balance strategy where as you can see here I can basically risk $10 and make $90 so and you know this is just an example you may want to do this on a different stock but in this example I can literally 10x my money I can literally turn $10 into $90 or 100 I'm spending 10 but my 10 can turn into a00 so this is a really good strategy and this is a strategy that I do run from time to time and I will be honest with you that there are risks to this strategy however the returns are just absolutely ridiculous and you do have a lot of control with this strategy specifically as I mentioned if a stock is moving sideways this is exactly when you want to execute and run this strategy now in terms of actually managing this strategy and closing it for a profit you want to pay attention to the momentum all right so that's the first thing and another trick is you want to determine if a stock is moving sideways you can look for several key factors in its price action and also also use various technical analysis tools like flats or horizontal trend line listen you need to identify clear levels of support when you're running this strategy you want to look for support where the price tends to stop falling and resistance where the price tends to stop rising in a sideways Market the price will frequently bounce between these two levels so once you have the pattern down you can select the strike prices for this strategy here you can see that the break even is going to be 2310 on the downside and on the upper side it's going to be 2490 so if I show you palen here on a chart right now you're going to notice several things so I'm going to go to the charting feature here of Yahoo finance you're welcome to chart any way that you wish as long as you're using something called the bowling or band I typically use a period of 20 days and that is going to cover an entire month all right the standard deviation that I use is going to to be two so you can see right here how palen here is actually having a current wide binker band but if I go to the one month chart right here you will see that the top of the Bullinger band is 2406 so if I go back uh the option position that we have right here that Binger band is capturing okay the top end here so we don't think that the stock is going to move too much higher and that's because you can already see the pound here has already moved higher in the past 1 month the stock was roughly $22.94 and now it's all the way up towards $24 so we don't think it's going to rise that much more because it's already seen a decent rise you can also notice here the RSI is 62 so you can already know that Palante here is towards the top of its range but I'm actually bullish on it I am not worried about the bottom of its range I think paler will rise a little bit and given that expectation I'm planning to make a lot of money by pounder just slightly going up now listen you do not need to hold this position until expiration so many people think they have to hold options until expiration the thing is you should be holding simple options to expiration if you're an option seller which is what I mainly talk about on this channel in my other videos but for this strategy specifically you do not want to hold it until expiration because it's very hard to actually wait until the last day since the stock will bounce around you're almost never going to see the full expected profit however if you're in this range right here what you can do is you can take profit any time uh specifically if it's been like a week and the stock has gone up just a little bit this position can you know go from let's say the $10 that you spend up to $30 and if you can see a 3X return like that from 10 to 30 then it does make sense to close out this position in a week because essentially you've 3x your money in one week even if you see a you know two we period and you have a 3X return that's still phenomenal basically you want to set your exit point to where you are happy with the stock if the stock stock is just staying where it's at that's actually going to be a good thing because this strategy right here does profit from time going on while the stock moves sideways is going to increase in value every single day now look you can also play around with this just a little bit so for example if I take 25 away and I go 25.5 you can now see how you can actually have a very different return here however you can protect your downside so as you can see a small little change here now gives me the opportunity to basically protect protect my downside let's say you're a little bit bearish and if the stock goes up you will start to lose money however you're not really going to lose money unless it goes beyond 25 this strategy also has a little bit of an advantage because now you can make a bit more money at the very Peak you can make $105 so if you're very sure that it's going to end at 24 this strategy will be slightly more profitable now I also want to show you a different strategy here it's going to be very similar this bearish strategy right here is also a very interesting one and you know you might not want to use it on Palance here but you might want to use it on a stock that you are bearish on so this strategy right here is much better than just buying a put option because as you can see if you just slightly bearish you can get a huge return here at $79 by just risking $21 so this is basically a 4X return also in 3 weeks so 3 to 4X Returns on both of these strategy now let me show you how to open up this strategy I'm going to get rid of the 24 here and the 22 1/2 and I'm going to go back to selling L the 23 so check this out I'm going to sell the 23 put option now with this strategy it's very similar to the other strategy except we're using puts right now okay you don't want to just sell a put option that's going to be very expensive you can see here the maximum loss is very very large of course this would assume that the stock would fall down to zero but still the maximum collateral you need here is very big and I'm going to buy just a little bit lower okay I'm going to go down by 0.5 but on the upside for buying a put I'm going to go a little bit higher instead of I'm going to go up by two so now you'll notice that this is a very you know bearish position however I don't want to necessarily risk $77 that's kind of you know it's not high but again I'm showing you cheap option strategies to make a lot of money so given the cheap option strategies I'm going to go here and create another custom ratio and just like the last strategy I want an even amount of sells for each buy okay now I'm getting a much lower price of course I can't make $2,000 but in the previous example that you just saw you're not going to do that anyways unless the stock goes down to zero instead let's be more realistic being more realistic means that the stock just might fall like 2% 3% so if the stock fell down by 3% it would basically be a $23 stock and lo and behold right here your maximum price or the maximum benefit that you get the expected profit here will be $79 by just risking $21 and this assumes basically if the stock fell down by 3.36% you can see it on the screen right there if it fell down by just 3% which is very realistic right on a stock that's let's say you're kind of slightly bearish on a high quality stock right stocks don't typically just crash 15 or 20% for no reason right but a stock can easily just fall down 3% if you're slightly bearish on it in a 3-week period so here you can literally forx your money and again you do not necessarily want to hold this position until expiration because if you hold the position till expiration you end up waiting a lot longer when you can actually just do the strategy multiple times within the same period but at the same time I don't like doing very shortterm trading cuz if I go for one day or 8 days that really gives me no time for the stock to have any significant move so what I like to do with the strategy is I like to open the strategy for 3 week or four weeks out potentially even five or six weeks but I close out the position once it's 3 weeks in this position can be hard to manage because well for example here we do have four option leg and because we have four option legs it can be a bit more difficult to close out the position since you are dealing with multiple options which each have a bid and ask spread so that's also why I said in the beginning of this video it's so important for you to look at an option that has good volume okay here this is pretty good volume because it's 759 but the bit ask spread here is not as good as it can be so you might want to look for a tighter bit ask spread which you know let's go into our next example where we might even talk about you know scalping right now is going to be Nvidia now for NVIDIA I become a bull on Nvidia this stock is rising nothing can really stop it I am pretty bullish on Nvidia and I've started making pretty good money on Nvidia stock however let's just pretend for an example that Nvidia has already gone up so much in fact in the past year it's gone up 218% so let's just say that you think that the stock can stall like it's not going to go up too much in the short term so look here's actually a shorter term super cheap strategy that you can run okay I'm going to look at the June 14 right now this is going to be a zero days expiration trade or a zero DTE trade and this one specifically I'm going to show you what an iron Condor can do for you especially given a sideways Market an iron Condor can actually give you really steady income on a weekly basis or even on a daily basis and this strategy will also benefit if a stock basically moves sideways so here's what you can do okay you're going to start off by going down a bit so let's say in the next one day we don't think that NV video will go below 123 okay let's just say for whatever reason we determined that 123 is going to be a daily support okay so I'm going to go for 123 and sell a put option at 123 but now what I want to do is I'm also buy a put option okay so the first one you sell and the second one I'm going to buy and I'm going to create a $1 difference all right so the $1 difference here I'm going to go from 78 and collecting and then I'm going to create a $1 difference and I'm going to pay 65 all right so this right here it's currently showing you like a win of 25 and 75 not sure if it's 100% accurate given there's going to be a little bit of difference because of the bid ask spread okay but you know for this example we're just not going to consider the bidas spread too heavily anymore now what I want to do is I've sold a put credit spread now this is a put credit spread all right this is a betting that the stock will stay above but now I also want to sell some call options and collect money on both sides okay now to open up an iron Condor now you need to sell the call side of things okay we just did the puts okay you can see right here that I sold sold a 123 put and then I bought a 122 put now what I want to do is I want to sell a call option so I'm going to sell something let's say for example we don't think it's going to go up too much more because it's already kind of skyrocketed in price and let's say you know for the day we think it's going to be fairly flat so what you can do is you can sell a 129 right now okay and then you would just go up by $1 for 129 to 130 on the strike price all right difference here is not that much however you can see now that this position here would give you a pretty good return like a more than 50% return in a single day so this option would expire in the same day Zero DTE basically or the next day so 24-hour period and as long as the stock stays within this range you're going to realize a profit now this stock or this option strategy can be kind of difficult for managing okay so if it goes beyond your range here so if Nvidia goes up past like 130 you basically want to close out this trade okay because you don't want to realize the full loss on this trade and losses are very serious okay CU when you lose money it can be very difficult to make it back so I always like to have correct position sizing I never put too much money into one single trade and I like to have a diversity of high quality stocks and I'm always running safe option strategies now this strategy right here is as safe as it gets for the level of risk that you're taking because the return here is absolutely astronomically high right so given the high return this is going to be a bit higher or a lot higher on the risk and the way you want to manage this position is you want Nvidia to stay within this green zone if Nvidia just stays within the Zone this is where you're going to experience the biggest amount of returns and as time hits which is basically every hour since this option is expiring so short term you're going to be making money on an hourly basis okay every single hour you may make a dollar I don't know 75 not something High because obviously you know our maximum profit here is $39 but Tech technically if this option stays within this range and it expires then you've made $39 in 24hour Period so you've made over $1 hour depending if you want to count the hours the market is closed or if you count let's say8 hours of the market being open then you're basically making $5 per hour on this option position which is pretty good considering you can open up multiple contracts here so if I click continue and let's say for example I wanted to open up a position of 25 basically this would be $975 in a single day now yes the risk is higher but the reward is also very very juicy because you're only risking $1,500 and if you have a bigger portfolio then this is very easy amount to risk if you have a small portfolio then you're probably not going to want to risk too much on any one single position you're going to want to diversify and have multiple positions open so you can use these strategies you can also check out options FY options fi is a website that I personally like to use I have contributed to it and I have worked for this company I really like what they're doing with their AI engine and they give you different

Invest with Henry,b6lncrmvMWM,2024-06-14T21:11:10Z,10X Your Money Using These CHEAP Option Trading Strategy,Yahoo Finance,"if I show you palen here on a chart right now you're going to notice several things so I'm going to go to the charting feature here of Yahoo finance you're welcome to chart any way that you wish as long as you're using something called the bowling or band I typically use a period of 20 days and that is going to cover an entire month all right the standard deviation that I use is going to to be two so you can see right here how palen here is actually having a current wide binker band but if I go to the one month chart right here you will see that the top of the Bullinger band is 2406 so if I go back uh the option position that we have right here that Binger band is capturing okay the top end here so we don't think that the stock is going to move too much higher and that's because you can already see the pound here has already moved higher in the past 1 month the stock was roughly $22.94 and now it's all the way up towards $24 so we don't think it's going to rise that much more because it's already seen a decent rise you can also notice here the RSI is 62

Invest with Henry,1eHUjwOEqkk,2024-06-12T15:25:30Z,Top 5 Stocks I'm Buying Right Now for HUGE Growth,Adobe,number one Adobe among the list of stocks I watch and evaluate Adobe stands out significantly as an undervalued stock for multiple reasons while I typically focus on high growth stocks if you're investing this channel that usually don't pay any dividends Adobe is a dividend growth stock that has a tremendous potential for upside especially given the pullback just look at the chart I can't ignore adobe's potential with its strong recurring revenue and its brand since AI started dominating discussions in 2022 many investors have overlooked Adobe however I believe this has created an excellent opportunity for Savvy investors like us let me explain why I'm bullsh on Adobe first of all Adobe is benefiting from strengthening and generative AI capabilities the solid momentum of its family of creative generative AI models Firefly is a major positive in order to deliver enhanced experiences to various Enterprises and customers the company is constantly making efforts to bolster his generative AI backed offerings given I have Palante here and Nvidia on this list you can tell I am bullish on AI in general the stock started the year at $580 per share and now is down more than $100 since the start of the year I bought most of my shares in Adobe in early 2022 at the time I admired its robust Revenue growth pricing power and the stickiness of its cloud-based subscriptions however I sold many of my shares as a stock row higher and higher as I saw it growth was cooling off and management didn't seem to have a clear plan for the future planning is very important given no plan I couldn't justify Adobe price to earnings valuation but now I see more potential in Adobe and I started to buy shares especially as it's pulling back and because I use the services myself and I see many other businesses are going to Adobe the Topline revenue is super consistent and continues to grow,0.95,0.8
Invest with Henry,1eHUjwOEqkk,2024-06-12T15:25:30Z,Top 5 Stocks I'm Buying Right Now for HUGE Growth,Nvidia,"now second stock is NVIDIA given its 10 to1 split I think this stock will see a rise in demand Nvidia has been a big beneficiary since it designs the chips used to train many large language models the foundation of generative AI I personally like to prioritize companies with competitive advantages it's also important to invest in growth companies that possess a strong competitive Advantage otherwise their competitors may pass them and their growth may not last forever Nvidia although one of the biggest in market cap is a decent investment for the longterm and will still outperform the market in my opinion in the next coming years my degrees are in finance data analytics and I studied competitive advantages in great detail because Warren Buffett amongst other influential figures have taught me to pay attention to how companies compete in a market looking at competitors is one of the most important things when a company is looking to gain market share a competitive Advantage becomes especially important during turbulent times when there's a lot of volatility such as during a pandemic or periods of just regular or high inflation a strong competitive Advantage will help companies survive and thrive through Market downturns while those without a competitive Advantage will struggle in many ways as a simple example talented employees simply just leave a company when it can't offer the best compensation and career advancement you know for yourself you probably jump ship from a company if they weren't paying enough or one of their competitors were just paying a better salary I also mentioned the stock split being a big Catalyst for me stock splits reduce the price per share without affecting the company's overall market cap for many individual investors a lower price per share makes a stock more affordable potentially increasing demand as more investors can now buy shares a stock split increases the number of shares outstanding which can enhance liquidity with more shares available for trading it becomes easier for investors to buy and sell the stock often resulting in tighter bid ask spreads which is actually phenomenal for option trading as well a company typically performs a stock split when a share prices have just risen significantly and become very expensive for the the General market or for someone to buy one share of so if a Stock's over $600 $700 that's typically when a stock or the company or the management starts to think about making a stock split we've already seen that with Chipotle as well this often reflects strong historical performance and growth which is a really good thing investors might perceive the split as a positive signal the company is confident in its future prospects investors may have psychological preferences for stocks with lower nominal prices which is also not really a problem it's pretty good actually when other investors think something is cheaper but it's not but the stock goes up so you can take advantage of this a lower price can attract a broader base of investors including retail investors who might feel more comfortable buying shares at $100 rather than $11,000 historically many stocks experience an increase in demand post split now one more time stocks typically go up after a split which can drive the price up in the short term over the next 1 two or 3 months while past performance is not indicative of future results this trend can make post-split purchases very attractive a stock split does not change the intrinsic value of the company in any way as I've mentioned on this channel before it's basically like cutting a pie in multiple pieces the pie is still the same or the calories of the pie is still the same the fundamental analysis Remains the Same and the split merely Alters the share price amount and the share price cost per share this makes it an opportune moment to buy into the company's prospects without changing the underlying fundamentals and for me having Nvidia go down so much actually is a really good purchase so I ended up buying it yesterday in my Discord community and take me some time to edit this video but still it is not too late to buy Nvidia so Nvidia keeps beating and raising in the past three quarters so I think that that is going to continue and the biggest midterm Catalyst for NVIDIA is that demand is sustainable past 2025 which would blow the current 18.86% journey it's likely to happen based on the facts that even open AI wanted to make their own chips and some other facts we can speculate the demand will be stronger for longer the risk lies in the potential for demand to be pulled forward where major customers might start cutting back on orders once their chips are operational however in my opinion creating the best chips requires significant research and development cost and frequent refresh Cycles with nvidia's extensive experience it is likely to continue on performing custom chip to the extent that producing custom chips becomes really impractical I think Nvidia is easily a 10% stake in anyone's portfolio",0.95,0.9
Invest with Henry,1eHUjwOEqkk,2024-06-12T15:25:30Z,Top 5 Stocks I'm Buying Right Now for HUGE Growth,Meta,"stock number three is going to be meta or formly Facebook and Facebook has one of the best network effects so a network effect is something that I also learned back in college before I worked for Goldman Sachs and each person who joins a network fact or each person that joins the social media uh platform that is Facebook is going to increase the value of Facebook so a network effect can make it difficult for new entrance to basically come into the market because if everyone is talking about Facebook the more people that go on Facebook that means more people want to go on Facebook same thing with Uber if you look at Uber the more people start driving for Uber means that there's going to be more cars available for you to hire so it's going to make it faster for you to hire a car and the more cars people are trying to hire the more Uber drivers come onto the platform because there's money to be made and there's customers looking to get an Uber so basically that is what a network effect is and met as 3 billion users across its family of apps certainly make it very unlikely that a new social media can come up and just kind of like displace meta that's going to be very very hard and then also talking about artificial intelligence AI is all the rage on Wall Street and meta plays into multiple of my thesis so today de pocketed technology companies are investing billions of dollars to accumulate the broad computing power needed to develop train and use AI models well meta is one of the companies leading the pack Mark Zuckerberg disclosed earlier this year that meta aims to accumulate 350,000 of nvidia's Flagship h100 graphic processing chips by your end giving the company a total Computing capacity of roughly 600,000 h100 equivalents when factoring in meta's total chip horde so basically that's why have both of these stocks on the list because meta is buying all of nvidia's chips Nvidia is making lots of money and met is just looking really good for an AI play and I think the market notices this and that's why both stocks have done so well in 2024 and I think it's going to continue to go well into 2025 the h100 chip is easily optimized for AI workloads and these chips cost over $40,000 each giving you an idea of meta's astronomical investment in AI management has guided for Capital expenditures in 2024 to fall between $ 35 and $40 billion so Zuckerberg noted that AI will become prevalent in meta's business already the company has developed and integrated its large language model llama 3 into its social media apps and deployed AI tools to help advertisers optimize their marketing dollars AI will continue guys I think AI will continue appearing in meta's augmented reality business including the quest headset line and the Ray-Ban meta smart glasses AI is all over the market and a stock like this I think is going to do very very well I think the stock is also cheap on a long-term basis calling meta cheap kind of feels off considering shares have climbed over 80% as well as Nvidia is just very very expensive and its historical chart but look I think if you pay attention to the numbers they do reveal that the stock has a very inexpensive valuation at the moment given future prospects analysts believe metal will earn about $205 C or $20.20 per share this year which values the stock at a forward price to earnings ratio of about 24 they also believe meta will grow its earnings over 19% annually for the next 3 to 5 years now remember meta's reality lab segment is currently dragging on profits because it's losing money eventually that segment could come alive and that will really improve the stocks performance as well and its valuation I also use the PEG ratio to evaluate how attractive a stocks valuation is is relative to the company's expected growth this is something that I teach in my boot camp and by the way if you do want to join my boot camp I finally have one it's been 6 months since I've had one you can learn more about it by clicking the first link in my description it is going to be starting later this month now the PEG ratio is currently 1.3 a good deal if the business can meet growth estimates",0.95,0.9

I am running the wheel I'm selling puts and I am selling covered calls so I'm doing everything in terms of selling options. I have 3500 shares and I have only sold 23 contracts of my 22 covered calls so if you'll notice I am not fully selling covered calls on my entire position I'm leaving some of my position open so I can make money on the stock going up because I am pretty bullish on it in fact I'm very bullish on Palance here. I'm going to go back to pltr because what I'm going to do is I'm going to straight up just buy more shares and I'm going to buy more shares so I can run some covered calls. I just purchased 1,500 more shares for $23.38 so you can see here how my position just increased to 5,000 shares. Let me just quickly go back to pound here because I want to be mindful of the fact that they may have earnings we do see here they have earnings in August 5th so that's pretty good no worries there. some of you guys may have traded pal here today and uh most likely some other people out there in the world have traded Palance here today. I don't think paler is going to go to 20 or 20 so these options are pretty much useless in the sense that I've already made money so if I want to make more money I can just go ahead and sell some more options.

So, Starbucks stock price $73 and you buy a long put option with a strike price of 70. As Starbucks falls to $65 per share, here's what it's going to look like. So this means that the holder of a put option now has the right to sell Starbucks shares at the higher strike price of 70. So if Starbucks comes crashing down, you're perfectly fine with that because you get to sell it at 70 no matter what because you own that put option even though the market price declines and it goes down to 65. All right, so we're going to jump into my Robin Hood right now and I'm going to show you an example of how I would run a buy put on Starbucks.

million portfolio I'm going to be showing you all the best features that I use as well as how I trade options and how to properly use Robin Hood with basically all the features that they have including gold including how to get level three option trading all the different features that they have so first of all I do personally use gold so Robin Hood gold gives me the ability to use margin I personally love using margin because it is kind of like free money although in some ways you have to pay for margin certain option strategies are actually non-paid so you can sell options and specifically if you're selling put options you don't always pay interest so I like using Robin Hood gold because my only expense is going to be that $5 so if I click Robin Hood gold right here you will see that um you can earn 5% apy in your brokerage cash which is pretty good like you are actually earning some pretty decent uh interest on your account I also really like that you get a 3% match on the IRA with Robin Hood gold you get 2K margin interest free although that 2K isn't really free because that first 2K you do pay for with a $5 fee which is honestly not that much just $5 a month um you get 50k in instant deposits now the only thing I don't like about Robin Hood is that you know obviously I have money and I want to like deposit sometimes 100K 200k and I can't so it only gives you 50k in deposits all right so you can see right here that Robin Hood actually has crypto I don't personally have any crypto in Robin Hood um I'd rather have crypto in a crypto wallet but I don't have any crypto at all my net worth is literally 100% in options completely um what I actually am doing right now is I transferring money to Robin Hood so you can transfer money from any other brokerage and they're currently matching 1% um I'm not sponsored by Robin Hood or anything like that um I don't even know if I have a link but I'm going to drop a link for you if you want to join Robin Hood I don't even know if I get anything I might drop an affiliate link but to be honest I don't make videos I'm just doing this because I want to help you guys so let me go retirement so uh retirement they match 3% which is actually pretty good 3% is a pretty good match actually want to kind of open this up myself so if I were to cck get started you see that I can open up either a Roth or a traditional let me just go through this real fast so a Roth IRA means that you're basically putting in after tax dollars so it makes sense to do this if you have a like a lower income so let's say that you're making 50k a year it makes more sense to do the Roth iray and then I think at like8 or 120,000 something like that you can just easily Google it at it's around 108 to 140,000 you can no longer contribute to Roth IRA so I'm not really allowed to myself cuz I make more than that obviously some months are actually over that option trading but um traditional would be better for a higher income earner because a traditional IRA gets your um taxable income lower today but you get taxed later when whenever you sell it so I'm just going to click traditional IRA you can see here that literally anyone can just sign up for it um there is a penalty to withdrawal so I personally don't really have a traditional IRA because I don't really want to wait till 59 A2 um that is quite some time for me so let's just talk about like the option trading features that I really like I it's really easy to trade an option like you just look up a stock so like let's just say I also just really like these screener tools a lot and what I really love about Robin Hood it's just so easy to use is they tell you the max loss they tell you how much you're collecting all that good stuff so you can create

Invest with Henry,cAjyUvGb6qg,2024-05-27T18:38:46Z,Palantir Urgent: Do This Immediately,Palantir,"what's going on guys it's Henry back with another video and today we're going to be talking about paler stock and specifically I want to look at paler options I also want to look at paler technical analysis I'm going to be diving into my portfolio right here right now to show you my opinion on paler my position and where I think this stock is heading next because paler is actually a very hot stock for multiple reasons not only is the business very strong the leadership is very interesting the trend of AI is very good this company is a full data company that has a lot of progress growing rapidly but it's also has a very high social velocity which is something that nobody talks about you see a lot of people on YouTube we talk about paler because it gets views sad to say but the reason why it's getting views is because there's a lot of people that understand this company has a bright future so there's a lot of people piggybacking off of the idea that this stock is growing and they're creating more attention actually than I think it deserves not because paler is not a good company but there's actually additional social velocity coming from Twitter from all social media so I think this is a really interesting stock for many reasons fundamentally technically the options look good and there just seems to be a lot of attention on the stock I've caught this stock years ago actually I've been making videos about pounds here for a very long time before everyone really started to push this stock now the reason why people are pushing it is again one I think that this is a very strong stock fundamentally technically for me options I don't know who's talking about options on pal here but for me the options on pal are absolutely beautiful but then socially so what I want to look at right now is first of all I'm going to start off with technical analysis I'm going to jump into my position as well here well let just show you my current position on Palance here I don't have the biggest position but I'm planning to buy more shares of Palante here you can see here how I have a 3.5% of my portfolio in paler stock right now uh with a total return of $11,800 now I have a decent sized position $75,000 in this portfolio I do have another portfolio I have some more pal here but it's not that much more uh I have in my other portfolio you can also see here that on my option position I have U made about $492 what I'm ly doing is I'm selling calls and puts on paler so let's talk about selling options on paler and why it's so profitable when a stock like pal here that has a lot of implied volatility okay implied volatility is basically how much the market expects a stock to move right so there's High implied volatility the market is expecting this stock to be very volatile meaning they think it's going to go up a lot it's going to go down a lot or maybe it's just going to go up and down a lot and then who knows where it's going to end up the market just knows that this is a turbulent stock this stock has a lot of movement and for that reason it has more implied volatility now as an option seller myself and I've have over 4,000 students generating consistent income selling options the best thing that you can do is find a stock that has high implied volatility that is range-bound okay a lot of people think you can't make money when a stock is going sideways that is furthest from the truth I mean look right now the three-month chart on Palance here this stock has gone absolutely nowhere but if you're selling options on a weekly basis and it's not going anywhere that's completely fine that's why I've been able to to make pretty good money so let's just go over some examples let me go over the full thought process I have around selling options because if you're not selling options for income you're basically not looking to retire anytime soon if you learn how to sell options for income you are basically in control of your finances and it's only takes a certain amount of money for you to save up until you're generating x amount of dollars to retire right whatever that number is for you I have students that are making $5,000 a month 7 8 n the list goes on I mean I have millionaires as well I also work with folks that have a small portfolio doesn't really matter where you are you want to be selling options eventually if you have a small portfolio yeah buying options is kind of more attractive but as you build up a portfolio I think the best thing that you can possibly do sell options I've literally retired traveled the whole world because I'm selling options it's the easiest way to make money online also has the most Freedom so if I just show you something like sell put right now on Palance here and I go to let's just say a week out okay I'm going to pick out a week ad option you can sell right here you see it's only $41 it might not seem like a lot but this is a 2% return 2% of 21 is about 42 right this is 41 this is literally an almost 2% return thereabouts in just 7 days so if you can do this every single week that's about an 8% return on a very safe stock that has a lot of growth so if you're selling put options not a whole lot can happen and here 2% per week would have worked out literally for the past 3 months so that's like four weeks in a month that's 12 times in a row you would have literally won 12 times in a row selling options on pound here pretty crazy 12 times in a row because you can see by the chart right now that it's not going anywhere it's going a little bit up it's going a little bit down so a lot of people are kind of frustrated they're in Palance here because they see a big Vision big future which I Do by the way I just don't know when okay I'm not going to sit here and pretend to be like Mr fortune teller oh paler is going to go up to this price at this time no I don't know I think paler is going to be $50 stock in the next 2 3 years I think we can see a double in the price but I don't know how fast I don't know which earnings quarter is going to drive this the most I just look at the valuation if I look at the statistics okay looking at the statistics this stock has a really good valuation yes the Ford PE ratio is high the current PE ratio is also very high but we've seen this with Nvidia a company that has high profit margins which pound here granted doesn't have the highest profit margins yet I think they're going to continue increasing but everything just looking really good year-over-year quarterly Revenue growth 20% CEO fantastic job um once paler get it's into a business you're not leaving this is kind of like a software play very similar to Adobe Adobe has a very high price earnings ratio because once people get into the Adobe suite they're really not leaving they're most likely long-term contractors they have a job in the field it's most likely a company using their software tools so once a customer comes they don't leave same thing applies for paler and just looking at the chart I don't need a good chart to make a lot of money I can make a lot of money by just simply following a pattern and the pattern could be sideways okay so sideways pattern patter means that this is a good opportunity for multiple different option selling in fact all option selling will work on palen here you can literally be a monkey and make money on Palante here if you're losing money on Palante here you're not following the right people what you want to do is first of all just sell puts okay that's the most simplest strategy that I would use on paler right now I am selling the $20 put for July I would sell $20 puts for July for August for September for October for November I would go the first you know next you know 1 to8 months it's fine this is a window I know it's a crazy big window but listen telling you if you sell puts on paler the worst that can happen is if Palante here goes down you will have to get assigned some shares you shouldn't mind getting assigned shares if you like the stock okay if you like the stock okay I'm not going to force the stock on you I really don't care I'm not trying to force any opinions here I don't have an agenda my only agenda is to educate you teach you and of course if you want to join my community fantastic but I'm not desperate for any of this I'm just teaching you what I believe to be the best strategy and what I'm personally doing I'm putting my money where my mouth is I'm not going on this YouTube channel and saying buy this buy that no I'm actually showing you what I'm doing I literally have real money in this position in multiple different portfolios so I would personally sell $20 puts not Financial advice because I'm not a financial adviser next the thing that I would do is I would just simply buy shares and I would sell covered calls listen a covered call is very similar to selling a put okay it almost drives me me crazy when my students ask me should I sell a covered call or should I sell a put listen the thing is they're actually very similar okay there's the same thing if you sell a put option you're saying that I want to buy the stock if it goes down if you do a covered call you already have the stock and you're just generating money on the stock that you already have in both scenarios though okay listen both scenarios you have about $2,000 into the position I sold a $20 put I have about $2,000 that is committed to this position I sold a $225 you know covered call I have the shares so that's also about $2,000 so in both scenarios I have $2,000 locked up and I'm generating 2% or 1% per week on my money I literally want to scale my entire portfolio just using paler but that would not be smart riskmanagement so instead I'm not going to do that but I think that having 10% 15% of your money in Palante here um is really good unless you have you know millions of dollars like me you probably then want to start diversifying a little bit more but then again it just depends on your conviction level my conviction level on pal here is very high I just have a little bit higher conviction on some other stocks which you know I email you guys all the time if you're not part of my free email newsletter then it's free just you know find it in the description so right now what I'm doing is you can see that I have a may31 covered call on paler at 22 and A2 the thing is I don't have to do may I can do june I can do July I can do August all of those different expiration dates would be perfectly fine because to be honest I'm just selling options that are out of the money and selling out of the money options Works especially on high quality companies so I'm always looking for a high quality company whether it's apple or Amazon or Microsoft I've been making money in all of those stocks it's really easy paler is even better because paler has higher implied volatility and again when a stock has higher implied volatility there's just simply more premium to be made so looking at the chart right now if I zoom out to like 6 months you can see that pal here has had a huge bounce now you know I wasn't a genius but I did kind of catch this right here I and ended up doing some covered calls and I ended up making really good money now thankfully I wasn't just selling puts because if you just sell puts here's the benefit of puts and and and covered calls by the way when you sell a put you have a certain amount that you can make no more covered call is the same thing except if you do a very outs of the money call so for example right now when pal well back when paler was $16 I sold $20 covered calls so I didn't fully catch the full upswing to 24 but I caught half of it okay now for me this little period right here I had a slight underperformance because obviously a covered call is not going to perform as well when a stock just shoots up to the moon so just being honest I had a week of underperformance I didn't lose money I made money but I just made less money by doing options than I would have just holding the stock so there can be periods like that it's not like options are the golden vehicle and yes they're very good but there are periods of time where options can hurt your returns most of the time that's not the case but again I'm just being honest there are some periods of time where you don't want to do a covered call so I did a covered call here but the good news is I basically made way way more money by continuing to sell options from this period onward like every single week for literally like 12 weeks in a row or 3 months so look what would I do right now well given where paler is and it has been I predict that paler is pretty much going to continue going sideways until they have the next earnings okay if we look at the next earnings it's on August 5th Okay so until August 5th I don't really see paler doing a whole lot I think paler will move sideways I also think pal here may have some good or bad news coming out and the stock may see some pops 3 or 5% here and there this is a fairly volatile stock it has popped up 5% many many times um throughout the year but what I think will happen is sideways action given sideways action here's what I would do I would go to paler trade options and I'll show you an example of two different trades okay so first of all I'm going to go to uh July 19 again you can go for June you can go for August it just depends on your level of patience not one expiration is better than the other both are fine um what you just want to do is go for an out ofth the money option so go to sell all right I'm going to go to 20 I mean I already have this position open so if you want I still think this position is very very valid uh 31 Delta it's a little higher than than usual but I think about a 30 Delta is actually pretty much the sweet spot for me you know if you want to be really really safe you would go for a 20 Delta if you want to be really aggressive you can go for something higher you can go for 43 which would be the 21 strike okay for me I'm going to pick the 20 strike I already have this position open so I mean once the Market opens up I'm making this video in the morning I I could uh I could increase my position size here now what I would do is I would just click continue and I would probably open up like let's say five contracts so I would sell five contracts and basically make $354 I would tie up less than 10 grand boom this would be a decent position it's not going to make you rich overnight but this is a really good consistent income strategy what else I would do is I would just do a simple covered call so to do a proper covered call you need 100 shares and I would do some upside so let's say that sh think pound here is going to go up you can simply give it some upside like you can pick the 24 strike right here and boom now you can collect income plus you have upside from $21 to 24 so in this way a covered call and a sell put is different because if you go out of the money then a covered call gives you upside whereas a selling a put option will not do that so if you're more bullish which I am and both I have both sell puts and covered calls just to see if it goes sideways my sell puts really benefit if it goes up a bit my covered calls benefit a lot more so but both ways I'm I'm bullish I'm making money sell put is a bullish strategy and the covered call is also a bullish strategy so I would sell the 24 covered call and I would just hold this position until expiration in terms of managing this position guys I would not manage it you trying to manage a position is you just like trying to micromanage an employee you're really not going to have better performance micromanaging things you're going to have better performance by just letting this position go relax take a deep breath if you're bullish on Palance here like I am set this position and forget it",1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,h-1sVxdK880,2024-05-22T21:47:48Z,"$4,500/mo Spread Trading (Small Account)",Amazon,let's take a look at Amazon Okay the reason why I want to use Amazon right now is I was doing research before this video and specifically I noticed that Amazon is near its 52 week high if you look at Amazon over the past one year this stock is up a lot I mean this stock was $114 stock now it's $181 okay given its movement upwards and because it is basically at a 52e high if I scroll down right here you will notice that the 52e high is 191 okay what we can do is we can make a bet that this stock is not going to go past 191 it could happen but it's very very unlikely given that that's already been the peak and then we're currently getting a retraction in the stock it's currently showing some negative signs of momentum given this what I'm going to do is open up a call crit spread now you will notice I do currently have two different positions on Amazon we can talk about that later I'm going to go to trade Amazon options okay I don't think Amazon's going to go too much past 191 or even up to 191 it's unlikely if Amazon goes up past 195 I will start to lose money and you will shortly see that on the graph right here on the right side all right so I'm going to be selling one call option now I'm going to be buying another call option so I'm going to go higher right remember when I said we're going to go up one all right so um I sold the 195 now I'm going to be buying the 200 now this creates me an opportunity not to have an unlimited risk because if you notice right here before I click this button it says Max loss unlimited you don't want to be in that situation and that's only a theoretical unlimited amount it's unlikely you're going to lose tons of money but still rather than being in that situation what you want to do is is you're going to go ahead and buy the 200 all right so now that I bought the 200 you can see here this is called a call Credit spread as you see on the screen a call Credit spread right now is going to benefit as long as the stock stays below about $195 64 okay I'm collecting $64 on this position right now so my income on this position is going to be 64 my risk is $436 that's the collateral that's the capital that have to put into this position to make $64 now if you do the math and I'm going to do it on top of my head right now it's roughly a 15% return in five weeks that means that you're going to make 3% per week returns every single week if this option goes out of the money which it's already way out of the money this is a very safe option position and given that it's going to generate 15% in 5 weeks this is exactly the type of position that I'm actually going to open up right now so I'm going to click continue and I'm going to go for just five contracts so I'm going to open up these five contracts and you will notice right here that the bid is 57 the ask is 69 okay in actuality I want to go for somewhere in between because you're never going to get 73 in fact if I show you what would happen right now if I asked for 73 this option just won't get filled so I just submitted this option you can see right here that the quantity is still zero for five it is not going to get filled so instead if I replace this order and I go for something very low and I'm going to probably lose money but for the sake of this video cuz I want to help you guys out um you'll see if I put in 0.57 this is me actually lowballing myself I got filled instantaneously but I probably could have made a bit more money had I put in a different limit price so I could have put in a limit price of 058 0.596 um just to show you what would happen though if I went to the high end I didn't get filled at all if I went for the low end I got filled instantaneously so which want to actually do is you want to go for the midpoint somewhere in between all right so I just opened up this trade this is an Amazon call Credit spread,1.0,0.3
Invest with Henry,h-1sVxdK880,2024-05-22T21:47:48Z,"$4,500/mo Spread Trading (Small Account)",Starbucks,I'm specifically going to be using Starbucks as an example right now because basically Starbucks it's pulled back a lot this stock was really a very expensive stock not that long ago at over $90 per share now this huge company Starbucks which has a really good reputation has P back to under $80 after earnings so they disappoint in their earnings and you can see right now that the stock is actually trending back up okay so this stock is trending back up making it a very good opportunity for a put credit spread now let's go over this example on Starbucks so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to trade Starbucks options we're going to start off by selling a put option so when we sell a put option we're just saying that we don't think that the stock will go to this level again we don't think that the stock will pull back down therefore we're selling a put option when you sell a put option that just means I'm ready to buy the stock you're basically selling Insurance means that you make money you get to collect the premium just like an insurance company now with a put credit spread there's going to be a little bit of a Twist you sell a put option and then you buy a put option a little bit lower which for me is going to be a $5 Gap again I found that $5 gaps are just the very best uh difference in spread to utilize when I'm trading options specifically spreads as well as iron Condors which I do have videos on this channel as well which you should check out because an iron Condor is just a combination of these two spreads but let's go over this put credit spread example so the first thing I'm going to do is again I'm going to pick an expiration date for me 1 to 6 weeks is really ideal sometimes I go 8 weeks so let's just go over an example where I'll go a little bit further okay I'm going to go for roughly eight weeks okay I'm going to go for July 19 now remember if you're watching this video in the future totally okay you can just apply the same logic and just keep using my strategies here okay so sell put and I'm going to sell an out of the money put all right now the premiums here are not that high however I will say that Starbucks has very strong support it's pulled back after earnings and it's immediately coming back up so I'd be a lot more comfortable selling something like the 75 put option right here the Delta here is higher but sometimes you have to use intuition okay okay it's not just about the technical chart remember option trading and Stock Market trading in general is just psychology you're playing other players it's a player vers player game and you want to use intuition and logic at the same time for me 75 put makes a lot of sense right now so I'm going to open up a sell put for 75 and then again I'm going to go ahead and buy a put option that's going to be $5 lower so I'm going to buy a $5 lower um put option right here I'm going to buy the 70 and you will see right here that I am making $77 and I'm risking $423 this is roughly a you know one six ratio so it's roughly a 18% return here you can literally make up to 18% return in Just 2 months or about 9% per month in this position right here this is something that I would do and this is something that I'm actually going to open up right now in front of you and I'm actually going to be a little bit um more smarter here this time so instead of coing for the bid price I'm actually going to put in 75 and hope that I get executed very quickly here so I've just submitted this trade you can see that I just got filled for five contracts on the put credit spread again this put credit spread is going to benefit as long as Starbucks does not move lower very important because if Starbucks moves lower I will be in trouble and I can lose the $424 or however amount that was in collateral if the stock goes down now there is a caveat you don't lose that full amount of collateral you only lose it if Starbucks goes all the way down to 70 if Starbucks goes down to 74 I'm only going to lose $1 okay and because I've actually collected a good amount of money here I'm not even going to lose a dollar because I've already collected some premium so if it's down by a dollar well I'll be down by a dollar minus the premium that that I collected okay if it's somewhere in between I'm going to lose potentially half of the collateral right so if it went down to $72 .50 I would be down $ $50 however I've collected you know it was 64 or something let's go over this example sellp put buy put you can see here that I'm collecting 73 cents so even if it were to be uh down 73 cents in the money that would be my personal break even if it was in the middle at 722 then I would lose 250 minus the $73 that I collected so I would only lose $180 the best way to manage this position is by setting clear expectations when you enter the position you want to make sure that your technical analysis is correct but once this position goes into the money if it goes below 75 at that point this is where you may want to consider closing at the position for me I personally like to hold positions up until expiration but if it's really showing signs of negative momentum which I don't think will be the case with Starbucks but if that is the case I will often set myself a rule to close a position at a 50% loss so again going back if this stock hits 725 and I see that the momentum is just not that good looking at the RSI and other technical indicators if they're not showing signs of recovery I will then cut this position because it is much better to lose just $250 minus the premium than the full $500 or the 500 minus the premium which would be $420 so I'd rather go for a $200 loss than a $400 loss,1.0,0.6
Invest with Henry,giYniDkBd7Q,2024-05-16T18:29:23Z,Top 5 Covered Call Stocks Now for 2024,Neo,"first is Neo this stock has had some tremendous momentum since I picked up shares and made a video when this stock was $3.80 I put $10,000 into neostock and I've also begun just buying up more shares as of lately right now I would do a $5 covered call on the stock for any expiration dates between 3 to 6 months because the premium is very high due to High implied volatility I'll show you an example shortly the main reason I purchased the stock is it's trading at pretty much the same value as the cash that Neo has in hand so the company is now valued basically the same as cash so it makes absolutely no sense that it would go that much lower it has really tremendous support and then just selling covered calls in general is going to generate income and later on in this video I'm going to cover my high income double dividend strategy Neo would not go into that because Neo doesn't pay a dividend however the high implied volatility is so good that selling covered calls on Neo's very profitable all right so let's take a look at Neo stock right now so I'm going to pull up Neo on the Yahoo finance chart going to show you specifically what I'm looking at and why I think this is such a strong stock right now so obviously I picked up shares at around $3.80 this was a few weeks ago I made a video I got a lot of views and hopefully you guys made a lot of money but now the stock is going up a lot so this stock went up past $5 a little bit of a pullback and now we're seeing it soar a lot higher you can actually see here on the RSI chart this stock is actually sitting at 66 which is towards the higher end now that means that the stock is kind of heating up and I don't know if it's going to keep going higher it's actually moving towards the higher end of the Bullinger band so the momentum May cool off in the near future however what I think is going to happen is that Neo will likely Trend sideways now you know I caught at 380 there's you know how much more upside can we have from 380 to 580 that's literally $2 on a stock under $4 that's a 50% move I mean I've literally made $5,000 on a $10,000 position plus now I'm going to start selling uh covered calls so here's what I would do if I was going to sell some covered calls you're going to want to sell covered calls are going to be near the money the reason for this is I really don't know how much more upside Neo has and given the fact that it has already moved up from 380 to 580 what you want to do now is probably sell $6 covered calls now you can sell $6 covered calls for a short-term expiration something like 10 days out you can go 17 days you know you can go something in the short term for me the best option expiration is going to be 1 to 6 weeks so let's go for something like June 28th I'm going to show you what the $6 covered call is going to do right now you can see that has 60 cents which means that you're going to get more than 10% return in just 6 weeks so you can collect 10% income and if Neo falls back down you have a 60 Cent cushion okay you have quite a lot here actually if you want a bigger cushion you can also go down um to 550 for example and you'll have a little bit bigger of a cushion however this would be an in the money option because the strike here 5.5 is under the current price of 583 I don't really recommend that I think the best thing would be to go for six you can also go a little bit longer term in expiration give yourself a break relax and you can sell a$6 uh covered call here for 86 the main concern people mention is the range of electric vehicle of electric vehicles however Neo has a 400 km range so I don't really see the issue and I think selling covered calls is going to generate a lot of money",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,giYniDkBd7Q,2024-05-16T18:29:23Z,Top 5 Covered Call Stocks Now for 2024,Palantir,"The next stock is paler or ticker symbol pltr I've made a video on paler and by now you already know that well paler is recent performance is not so good and specifically after the q1 earnings they didn't really meet EPS expectations and and exceeded they did exceed revenue estimates so the stock did not really perform so well and actually had a more than 15% decline which to me presented a really good opportunity for covered calls specifically I think the market really overreacted the stock market often overreacts to news and earnings reports creating opportunities for investors despite positive performance metrics pal your stock fell which you know is presenting a good opportunity right now to get in and whether you sell some short-term or longer term covered calls this is going to be a fantastic opportunity for 202 for just looking at investor sentiment some analysts suggest that investors should focus on pal here's positive highlights including accelerating growth profitability and Global Partnerships this optimistic sentiment contrasts with the Market's reaction to recent earnings reports so there's really a disbalance here between analysts and the market in general so also if you look at the volatility and the opportunity in general paler shares really do also exhibit High volatility just like Neo with significant price wings despite the volatility some investors view the current price as really attractive considering factors like company's long-term perspectives and really looking at Kathy Wood she just purchased a whole lot of shares on the dip so that's just more reason to buy it not that I really like to copy other investors I always like to do my own research you can also sell puts on paler in the light of you know the proceed value in palent here's current price yes the stock went down maybe some people are fearful but selling put options is also a no-brainer opportunity because if you pick up the stock for under $20 per share you're going to have a really good entry point at the same time if you just sell cover calls at say 21 strike or 22 strike well you're also reducing your average cost to well you know around below 20 but just like I like to sell puts I also like to sell covered calls the reason is because selling covered calls which is what this video is about allows you to collect premium allows you to collect consistent income and it provides an immediate income stream this can be appealing especially if you believe that paler stock price will remain relatively stable or experience only modest growth over the short term they can also leverage volatility so paler has high volatility and just in general whatever stock that you pick for covered calls whether it's Neo whether it's craft hind whether it's paler or the other couple stocks I'm about to get into well High volatility is a good thing because it increases premium and when you're an option seller you want the premium to be higher now let's go over an example of pounds here what I'm going to show you right now is my paler position I do have a pretty good size paler position overall and you can see here I have 3.55% of my portfolio in paler stock I have 3,500 shares currently I have some sell uh puts as well as some covered calls I have a covered call at 25 I also have another covered call at 22.5 so what I would honestly recommend is going for the 22 and a half go for something one to six weeks as I've already mentioned this right here is going to expire in two weeks as I'm making this video so you know two weeks expiration is going to be fantastic currently up $48 and 22 a half is specifically good because I give myself some upside but also I amum you know I'm collecting some good premium so I get the best of both worlds I get 1.5% on the premium roughly this is one and a half% and then I also get like about $1 of upside so that's you know about like you know four 5% so very very happy with this position so far I made $48 I opened this position not that long ago you can see on actually four days ago as I'm making this video I made $492 so I would say that pound here is very strong specifically if we take a look at the pound here chart you will notice that there's a lot of good stuff going on um with the chart itself although the stock is down it has already found some really good support So stock went down to $2.60 and we're already seeing a really good bounce so if I go to the 3-week Chart you can see here that there was a lot of selling you can see there's a lot of selling but now you can see how the volume is picking up and there's some buyers coming in well to be honest the volume is not even that high but you know it's higher than it was before the earnings report came out so it does look like there was a lot of buyers a lot of people were optimistic the pounds here will go up and a lot of those people did get disappointed but if you're trading options like me you're not disappointed at all you've made a lot of money so if you have haven't made a lot of money you're just not trading options properly what you want to do is go for covered calls cuz covered calls give you that margin of safety give you that cushion give you that income so basically there's no issue when you're doing covered calls I um had you know the stock go down a little bit but my average cost was a lot lower so really didn't have an issue and now there's some support coming in buyers coming in and the stock is already popping back up so I would say that uh it's pretty urgent I would say pretty urgent that H jump in do some covered calls and collect some income",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,giYniDkBd7Q,2024-05-16T18:29:23Z,Top 5 Covered Call Stocks Now for 2024,Shopify,"Now the next stock is going to be Shopify because the stock fell 24% in the past 3 months and post earnings the stock crashed this is an easy money option that you can just sell a covered call and we're going to go into an example shortly but first I want to say that the e-commerce company's first quarter Topline performance was very solid total first quarter Revenue Rose 23% year-over-year even more when adjusting for the sale of its Logistics business Revenue actually Rose 29% year-over-year an acceleration from 24% growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 but here's the issue shopify's expense structure remains extremely high even after recent layoffs operating expenses for the first quarter were $871 million accounting for 91% of its growth profits sure this produced an operating profit of $86 million up from an operating loss of $193 million in the year ago quarter but you know this is still a rough situation however I think the stock will likely not fall lower which is why I think right now it's a very good covered call Opportunity the loss that they had is actually a very small figure compared to the company's massive $80 billion market cap I think what's going to happen in the further quarters is as Shopify continues to scale the business and the revenue continues to grow their expenses will come down it's going to be a really easy stock to make money on a lot of investors are worried about where shopify's business is right now but I absolutely don't think there's something to worry about and here's why all right now I'm quickly going to do you guys the justice of doing some technical analysis as well as fundamental analysis on Shopify so you know hopefully I'm delivering on this video and if I am and you're learning a lot then go ahead subscribe be really really helpful for my channel as we try to hit 300,000 subscribers now let's take a look at the chart first okay we're going to look at the chart and you see here that uh Shopify is going down a whole lot actually crashed from 77 all the way down to $58 you can see here have the RSI is 28 that means it's pretty much oversold um there's been a lot of selling and this is you know this is something that they call a falling knife okay but I really do like catching falling knif and especially I want to show you guys the statistics right here and go over some fundamental analysis on Shopify because I think that um Shopify has some really good fundamentals so check this out shopify's market cap is now under 80 billion okay the Ford PE ratio is going to be 60 currently it's 781 you can guys can see here how this is pretty absurd right until you see the fordp ratio and the fordp ratio is basically what the company is going to be worth in one year according to estimates so the price if it stays is the same the new earnings then this stock will fall by a whole lot so the market expects the price earnings or just generally the earnings to go up a lot which is good the peeg ratio is actually very low um at 1.12 this actually is very very good and this actually means that this is a value stock if everything goes according to plan because this is taken into account price or earnings divided by growth okay so the growth is very good and that's why this ratio is very good now price of sales is 10 that's a little bit higher if you just take a look at Apple or you take a look at Tesla Shopify is trading for higher sales price of sales ratio however it's also growing a lot faster and if you compare this to Nvidia um if we compare this to Nvidia real quick you'll probably notice that um most likely Nvidia is trading for a higher multiple I'm just going to double check that and make sure that um I am indeed correct and yes that is the truth uh Nvidia is going for 37 and Shopify is going for 10 so in theory um you can say here that Nvidia is 3.7 times more expensive at least on a price of sales ratio as opposed to Shopify which makes Shopify a more bargain it doesn't mean that it's a cheap stock because again the PE Ratio is also another ratio to look at um generally speaking looking at the short ratio it's actually not that high looks like a lot of short sellers already made money or actually since this is as of April 30th that means that a lot of people did not expect Shopify to fall and there's not many short sellers to begin with which just means that there was a lot of people that owned the stock that uh ended up selling it now now taking a look at their cash they have 5 billion of cash and they have 1 billion of debt so this is a very very good ratio so overall Shopify is a strong stock both on the technicals and on the fundamentals",1.0,0.9

going to collect $76 so right now I'm going to collect $76 the market is actually open so I can actually make this trade right now so I can show you I can for example sell five contracts five contracts 76 Nob brain or trade I'm going to review this and I'm going to submit it pound here right now is around $20 per share this is an absolute steal on my opinion for the reasons I'm about to cover paler reported q1 non-gaap EPS of 8 cents which was in line with forecasts at the same time the organization delivered revenue of $634 million which is up over 20% year-over-year Which topped estimates by 16 million guys they topped estimates but the stock actually ended up tanking let's put this together and see if this makes sense and I'll show you what I'm doing with my paler stock paler declined by more than 15% after the earnings report that was a pretty big event last week and I've seen this story before the price can fall more in the near term due to factors such as the company profitability Outlook operating expenses and selling pressures however I don't think it's going to go below $20 per share which is why I'm about to show you how to sell a put option and how I'm using put options to make money on pal here consistently week after week month after month I was reading an analyst recommendation and his thoughts were this he was suggesting investors ignore this volatility and focus on all the exciting highlights from the earnings the company's accelerating growth maintaining profitability and forming key Partnerships globally to me from my perspective it's OB obvious that the opportunity is right now for paler the data mining and the analytics company paler fell so much in the morning session after the company reported first quarter earnings results with the Billings falling below wall Street's expectations I'll give it that that was pretty bad basically the stock became a more attractive put sell though because as the stock goes lower it's just getting cheaper I'm going to sell a $20 strike put option right now because I want to collect income and if I get assigned the stock I'm going to be very glad to own it listen guys the stock market overreacts often it's your job to take advantage of an overreaction I said this before and it's plain and simple when a stock Falls you buy more shares in doll cost average I'm telling you when a stock is as popular and as sought after as paler and that stock ends up falling it's a very good buy of course not a financial adviser this is just my strong opinion from a seven figed Trader now paler right now for many reasons we will go over such as the q1 results being different from expectations I'm going to go over some technical analysis in fact let's just jump into it right now I'm going to show you what the three-month chart looks like if you see right here the stock is actually down 14% in the past 3 months the stock used to be about a $23 stock now it's 20 which to be honest with you isn't that much of a change and year to date the stock is actually up and I was um invested in pal here at under $16 per share it went up a lot so there was a lot of money made and then uh since then I've been selling options so actually if I scroll down you'll see that I currently have a few positions I'm making $2,800 as of making this video and I have several positions here so now I've opened up some more and like I said in my last paler video I ended up selling some more covered calls but in this video we're going to be talking about selling some puts so I had a covered call where I made money here it's worth 3 cents you can see here I had an 18 put that also has made good money and a 20 put now I have sold 12 contracts here at 222 and that is so far so good doing very very well so what I'm going to do and because I don't have that much money in pound here I mean I have a good amount I have $71,000 and it makes up about 3.4% of this portfolio I have some more pounds here in my other portfolio what I want to do right now is I'm actually just going to show you how to sell a put option and like I said I'm going to go for the $20 put now before I go into the put options what I want to say is that right now for many reasons you know q1 results were not that good but also they were not that good in relative to what the market expected in my opinion they were good and just looking at Kathy Wood she also loaded up on the stock Kathy Wood ended up buying shares of Palance here and I think she's loading up on the company specifically 1.35 million shares of pal here right after the drop because I think she's bargain hunting I actually think that she found a really good value on pounds here and that's what I'm about to show you right now when I go to sell put options if Kathy Wood is buying this right now at these prices I can actually get a better price by selling some put options so that's the beautiful thing about put options a good investor can buy the shares the shares can go lower but you know with a put option yes the shares can still go lower but at least I'm going to be buying the stock lower than what it's trading at today so if you take a look at pound here right now it's trading at $205 what I can just do right now is I can pick an expiration day that's you know say it's you know later in June and I can pick an expiration that's you know expiring in just about a month I can sell a $20 put right here and look I'm happy to buy it at 20 I mean you tell me would you rather buy the stock at $205 or $20 and even better would you rather buy it at $20 or would you rather buy it at $20 and get paid 76 to buy it at $20 well yeah yeah you probably guessed that or you probably said that you'd rather buy a 20 so for me that's what selling a cash secured put looks like I have the cash in my account I'm happy to buy the shares the cash I have available is just waiting around it's ready to be deployed so if you have some cash sitting on the side all you need is like $1,900 and you sell a put option on paler you're going to collect $76 so right now I'm going to collect $76 the market is actually open so I can actually make this trade right now so I can show you I can for example sell five contracts five contracts 76 Nob brainer trade I'm going to review this and I'm going to submit it all right so I'm going to have this trade open once it executes I'm going to be having five contracts open of Palance here what I just noticed is today is Sunday I'm so used to working every single day that it's Sunday so this uh option position actually won't get filled it's a pending order right now so what I'm going to do instead is tomorrow morning as soon as the Market opens up 9:30 a.m. I'm going to be selling this exact same position right here and what that's going to do is I'm going to collect income probably around 76 again or $76 per contract since I'm selling five contracts I'm going to make over $350 in one trade and then I'll be very happy to buy pounder at $20 per share now I will say that pounder Shares are very volatile and over the last year they have had like 40 moves that were greater than 5% now this is kind of crazy because it may move another 5% lower but again I don't really mind if it moves 5% lower investors will lose 5% as a put option seller 5% down would be like $250 right but I already have a cushion of0 50 cents right 50 cents less than the current price and then also right here it's 76 cents I'm collecting so I'm already up over a dollar versus the stock investor so that's why for me selling puts is just so much more advantageous it just makes so much more sense to sell put options collect income get rich off of the premium as well as buy a highquality company and for me owning pound here at you know under $20 per share is amazing because even worse comes to worse even though I have shares and I get more shares that's fine I can just sell more covered calls also if you want to be safer you can sell more out of the money puts so for example you can see here I have 25 covered calls call but I also have $18 puts so right here I'm already up $490 so this option is actually going to expire during this week so I've actually already done this in the past and even though earnings went down this option still like really made a lot of money so as long as you're selling out of the- money options which is what I teach in my Discord Community it's a very simple strategy I've been selling options for literally a decade and it's been working I've been collecting premium been collecting income been growing my portfolio very very steadily just creating the income that I need to live overseas and to uh continue traveling and basically having tons of time freedom.",1.0,0.8

Do This Now!,"""excerpt"": ""wow so shares of data mining and analytics company paler fell 15% in the morning session and just after they reported the first quarter results that was a couple days ago and things are really starting to look interesting and I want to talk about what just happened with paler and what I think is going to happen next with the stock specifically their first quarter results were actually below what Wall Street expected we really need to talk about this now what I'm seeing right now with paler is exactly that although some people in the short term are very upset in the long term if you zoom out the picture is actually very clear paler right now for many reasons we will go over such as the q1 results being different from expectations their guidance being a lot lower and even Kathy Wood loading up on the stock is creating an interesting mix of risk and reward I will analyze for you in this video paler Shares are very volatile and over the last year they have had basically 40 moves that are greater than 5% that is a lot but the moves this big are actually very rare even even for pal here and this is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the Market's perception of the business especially on the psychology of investors this is especially good news though for option Traders because we have done covered calls to profit from volatility you guys know that I love covered calls and I'm going to go over a covered call on paler right now as an example so basically a covered call is fantastic because you get to collect income on a stock I personally already own paler shares I have 3,300 shares with the average cost of $20.9 I'm currently up $1,388 on the stock and I'm actually playing call options as well as put options so you will see right here that I'm up $2,655 so if you're down on the stock you're just simply late which is okay it's not a problem because paler still has a bright future so don't worry about the past let's talk about what's going to happen going forward so for one I currently have covered calls on Palance here at $25 strike the thing is pal here fell down a lot after earnings so the $25 strike no longer has any premium and I was totally correct in the past but I want to be correct in the future so what am I going to do well the thing is what I want to do with palons here is I'm actually going to be buying more shares and doing some covered call options let's just jump into the covered call itself so let's just say that you have 100 shares of palons here 20 shares or however many shares that you have what you want to do is you want to go to sell call now what I'm going to do do is I'm going to pick an expiration date for June 21st now why am I picking this expiration date because options typically expire and traditionally they expire on the third Friday of every single month so since this month is May as I'm making this video it's a little bit too soon for expiration what I want to do instead is I want to go for June expiration which is next month if I was going to go for a July expiration I would pick the July 19th or August 16th these are all the third Fridays of the month so if I was going to sell a covered call as you will see here I'm going to go for something like 23 now if I look at the 23 the Delta is31 with a very good volume in fact the volume is very high here and the implied volatility is 42% so this is actually very good this option right here is worth $57 which is about you know over 2% actually so not only can I jump into paler stock at $21 because I think it's a good purchase right now but I am also going to be collecting premium and making $57 for each 100 shares that I own if I were to sell a covered call so if I click this right here you will see if I click continue that you know for every one contract or for every 100 shares I can sell one contract and collect about $57 now the numbers are very interesting for palent here the US the commercial Revenue Rose about 40% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $150 million total commercial Revenue Rose 27% year-over-year to 299 million while government revenue Rose 16% year-over-year to 335 million the US government Revenue accounted for much of that rise Rising about 12% year-over-year to $257 million now guys I've talked about paler many times I like it for many reasons one is that it has artificial intelligence two the CEO Alex karp is a phenomenal leader he's a genius he's kind of like Elon Musk but even better cuz he doesn't run his mouth and this guy just knows what he's doing the management of paler is very strong not to mention Alex karp actually went to my high school so I think the connections that paler has is very strong with the government and just looking at the government sector the government isn't going anywhere you're going to continue spending money and that's why paler is going to continue capitalizing on the government and just making lots of money recurring consistently and all that future Cash Flow by the way all this future cash that is going to be estimated or expected by investors that's only going to continue Rising year-over-year as paler builds deeper relationships continues to improve its software and you know whether it's the government or the private sector once they have their software in place it's really difficult to get that software out it's hard to transition from a software provider like paler that's very good because that means that the business is very sticky you want a very sticky business for years paler has navigated the turbulent Waters of skepticism and doubt surrounding their vision for software development and I think that they will be able to achieve this vision due to their strong management again Alex carp knows what he's doing I like to invest in strong managers amongst all investors also Kathy Wood is also a big supporter of the stock likely due to you know management and execution she might be liking the stock because of those reasons but of course I'm not fully sure why but it is eye openening to see that the purchases made by Kathy Wood were spread across her various Ark invest exchange traded ETFs right and it's worth noting that Kathy Wood is building on a 177% stake in the company revealed in the fourth quarter update now look if I go back to my paler position you can see that I'm not just playing covered calls I like the covered calls and I'm making money on them but I'm also selling puts I'm actively trying to purchase more shares of pounds here I currently have $7,000 in the stock it makes up about 3.5% of my portfolio and what I want to do right now is I want to keep buying the shares now I'm going to point out something a little bit crazy but this is actually really smart I like dollar cost averaging it's one of the best strategies so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to buy some paler shares now I'm not going to buy a lot of shares I'm just going to go for 200 shares right now I'm going to review this order and submit it now the reason why I'm buying shares of palen here is because I'm dollar cost averaging so I just bought 200 more shares you will see here that my average cost actually went up now is that a bad thing not necessarily because if you look at a company like paler or Amazon or meta or Nvidia any of these big technology companies that are positively trending upwards over the long term you're not going to be able to average cost down there's just no way and I mean there is a way but it's very unlikely that paler is going to fall and be a lot cheaper than $2 long term so for me I'm going to continue buying shares even if it's above my average cost that's very difficult to do specifically because mentally as investors you might have a cognitive bias towards buying shares lower than your average cost but the truth of the matter is you want to be buying shares as much as possible if it's a good company you want to keep acquiring shares as long as the company is valued less than you think it will be in the future and for me I think Palance here can be a $30 $40 maybe a $50 stock in the coming year so for me this is a very obvious investment that I want to be in and also I have a very small state currently in this portfolio I do have more shares of Palance here but still it's currently about 5% of my overall net worth or even a little bit less probably around 4.5% so I'm okay with increasing my position to paler potentially a few hundred more shares within the next couple of months I'm going to be buying this stock consistently and I'm also going to be selling covered calls so you can watch me do that right now what I'm going to do is I currently have 3,500 shares I have sold about 23 covered calls in the past so I can currently sell the difference so the difference is 23 contracts 35 contracts that's going to be 12 contracts that I can sell right now and generate some income on so if I go to sell call option I can sell a call option for say May 17th now what I can do is again I have 12 contracts that are currently uncovered meaning that my current 23 Shares are covered but the rest of the 12 or 1 12200 Shares are basically uncovered so I can go for some income generating opportunity such as the May 17 expiration this would be pretty shortterm however I'm pretty happy collecting about 1% as you can see here now another thing that I could do is I can go out a little bit farther now I typically don't like to trade expirations that are not the traditional third Friday however with palen here it's not really a problem I can go 2 weeks out and in fact this is even better for me cuz I go 2 weeks out I can go a little bit higher to 22.5 giving myself 50 more cents of upside so before I was looking at the 22 now I'm going to look at the 22 1/2 and I'm going to go ahead and sell the 22 1/2 strike price you'll see here that I can collect $26 so if I click continue right now and I'm going to sell the 12 contracts and to sell 12 contracts again you can see that the bid here is26 and the ask is 0. 29 I'm going to try to get. 27 going to review this order and I'm going to submit this order right now all right so I have submitted this order as you can see it has been placed however it's not getting filled the reason for that is because it's currently the bid in the asket should be actually getting filled at 27 however I'm not having that much luck that could be due to volume although the volume here is very good I may have to wait but if I wait longer than 30 seconds what I typically do is I don't really wait for the extra dollar I'll just go ahead and replace the order I'll click continue and I will just settle for 26 now you could also kind of wait for it and see if you'll get filled you know cancel the order put in you know 27 again and just wait however I'm not really going to do that I'm okay just getting um 26 although we can see here I'm still not getting filled so now I will definitely wait because it doesn't make any sense to go below the bid price so I've actually never seen this I've been sitting around and kind of waiting for a you know 30 seconds to 45 seconds I still did not get filled so what I'm going to do is uh in this rare scenario which I've actually pretty much not seen before in my uh little career here of investing I'm going to go to May 31st just go out a little bit further potentially see if I can get some luck on getting filled for the 22 1/2 again I'm going to go again for 12 contracts here this is a little bit wider so I should get filled here for 36 although the volume is lower the bid ask spread here is more wide if I went for a 36 it should give me a little bit of advantage to actually get filled so I just went for. 35 and um what I realized here is this is actually a Robin Hood error. so let me know how many shares paler do you guys have what's your current investment strategy and what is your average cost on paler I'm really curious to know and if you want more videos on paler make sure that you're subscribed with bell notifications on and I'll have more news for you coming up soon have an awesome blessed and amazing day"",",,,

Invest with Henry,FTNlMC4n8x8,2024-05-06T22:37:52Z,27X Your Money With CHEAP Option Strategy,Tesla,now I'm going to show you a little bit of variation on this strategy and um another example so I'm going to use Tesla Tesla is really good because it has a lot of implied volatility so let's say that you think Tesla is going to stay around $170 per share what you really want to understand is again the only important thing is that a stock just stands at the same price if it's not going up or down a lot and it's just staying flat beautiful so here you'll see that Tesla recently had earnings so it's unlikely to move a lot so this is actually a perfect strategy to use once the stock has had earnings it's just moving sideways you can basically do this again so I'll go to trade Tesla options you think that Tesla is going to end at 175 if Tesla just goes up a little bit you may decide to cut this position if Tesla moves up to towards 177 you're going to see a big big profit you're going to two three or four extra money here in this scenario,0.9,0.7
Invest with Henry,FTNlMC4n8x8,2024-05-06T22:37:52Z,27X Your Money With CHEAP Option Strategy,Palantir,I want to show you the third strategy which is going to be on paler this is a really good stock because paler specifically if we look at the chart right here has actually had a very big bullish run but now again it's also trending sideways so I'm actually going to show you a put strategy where you can put in very little and literally squeeze out multiple times what you put in I actually currently already have a position that I'm slightly down on but my options are making money so that's good my options typically make make money even when the stock goes down now let me show you how this put strategy works and there's actually several put strategies I would run on palen here right now so in my opinion paler is not likely to go below this area of $13 per share and that is just because as you can see right here back in June of 2023 there was a very good support level and then another double support level back in August and then another double support back in September and literally now in 2024 I think that paler is going to have a pretty good return and I don't think that it's going to fall below $13 in fact I think it's going to stay around the $16 mark it could go up I'm not sure but the strategy that I'm going to use right now is actually going to have a very big benefit even if paler just Trends sideways if paler goes up which is my assumption you are actually going to profit if paler were to go past like $25 per share you would start to experience a 2x on your money you know very very quickly and you can actually close out this position in say 30 days so if paler were to have a pretty big move you could exit out of it for around these areas of $20 per share literally if pal here were to stand still for a couple of weeks since these two options or these three options are actually expiring in March you can actually experience a very short-term big gain and then you can cut the position early there's no reason to actually hold on to a position you know longer than than needed especially for buying strategies like these since you are buying some of these options it can get really complex and that is why some of these strategies are more difficult to manage and why they are not my preferred number one strategy however this is one of the best strategies for really growing a small account super fast although again hard to manage now the profit that I'm typically going after on a buying strategy is going to be anywhere from 10 to 20% in under 30 days but honestly another strategy that I use and this is going to be a bonus strategy is going to be the pmcc strategy so I would do something like let's say I'm going to buy a call at $8 now this is really interesting because this is a different way of doing things typically when people buy leap options they go for in the money you can also do out of the money so I can buy an 18 and then in the shorter term I can sell options so let's say I go for slightly less like 3 months out and I go to actually sell a call and I sell something like let's say the 19 strike price right here you can see how you get a very big actual profit here where you are more than doubling your money so you're putting up $167 but you're making $180 so you can actually double your money here this can really happen in a shorter amount of time because although this option is expiring like quite a bit out and so is this one you're not going to realize the full profit but if Palance stock goes in this direction these options will start to profit very quickly and say for example that you make $80 on 167 so you get a 50% return in 3 to 6 weeks what I would do is I would just cut that position because again I don't want to get greedy if I get a 50% return in you know 3 to 6 weeks roughly again it depends on a few factors like you definitely want to look at the technical analysis and for example if the stock goes up and the RSI goes from like 42 to 62 then I know that the stock is kind of overheating and if I made a good enough return in a short amount of time it's basically an emotional decision where I will decide to cut the position now I also want to use technical indicators that I don't commonly discuss called the ichimoku cloud with you guys and I want to show you an example that I was 100% correct on on this exact stock where I made so much money in the past 5 months in a row actually using the ichimoku cloud so pay attention to this example if you really want to get this strategy correct I want to show you something really interesting and really new so with paler what I'm looking at right now is an indicator the ichimoku cloud and essentially paler has been inside this Cloud for some time now of course if you're watching this video in the future you can still apply the same principles of these three strategies that I'm going to show you today to the Future Okay so taking a look it's inside the cloud and for me what that means is it's likely to continue trading within a specific range so I've done a lot of research into paler obviously it is a good company Long Term but in the short term I do think it's going to stall out and specifically if I go to the indicator RSI we're also going to take a look that the RSI is somewhere in between 20 and 80 so you know I believe that paler is going to stall out for the short term now if a company like paler is going to stall out there's actually a phenomenal strategy where you can make tons of money and I mean 25x return so let's open up this position it's going to be a little bit complicated and I will warn you that this strategy is a bit harder to manage there's a whole lot to it however if you get it right obviously there is some really really huge rewards so what I'm going to first do is I'm going to go to uh sell I'm going to sell a $115 call option now what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy a call option I'm going to go down lower okay so I'm going to go down into the 13 and2 strike right here and I'm also going to go up into the 16 strike right here now this is going to look a little bit weird because the position setup is not ready and basically what I'm doing right here is this 15 strike is actually the anchor it's the top of the Christmas tree if you will it's the very peak of where you think this stock is going to trade and I picked 15 again because when I look at the technical analysis I really think that pound here is going to stay within the cloud right now so if I go to custom order and I go to uh customize you want to make sure that you have an equal amount of cells for each body,0.95,0.8
Invest with Henry,YsbOiSiNYbQ,2024-05-04T16:03:52Z,SPY - How to Profitably Trade it,SPY,"all right guys I was just taking a look at my results for spy how I've been trading SPY in my Robin Hood portfolio and let me tell you something I've been extremely profitable selling spy options as well as just generally trading SPY it's one of the most predictable things to trade it's one of the safest ETFs has amazing volume and in today's video I'm going to talk about why you can technically just trade spy you don't really need any single stocks you don't really need anything else you can just trade spy and make consistent income whether that's $5,000 a month $1,000 a month or even more just trading SPY so let me talk about high level what Spy is real quick it's basically an ETF that has 500 of the biggest companies in the United States so that includes Goldman Sachs that includes Apple Amazon Google Microsoft it includes caterpillar includes some healthcare companies like Johnson and Johnson it basically includes everything so you don't actually need that much diversification in your portfolio or any at all if you just have spy so the simplest spy strategy that you can sell actually I'm going to talk about multiple I'm going to talk about zero DTE Trading to talk about covered calls on spy selling puts on spy now I'm going to show you the mechanics of how to actually go about SPY trading to make a consistent income and really the most important thing is not to lose money because spy is the safest if you trade single stocks they have a lot more volatility whereas spy there really isn't a whole lot of volatility now sure the markets do go down but in the long term it's very hard to lose money on spy it's practically impossible over a long enough time Horizon 2 years 3 years to lose money and many of my retirees the students that I work with they're just trading SPY and QQQ by the way spy and QQQ are both very similar just QQQ has a bigger focus on technology companies rather spy has a little bit more variety all right I'm going to show you what Spy one of my favorite strategies is right now now I'm going to show you a small account strategy a medium account strategy and a large account strategy in this video so you truly in for the best spy video hands down so trade spy options actually I want to show you my history all right I want to be transparent about my history on spy so I want to show you what recently had happened because right now I am trading some Zer DT options on spy so right here you will see that I've been doing daily actually so let me show you what this looks like so that's 2023 2023 let's go to 20 actually I just started I was actually doing this on QQQ I'll actually show you both in this video so uh spy so sell spy 4.99 put option I collected $494 on April 18th and then as soon as um this expired I just waited a little bit and then I sold uh for $646 but you can actually make this a daily income strategy I'm going to actually show you what that looks like on QQQ like I said QQQ and spy they're essentially the same thing so whether you trade one or the other it's really not it's really not that big of a deal so here's my QQQ I've traded it so many many days in a row where I was consistently profitable so if I go to show more you can see here how I ended up doing there a lot of Trades just pay attention here promise you this is going to be totally worth it back on uh March 6th I sold a put and made 162 I sold another put on the 11th made 575 then I sold some more puts made 4,845 1180 780 1145 620 780 780 and then I did end up um having a small loss of I got a signed here at 431 and I ended up selling um the stock at $4 43083 so I lost $17 so I lost about almost $300 but that doesn't matter 780 780 620 this is my consistent daily income strategy basically here's what I do this is the most interesting thing when the Market opens up it's unlikely to fall 1% after 10:00 a.m. okay listen to that one more time after 10: a.m. if the market is up a percent it's unlikely to end the day at Flats if it's down 1% it's unlikely to end the day at -2% if it's down 2% it's unlikely to end at -3% at 10:00 a.m. is the most important inflection point because the first 30 minutes of trading in the option Market or just in the General stock market as a whole is the most volatile so after the first 30 minutes you get a really good sense of where the market direction is after that point so once 10: a.m. hits you can just sell a put option that is about 1% out of the money so let me show you what that looks like so if I were to go to spy right now and I were to go to trade spy options this would be my zero DTE strategy I would go to sell put option okay now I would just sell a put option that is 1% down what is 1% of 507 well it's $57 okay so I would just basically go down by $5 that means that that would be about 502 so if I look at 502 right now yes this is not a big return however this is like the most safest return ever because I'll just do this on every single day basis there's a little bit of a caveat I typically only cover this in my Discord Community but you can actually use margin to collect free income on spy it's a little bit more advanced don't worry about it but I would sell options here whether it's using margin for free the way I do it or just basically selling it every single day for a daily income so if I were to sell 10 contracts here this would be $350 per day now yes you need a large amount of money which is why the next strategy I want to talk about is going to be um a different income strategy on spy which uses a smaller amount of money so I would go for something like one week out for example spy has the best the best best expiration days they're basically every single day so I would go for something that is one week out and then I would just go for something out of the money again we can go for 500 we can go a little bit lower here in this example the Delta is. 31 which is a little bit High to be honest with you so maybe I would go a little bit lower I would go to like let's say 498 okay still a pretty high Delta but at the same time it's spy it's the most safest um ETF to trade so I would do this 25 Delta I would basically sell a put option okay I'm going to sell this put option right here and and then I'm going to buy another put option okay this is going to be called a put credit spread so I'm going to go for 498 I'm going to go down to 495 so I'm going to open up this position right here you can see that the max profit here is $43 and I'm only risking $257 so look 43 over 250 that's basically a 16% return I know that because 4 * 250 is 1,000 4 * 443 is about 172 so it's actually a 177% return you're getting 177 % in 7 Days 7 Days 177% amazing amazing amazing amazing granted you don't want to put your whole portfolio into this this is a position where you would put 5 to 10% of your money okay so putting 5 to 10% of your money here easy play easy money this is the second strategy that I would use to profitably make money on spy now the next strategy that I would use okay would be very very simple actually you can actually buy call options on spy as well now you guys know I'm not the biggest call option buyer however I would just simply buy some leap options on spy so for me I would pick a leap option that would be you know probably between 6 months to 12 months okay I want to give spy some time to actually rise in value so I would pick something like let's say we're going to go to the end of the year so end of 2024 we're going to go to end of 2024 and just buy a call option now I would buy a call option that would probably be a little bit in the money because the whole point of doing this strategy is I don't want to buy 100 shares of spy that's $50,000 you may not have $50,000 laying around so instead um what you can do is you can put a very small fraction of that for example you can go for an at money option right here instead of buying spy for 50 Grand does that make sense why would you pay 50 grand for spy if you have a big portfolio it may make sense if you have a medium-sized portfolio or a small portfolio it does not make any sense so what I would do instead is I would just buy a call option now I'd buy a call option I would spend 3.5k boom I would wait it out I would just wait it out until December and I would wait for the stock well the ETF to rise and here the break even is 539 spy can easily go to 539 he can go to 550 he can go to 560 and by the way you do not have to hold this option until expiration you do not have to my uh approach to spy would just be to hold this option position one month to five or 6 months because as you hold the option until expiration time DK does kick in okay the the Theta will kick in it'll start to to lose some of its value a little bit faster so in the first 1 to 3 months it's not going to lose any value honestly the Theta here is going to be extremely extremely low so you can see here the Theta is 09 which is actually not that low that's actually $9 a day so what Theta means is the daily DK of the option so right here at a $9 Theta is $9 per day but this ETF can move easily by multiple dollars which would be multiple hundreds of dollars so you're spending $9 essentially to rent out this call option you're basically renting a call option but if spy goes up then you are making hundreds of dollars so as long as it is bullish and it's a good year you're going to make a lot more money by buying a call option versus just owning shares now the next thing that I do want to show you with spy is another strategy that is going to be called The Bull call spread okay this is a also referred to as a debit call spread it's basically where you are buying a call option then you're selling another call option to subsidize and make buying a call option a lot cheaper okay so let's actually make this a lot cheaper by for example let's buy a call option for August 16 okay so we're going to buy something let's say we're pretty bullish we think it's going to go just up to 520 so we're moderately bullish okay we're not super bullish we're not bearish we're not neutral we're moderately bullish okay which is by the way the best strategy for spy because spy typically moves up 10% per year okay on average the stock market makes between 8 to 12% per year so if spy just moves up a few percentage points from here till 2024 right until the end okay or even in the next two three months this this option expires in four months so if it goes up 2 or 3% here's what you would do you would essentially want to buy a 515 call option okay this is kind of expensive it's $1,500 for 4 months okay but now you can go ahead and sell a call option and you know basically make this a lot cheaper a lot lot cheaper okay so you can go from $15 and then now you're selling a $12 uh call option now this is only going to cost you about $264 and the benefit is you basically can double your money so if spy goes to 520 which is not really that big of a move you will double your money in this example now I would hold this position until expiration unless in the last week we're not even close then you would cut this and take a loss so this is a kind of risky position because you're going to only win about 45% of the time but if you do win you're going to double your money so that actually the math actually doesn't make a lot of sense the only way this makes sense is if you're personally bullish but at the same time these thetas uh these Deltas these thetas these Greeks are not always correct so it says there's about a 43% chance of this happening but if you logically think about the market moving up it's more likely than 43% to move up on a long-term basis if you do research again the market goes up 10% so because we're almost halfway through 2024 in 6 months it's going to move up by about 5% that's the best guess promise you that is the best guess you can talk to many people it's going to go down it's going to go up who's right nobody knows if you were to actually take an average halfway Mark of a year what's going to happen for the end of the year in six more months is going to go up about 5% that would be the most logical guess in any given year so look some lessons learned about spy is there's many strategies that you can trade on spy whether it's a bull call spread whether it's just selling puts or even covered calls by the way a sell put and a covered call is very similar that's basically the same thing because you're putting up about the same amount of capital you're collecting about the same amount of income so whether you sell a put on spy which by the way the

Invest with Henry,1qeHyEQxBEI,2024-04-27T20:05:13Z,"Breaking NIO NEWS: I Had to BUY More after Making $1,700 on $10,000",NIO,"I'm going to cover some breaking news on Neo as well as what I just did so I haven't made a video on Neo in over a year but 6 days ago I said I bought the stock with proof in the last video for $3.80 I titled the video I put $110,000 into Neo and I actually made 177% in one week just on the stock as well as some more money on the options I waited over a year to finally make this video when I thought Neo reached the bottom and I delivered the biggest results your maret in one trade actually more than the average stock market return per year in just one week you're welcome please subscribe and let's continue with my logic and thought process of why I invested in Neo so to recap the stock went from over $8 per share to under $4 so I've been completely right about not being invested in it due to multiple concerns that I've had for some time now however I had a feeling and I analyzed a perfect entry and I just put $10,000 into neostock at $3.80 per share and I begun buying up even more shares now the biggest piece of news is Neo and Lotus entered into a strategic partnership on charging and Battery swapping they're listed on NASDAQ as lot they're a luxury electric vehicle maker EV maker as well and they're majority owned by Gil holding the two companies will be working together on battery standards charging and battery swap technology battery asset management and operations it's a whole lot of stuff and all this came out in a statement posted on the Neo app the two companies will also collaborate in areas including the development and customization of charging and battery swap enabled models and charging connectivity according to the statement this is very big news and in addition to already making $1,700 myself and for my Discord members which is the first link in the description it's a free call you can set up on just $10,000 I mean we made $1,700 and I decided right now that this was kind of a tough decision but I've decided to buy more shares and continue to add to my position because I'm actually building a lot of confidence right now and this is actually due to two main reasons not one the first one is Neil emphasized its robust infrastructure for replenishment highlighting its status as the automotive leader in China with the highest number of proprietary charging and battery swap facilities according to data as of April 25th Neo boasted 2,44 battery swap stations across China including 790 strategically positioned along highways Additionally the company operates 2,25 charging stations equipped with 10,066 charging points along with 1,574 destination charging stations providing get it 11,941 charging points that is a whole lot for the end consumer now notably Neo's charging infrastructure is inclusive welcoming all electric vehicle users with more than 80% of the power catering to non Neo branded EVS that's really important because they're making money not just from their own brand and they're very consistent and also what's consistent is its prior announcements Neo's extensive infrastructure for charging and Battery swapping is crucial for overcoming range anxiety promoting widespread adoption of electric vehicles and fostering a collaborative approach to sustained transportation in China now guys China needs robust charging and Battery swapping infrastructure for electric vehicles because it has the largest Automotive Market globally and faces significant air pollution and emission challenges with the governments push towards electrification to combat pollution and reduce Reliance on fossil fuels widespread adoption of EVS is essential a comprehensive charging Network alleviates concerns about range limitations encouraging more people to switch to electric vehicles and contributing to China's environmental goals I recently saw this short clip which also contributed to my purchase the Chinese have created a car that thanks to its innovative suspension can do incredible things on a comparative test we see that the luxury Maybach s580 worth more than $220,000 is trying to drive through bumps at the same time there are many glasses of booze on the hood of course no matter how luxurious and comfortable the car is it is unlikely that it will be able to do this without spilling a drop but as soon as the test queue reaches Neo et9 something incredible happens all this is thanks to its intelligent Skyride chassis with active electrohydraulic suspension which allows the 707 horsepower electric vehicle to shake off snow and overcome bumps on the roads as smoothly as possible the Neo et9 cost just over $110,000 the main reason I purchased the stock is it's trading at pretty much the same value as the cash that Neo has on hand so the company is now valued the same as the cash which means there's actually no premium for the brand or any of the future sales it's really just valued the same as cash which is pretty insane if you think about it now looking at some competitors the landscape is a little bit rough right now Lee Auto announced last week that they're basically saying we're not focusing on massive growth we're just focused on user loyalty we also see Tesla coming down significantly with lots of vol in the market as predicted with the pullback and taking a focus on Neo we knew that this was going to happen well at least they knew that this was going to happen and they actually plan for this accordingly they raised money last year and this was a very smart thing to do because that's what you need to do to get through an economic slowdown and the world is essentially in a recession although it doesn't feel like it because the US government printed a lot of money and just now spending tons of this money now Neo is in an interesting place right now as an investment and that's why I decided to buy shares and I think it's really important for you to listen up to this even if you're not invested in Neo this has a lot to do with the industry as a whole from one hand I've been asked so many questions on my Discord Community from my members like why do so many people have electric cars and they're switching back to fuel cars again will this be the end for Neo Tesla and other EV maker stocks the main concern people mention is the range of vehicles the main concern people mention is the range of electric vehicles however Neo has 400 km range the fact that some people go back to gas cars is actually Irrelevant in my opinion due to changing laws in economics which are going to force more people into electric cars in the long term they will eventually switch back because of these factors number one the charging and electric cars will just get better overall I mean the charging is going to be longer distance the charging is going to be faster and you know number two the prices for electric cars is going to be cheaper the prices are going to continue to go down because there is economies of scale there's also Innovation so the price of electric vehicles is going to keep getting lower and more economical which is going to make more sense for the end consumer now number three the gas car that they want/ need will no longer be available except as used because eventually there are a lot of laws that are changing and even with sports cars like Lamborghini Ferrari Porsche they are going towards electric vehicles and they're getting rid of they pure gas cars slowly and surely now whether that's a good thing or a bad thing the laws are going towards that direction so being invested in electric vehicles makes a lot of sense at least having a portion of your portfolio allocated to this area now number four gas stations will switch to Electric charging or basically go out of business in the future making gas cars harder to refill this is kind of crazy to think about because a lot of us still drive gas cars but with the trend with how laws are and many other reasons gas stations are are just not going to make economic sense so there's going to be less gas stations and as there's less gas stations people are not going to find it as convenient to drive a gas car and they're naturally going to switch and that's why right now we see a lot of early adoption with electric vehicles then you see more people adopting it and then you know at the very end of the cycle just everyone else adopts it because it just makes the most sense you're almost weird in a late adoption cycle for not having something for example like imagine not having social media at this point or not having a smartphone like still having a flip phone most people have already adopted to smartphones the internet internet of things and other brands that just make sense so this is another adoption cycle now Neo is a major player in the electric vehicle industry which is experiencing rapid growth due to increasing environmental concerns and government regulations favoring EV adoption although this isn't even close to my main play or what I typically trade there are a few things here to really understand and consider Neo is known for its innovative approach to EV design and Technology they offer features such as battery swapping autonomous driving capabilities by the way I'm super bullish on autonomous driving because me myself like I have a car out here in Europe but I don't always want to drive it so sometimes I just take Uber cuz it saves me time now imagine if you have an autonomous vehicle that can drive you to work you can save so much time and be more productive and that's going to increase output and GDP and more people are going to want to use their time to make more money or just have leisure time instead of actually driving their vehicle autonomous driving will be super cheap and for example you know companies like Tesla will even create autonomous driving vehicles that can pick you up without having a driver so that's going to be amazing because the cost is going to be super low now I'll be it I don't even know if I would get into a car without a driver but eventually it's going to be safer if not already safer than having a human driver and look the advancement of connectivity is also a really big factor here which could give um Neo a very good Competitive Edge in the market because they have all this Innovation they have this technology and I think they have a really strong brand Neo has been successful in building a strong brand image and cultivating a customer loyalty basically their customers are coming back and especially with battery swapping although you know there's some issues with battery swapping you know maybe it takes some time there is a lot of Customer Loyalty there because they're coming back to get their vehicle service to get a battery swap to charge the battery and they keep seeing the brand and that's actually a really good thing for the brand overall now their focus on providing high quality products excellent customer service and creating a community around their brand has helped them establish a dedicated customer base now for me kind of what I said earlier Lee Auto is focusing on Customer Loyalty well this is really smart because having customers come back is pretty much the most important thing in every single business whether it's a restaurant whether it's Apple iPhone whether it's a vehicle even if it's a long sales cycle like people buy a vehicle every 3 to 5 years or even much more than that right A lot of people can wait 10 years but still it's really important to have a loyal customer base that keeps coming back for more just like you guys that are subscribed to this channel I really appreciate you for supporting this channel watching the videos I'm always trying to educate you as much as possible and help you make money now this brand recognition that Neo has and loyalty can translate into sustainable sales and market share growth which could positively influence the company's stock performance over the long period of time now of course right now the stock has gone down a lot and people who are holding a stock have felt a lot of pain however me my members you guys hopefully haven't felt any pain because well I'm not in this stock I am just buying the stock right now after not being in the stock for a very very long time I finally see that the stock has pulled back enough to display its value right when it's worth as much as it's cash on hand now I can imagine myself well you know I put $110,000 but I can imagine myself buying a bit more I can really see myself dollar cost averaging over time I'm going to wait and see and give you guys an update but the fact of the matter is I mainly look for loyalty and customer experience in a company that I invest in and that's Apple Apple has great customer loyalty and Neo I actually noticed the same thing I used to think that I had to wait until you know the stock was basically at its very bottom but the truth is I really don't know which is why I'm only beginning to invest small amounts of money into neostock and basically dollar cost averaging my cash I also want to take a look at some Neo options so let's jump into my portfolio and take a look at potential trades I'm going to be using my Robin Hood portfolio although I don't have Neo in this portfolio I like to trade options on Robin Hood more than my other portfolio as the trading costs are much less or pretty much non-existent so looking at Neo it's actually under $4 per share so if I go to year-to dat performance stock is down 50% % amazing cuz I don't have a position on it so I'm happy to see a stock fall down when I don't have a position in it that's actually a good thing cuz this stock has become a lot cheaper it's become basically what I think is a value company now if I look at the 5-year chart this stock has done a whole lot of action I mean when I was recommending this stock back in you know 2020 actually when I was making videos in 2020 this stock was a $4 stock this is where I was buying it at I had a little bit of shares at 350 and then you know I had some trouble here as it kind of fell down and believe it or not actually when I bought this stock at $4 I myself was panicking when it went down to 267 this was actually a very stressful time however I kept holding the stock and I started selling it basically I wasn't smart enough to sell at 61 I'm not going to lie to you I just started selling it at in the 40s right so when when this big dip started to happen I really got out of this stock quite a lot you know I was still a little bit bullish on it in the short term I was trading it but essentially I lost a lot of confidence once 2022 hit and I haven't really touched it for a very very long time I mean I dabbled in it small amounts but now I can finally see that it's at a 52- we low I mean this stock is right at its 52 we low if I show you right now 52 we low is $371 currently the stock is at$ 379 here's what I would recommend if you are still cautious about this stock I would do this I would sell a put option that is out of the money for example I'm going to go sell put I'm going to go to something that's out of the money I can go to June 21 you're watching this in the future just find itself a good value now unfortunately that doesn't have the best strike prices you can see here how we don't have a $3 strike price might have to play around a little bit go to July July see if July has a $3 strike price it does right here you can see that this is a 90 days to expiration as I would open up this position and the $3 strike right here has decent volume has really high implied volatility this is insanely High implied volatility the bids spread is actually really really good so this is a fantastic option to trade and if I were to sell this put option right here you can see how I'm collecting $26 I'm risking $274 which is almost a 10% return in 3 months on an annualized basis if I were to do this trade four times per year I would make almost 40% on my money this is a fantastic return this is basically two times more than Warren Buffett gets Warren Buffett gets about a 20% return selling put options on Neo can get you a 40% return of course we want the stock not to crash but at the same time if you think about it this stock is already trading for its cash value it's worth $3.79 I'm selling a $3 put which means that you still have a lot more cushion in fact this stock could fall 20% down it'll go 20% down and this would still be an out ofth money option because 20% of $3.79 is going to be like roughly 75 so 75 cents lower is going to be $34 so we are going to be still out of the money the $3 strike is going to be out of the money even if this stock Falls 20% lower so in my opinion this is a no-brainer trade especially if you have a small account portfolio or if you just want to have some exposure to electric vehicles or China or whatever you don't have to put a lot of money into this or any money at all cuz I'm not a financial adviser I'm just telling you what I'm doing with my money sharing some advice here.",1.0,0.8

Neo is in an interesting place right now as an investment and that's why I decided to buy shares and I think it's really important for you to listen up to this even if you're not invested in Neo this has a lot to do with the industry as a whole will this be the end for Neo Tesla and other EV maker stocks however Neo has 400 km range now Neo is a major player in the electric vehicle industry which is experiencing rapid growth due to increasing environmental concerns and government regulations favoring EV adoption Although this isn't even close to my main play or what I typically trade there are a few things here to really understand and consider Neo is known for its innovative approach to EV design and Technology they offer features such as battery swapping autonomous driving capabilities which could give um Neo a very good Competitive Edge in the market because they have all this Innovation they have this technology and I think they have a really strong brand NE has been successful in building a strong brand in image and cultivating a customer loyalty basically their customers are coming back and especially with battery swapping although you know there's some issues with battery swapping you know maybe it takes some time there is a lot of Customer Loyalty there because they're coming back to get their vehicle service to get a battery swap to charge the battery and they keep seeing the brand and that's actually a really good thing for the brand overall now they're focus on providing high quality products excellent customer service and creating a community around their brand has helped them establish a dedicated customer base This brand recognition that Neo has and loyalty can translate into sustainable sales and market share growth which could positively influence the company's stock performance over the long period of time now of course right now the stock has gone down a lot and people who are holding a stock have felt a lot of pain however me my members you guys hopefully haven't felt any pain because well I'm not in this stock I am just buying the stock right now after not being in the stock for a very very long time I finally see that the stock has pulled back enough to display its value right when it's worth as much as it's cash on hand now I can imagine myself well you know I put $10,000 but I can imagine myself buying a bit more I can really see myself dollar cost averaging over time I'm going to wait and see and give you guys an update but the fact of the matter is I mainly look for loyalty and customer experience in a company that I invest in and that's Apple Apple has great customer loyalty and Neo actually noticed this same thing I used to think that I had to wait until you know the stock was basically at its very bottom but the truth is I really don't know which is why I'm only beginning to invest small amounts of money into Neo stock and basically dollar cost averaging my cash I also want to take a look at some Neo options so let's jump into my portfolio and take a look at potential trades so looking at Neo it's it's actually under $4 per share so if I go to year-to dat performance stock is down 57% amazing cuz I don't have a position on it so I'm happy to see a stock fall down when I don't have a position in it that's actually a good thing cuz this stock has become a lot cheaper and it's become basically what I think is a value company now if I look at the 5-year chart this stock has done a whole lot of action I mean when I was recommending this stock back in you know 2020 actually when I was making videos in 2020 this stock was a $4 stock this is where I was buying it at I had a little bit of shares at 350 and then you know I had some trouble here as it kind of fell down and believe it or not actually when I bought the stock at $4 I myself was panicking when it went down to 267 this was actually a very stressful time however I kept holding the stock and I started selling it basically I wasn't smart enough to sell at 61 I'm not going to lie to you I just started selling it at in the 40s right so when when this big dip started to happen I really got out of this stock quite a lot you know I was still a little bit bullish on it in the short term I was trading it but essentially I lost a lot of confidence once 2022 hit and I haven't really touched it for very very long time I mean I've dabbled in it small amounts but now I can finally see that it's at a 52 we low I mean this stock is right at its 52 we low if I show you right now the 52 we low is $371 currently the stock is at$ 379 here's what I would recommend if you were still cautious about this stock I would do this I would sell a put option that is out of the money for example I'm going to go sell put I'm going to go to something that's out of the money I can go to June 21 you're watching this in the future just find itself a good value now unfortunately that doesn't have the best strike prices you can see here how we don't have a $3 strike price might have to play around a little bit go to July see if July has a $3 strike price it does right here you can see that this is a 90 days to expiration as I would open up this position and the $3 strike right here has decent volume has really high imply volatility this is insanely High implied volatility the bids spread is actually really really good so this is a fantastic option to trade and if I were to sell this put option right here you can see how I'm collecting $26 I'm risking $274 which is almost a 10% return in 3 months on an annualized basis if I were to do this Trade four times per year I would make almost 40% on my money this is a fantastic return this is basically two times more than Warren Buffett gets Warren Buffett gets about a 20% return selling put options on Neo can get you a 40% return of course we want the stock not to crash but at the same time if you think about it this stock is already trading for its cash value it's worth $3.79 I'm selling a $3 put which means that you still have a lot more Cush in fact this stock could fall 20% down it'll go 20% down and this would still be an outof the- money option because 20% of $3.79 is going to be like roughly 75 so 75 C lower is going to be $34 so we are going to be still out of the money the $3 strike is going to be out of the money even if the stock Falls 20% lower so in my opinion this is a no-brainer trade especially if you have a small account portfolio or if you just want to have some exposure to electric vehicles or China or whatever you don't have to put a lot of money into this or any money at all cuz I'm not a financial adviser I'm just telling you what I'm doing with my money sharing some advice here",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,4Y4rfffeZCQ,2024-04-18T23:37:59Z,Credit Spread | ONLY RISK $50 (Beginners),Apple,"for example if I go to Apple and I go to let's just say we do year-to dat year to date apple is showing some really good support especially here at the $169 level so the stock has bounced up a little bit and down of course but overall it's showing a really strong sign of support therefore this is a good indicator and also just a good stock in general because when you sell a put credit spread for example and you collect in right away you want to make sure that that income is yours and the position doesn't go against you you can't always control if the stock goes against you or goes down but you ideally want to pick a stock with really strong support therefore if it does go down it doesn't go down by that much and it doesn't go into your strike zone so for example if I were to trade Apple you can see here that it has very strong support right now at $168 per share it's basically trading at a year-to-date low so you definitely want to find a stock that is either at a 52- we low or at a 3month low you want it to be below the moving average you just want it to be sold off you want a stock to be valued cheaply whether that's a support level whether that's other indicators you want to find a stock that you really like okay so I'm going to go to sell put now for expiration day you can go for numerous different expirations for me I prefer two to 6 weeks now you can also go for really short-term one-day trades that's fine you can also go really long-term if you go long-term that's also okay but the sweet spot again is in the middle don't go for extremes so you can go for something like 15 days out okay that's basically 2 weeks now what you can do is obviously you can sell something that's really close to the money you can be aggressive you can actually have a really high return here but the risk wouldn't be so low so if I were to sell a 1672 put right here and I were to buy the 165 you know I've seen Traders do this you know when I was working on Wall Street I would see some Traders basically going for higher risk reward and yes sometimes they would have big days I mean I've seen I've sat next to a Trader that's had a $156,000 gain in one day I mean he was a very aggressive Trader but he also had plenty of down days and in fact he would have multiple days where he would just lose 15,000 18,000 I've seen him lose $28,000 once in a single day so you know that's pretty bad because that's his living right every single day he's trying to make money and he also has expense to sit on the New York Stock Exchange but anyways long story short you can go for more aggressive play so for example right here you will see that the max profit is $103 and you're risking 147 but the chances of loss here are just a little bit too high as you can see the the break even is right here at 16647 which is okay I mean this is not a bad trade by no means but what I would do instead is I would just go a little bit out of the money so one thing that I learned at Goldman Sachs was that going out of the money and just selling out of the money options in general works I mean I've seen it not just that Goldman I've also seen it through my own research I've seen it through asking my professors back a long time ago when I was studying doing research and I had access to Bloomberg I had access to other softwares where I was really deeply diving into back testing so back testing option strategies that make money and overall what I saw was when I'm you know going to go for a poit spread I want to go for something that's out of the money ideally um it's a 20 Delta however or even less even a 15 Delta but you know I will say that something like like apple that has good support I would go more aggressive so you can adjust the strategy you don't always want to just go for 14 or 15 Delta you can also dial up the risk a little bit and use appropriate position sizing and asset allocation this is something that is not talked about YouTube because frankly people don't understand risk management they don't have a finance degree that haven't worked on Wall Street as long as I have you really need to understand that risk management is the most important thing for any strategy if you're doing spreads especially because at the end of the day a spread is a good growth strategy it is amazing it uses a small amount of money you can risk $50 you can even risk $35 as the example that I just showed you but the problem is it is not as safe as just selling a put or going after some safer strategies a put credit spread is a medium risk High reward strategy because of this you need to make sure that you don't put too much into a single position so here's what I would personally do I would sell a 165 put option right here and you can go down to 162 and a half for example but for me I prefer to go down to 160 now some people say well why don't you just do two times more the 165 and the 162 right why don't you do 10 of these instead of five of these well it really kind of depends let's look at both scenarios okay first of all let's just look at the $25 spread here the maximum profit is 83 and the maximum loss is 172 this is about a 50% return okay so ask yourself and tell me why do you think this right now has a lower return why is this not 50% why is this lower so think about it I'll give you the answer right now the reason why the 160 is lower right why this spread is actually giving you a lower profit you may think to yourself well wow this is not a good of a trade actually you would be wrong this is actually a better trade the reason why it's better is there's a higher chance that Apple could go down to 1625 than it can go down to 160 60 is less likely meaning this is actually safer okay if you were to do 10 of these and apple went down to 1625 you would lose 100% of the spread okay now if it went down to U 162 a half but you have the current position which I have here open 165 160 you will only lose 50% and in fact you would have a pretty small loss well relatively small because you're collecting 142 it would be down to 250 so your actual loss wouldn't be as much it would not even be close to 100% it wouldn't even be 50% so in this scenario right here I prefer to do $5 spreads now of course it's really important to understand the direction of the stock because the direction is the most important thing to make money now you naturally want a high win rate so the more you go out to the money the lower you go the higher you will have as your natural win rate and that's because normally stocks move up down but on average they're going to move about nowhere they're going to go sideways so in a two-e period if you are selling out of the money options you are going to have a naturally High win rate you are definitely going to win more than 50% in fact if I show you the Delta right here you are expected to win this 65% of the time that's because the Delta is 35 so there's a chance of 35% chance of this happening and a 65% chance of this not happening so if you want to make consistent income you will go for outof the money options however if you want to have a big income you go closer to the money so you need to find a balance and this is exactly why I do have a Discord community and I'm always trading and teaching you because you need to find balance there is no perfect rule to trading anybody that says they have a perfect formula to trading is completely lying you need to understand this game is very similar to sports to life to mathematics and to Art you need to have intuition experience and you need to understand and learn from your mistakes consistently so look when you set this position up here's how you would manage it once you have set this position the best way to manage this position is by leaving it alone you can monitor it for sure you can take a look at it but ideally what happens is the stock does not go down into your red area now it can go down a little bit and you may want to close it however I would urge you or recommend you not to close this position because in my experience and from the research that I have done it is a bigger return and I have a larger raw return okay I'm not saying volatility the volatility is higher the risk is potentially higher but you have the biggest raw return the best results when you do hold until expiration you want to let options time Decay kick in because a put credit spread is a selling strategy it is a credit you are collecting a credit you are making money instantaneously so when you open up this trade you immediately get at $142 now what you want to do though your account won't reflect that because you now have a negative $142 position in your portfolio what you need to happen is you need time DEC to kick in you need the option to start losing value as it loses value that's really good because you can buy this position back anytime that you wish you can make a profit however again I would recommend you that you just wait until expiration so if you wait the full 15 days and apple is above 16 five then you end up collecting the full amount of money but look the full amount of money that you collect is already yours but now the position actually leaves your account nothing else happens and you can do this again and you can basically do this position many times",1.0,0.7

Invest with Henry,4Y4rfffeZCQ,2024-04-18T23:37:59Z,Credit Spread | ONLY RISK $50 (Beginners),Tesla,"okay so let's look at Tesla now look Tesla is taking a nose dive it's currently in the money so this is going to be perfect if you want to see me roll this and how I use risk management and adjust this position this is a perfect perfect example especially because Tesla let's just take a look at Tesla real quick Tesla has recently really fallen down I mean the stock is taking a tumble for a number of reasons they do have earnings coming up in 5 days and overall my position which is not that big of a position is down a decent amount I'm down $1,260 so this position actually expires tomorrow which is pretty interesting so this is actually a perfect time to adjust and roll this position so look I can just let it expire I will lose some money okay or what I can do is I can close this position and open up another another position okay now some platforms will let you roll a spread some won't right here I cannot okay I'm just going to go for an example pretend that I'm I'm going to close this trade right now so I'm going to close this trade for example I will incur a $2,340 basically that's how much it costs but although I did collect income so if you look here I collected $1,360 when I opened this up a couple of weeks ago and now it's worth this much so my total loss is exactly negative you know $1,000 all right so this is what I can do I can first of all I can close that trade for negative a th000 and I can then sell another put now because Tesla has earnings I will probably hold this until tomorrow and if Tesla comes up tomorrow then I'll do it so I'm not actually going to close in this video just like we can just pretend that I closed that $1,000 for $1,000 loss personally I would hold uh one more day until expiration but okay so let's say I close this trade or let's say it's tomorrow and tomorrow I'm closing this trade um and I can go for a future date so let's say that I go for June 21 what I would do now is I would open up a very similar trade but my first trade right now is 150 140 now what I can do is I can go for a 140 so I can sell and then go for a 130 okay this is basically rolling down now if I go to continue and I go to 10 contracts you'll actually see here that I am more way more thaning up for the cost of buying back those shares in fact I'm losing $11,000 or 980 but I'm making $3,250 so in this video you're really understanding how I think about spreads because not only is it important to open up a spread properly with a stock that has support it's important to um have a high win rate it's important to risk low amounts of money it's important to specifically go for a spread that's five or in this case it's $10 spread it's 140 to 130 I decided to go a little bit more it's also very important to understand how to manage and close a position so the other position you can simply close and as you can see here I'm not closing it because I'm still bullish on Tesla a bit and it's kind of popping up here now above 150 so my loss is going to be less than 1,000 right now my loss is only 750 so you can see why I don't want to close it because I still personally have belief that this position is going to go um well so I am not closing it at the moment I'm going to wait until you know basically close of tomorrow I'm not going to rush this position whatsoever I'm going to keep monitoring the total return here and I am actually expecting to come out as a winner now again I don't I don't really know nobody knows um but for me I've had better results so I'm going to hold this position and uh and wait but you know going back if I you know go back here to the position that we did have open you can see that it was pretty favorable to go for a June 21 so going back to the June 21 and I go to the sell we had a uh 140 we had 14 40 130 this is going down so instead of 150 now I'm going to 140 so you can see here the break even is 136 whereas in the other scenario my break even was a lot higher it was like 149 or it was 150 right so I'm moving down um from 150 to 140 and from 140 to 130 this is how you would roll a put credit spread save yourself an issue of actually having any problems with assignment and assignment can happen it's not that likely it does become more likely if the stock sorry is between the two strike prices so for example if Tesla was at 1 36 right here they would be between 140 130 and it's the last day of expiration you have a high risk actually of assignment you want to close that position so I like to close uh the day of expiration the day before or the day of in this example I'm going to go for the day of so I'm going to wait until tomorrow",1.0,0.2
Invest with Henry,-sXmxNK1vlQ,2024-04-16T20:37:05Z,Urgent: I'm Buying PLTR Stock Now,Palantir,"now let's talk about Palante here so paler stock is pretty stable at $21.85 at the moment as I'm making this video and in early February or mid-February this stock went up a lot and it's actually a really good candidate for multiple strategies which I will discuss with volatility being high which pounds here does have pretty high volatility like actually if I go into one of the options I'm going to show you that it does have really good implied volatility the implied volatility is very very high like 59.87 if I go to a future option if I go to let's say August expiration volatility is 63 okay so very high volatility yet the stock is moving sideways this is actually a mismatch and a potential Arbitrage opportunity since paler has gone down a good amount I would just buy 100 shares I would literally just go 100 shares okay I would spend let's say $2,000 if you have a bigger portfolio then yeah go ahead and do 200 shares 300 shares just make sure you're doing it in lots of 100 let's say the pounder stock goes up you're taking some risk over the weekend either the stock can go down or the stock can go up if it goes up then fantastic right I mean you've made money on the stock on a covered call Cuz on a covered call you own shares so you would make money owning shares and then maybe instead of selling a 22 the following week you would just sell something like a 23 but at the same time it can also go down like it can after the weekend it can go to let's say 21 so now you're going to be like oh man like I can only sell a 21 A2 or maybe it goes down further like oh I can only sell 21 so you are taking directional risk when you hold stock through a weekend and you don't have options this probably likely means that paler has earnings since this Delta is a little too high for an out-of-the-money option with a short expiration date so yes confirmed it does have earnings cuz there is yeah I just took a look at the Delta there it makes no sense at all unless there's earnings which there is okay so May May 6 there's earnings okay that makes sense given there's an earnings period you may want to actually change your strategy here covered calls are still good by the way but um in an earnings period if you're bullish on the stock you want to give it more upside room okay so I mean there is a chance that pound here just like skyrockets to okay let's actually go back to May 17 there's a chance that it does Skyrocket a bit right you may want to go for something like the 25 strike okay so the 25 strike about a 33 Delta pretty good so if you were to sell this option right here you would get $97 which is roughly 5% return in 30 days now tell me 5% in 30 days pretty good isn't it like that's amazing 5% 30 days plus you get upside you get upside from 2185 to 25 so you can make basically make about $35 so $35 cents that's roughly 15% return plus 5% for this option premium like that's 20% in a month like tell me covered calls are not profitable covered calls are amazing and they're also pretty safe like what can really happen I mean paler could go up and you can lose your stock that's not a risk by the way that is not a risk because well it's a risk of losing your stock but is your net worth growing or is it decaying well it's growing like you became richer so like yeah you have a risk of losing the stock but that's like a risk of getting richer so what's the problem what I think will happen to the stock at earnings the stock will likely pop about 5% one way or the other I really don't know which way I try not to predict Direction on stocks anymore instead what I think will happen with paler is we're going to get a either 5% up 5% down now I will just say I'll just put it out there I am a bull on paler I think they have a lot of innovation I think the company has fantastic management this is also an AI play that's why I am bullish on paler and in fact I should have more paler in my portfolio I currently have a very small position and I need to add to this position I've just been a bit busy so what I want to do is personally I'm going to add to paler and you know as a recommendation or you know obviously I'm not a financial adviser I'm just giving you my viewpoint here I think covered calls is like the number one strategy right now in paler if you had to pick one I would probably do covered calls on paler and the reason why I would do covered calls on paler is because they have earnings",1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,-sXmxNK1vlQ,2024-04-16T20:37:05Z,Urgent: I'm Buying PLTR Stock Now,Apple,"if you are going to be selling puts I would sell puts on something like apple so apple is like one of my really big positions right now I have been bullish on Apple for some time and in the past week there was some you know people basically panicking as Apple went down below $168 per share I did not panic and I actually am making really good money like if I go into my history let's just look at the stock real quick so it's at 17238 it pulled up I have 7,000 shares quite a lot $1.2 million and 43% of the this portfolio in um Apple at the moment I have $180 covered calls now these are showing a slight loss at the moment that's because apple is actually showing a lot of signs of bullish momentum and investors are getting fairly bullish on it but as you can see here looks like one day I made quite a lot so it's it's it's going back and forth right there's a lot of volatility in apple actually which is pretty surprising you know typically it doesn't have the most volatility but let's just take a look at my history right here you guys already know I like to be transparent show you my wins my losses and really just like everything let's just talk about my history real quick and then we'll wrap it up with some more tips so give me a couple more minutes here I did sell ,800 shares at $170 and I didn't actually want to sell Apple but I had to sell Apple because my account was in margin there's a right way of using margin and there's a wrong way of using margin that is on the scope of this video but if you want a video on margin just comment down below and let me know what questions you have about margin I do read your comments and I'm very happy to see them so I'll make another video on that but um buying Apple at 177 I closed out an option trade here so I closed out an option trade that I have previously sold and I have sold many many covered calls which were all actually profitable I think all except for one you can see here I sold 552 2.3k 6,000 ,000 1100 1100 5,000 uh Etc I've been making not the most money but some money on Apple just by selling options okay it's pretty consistent but I do have a big apple position you would think I'm making more but I'm fairly risk adverse so I'm trying to just make a little bit rather than um you know being aggressive in in you know going for more than I can uh get right biting off more than I can chew basically so I did sell 1,00 shares and then I also had to sell um 1,200 shares that's also because of margin I was slightly in margin even at this point so I did get rid of about half a million dollars of Apple but overall I'm still very very bullish on Apple and I'm going to keep just selling covered calls like I have let's say 70 covered calls that's like quite a lot now currently this is actually worth a lot because it's like $3 per share so if I actually click into this option contract you can see here that the market value is negative $20,000 so I'll be pretty excited as time DK kicks in this will actually be fully in my favor fully fully fully which which is pretty nuts to think about but yes this will actually be fully $20,000 mine as long as Apple stays below 180 which I think it will even if it goes beyond 180 I'm just going to roll this position if you want to watch a really good video on rolling I'm going to leave it on the screen right now for you guys to watch",1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,x3yIocSj-x4,2024-04-15T12:30:40Z,WOW! Day Trade QQQ Last 15 Minute Sell Put 0 DTE EXAMPLE,QQQ,"it was an at the money trade on a QQQ and I showed you exactly how I managed it until the very last second the mindset behind this trade how I manage it right at the close what's going on guys it's Henry back with the video and in today's video I want to talk about selling put options and as you can see in my other portfolio right now I have sold a whole lot of puts now I want to specifically go over collecting income on a consistent basis safely and generating gains like this as you can see here this portfolio all my positions currently are making money even though today is a very massive rad day and yes I'm even down about $25,000 today you can still see on a longer term basis this portfolio right here is generating me consistent income it's my bread and butter strategy I mean it's ham Tomatoes it's everything this is literally everything I've been doing to grow my wealth consistently especially as you hit a bigger account you can also grow a small account however you may want to use spreads I'll leave you a link about my ultimate spread strategy but for now we want to focus on selling puts as you can see it's a put put put just all puts in this portfolio I'm using puts because it's the safest way to generate consistent income Without Really risking too much money in your portfolio now look I am putting out a lot of capital but the thing is I've never actually lost money selling a put option because they're very easy to roll they're very easy to adjust they're very easy to turn into a winning play even if it's down I'm going to show you in this video how to make a option that is down into a winner by Rolling and managing this position properly a lot of people think that when you sell a put option and it goes down into the money you have a problem well not really as you can see right here I do have one position currently that is expiring actually today in 30 minutes so I'm going to show you an example of what I'm going to do with this position so right now I do have the cash in my portfolio but for um you know call it generosity or whatever for the purposes of this video I'm actually going to roll even though I do not want to roll and we will see what happens here okay so right now I actually sold this position because I want to get ass sign I'm trying to accumulate QQQ my portfolio and I have a lot of cash but for example purposes and for you right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to this option and let's pretend that I don't have the cash in my portfolio Okay this is how you would manage selling puts I'm going to go ad toz how to how to sell puts in a a little bit but I first want to talk about rolling this is a very important topic I've been asked about over and over again because a lot of people let's say for example some people sell puts on margin and they think it's really risky well that's also a myth there's so many myths that are sold to us um option Traders and that's because of all the advertisements whatever there is a very specific way that I go about this so let's go into um for example this is sold so what I need to do is I need to actually buy it also some platforms will allow you to like uh actually roll this position by clicking into it so what I'm going to do right now and I don't always use TM trade I know they're moving over to Schwab is I would need to buy this and I would need to open up a new trade okay so I'm actually going to go to the option chain itself um because I don't always so let's go to this let's go to option chain okay so right now you will notice that I have a position that is expiring today uh April 12th as I'm making this video but of course you're watching this in the future it's totally okay to copy my logic like you want to mirror success I've been doing this for 10 years that's why I have so much you know capital in my two portfolios they're both seven figures because I've grown them over time it's taking time this did not happen overnight that's why I hate people with the wrong mindset that they think they're going to get rich no I like to work with people that have the safe mentality of I want to retire I want to generate income I want to maybe travel take care of my family say you have a sum of money 50k you don't know what to to do with that 100K you know you're thinking about what business to start well option trading is the easiest one it's like literally the easiest one I'm literally traveling the world and doing option trading online so uh let's go to for example this one's expiring on the 12th so I would roll this out to the Future so for example instead of the 12th I would go out by let's say 28 days okay because listen you can you can actually roll an option out for whatever time period that you want uh there is no specific date for me I like four weeks roughly four weeks because it's a good sweet spot okay The Sweet Spot is this um you have to wait four weeks but you get to roll down and give yourself more cushion and also collect income okay so if I go to May 10 look you can go for June you can go for July you'll actually get paid more so if I go to uh May 10 you will see here that I can take this 439 option all right if we take a look at the 439 and currently the price is a133 okay so I would have to buy it back for 133 but look if I buy it back for 133 how much am I going to get paid well right here you can see that I can get paid a lot more $7.77 that's literally $6 $6 okay I have 15 contracts here that's going to be like $90 okay 6 * 15 is 90 it's 100 shares so like 90 that's like $99,000 okay so I already made $2,000 and I can make $9,000 ,000 more dollar like literally $9,000 more doll I can make so uh for example what I would do and each platform is different some platforms let you do this in one trade for me what I would do um here is I would actually manually close out this trade um to be honest it's really not advantageous for me to do it because the whole reason I opened up this position is because I'm running the wheel strategy right the wheel strategy is this you sell puts you collect income if the stock goes down then you buy the stock that's perfect L okay because in the wheel strategy you sell puts until you get assigned not panic when you get assigned until you get a signed you're actually happy you're actually happy to get a sign because for me I've been waiting for QQQ to kind of pull back so I can jump into it now that it is pulling back I'm actually happy to buy it but if I was not happy to buy it and I was not running the whe strategy and I was just running a pure uh sell put strategy here which is very similar right selling puts is very similar to running the wheel because the wheel starts off by selling puts it's it's the same thing okay both these strategies look the same when you get in all right so uh I would switch this from 439 to 435 for example if I go to 435 you will see right here you know I'm just going to go for a market order I don't like any of these other orders I know some people do limit some people do stock uh Market orders says stop limit orders look for me I just go market okay if you have a good broker you know do your research you're not really going to get get screwed over much okay or or at all right some free Brokers yeah they'll maybe give you a disadvantaged pricing so you might not get the best execution price um the bid ask spread price you can't really control but you know whatever let's go for market it's the most simple uh and honestly that's the only one that I do uh actually what I meant to do was I need to change the order I would change this order to 15 contracts okay and yeah you review the order and there you go uh here it's $111,000 but it's going to cost me for example uh $2,000 to close this now I've already made 2,000 but it's going to cost about $ 2,000 more doar to close I just know that because 15 here times a151 that's going to be like 2.2k okay and you can also see that I made 50% so the 50% remaining is also around $2,200 okay so that's why here I can make like 9 Grand just by Rolling this down now you know the first step is close this and then open this one that's exactly how you would do a roll okay you can also I can also show you a quick easy roll in Robin Hood you know have two portfolios by the way my portfolio is almost at 2.1 million all right it's been awesome it's been amazing um time for me especially because I have a few options that really went well and I also shared them in my Discord community so if you did want to schedule a call or just learn more about it do click the first link um I'm still coaching I've been coaching for a very long time it's almost boring at this point but we get results I'm happy to share I'm happy to help I'm happy to I don't know what else I would do with my life so yeah go ahead click the first link more than happy to help you see all my trades and and Coach you so let's look at wow this is amazing guys this is really interesting because specifically the market has 23 more minutes I did do a shorter term sellp put so yeah we're going to actually see a very interesting scenario right now very very interesting I have been doing a little bit of zero DTE sell puts on QQQ okay now this is very interesting you're about to be like wow so actually 3 days in a row I have sold QQQ puts all right so let's see the first one I did was April well I've been selling puts before so I was pretty profitable actually before but this was March 27 well actually yeah this counts this is all my current okay this is the old older stuff and you can see older stuff um I opened up this is actually an open position I still am making money on but look here's the current positions right here's like most recent as I'm making this video I sold put on QQQ 429 it expired on on April 5th okay I made $1,180 um this one was very safe it was very out of the money this was Ultra conservative this is ultra Ultra safe this is when I talk about my students that make $6,000 a month and $300,000 this is the type of stuff that he does all right now I want a little bit more aggressive we're going to talk about this right now look I sold uh QQQ 429 put 45 expiration boom this is good okay this was uh like over a week all right so it took over a week to make that much that's not that much money but look now I did dailies I did daily expiration all right this is something that I think it's a little bit more advanced but again in this video if you're watching to this point congratulations you have an attention span you're going to be successful at trading because it's very good I'm going to show you even more important things to keep in mind look so cell QQQ 43749 okay this is I sold on 49 and it expires on 49 same day made 780 boom it was good I made my daily profit the next day I did it again I did KQ 436 put 410 okay um if we want to talk about technical analysis I'll link you a video below as well but uh I usually cover that in Discord because it it just depends it depends on many factors it's not a simple concept but look pretty simple I saw support I didn't think it would go below 436 or 437 that day so 780 11:45 the next day I did again 411 I did 437 I kept going this time it's a little bit volatile in my premium collection um by the way I'm making all this money for free I'm not even using my Capital 620 you see I collected 620 20 contracts amazing amazing amazing then today I did in the morning okay I collected $780 and QQQ uh took a pretty big tumble okay I'm going to show you right now what's happening to QQQ it took a tumble uh I was out just just came back and you can see here as I was away the you know the index the ETF here it took a bit of a tumble if I look at the chart you will see that over the one day chart it did move quite a lot all right on the 5day you can see that we have had a pretty big decline from 446 down to 437 with the RSI right in the middle now I'm Not Afraid okay I was thinking to close this position you see it's I I collected 780 this is really good $700 to $11,000 a day okay but you know QQ today is down you know for me I was thinking about closing it but I have iron hands right Diamond hands whatever they call it I do not want to close because for me the optimal return that I get is waiting until expiration uh the longer you wait the better now this was down a lot more before now it's pulling up and yes I will likely take a loss here and we have the next you know 19 minutes as I'm making this video I'll educate ship we'll come back to this so let's just let's just hold this for now so look several positions that I have right now are expiring um later in the month and two months and three months and four months you shouldn't be afraid of selling puts that expire for out because it's really truly passive income it's passive income to just sell a put option and hang out and wait because as long as it's out of the money you're good and even if it goes into the money that's not really an issue especially if you like the stock so you know I took like a couple minutes break and as you can see the position here is already popping up now I'm not necessarily a genius like I didn't know that this was going to happen but what I do know um happens is there's lots of overreactions in the market and yeah it's interesting because I'm right here at the money right there's 438 it's at 438 11 it was just under it's actually pulling back up so this is like amazing right right now in the next 17 minutes as I'm making this video when the market closes if it closes above I'm good but look even if it closes below so I was debating with myself should I close this position or should I leave it open if I don't close a position and ends below 438 I will get assigned a lot of contracts and honestly I don't have the cash in my account uh if I go into my account right now I go to investing you will see here that I only have $186,000 and the QQQ position I have is pretty big like the position here for 438 * 20 is going to be almost $900,000 so I would be on margin I would have to pay which I really don't want to do so that's why you know this was actually unplanned you can see right now QQ 438 put um intra day it actually went as high as 153 so this would have been a pretty big loss had I panicked and closed in fact at 153 if I had closed the 20 contracts that would have been like over $3,000 so in imagine if I was staring at my portfolio all day instead of following my simple rules of waiting until the last 30 minutes of the market then I would have probably panicked I would have probably closed around these levels I would said oh my goodness I'm going to lose money and I would have lost $33,000 but the difference between a mediocre Trader and a really top level Trader is their emotional ability to wait and analyze the situation so for me I knew that's going to be beneficial to wait until expiration because you know at Goldman Sachs and all hedge funds that I worked at I just saw the data and when I was crunching the data and doing analysis I really did see that options are more profitable when you wait until the last moment so as time is going right now as I'm making this video you can see here that essentially this option is going to nothing it's going to zero and that's actually a function of two things so not only is time running out here as I'm making this video there's only now there's 14 minutes left but also one of the biggest things is that is actually genuinely pulling up and you will see that quite often in the market when the market starts off red it will typically um continue to go red but not as much like I wasn't expecting so look it opened up around like the market opened up around 441 um I usually don't expect more than a 1% move so you can see here how the market opened up at negative .91 but then um it's ending less uh less bad than negative 1.9 Watt so typically when the Market opens up it's very rare for it to go down another 1% from the market open so a lot of bad stuff can happen pre-market which is why I actually sometimes don't mind doing the zero DT strategy special QQ um just opening it up um during the day and Al also I don't really open it up during um the first hour I will typically wait until 11:00 a.m. so today I think I open this up at 11:00 a.m. actually so we look at my history you will see how this strategy is really profitable um let's go right here I opened this up at 11:56 a.m. eastern time so I actually waited until 11:56 so let's see how good I was with the timing I had seen that 11:56 I actually caught it up wow look at this wow I actually caught it at a pretty bad time so I actually thought it would recover but this strategy is just so good and my ability to hold it here this P this last 15 minutes is so strong that uh it can even make up for not optimal entry so this was not optimal entry obviously this would have been a lot better actually I would have got paid probably so much more let's actually see how much I would have got paid had I waited I only got paid so I went for A1 eight I got paid 39 so yeah quite a lot of volatility here in terms of how much you get paid per day and we can see now that it's pulling back back down a little bit but you know for me and usually I don't even do this I'm only doing this today for this video to be honest what I would do is I would just close my laptop and forget about it and on Monday if I got assigned and then at that point what I would do is I would manage the strategy by selling some covered calls if I have the cash available now in my case since I don't have the cash available I would close the position for a potential loss or I would do a one day wheel shot sheet so I would do a one day wheel basically um the opposite of what I'm doing here so my TD account um when I get signed then I will just sell really longterm long deed call options I'll go out three months four months five months even six months now for the zero DTE strategy QQQ what I will do is I will just uh do one day especially because I don't have the capital so I'm just going to do one day out and uh yeah it's uh pretty good so as we end off the day here it looks like another successful day of selling put options and honestly if I had to pick one strategy and I could only do one thing it really would be selling puts because well you can get rich with puts you can make passive income you can sell them consistently you can get lower uh entry prices than the current stock market so the current stock market um can be you know $100 you can sell 95 puts so you get paid more then uh you can actually collect good income and buy stocks cheaper than anyone else can so why wouldn't you do selling puts it's like the ultimate passive income it's also the ultimate value investing strategy if you're a value investor you look at options as they're risky you straight up just don't know how to invest um we can see here there's a lot of um volatility especially in the last 10 minutes there's a lot of fighting going on I guess between Traders on the ETF also one thing I do want to say and I probably should close this position is that in the last 10 minutes um a lot of people don't really want to hold the stock over the weekend so I will say that not everyone wants to hold over the weekend therefore you can see quite a bit of selling in the last 10 minutes now let me just refresh the screen real fast and let's also Refresh on Yo Finance I did a lot of coaching today so my voice is kind of um kind of hurting at the moment but let's go to one day and uh we can see here how yeah it's it's really interesting what will happen um we can also go to um shorter ex like shorter time we can go to like the five minute chart you know 10-minute chart but I don't really find it that useful to to obsess I'll just uh actually talk about my tdmr trade account a little bit more while we uh wait until expiration here one of my favorite stocks is Google Amazon all these text thoughts that um I really like they are my bread and butter like I don't really want to trade anything else because well this pfolio specifically is more of my passive income where I really truly only trade once a month or a couple times a month and uh yeah it's more for my large account here I'm trading a lot of small account strategies I'm doing basically everything on the Nissan I'm doing some Starbucks I'm doing paler I'm doing Snapchat I'm doing Starbucks I'm doing Apple Walmart I actually recently bought PayPal looks like PayPal is uh kind of going down a bit here PayPal is uh detracting actually started off today with the positive on PayPal and now it's uh going down but I had some really good covered calls so I have some good covered calls here that are creating some cushion I mean not enough cushion at the moment but they have generated me $1,000 where I'm down in the stock about you know 1,500 1,600 so yeah calls are also fantastic a good part of the wheel strategy so taking a look at my watch list I also am looking at Disney Nvidia which I think is pretty expensive but we'll see what happens with Nvidia meta it looks like overall the stock market is just really down today and you can guys you guys can see that I'm pretty much flat so I'm very proud of my ability to hedge my portfolio very proud of how I can hold ground in my portfolio and on on red days I really don't experience much volatility while some of these stocks are down a whole lot and the S&amp;P um well Neo's in the dumpster I'm I'm glad I got out of Neo at $10 per share and I haven't touched the stock ever since haven't even made videos on Neo ever since I just lost a lot of confidence in China So currently don't have any of those companies so yeah it looks like everything's just selling off here in the last few minutes and one thing that uh I am kind of debating is should I actually end up closing this position as we get into last final minutes see here how I am still up well $75 $135 165 you know I'm asking myself would it be wise to just uh can I cut this and say you know I'll have a good weekend so at this point and in the last few minutes at plus 210 I think uh I think this is going to be a good time to get out so go here at 4:38 and I will go ahead buy to close 20 contracts um I will go for a close of let's see I sold it for 39 and given where well look look look look look look look it's above 438 it's above I mean what we can't wait 5 minutes we can't wait 5 minutes right now to see what happens here 4 3805 03 fourth fourth okay we we're at wow 43801 4 3806 you guys can see right now that Theta in the last 5 minutes is kicking in a little bit harder it's kicking in even a little bit harder than uh the price action itself as long as the price action kind of stays steady here now we're getting a bit of a fall 160 180 200 nice nice nice nice so yeah and by the way options expire on Saturday actually so they expire on Friday but there's still some after hours movement so I'm probably going to try to close I'm going to probably try to close in next 2 minutes here at 3:59 p.m. I'm going to probably close this out uh 3:59 p.m. so right now if I were to close this out it would be um it would cost me roughly yeah 30 would cost me about 30 28 25 26 so yeah but yeah generally like I said I wouldn't really play this game I would just either shut my laptop or I would decide to just close the position myself but uh this is probably like a rare time where kind of having fun with it like we can see here on the screen let me zoom in here by 4:30 13 feels kind of like a little holiday here will I make my $780 for the day or not I mean obviously my portfolio as a whole generates more than than that um think anywhere from I mean I'm going after safe strategies right now so I'm I'm after save passive income like 2% it's like $40,000 a month but uh it's kind of fun it's kind of fun to to take a look at a position like this and just do like a a shorter term so I guess you got to see both my short-term strategy and my long-term strategy today got to see both portfolios also my small account strategy me all this stuff I I always do in my uh in my Discord Community I'm showing all my trads um working with the members making sure that um yeah they're profitable they're learning and some people just decide to copy because they're so busy you know have so many professionals here we are 18 cents we got two minutes left but yeah Discord Community has been really good I do coaching Mondays and Wednesdays um just we have 4,000 people that have been successful with it I'm very proud and thankful that so many people have trusted me and gotten about 2,000 testimonials at this point so I'm really passionate happy about this and yeah at the end of the day the hardest thing to do is just to hold hold hold the position like it's not always easy actually I wonder what exact time it is it is 3:58 358 Easter I'm I'm out in Europe at the moment traveling around enjoying life a bit um treating myself learning more about other areas health wealth love happiness all those areas of life that are important not just money see here that I'm up $400 okay 340 380 okay going back and forth now it's 359 guys so look this is probably one of the most interesting positions but I think I'm going to going to end up cutting this position and I won't make the full amount today but I'll be pretty happy so buy to close 20 contracts and I will try to buy it 4.9 now in this last minute you can really get a whole lot more you can see I'm not really rushing boom we're down to 15 down to 16 we're down to 16 cents okay and uh down to 15 cents down to 13 cents is going to be like a big countdown right now so you see like okay I don't see even the point of closing it now we are down to 12 okay I think we have what less than 60 seconds to go less than 60 seconds 16 uh 16 cents 13 cents okay we have less than 60 seconds to go and the market closed okay so the market I think is officially closed there's going to be some after hours action most likely I will be very successful on this trade I cannot control the weekend but this trade ended up doing very good so 7 cents boom I can't even buy it back now or no I can't I can't can I can buy it back back now for look 6 cents look at this all the people that would Panic look don't panic listen to Uncle Henry subscribe to the YouTube channel join the Discord by clicking the first link and uh enjoy the profits enjoy the good plays that I have for you here's just another one I'm pretty happy today okay

Day Trade QQQ Last 15 Minute Sell Put 0 DTE EXAMPLE,TD Ameritrade,"I don't always use TM trade I know they're moving over to Schwab is I would need to buy this and I would need to open up a new trade okay so I'm actually going to go to the option chain itself um because I don't always so let's go to this let's go to option chain okay so right now you will notice that I have a position that is expiring today uh April 12th as I'm making this video but of course you're watching this in the future it's totally okay to copy my logic like you want to mirror success I've been doing this for 10 years that's why I have so much you know capital in my two portfolios they're both seven figures because I've grown them over time it's taking time this did not happen overnight that's why I hate people with the wrong mindset that they think they're going to get rich no I like to work with people that have the safe mentality of I want to retire I want to generate income I want to maybe travel take care of my family say you have a sum of money 50k you don't know what to to do with that 100K you know you're thinking about what business to start well option trading is the easiest one it's like literally the easiest one I'm literally traveling the world and doing option trading online so uh let's go to for example this one's expiring on the 12th so I would roll this out to the Future so for example instead of the 12th I would go out by let's say 28 days okay because listen you can you can actually roll an option out for whatever time period that you want uh there is no specific date for me I like four weeks roughly four weeks because it's a good sweet spot okay The Sweet Spot is this um you have to wait four weeks but you get to roll down and give yourself more cushion and also collect income okay so if I go to May 10 look you can go for June you can go for July you'll actually get paid more so if I go to uh May 10 you will see here that I can take this 439 option all right if we take a look at the 439 and currently the price is a133 okay so I would have to buy it back for 133 but look if I buy it back for 133 how much am I going to get paid well right here you can see that I can get paid a lot more $7.77 that's literally $6 $6 okay I have 15 contracts here that's going to be like $90 okay 6 * 15 is 90 it's 100 shares so like 90 that's like $99,000 okay so I already made $2,000 and I can make $9,000 ,000 more dollar like literally $9,000 more doll I can make so uh for example what I would do and each platform is different some platforms let you do this in one trade for me what I would do um here is I would actually manually close out this trade um to be honest it's really not advantageous for me to do it because the whole reason I opened up this position is because I'm running the wheel strategy right the wheel strategy is this you sell puts you collect income if the stock goes down then you buy the stock that's perfect L okay because in the wheel strategy you sell puts until you get assigned not panic when you get assigned until you get a signed you're actually happy you're actually happy to get a sign because for me I've been waiting for QQQ to kind of pull back so I can jump into it now that it is pulling back I'm actually happy to buy it but if I was not happy to buy it and I was not running the whe strategy and I was just running a pure uh sell put strategy here which is very similar right selling puts is very similar to running the wheel because the wheel starts off by selling puts it's it's the same thing okay both these strategies look the same when you get in all right so uh I would switch this from 439 to 435 for example if I go to 435 you will see right here you know I'm just going to go for a market order I don't like any of these other orders I know some people do limit some people do stock uh Market orders says stop limit orders look for me I just go market okay if you have a good broker you know do your research you're not really going to get get screwed over much okay or or at all right some free Brokers yeah they'll maybe give you a disadvantaged pricing so you might not get the best execution price um the bid ask spread price you can't really control but you know whatever let's go for market it's the most simple uh and honestly that's the only one that I do uh actually what I meant to do was I need to change the order I would change this order to 15 contracts okay and yeah you review the order and there you go uh here it's $111,000 but it's going to cost me for example uh $2,000 to close this now I've already made 2,000 but it's going to cost about $ 2,000 more doar to close I just know that because 15 here times a151 that's going to be like 2.2k okay and you can also see that I made 50% so the 50% remaining is also around $2,200 okay so that's why here I can make like 9 Grand just by Rolling this down now you know the first step is close this and then open this one that's exactly how you would do a roll okay you can also I can also show you a quick easy roll in Robin Hood you know have two portfolios by the way my portfolio is almost at 2.1 million all right it's been awesome it's been amazing um time for me especially because I have a few options that really went well and I also shared them in my Discord community so if you did want to schedule a call or just learn more about it do click the first link um I'm still coaching I've been coaching for a very long time it's almost boring at this point but we get results I'm happy to share I'm happy to help I'm happy to I don't know what else I would do with my life so yeah go ahead click the first link more than happy to help you see all my trades and and Coach you so let's look at wow this is amazing guys this is really interesting because specifically the market has 23 more minutes I did do a shorter term sellp put so yeah we're going to actually see a very interesting scenario right now very very interesting I have been doing a little bit of zero DTE sell puts on QQQ okay now this is very interesting you're about to be like wow so actually 3 days in a row I have sold QQQ puts all right so let's see the first one I did was April well I've been selling puts before so I was pretty profitable actually before but this was March 27 well actually yeah this counts this is all my current okay this is the old older stuff and you can see older stuff um I opened up this is actually an open position I still am making money on but look here's the current positions right here's like most recent as I'm making this video I sold put on QQQ 429 it expired on on April 5th okay I made $1,180 um this one was very safe it was very out of the money this was Ultra conservative this is ultra Ultra safe this is when I talk about my students that make $6,000 a month and $300,000 this is the type of stuff that he does all right now I want a little bit more aggressive we're going to talk about this right now look I sold uh QQQ 429 put 45 expiration boom this is good okay this was uh like over a week all right so it took over a week to make that much that's not that much money but look now I did dailies I did daily expiration all right this is something that I think it's a little bit more advanced but again in this video if you're watching to this point congratulations you have an attention span you're going to be successful at trading because it's very good I'm going to show you even more important things to keep in mind look so cell QQQ 43749 okay this is I sold on 49 and it expires on 49 same day made 780 boom it was good I made my daily profit the next day I did it again I did KQ 436 put 410 okay um if we want to talk about technical analysis I'll link you a video below as well but uh I usually cover that in Discord because it it just depends it depends on many factors it's not a simple concept but look pretty simple I saw support I didn't think it would go below 436 or 437 that day so 780 11:45 the next day I did again 411 I did 437 I kept going this time it's a little bit volatile in my premium collection um by the way I'm making all this money for free I'm not even using my Capital 620 you see I collected 620 20 contracts amazing amazing amazing then today I did in the morning okay I collected $780 and QQQ uh took a pretty big tumble okay I'm going to show you right now what's happening to QQQ it took a tumble uh I was out just just came back and you can see here as I was away the you know the index the ETF here it took a bit of a tumble if I look at the chart you will see that over the one day chart it did move quite a lot all right on the 5day you can see that we have had a pretty big decline from 446 down to 437 with the RSI right in the middle now I'm Not Afraid okay I was thinking to close this position you see it's I I collected 780 this is really good $700 to $11,000 a day okay but you know QQ today is down you know for me I was thinking about closing it but I have iron hands right Diamond hands whatever they call it I do not want to close because for me the optimal return that I get is waiting until expiration uh the longer you wait the better now this was down a lot more before now it's pulling up and yes I will likely take a loss here and we have the next you know 19 minutes as I'm making this video I'll educate ship we'll come back to this so let's just let's just hold this for now so look several positions that I have right now are expiring um later in the month and two months and three months and four months you shouldn't be afraid of selling puts that expire for out because it's really truly passive income it's passive income to just sell a put option and hang out and wait because as long as it's out of the money you're good and even if it goes into the money that's not really an issue especially if you like the stock so you know I took like a couple minutes break and as you can see the position here is already popping up now I'm not necessarily a genius like I didn't know that this was going to happen but what I do know um happens is there's lots of overreactions in the market and yeah it's interesting because I'm right here at the money right there's 438 it's at 438 11 it was just under it's actually pulling back up so this is like amazing right right now in the next 17 minutes as I'm making this video when the market closes if it closes above I'm good but look even if it closes below so I was debating with myself should I close this position or should I leave it open if I don't close a position and ends below 438 I will get assigned a lot of contracts and honestly I don't have the cash in my account uh if I go into my account right now I go to investing you will see here that I only have $186,000 and the QQQ position I have is pretty big like the position here for 438 * 20 is going to be almost $900,000 so I would be on margin I would have to pay which I really don't want to do so that's why you know this was actually unplanned you can see right now QQ 438 put um intra day it actually went as high as 153 so this would have been a pretty big loss had I panicked and closed in fact at 153 if I had closed the 20 contracts that would have been like over $3,000 so in imagine if I was staring at my portfolio all day instead of following my simple rules of waiting until the last 30 minutes of the market then I would have probably panicked I would have probably closed around these levels I would said oh my goodness I'm going to lose money and I would have lost $33,000 but the difference between a mediocre Trader and a really top level Trader is their emotional ability to wait and analyze the situation so for me I knew that's going to be beneficial to wait until expiration because you know at Goldman Sachs and all hedge funds that I worked at I just saw the data and when I was crunching the data and doing analysis I really did see that options are more profitable when you wait until the last moment so as time is going right now as I'm making this video you can see here that essentially this option is going to nothing it's going to zero and that's actually a function of two things so not only is time running out here as I'm making this video there's only now there's 14 minutes left but also one of the biggest things is that is actually genuinely pulling up and you will see that quite often in the market when the market starts off red it will typically um continue to go red but not as much like I wasn't expecting so look it opened up around like the market opened up around 441 um I usually don't expect more than a 1% move so you can see here how the market opened up at negative .91 but then um it's ending less uh less bad than negative 1.9 Watt so typically when the Market opens up it's very rare for it to go down another 1% from the market open so a lot of bad stuff can happen pre-market which is why I actually sometimes don't mind doing the zero DT strategy special QQ um just opening it up um during the day and Al also I don't really open it up during um the first hour I will typically wait until 11:00 a.m. so today I think I open this up at 11:00 a.m. actually so we look at my history you will see how this strategy is really profitable um let's go right here I opened this up at 11:56 a.m. eastern time so I actually waited until 11:56 so let's see how good I was with the timing I had seen that 11:56 I actually caught it up wow look at this wow I actually caught it at a pretty bad time so I actually thought it would recover but this strategy is just so good and my ability to hold it here this P this last 15 minutes is so strong that uh it can even make up for not optimal entry so this was not optimal entry obviously this would have been a lot better actually I would have got paid probably so much more let's actually see how much I would have got paid had I waited I only got paid so I went for A1 eight I got paid 39 so yeah quite a lot of volatility here in terms of how much you get paid per day and we can see now that it's pulling back back down a little bit but you know for me and usually I don't even do this I'm only doing this today for this video to be honest what I would do is I would just close my laptop and forget about it and on Monday if I got assigned and then at that point what I would do is I would manage the strategy by selling some covered calls if I have the cash available now in my case since I don't have the cash available I would close the position for a potential loss or I would do a one day wheel shot sheet so I would do a one day wheel basically um the opposite of what I'm doing here so my TD account um when I get signed then I will just sell really longterm long deed call options I'll go out three months four months five months even six months now for the zero DTE strategy QQQ what I will do is I will just uh do one day especially because I don't have the capital so I'm just going to do one day out and uh yeah it's uh pretty good so as we end off the day here it looks like another successful day of selling put options and honestly if I had to pick one strategy and I could only do one thing it really would be selling puts because well you can get rich with puts you can make passive income you can sell them consistently you can get lower uh entry prices than the current stock market so the current stock market um can be you know $100 you can sell 95 puts so you get paid more then uh you can actually collect good income and buy stocks cheaper than anyone else can so why wouldn't you do selling puts it's like the ultimate passive income it's also the ultimate value investing strategy if you're a value investor you look at options as they're risky you straight up just don't know how to invest",1.0,0.0

span you're going to be successful at trading because it's very good I'm going to show you even more important things to keep in mind look so cell QQQ 43749 okay this is I sold on 49 and it expires on 49 same day made 780 boom it was good I made my daily profit the next day I did it again I did KQ 436 put 410 okay um if we want to talk about technical analysis I'll link you a video below as well but uh I usually cover that in Discord because it it just depends it depends on many factors it's not a simple concept but look pretty simple I saw support I didn't think it would go below 436 or 437 that day so 780 11:45 the next day I did again 411 I did 437 I kept going this time it's a little bit volatile in my premium collection um by the way I'm making all this money for free I'm not even using my Capital 620 you see I collected 620 20 contracts amazing amazing amazing then today I did in the morning okay I collected $780 and QQQ uh took a pretty big tumble okay I'm going to show you right now what's happening to QQQ it took a tumble uh I was out just just came back and you can see here as I was away the you know the index the ETF here it took a bit of a tumble if I look at the chart you will see that over the one day chart it did move quite a lot all right on the 5day you can see that we have had a pretty big decline from 446 down to 437 with the RSI right in the middle now I'm Not Afraid okay I was thinking to close this position you see it's I I collected 780 this is really good $700 to $11,000 a day okay but you know QQ today is down you know for me I was thinking about closing it but I have iron hands right Diamond hands whatever they call it I do not want to close because for me the optimal return that I get is waiting until expiration uh the longer you wait the better now this was down a lot more before now it's pulling up and yes I will likely take a loss here and we have the next you know 19 minutes as I'm making this video I'll educate ship we'll come back to this so let's just let's just hold this for now so look several positions that I have right now are expiring um later in the month and two months and three months and four months you shouldn't be afraid of selling puts that expire for out because it's really truly passive income it's passive income to just sell a put option and hang out and wait because as long as it's out of the money you're good and even if it goes into the money that's not really an issue especially if you like the stock so you know I took like a couple minutes break and as you can see the position here is already popping up now I'm not necessarily a genius like I didn't know that this was going to happen but what I do know um happens is there's lots of overreactions in the market and yeah it's interesting because I'm right here at the money right there's 438 it's at 438 11 it was just under it's actually pulling back up so this is like amazing right right now in the next 17 minutes as I'm making this video when the market closes if it closes above I'm good but look even if it closes below so I was debating with myself should I close this position or should I leave it open if I don't close a position and ends below 438 I will get assigned a lot of contracts and honestly I don't have the cash in my account uh if I go into my account right now I go to investing you will see here that I only have $186,000 and the QQQ position I have is pretty big like the position here for 438 * 20 is going to be almost $900,000 so I would be on margin I would have to pay which I really don't want to do so that's why you know this was actually unplanned you can see right now QQ 438 put um intra day it actually went as high as 153 so this would have been a pretty big loss had I panicked and closed in fact at 153 if I had closed the 20 contracts that would have been like over $3,000 so in imagine if I was staring at my portfolio all day instead of following my simple rules of waiting until the last 30 minutes of the market then I would have probably panicked I would have probably closed around these levels I would said oh my goodness I'm going to lose money and I would have lost $33,000 but the difference between a mediocre Trader and a really top level Trader is their emotional ability to wait and analyze the situation so for me I knew that's going to be beneficial to wait until expiration because you know at Goldman Sachs and all hedge funds that I worked at I just saw the data and when I was crunching the data and doing analysis I really did see that options are more profitable when you wait until the last moment so as time is going right now as I'm making this video you can see here that essentially this option is going to nothing it's going to zero and that's actually a function of two things so not only is time running out here as I'm making this video there's only now there's 14 minutes left but also one of the biggest things is that is actually genuinely pulling up and you will see that quite often in the market when the market starts off red it will typically um continue to go red but not as much like I wasn't expecting so look it opened up around like the market opened up around 441 um I usually don't expect more than a 1% move so you can see here how the market opened up at negative .91 but then um it's ending less uh less bad than negative 1.9 Watt so typically when the Market opens up it's very rare for it to go down another 1% from the market open so a lot of bad stuff can happen pre-market which is why I actually sometimes don't mind doing the zero DT strategy special QQ um just opening it up um during the day and Al also I don't really open it up during um the first hour I will typically wait until 11:00 a.m. so today I think I open this up at 11:00 a.m. actually so we look at my history you will see how this strategy is really profitable um let's go right here I opened this up at 11:56 a.m. eastern time so I actually waited until 11:56 so let's see how good I was with the timing I had seen that 11:56 I actually caught it up wow look at this wow I actually caught it at a pretty bad time so I actually thought it would recover but this strategy is just so good and my ability to hold it here this P this last 15 minutes is so strong that uh it can even make up for not optimal entry so this was not optimal entry obviously this would have been a lot better actually I would have got paid probably so much more let's actually see how much I would have got paid had I waited I only got paid so I went for A1 eight I got paid 39 so yeah quite a lot of volatility here in terms of how much you get paid per day and we can see now that it's pulling back back down a little bit but you know for me and usually I don't even do this I'm only doing this today for this video to be honest what I would do is I would just close my laptop and forget about it and on Monday if I got assigned and then at that point what I would do is I would manage the strategy by selling some covered calls if I have the cash available now in my case since I don't have the cash available I would close the position for a potential loss or I would do a one day wheel shot sheet so I would do a one day wheel basically um the opposite of what I'm doing here so my TD account um when I get signed then I will just sell really longterm long deed call options I'll go out three months four months five months even six months now for the zero DTE strategy QQQ what I will do is I will just uh do one day especially because I don't have the capital so I'm just going to do one day out and uh yeah it's uh pretty good so as we end off the day here it looks like another successful day of selling put options and honestly if I had to pick one strategy and I could only do one thing it really would be selling puts because well you can get rich with puts you can make passive income you can sell them consistently you can get lower uh entry prices than the current stock market so the current stock market um can be you know $100 you can sell 95 puts so you get paid more then uh you can actually collect good income and buy stocks cheaper than anyone else can so why wouldn't you do selling puts it's like the ultimate passive income it's also the ultimate value investing strategy if you're a value investor you look at options as they're risky you straight up just don't know how to invest",1.0,0.0

Day Trade QQQ Last 15 Minute Sell Put 0 DTE EXAMPLE,Google,"one of my favorite stocks is Google Amazon all these text thoughts that um I really like they are my bread and butter like I don't really want to trade anything else because well this pfolio specifically is more of my passive income where I really truly only trade once a month or a couple times a month and uh yeah it's more for my large account here I'm trading a lot of small account strategies I'm doing basically everything on the Nissan I'm doing some Starbucks I'm doing paler I'm doing Snapchat I'm doing Starbucks I'm doing Apple Walmart I actually recently bought PayPal looks like PayPal is uh kind of going down a bit here PayPal is uh detracting actually started off today with the positive on PayPal and now it's uh going down but I had some really good covered calls so I have some good covered calls here that are creating some cushion I mean not enough cushion at the moment but they have generated me $1,000 where I'm down in the stock about you know 1,500 1,600 so yeah calls are also fantastic a good part of the wheel strategy so taking a look at my watch list I also am looking at Disney Nvidia which I think is pretty expensive but we'll see what happens with Nvidia meta it looks like overall the stock market is just really down today and you can guys you guys can see that I'm pretty much flat so I'm very proud of my ability to hedge my portfolio very proud of how I can hold ground in my portfolio and on on red days I really don't experience much volatility while some of these stocks are down a whole lot and the S&amp;P um well Neo's in the dumpster I'm I'm glad I got out of Neo at $10 per share and I haven't touched the stock ever since haven't even made videos on Neo ever since I just lost a lot of confidence in China So currently don't have any of those companies so yeah it looks like everything's just selling off here in the last few minutes and one thing that uh I am kind of debating is should I actually end up closing this position as we get into last final minutes see here how I am still up well $75 $135 165 you know I'm asking myself would it be wise to just uh can I cut this and say you know I'll have a good weekend so at this point and in the last few minutes at plus 210 I think uh I think this is going to be a good time to get out so go here at 4:38 and I will go ahead buy to close 20 contracts um I will go for a close of let's see I sold it for 39 and given where well look look look look look look look it's above 438 it's above I mean what we can't wait 5 minutes we can't wait 5 minutes right now to see what happens here 4 3805 03 fourth fourth okay we we're at wow 43801 4 3806 you guys can see right now that Theta in the last 5 minutes is kicking in a little bit harder it's kicking in even a little bit harder than uh the price action itself as long as the price action kind of stays steady here now we're getting a bit of a fall 160 180 200 nice nice nice nice so yeah and by the way options expire on Saturday actually so they expire on Friday but there's still some after hours movement so I'm probably going to try to close I'm going to probably try to close in next 2 minutes here at 3:59 p.m. I'm going to probably close this out uh 3:59 p.m. so right now if I were to close this out it would be um it would cost me roughly yeah 30 would cost me about 30 28 25 26 so yeah but yeah generally like I said I wouldn't really play this game I would just either shut my laptop or I would decide to just close the position myself but uh this is probably like a rare time where kind of having fun with it like we can see here on the screen let me zoom in here by 4:30 13 feels kind of like a little holiday here will I make my $780 for the day or not I mean obviously my portfolio as a whole generates more than than that um think anywhere from I mean I'm going after safe strategies right now so I'm I'm after save passive income like 2% it's like $40,000 a month but uh it's kind of fun it's kind of fun to to take a look at a position like this and just do like a a shorter term so I guess you got to see both my short-term strategy and my long-term strategy today got to see both portfolios also my small account strategy me all this stuff I I always do in my uh in my Discord Community I'm showing all my trads um working with the members making sure that um yeah they're profitable they're learning and some people just decide to copy because they're so busy you know have so many professionals here we are 18 cents we got two minutes left but yeah Discord Community has been really good I do coaching Mondays and Wednesdays um just we have 4,000 people that have been successful with it I'm very proud and thankful that so many people have trusted me and gotten about 2,000 testimonials at this point so I'm really passionate happy about this and yeah at the end of the day the hardest thing to do is just to hold hold hold the position like it's not always easy actually I wonder what exact time it is it is 3:58 358 Easter I'm I'm out in Europe at the moment traveling around enjoying life a bit um treating myself learning more about other areas health wealth love happiness all those areas of life that are important not just money see here that I'm up $400 okay 340 380 okay going back and forth now it's 359 guys so look this is probably one of the most interesting positions but I think I'm going to going to end up cutting this position and I won't make the full amount today but I'll be pretty happy so buy to close 20 contracts and I will try to buy it 4.9 now in this last minute you can really get a whole lot more you can see I'm not really rushing boom we're down to 15 down to 16 we're down to 16 cents okay and uh down to 15 cents down to 13 cents is going to be like a big countdown right now so you see like okay I don't see even the point of closing it now we are down to 12 okay I think we have what less than 60 seconds to go less than 60 seconds 16 uh 16 cents 13 cents okay we have less than 60 seconds to go and the market closed okay so the market I think is officially closed there's going to be some after hours action most likely I will be very successful on this trade I cannot control the weekend but this trade ended up doing very good so 7 cents boom I can't even buy it back now or no I can't I can't can I can buy it back back now for look 6 cents look at this all the people that would Panic look don't panic listen to Uncle Henry subscribe to the YouTube channel join the Discord by clicking the first link and uh enjoy the profits enjoy the good plays that I have for you here's just another one I'm pretty happy today okay we're at 660 and profit 660 Total return this is good this is this is fun this is

Day Trade QQQ Last 15 Minute Sell Put 0 DTE EXAMPLE,Nissan,"one of my favorite stocks is Google Amazon all these text thoughts that um I really like they are my bread and butter like I don't really want to trade anything else because well this pfolio specifically is more of my passive income where I really truly only trade once a month or a couple times a month and uh yeah it's more for my large account here I'm trading a lot of small account strategies I'm doing basically everything on the Nissan I'm doing some Starbucks I'm doing paler I'm doing Snapchat I'm doing Starbucks I'm doing Apple Walmart I actually recently bought PayPal looks like PayPal is uh kind of going down a bit here PayPal is uh detracting actually started off today with the positive on PayPal and now it's uh going down but I had some really good covered calls so I have some good covered calls here that are creating some cushion I mean not enough cushion at the moment but they have generated me $1,000 where I'm down in the stock about you know 1,500 1,600 so yeah calls are also fantastic a good part of the wheel strategy so taking a look at my watch list I also am looking at Disney Nvidia which I think is pretty expensive but we'll see what happens with Nvidia meta it looks like overall the stock market is just really down today and you can guys you guys can see that I'm pretty much flat so I'm very proud of my ability to hedge my portfolio very proud of how I can hold ground in my portfolio and on on red days I really don't experience much volatility while some of these stocks are down a whole lot and the S&amp;P um well Neo's in the dumpster I'm I'm glad I got out of Neo at $10 per share and I haven't touched the stock ever since haven't even made videos on Neo ever since I just lost a lot of confidence in China So currently don't have any of those companies so yeah it looks like everything's just selling off here in the last few minutes and one thing that uh I am kind of debating is should I actually end up closing this position as we get into last final minutes see here how I am still up well $75 $135 165 you know I'm asking myself would it be wise to just uh can I cut this and say you know I'll have a good weekend so at this point and in the last few minutes at plus 210 I think uh I think this is going to be a good time to get out so go here at 4:38 and I will go ahead buy to close 20 contracts um I will go for a close of let's see I sold it for 39 and given where well look look look look look look look it's above 438 it's above I mean what we can't wait 5 minutes we can't wait 5 minutes right now to see what happens here 4 3805 03 fourth fourth okay we we're at wow 43801 4 3806 you guys can see right now that Theta in the last 5 minutes is kicking in a little bit harder it's kicking in even a little bit harder than uh the price action itself as long as the price action kind of stays steady here now we're getting a bit of a fall 160 180 200 nice nice nice nice so yeah and by the way options expire on Saturday actually so they expire on Friday but there's still some after hours movement so I'm probably going to try to close I'm going to probably try to close in next 2 minutes here at 3:59 p.m. I'm going to probably close this out uh 3:59 p.m. so right now if I were to close this out it would be um it would cost me roughly yeah 30 would cost me about 30 28 25 26 so yeah but yeah generally like I said I wouldn't really play this game I would just either shut my laptop or I would decide to just close the position myself but uh this is probably like a rare

Day Trade QQQ Last 15 Minute Sell Put 0 DTE EXAMPLE,Apple,"one of my favorite stocks is Google Amazon all these text thoughts that um I really like they are my bread and butter like I don't really want to trade anything else because well this pfolio specifically is more of my passive income where I really truly only trade once a month or a couple times a month and uh yeah it's more for my large account here I'm trading a lot of small account strategies I'm doing basically everything on the Nissan I'm doing some Starbucks I'm doing paler I'm doing Snapchat I'm doing Starbucks I'm doing Apple Walmart I actually recently bought PayPal looks like PayPal is uh kind of going down a bit here PayPal is uh detracting actually started off today with the positive on PayPal and now it's uh going down but I had some really good covered calls so I have some good covered calls here that are creating some cushion I mean not enough cushion at the moment but they have generated me $1,000 where I'm down in the stock about you know 1,500 1,600 so yeah calls are also fantastic a good part of the wheel strategy so taking a look at my watch list I also am looking at Disney Nvidia which I think is pretty expensive but we'll see what happens with Nvidia meta it looks like overall the stock market is just really down today and you can guys you guys can see that I'm pretty much flat so I'm very proud of my ability to hedge my portfolio very proud of how I can hold ground in my portfolio and on on red days I really don't experience much volatility while some of these stocks are down a whole lot and the S&amp;P um well Neo's in the dumpster I'm I'm glad I got out of Neo at $10 per share and I haven't touched the stock ever since haven't even made videos on Neo ever since I just lost a lot of confidence in China So currently don't have any of those companies so yeah it looks like everything's just selling off here in the last few minutes and one thing that uh I am kind of debating is should I actually end up closing this position as we get into last final minutes see here how I am still up well $75 $135 165 you know I'm asking myself would it be wise to just uh can I cut this and say you know I'll have a good weekend so at this point and in the last few minutes at plus 210 I think uh I think this is going to be a good time to get out so go here at 4:38 and I will go ahead buy to close 20 contracts um I will go for a close of let's see I sold it for 39 and given where well look look look look look look look it's above 438 it's above I mean what we can't wait 5 minutes we can't wait 5 minutes right now to see what happens here 4 3805 03 fourth fourth okay we we're at wow 43801 4 3806 you guys can see right now that Theta in the last 5 minutes is kicking in a little bit harder it's kicking in even a little bit harder than uh the price action itself as long as the price action kind of stays steady here now we're getting a bit of a fall 160 180 200 nice nice nice nice so yeah and by the way options expire on Saturday actually so they expire on Friday but there's still some after hours movement so I'm probably going to try to close I'm going to probably try to close in next 2 minutes here at 3:59 p.m. I'm going to probably close this out uh 3:59 p.m. so right now if I were to close this out it would be um it would cost me roughly yeah 30 would cost me about 30 28 25 26 so yeah but yeah generally like I said I wouldn't really play this game I would just either shut my laptop or I would decide to just close the position myself but uh this is probably like a rare time where kind of having fun with it like we can see here on the screen let me zoom in here by 4:30 13 feels kind of like a little holiday here will I make my $780 for the day or not I mean obviously my portfolio as a whole generates more than than that um think anywhere from I mean I'm going after safe strategies right now so I'm I'm after save passive income like 2% it's like $40,000 a month but uh it's kind of fun it's kind of fun to to take a look at a position like this and just do like a a shorter term so I guess you got to see both my short-term strategy and my long-term strategy today got to see both portfolios also my small account strategy me all this stuff I I always do in my uh in my Discord Community I'm showing all my trads um working with the members making sure that um yeah they're profitable they're learning and some people just decide to copy because they're so busy you know have so many professionals here we are 18 cents we got two minutes left but yeah Discord

gotten about 2,000 testimonials at this point so I'm really passionate happy about this and yeah at the end of the day the hardest thing to do is just to hold hold hold the position like it's not always easy actually I wonder what exact time it is it is 3:58 358 Easter I'm I'm out in Europe at the moment traveling around enjoying life a bit um treating myself learning more about other areas health wealth love happiness all those areas of life that are important not just money see here that I'm up $400 okay 340 380 okay going back and forth now it's 359 guys so look this is probably one of the most interesting positions but I think I'm going to going to end up cutting this position and I won't make the full amount today but I'll be pretty happy so buy to close 20 contracts and I will try to buy it 4.9 now in this last minute you can really get a whole lot more you can see I'm not really rushing boom we're down to 15 down to 16 we're down to 16 cents okay and uh down to 15 cents

Invest with Henry,tUDXT6-G4uA,2024-04-03T18:00:33Z,Selling Options For Passive Monthly Income (Easy Way!),Apple,"as you will see here I'm doing this on Apple... yeah I currently don't have any more sell puts in this portfolio because I'm very very currently heavy on Apple that's just my bias. Now for me doing this much of Apple is not really a risk because I think Apple's going to recover I literally have no fear whatsoever Apple can go up to $180 or even $200 in the next 6 to 12 months. So if I go to Apple options and then I go to sell put We'll just start off with selling a put okay we'll do add the money all right so let's just go out to um some future date let just go to uh let's say uh May 17 okay as I'm making this video if you're watching this future it doesn't really matter just an example just copy the logic the blueprint okay so sell put so if I sell a 170 put you can see here I'm going to get $560 all right cool now what would happen if I would sell the 170 call well here I'm getting $6.60 so the difference here is actually kind of significant but at the same time it's very close you can see how they're very similar here the 170 call doesn't really give you much upside because the current stock price is 16991 it's 170 it's n it's 9 cents off essentially you can make 660 or you can make 560 so here actually you can see a skew this is actually pretty interesting because in theory these two options should be about the same but Apple currently has a bias on the calls which is actually a bullish sign that the stock is going to go up good for me I have a lot of 10,000 shares of Apple okay so there's actually a bias in the option market right now that um apple is more likely to go up that's why the calls are priced more than the puts but if if I go shorter term which a lot of you guys are enjoying shorter term trading so let me go to 10 days uh of expiration okay so if I go to a 170 put it's 209 and if I go to cell call it's 224 so now the difference isn't that much now the difference is only about 20 oh sorry about 15 cents so this is what I mean very similar in risk and reward. So for example the stock of Apple is currently 169 let's say that in the next 10 days you think it'll go up but it won't go up past 172 and a half so you would just end up selling an option at 172 A5 and if you have a big enough portfolio you just do this on multiple positions it's only a matter of capital and time to make $10,000 a month.",1.0,0.9

(Risk Management Explained),Apple,"The covered call is an option strategy basically where an investor holds a long-term position say you're holding a lot of apple or a lot of Google or Tesla whatever stock that you have you can sell a covered call option and that will give you income. let me show you a a roll so let's say I have this apple covered call right here all right so let's pretend that this is like Tesla right so if Tesla and it's about the same price which is cool as well let's say that Tesla goes up to like 182 or apple right in this example and you don't want to get rid of the stock at 182 and a half what you would do is you would simply roll this position now I love rolling because when you roll you can adjust a position you can either save money you can make more money and you can change your strike price so here let's say that Apple went up to 1822 I can just simply go to roll this position all right and then I would change it to a future date so instead of the current expiration which is basically really really soon for as I'm making this video you will go to a future expiration so let's say you know typically for me I like to run something that I call in my Discord Community I call it the dog strategy it typically Roll by 30 days so I'm going to move this out by 30 days now you will notice that I'll actually get paid to move this by 30 days so as you can see here I can easily move an option from 1825 to1 1885 so I'm going to move up by $25 which is really good that's that's quite a lot right I mean just one contract that's $250 but I have many contracts here so what this means is when I'm moving an option contract from 1822 to 185 I'm moving it up which gives me more upside which is amazing and here you can also see the net credit here is 92 okay that's because this option is worth more so the new option I'm rolling to because it's worth more I'm actually getting paid to roll I'm actually making money to move up this option that's exactly how you want to manage a position you want to slowly manage it like I'm not going to go from 182 and A2 here's a downside okay and this is not really a downside but let's say the stock moves from 177 to something huge right to like 200 okay if it goes to 200 then obviously I'm not going to be able to roll this for a reasonable amount you can see here there is a debit so you don't want to run this strategy on a crazy stock but at the same time if you run the color strategy on a crazy stock you still get the benefits that I mentioned in the video in the beginning I mentioned how you smooth that volatility so yes in theory you will have to pay a debit when you roll but in all it is a really good strategy you can still always Roll by a little bit so you don't have to roll from like you know a huge amount for me I like to roll by 2 and 1/2 5 maybe 10 so for example if I go to2 and2 you can see that I'm basically breaking even here I can move by a whole $10 this is a whole lot of money $10 times you know each option is 100 shares that's $1,000 okay here that's 68 contracts that's $68,000 so it is a really big difference here and I'm only paying $272 so you can basically move options quite a lot without having to pay a huge cost",1.0,0.6

stock that you have you can sell a covered call option and that will give you income all right so let's go over an example my portfolio is back above $2 million has been a very good past couple of months so let's go to Tesla stock let's say that you have a lot of Tesla and Tesla has been pretty volatile it has actually fallen down quite a bit I'm actually up on Tesla because I'm just doing put credit spreads but that's you know a different topic than this video so look let's say you have a lot of Tesla you're afraid that it might pull lower so what you would do is you would go to trade Tesla options doesn't matter which brokerage you're using and the first thing is you would buy a protective put so you would buy a put option let's say that we're going to buy a put option for the short term let's just say in the short term you're pretty concerned if the stock goes you know a lot lower so let's say we pick a future date doesn't matter if you're watching this in the future let's say that we just want to protect ourselves for the next 60 days or so okay so if we want to protect ourselves for the next 60 days what we would do is we would pick a strike price that's not too far from the current price of the stock so Tesla's at 176 let's say that we're going to pick something like the 170 okay so we are afraid if Tesla goes below 170 the Delta here is 38 so there is a you know significant chance that this could happen not super significant but 38% chance the volume is pretty good at 793 and there's a lot of open interest so a lot of people are trading this option contract right here so what you would do here is you would buy a put option now in addition to this you would also sell a covered call okay so you can sell a covered call a lot further in terms of days because let's just say you're really happy and you want to lck in your gains and you can play around with the expiration days I'll show you what that looks like in just a moment but let's say you're pretty happy and you want to just lock in your gains if it goes up to 190 cool but if it goes above that you don't really care you just want to make sure to kind of guarantee yourself that it's going to be in a very stable position and that you're not going to lose much money while still creating some income so I would go to sell call option and then you can just go for the 190 right here if I expand this the the chances here are actually pretty high because there's a little bit more time here so you know because there's more time there's a more likely chance and that's why the Delta here is higher the volume is actually pretty low which is typically not a good sign so with the volume's low you want to check out the bid ask spread because look a lot of people don't understand this but even if your you know brokerage is free let's say you're using Robin Hood or whatever brokerage there's still a cost okay so when you're trading the bid and ask spread let's say you're going to sell this option well you're not going to get 1740 for it I'll tell you that right now you're going to get something in between you're probably going to get 1730 that's not that bad right it's usually the mid Price Right the mid price is usually what you get executed for but if you think about it you're not getting 1740 you're going to get 1730 so you're losing $10 so that's why it's important to have a tight bit asset spread the tighter this is the better and 20 is not that bad all right so you go to sell call now here you can see that this position doesn't look that good and that's because I'm not able to fully create the position on Robin Hood with owning the stock the missing component here is you want to own equal amount of stock for each option contract so here we have one put option one call option we would want 100 shares okay now having 100 shares would mean that you're actually collecting 1720 and you're protecting yourself with just you know ,45 so you actually get a net credit of $675 so you're making $675 you have downside protection and you have income that is the best of all worlds managing the car strategy effectively involves monitoring and adjusting the components of the strategy to adapt to changing market conditions and investment objectives so for example let's say that uh Tesla goes up a lot and you no longer feel okay with selling it at 190 let's say you become very bullish what you can then do for example you would get rid of the 190 and you would roll it higher so all that means is let me show you with an existing position that I have right now in my portfolio my portfolio is doing actually really good I have a bunch of wins right now except for Target but this is a covered call so I'm not really losing on this since I'm up a lot in the stock let me show you a a roll so let's say I have this apple covered call right here all right so let's pretend that this is like Tesla right so if Tesla and it's about the same price which is cool as well let's say that Tesla goes up to like 182 or apple right in this example and you don't want to get rid of the stock at 182 and a half what you would do is you would simply roll this position",1.0,0.5

Invest with Henry,X9ibF2v1RKA,2024-03-29T16:52:59Z,Options vs. Stocks: Which is Safer? (Risk Management Explained),Nvidia,for example if a stock ends up pulling back 10 15% you will be safe and you may only see a 5% drop now on the upside if the stock goes up 5% you actually may make 7% so you may make more the only case where you don't make more is that the stock really goes up a ginormous amount such as like an Nvidia something that just goes up 30 40% per month then in that case it's going to be much better to just buy options or just hold a stock. so for example if I go to Nvidia we have seen well Nvidia is just a rocket ship upwards but when it does pull back in the short term it could be a little bit scary because you know you might have a lot of money in it for example let's say you had 900 ft in Nvidia well if it goes down and just you know for March 8th for example here just 3 days you from 950k to 850k so you can lose 100 Grand really short term although this doesn't look bad trust me it's going to make you feel bad and that's one of my biggest things in my coaching is I always want to make sure that people are not feeling bad and making emotional decisions cuz when you're making an emotional decision that's not good you end up losing money and I'm actually making money right now in Nvidia I'm just doing Simple call Credit spread strategies that's because you know sometimes I I do focus on generating Alpha with a small amount of capital or just growing a small portfolio now for purchasing a protective put you want to buy protect protective puts to hedge against the downside risk so the strike price and expiration date of the protective put should align with your risk tolerance level so let's say that we're going to look ated NV video here let's say that it was right here and we have seen that you know for not even that long for multiple hours it was stuck at 918 had a huge jump up from 918 level to 950 let's say you just want to protect yourself and create kind of like a stoploss order basically you want to protect yourself if it goes below 918 you can buy a 9915 protective put and in this case if you had done that you would have actually done very very well maybe you were still lost money but you would have done very well versus a traditional stock investor who's just holding the stock you would have saved yourself a lot of money because you know a traditional stock investor here at 950 as it went down they would have lost like 100k but here let's just go over an example I go to trade Nvidia options let's say that I wanted to do a covered call let's say that you know just for example purposes we go out we don't even need to go out that far let's go even shorter term I'll show you how much you can make in just two weeks essentially two weeks so let's say that you ended up selling a covered call let's say it was that even if you went higher you gave yourself a lot of upside space you're like hey I think it's going to go up quite a bit so if you ended up selling the 970 for example okay a little bit longer term than 970 in the short term you know you were like hey I'm really afraid if the stock goes too low I want to buy myself a protective put and I said about 915 now that 915 is going to be well here the stock is a bit lower so it's not at 950 so this is slightly you know not an exact perfect example so let's just go for here if you were to do this it's going to be a little bit expensive actually buying the protective put is going to cost you a a net debit so you're actually going to spend $870 but the thing is you get out of the stock at 900 so whenever the stock pulled back right so here your break even $900 and you're paying eight here when the stock pulled down to$ 850 okay you essentially got out of the stock for 900 all right so when it went to $ 850 you got out of $900 yes you paid $8 for it sure you paid $8 so you know your break even was $8.90 it's at $850 so you actually saved your sell $40 I mean an investor lost a whole hundred you lost a bit less right because at 900 you got out so you saved yourself 50 bucks but you paid about eight for it okay so you save 50 bucks and you paid $8 to save 50 so basically you Sav $42 about 40 bucks so it's a lot of savings that you can have with the protective put strategy and call strategy,1.0,0.3

I'm going to take a closer look at Tesla right now I'm going to pull up the chart because you do want to make sure that you are picking a proper direction as well as a correct distance within your strike selection so right now you can see that I'm taking a look at Tesla and it has come down quite a bit from the $200 level it's currently trading at $170 with the RSI at40 I personally think that this stock is going to move back up to the middle of the Binger band which is 181. so going back to Tesla stock what I want to show you is a strategy that is going to be neutral to moderately bullish that you can absolutely make a killing on. the first call option I'm going to sell is the 180 this is the anchor or the peak price that I think that Tesla will most likely end. I'm using Tesla which is a more expensive stock so you can lower your cost a lot I'll show you an example a little bit later in this video but you can lower your cost a lot and make it a lot cheaper but I wanted to show you a little bit more of an expensive strategy because this is a high certainty play that I have currently but I'm going to show you both worlds now look there's an importance of managing this strategy so what I'm looking for is I'm looking for Tesla to make a move up to $180 per share and this is where I will realize my maximum profit of $721 on this current trade. now I also want to show you what I would do on Tesla if I was just very bullish. so it could be Tesla it could be anything it could be any stock let's say that you think a stock could go up you know in Tesla's example let's say it can go up to $200 what you want to do is the way you get maximum leverage on a option is by going as far out of the money as possible while still having certainty the option will end in the money so for example the top of the range for Tesla let's say we think it's going to be 200 I would simply Buy and out of the money bull call spread so I would go for 195 and this would be a buy call just make sure there's enough volume so there's 1,000 volume here that's pretty good and you go sell call at 200."",",,,

The thing is with Target I do need to roll the position because not necessarily that I'm at a loss because I have a $33,000 gain but I have $18,000 loss cuz of the covered call so what I would need to do here is because I don't want to lose the shares if I do lose the shares I have to pay some taxes and I don't want to do that so instead I'm going to roll this position out for the future.

Invest with Henry,JsyuKB3kBBs,2024-03-16T19:12:26Z,Top 4 Call Options I'm Buying Now (Easy Money),Apple,for example if I go into apple right now and show you buying a simple call option you will notice that you have unlimited upside so if I pick an expiration date April 5th for example if you're watching this in the future doesn't really matter these rules still apply if you want to make money so if I pick a call option you can see the maximum profit is unlimited now look the beautiful thing about call options is is you spend very little money and you get to own hundreds of shares worth of stock with just a few contracts since each option is worth 100 shares so when I buy this call option right here the 180 strike meaning I'm betting the stock will go to 180 or more I'm only paying $121 this will allow me to control 100 shares with only paying $121 now look there is a strategy to this and I want to talk about selecting strike prices as well as how long of an exper expiration you should go should you go very short-term expiration should you go medium-term expiration or should you actually buy call options that are longer term well I'm going to give you lots of different examples right now but look the first thing you need to know is if you have a smaller portfolio you can put 20% of your money 15% of your money no problem in call options but if you have a bigger portfolio you don't want to put as much money to the strategy because your portfolio needs to compromise of safe strategies buy and call options is a higher risk higher return strategy therefore you can't put all of your money and that's because there are risks you can lose the money that you put into a call option however you can manage your risk very easily because each call option is so cheap you need to balance the strategy with the other strategies that I talk about on this channel and that is the key to getting rich and building steady wealth now let's go through some examples okay I'm going to look at Apple right now Apple has pulled back quite a bit at the current moment that I'm covering this stock I do really like apple and I have a really large position so let's go through a short expiration date so first of all you can go very very short term like seven days out okay if you do seven days out the best thing to do is hope that there is an event or that there's going to be earnings okay which you can definitely track for me I like to buy call option shortterm if there's earnings 3 days before earnings happens and that's because during an earnings event a stock will move a tremendous amount since the expectation of the market can be very different from the expectation or the actual result of the earnings event so when I'm buying call options I'm looking for a higher Delta so let me actually examine one of the Deltas here you can see right now the Delta is 23 if you're using a different brokerage just identify where Delta is in your brokerage 023 is a pretty low Delta that means there's a 23% chance of Apple going to this strike price by the expiration date which is 7 days so instead of doing this I would rather get closer and have a bigger Delta and that's because if you think the stock is going up it's much better to have a higher Delta since you will get more participation and what I mean by participation is if Apple goes up by $1 the participation of this option will be $1 that it goes up multiplied by the Delta so here it would go up by 38 cents now that might not seem like a lot but 38 here is about a 20% move on the option so if the stock just moves by $1 which is not even 1% the option will move up by about 20% Which is a really big difference and that's why buying call options can make so much money if you're correct about the direction then you get a lot of movement on the option itself as long as the momentum is high which means that the stock is going up you are going to make money in fact if Apple were to go up by $5 then this Delta would actually increased by a little bit more than 38 multiplied by the 5 and that's because Delta is increasing the more the stock goes into the money the higher the Delta becomes so for example this Delta right here is 38 but if the stock were to go up then it would increase in value from 38 to 23 actually the mistake that I just caught myself making is that an option as it goes into the money will have a higher Delta not a lower one and since this one is more out of the money that's not what's going to happen it's actually going to be this one the 172.5 the Delta will go past 05 and as it keeps going into the money the Delta will keep increasing so 72 and so on and so forth it'll keep getting higher and you'll get more and more participation so the more a stock goes up the more option will actually participate with the stock and that's because it has a higher Delta because it's very deep in the money and there's a very high certainty that it's going to stay deep in the money.,1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,JsyuKB3kBBs,2024-03-16T19:12:26Z,Top 4 Call Options I'm Buying Now (Easy Money),Nvidia,"I'm going to use a different stock right now so I'm going to use Nvidia and I'm also going to talk about volatility because volatility is a very important part of option trading because a high volatility or a low volatility can really impact your option pricing so if I go to April 19 right now and then I go to option that is not that far out of the money so let's say we go for the 900 call option okay you will notice here that the implied volatility is 58 which is pretty high if you have a high volatility that means that the option is going to be more expensive now it's kind of like a cash 22 because when an option is expensive that is likely an indication that the stock is moving up and down a lot that means there is opportunity to make a lot of money but at the same time a high implied volatility alerts investors and Traders that they need to have a lot more premium to compensate them for the risk so here you will see that the $900 call option is worth $58 that is a lot of money okay this is $5,800 now granted $5,800 is much better than owning 100 shares which would be $90,000 so you still get a really good discount here by buying a call option however if you're not correct on the direction then you can lose all this money right here and the high implied volatility is making this a lot more expensive if the implied volatility was lower then this premium would go down so you're basically making a bet do you think it's going to go up or down and the bet gets more expensive the higher the implied volatility however this is a trade-off because stocks with high imply volatility can go up a lot so you can still make a lot of money for example on Nvidia the stock has been going crazy so on Nvidia you can make a lot of money even if you are sort of correct on the direction and the implied volatility is very High because the stock has been going up like absolutely crazy so if I go to the 3-month Chart even if you were to spend a lot of money on a call option let's say back when it was at $492 even if you bought like a $550 call option that would be expensive it would probably be worth like $50 $50 or so right but the stock went from $492 all the way to like over $800 so if you would have paid $50 and it went to 800 you would have 800 minus 500 which is $300 you have a gain of $300 and you paid $50 to turn into $300 so you would have a 6X return by buying a call option on Nvidia or probably even a lot more than that if you would have just bought it a few months ago actually it would be a lot more than that because even a couple of months ago the implied volatility was a lot less so the premium on buying call options might have been like 25 so you would have had like a 12x return.",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,JsyuKB3kBBs,2024-03-16T19:12:26Z,Top 4 Call Options I'm Buying Now (Easy Money),Tesla,you can use a simple technical analysis tool like Yahoo finance so let's just go into something like Tesla Tesla has been selling off and let's say that you want to jump into Tesla using a call option 3 months to expiration okay here's what I would do all right so I would go three months right here and you can see that I'm using the bowling your band at the very most I can only see Tesla really going back up to you know the moving average here the moving average is 198 so that's about where Tesla was for the past 50 days as you can see the period is 50 days on the moving average so for the past 50 days it's roughly $198 and this is going down every single day because it continues to put in a new day however I think you know right here is roughly what Tesla could be valued at if I were to make a short-term guess now it has pulled back from $200 all the way down to 162 if it were to change trajectory and if you wanted to jump in and bet on a momentum shift because you can see here the RSI is only 28 that's really low when the RSI is below 30 that is a signal it is a sign of an oversold stock this is one sign the moving average is another and the bowling band it's at the very bottom okay this stock has really sold off a lot you can see that there's quite a bit of red volume here so like multiple days of red volume a lot of huge red volume back in January 2024 or end of January there a lot of investors had fear in the stock and they just don't want to hold it anymore you know they see a lot of downside movement but at a certain point this falling knife will have to recover I mean this stock will recover it'll bounce back so buying a call option could give you huge rewards because you know check this out I'm going to go and show you the exact example right now of how much money you can make and how I would pick this call option and select it actually so let's go to trade Tesla options so look for me I think it can Bounce from 162 and A2 let's say it doesn't even go to 198 let's just say it goes to 188 middle or the center of the bowling band so 188 here's what you'll want to do you're going to want to pick an expiration day again you know for me you can see that the stock went down down from March 1st to March 15 this is just a two-e move right here so for a twoe move I can also bet on a recovery and uh let's just say 3 weeks okay we'll give it 3 weeks we'll be kind of generous here and if it were to bounce back up all the way to we said about 188 we're going to pick an option now obviously if we pick the 190 that's just too far out we don't think it's going to go to 190 and if we go for an in the money option which by the way you can do that you can buy a 150 call you'll get a lot of participation but you'll also pay a decent price okay I think what would be better here is if you just go right out of the money okay this isn't too far out this isn't in the money it's a good price 750 okay and if this option basically the break even is 1722 so if it goes to 180 or even like you can see here even if it goes to 176 you still already have a 50% return you can see that on the screen right there it says $372 192 and that is basically 50% of 750 which you are putting up but the point where you would double this is you can see the break even right here is 17240 and that's because the 165 strike plus the premium that you're paying of 750 is going to be 17250 I don't know why it says 40 it's going to be 17250 and then basically for you to double your money has to go up by 750 more so at 180 you would double your money at 1875 you would triple your money so all you really need is for Tesla to first of all break even from 1725 and then from there on you know the sky is a limit you have unlimited profit potential as the stock goes higher so look this would be really good but you can also go a longer term expiration so you don't have to do 21 days you can go a little bit longer I wouldn't go over a year but you can go up to let's say you can go for 245 days for example by the way you can go for over a year you just have to be really patient you have to sit on the stock and by the way nobody said you have to hold until expiration you can always close a stock for a profit anytime that you want I do do that I do take profit pretty consistently especially once I'm happy with the return so for me how I would get out of this position is once the stock starts swinging up if it even swings to 180 in the short term I'm going to be cutting this position that is going to be my exit point I'm going to sell that option for a profit in fact I've seen a lot of my students once the stock start swinging back up from like 162 and a half to 165 in a day or two and they see a profit of 10 20% they're sometimes happy and they cut the position and make 10 20% now for me I like to let my winners run I like to let the you know the positions that I'm making money on that are rising in profits I want to let them run because taking profit too early can you know really hamper your returns you get a lot more money if you can really just hold that position have that patience and let that position really increase in value so for me I would want to see a significant swing and as it would test this point at 177 then I would be pretty happy I would say hey okay we are approaching 180 I don't need it to go to 188 to be happy I just will use intuition and say at 177 178 180 I will cut the position and and make some really good money let's say 40 50% but I determine that you know a couple ways actually as I'm entering the trade I want to know exactly how much I want to make as I'm entering it but also you know as the the trade is in place I'm also feeling is this stock going to continue running up do I think the momentum is going to continue how is the technical analysis here how is the news how short of a time period sometimes if it happens really short term in time it goes up and I'm up 20 30% I'll also take profit right there's nothing wrong with that now look there's is an option firing on November 15 if I were to go ahead and buy a call option what you can do is you can actually turn this into a really interesting position you can go for something in the money so here's a higher Delta you can do this and by the way I don't know if you knew this but call option that's your long right here this is a little bit more expensive you can also sell call options on it okay you can actually generate income on this position while still betting that it's going to go up so as the stock is going up you can is still bet on it going up and create some income this strategy is called the poor man's covered call strategy and if you want to learn more about it here's a video that you have to watch that I made explaining exactly how to open a poor man's covered call and manage and close for profit,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,rIA5tof5VKU,2024-03-07T20:03:58Z,PLTR READY TO ROCKET 🚀,Palantir,"three weeks ago I told you guys that it's going to get wild for paler and in today's video I'm going to go over technical analysis as well as some fundamental analysis for paler give you guys some latest news about the CTO what he had to say about the company and also go through my portfolio a little bit and tell you what I'm doing with paler stock and specific strategies that I'm running with options so let's jump into it 3 weeks ago I said that basically Palante here is going to get wild and for good reason the stock has been on an absolute tear this company is an AI play okay I may have missed the boat on Nvidia but I have not missed the boat on paler and I've been talking about paler for a very very long time I think this company still has so much more room to run I think the momentum here on the stock is absolutely insane typically I'm looking at the bowling band and paler right now is peeking through the bowling band I mean it's going up this mountain it's going up Mount Everest but hey there is so much more fuel this is like a rocket and I think this rocket is going to continue going I mean I can can really see paler heading over to $50 per share and I want to mention that this is a AI play like they literally just won a new contract with the US Army to build AI enabled vehicles and this is basically you know what they have to say let's watch this clip really quickly and then I'm going to show you some option strategies P here having its best day in a month on news that it will become prime contractor for the US Army's Titan program to build an AI enabled vehicle initial contract $178 million for the first 10 prototypes this is a high-profile win for paler which the military picked over an industry stalwart RTX marks the first time a software company becomes prime contractor of a big Hardware program you can see shares end of the day up about 10% well paler Chief technology officer sham sanar joins us now exclusively to discuss sham it's great to have you back on the show welcome thanks Morgan great to be back with you all right so this is so this is significant it's meaningful for the company as I just mentioned this Milestone of being a software company that is now prime contractor for a high-profile Hardware program what does this enable for paler and how does it speak to the role that software and particularly AI is increasingly playing in military applications we've been talking for a while about how how software is eating the world I think this is a manifestation of just that here we have a vehicle that you wouldn't traditionally associate with the software company but we are we are delivering an AI defined vehicle that's going to provide deep sensing to enable long range Precision fires uh and really this this vehicle was built around the soldier to enable their workflows and it's another manifestation of how AI is changing the face of warfare so the CTO is very positive and just in general the management team over at paler is phenomenal so let me go into paler stock pltr now I wish I had a lot more of this stock I have a little bit of my other portfolio but overall I wish I had more Palance here it just been a little bit difficult for me because I have so much apple right now which has gone down but speaking about pal here what I'm planning to do is I'm planning to add more shares to my portfolio I want to at least triple or quadruple my position I want to get up to 1,000 or 2,000 shares and right now actually I believe in paler so much that I don't have a covered call position because I don't want to sell a covered call if I were to sell a covered call and the stock continues to go up I would have to either you know roll my position higher for a debit typically or I would have to lose my shares which I don't want to do so as soon as the Market opens up today I'm going to be buying more paler stock NOW the thing is a lot of people would say like why would you buy the stock if your average cost is 20 it's way more than your average cost thing is it doesn't matter I'm dollar cost averaging into paler I want to build my position I'm going to continue to build my position I've traded this stock a lot I've made a lot of money by running the wheel strategy so for example you know here's the wheel strategy on paler if I go to paler options this is what I've been doing I've been very very successful with it however I keep losing my shares and it's a taxable event so what I mean by taxable event is let's say I sell a put option like for example I go to sell put and then I go to March 15 if I sell a put on March 15 I get like put at $26 and then I sell a covered call right that's the wheel strategy I sell a covered call at say $26 as well or $27 and it goes to 27 I lose my shares and I've done that over and over again on Palante here because it is a volatile stock this stock goes up and down which is a good thing for an option seller I've been able to collect income I've been able to enter the stock and exit but honestly at this time I think I want to kind of settle down and I just want to build a bigger position and not lose my shares so I would do something like going out like say 8 days or 15 days heck even I can go out like 43 days so like April 19 here and I would go a little bit more aggressive so typically I say the best Delta is like 30 but for paler since I want to get assigned I'm literally itching to get into the stock I want to increase my position because I have a big belief about this stock I've been having a big belief about it for honestly like couple years now I've been talking about pal here for a long time and what I would do here is I would go for a little bit more aggressive Delta so you can see that the Delta is. 43 okay 043 Delta is pretty high that means there's a 43% chance of me getting assigned now this is actually good if I want to acquire the shares so right here you can see that the premium is a187 that is absolutely insane because 4 * 26 is a do this is almost about 7% this is about a 7% return per contract so I'm going to sell let's say 10 contracts I'm going to collect 1,000 so if I go to continue I go to 10 10 contracts I can collect $ 1,870 yeah I'm putting up $24,000 but I'm happy to buy this stock so this is a non- losing strategy this is what I like to do this is my bread and butter strategy this is what I like to focus on I like to have a non losing strategy that means if the market pulls back I'm happy because I get to own palent here the market goes up cool I still get to win because I'm collecting this premium upfront enters the cash in my account out then I'm free to use that cash for whatever I like here the Delta is 043 basically 044 the implied volatility is very high this is higher than Tesla so the premium is very juicy now this could mean they have earnings coming up this could mean there's events coming up that's fine it doesn't matter to me cuz I'm a long-term investor I am jumping into the stock for the long term for me it doesn't matter that the stock is going to pull back because let's actually take a look if it were to pull back right let's say that it pulled back to even $20 which we see there's a little bit of a double Peak and there's some selling pressures here so a lot of investors may have thought that this was the top and yeah little do they know there's some good news coming and boom We shot up like like a rocket like literally from 16 to 24 in my Discord we were actually in this place so I'm I'm I'm really happy about this but look if it pulls back and if this like let's actually go from the line to um Candlestick so if this Gap goes down you know a lot of these Candlestick technical investors will say when there's a gap up there's uh you know there's typically a gap down so here we what we can see is maybe we'll get a little bit of retracement that's fine okay I still see the long-term bull Trend like if I were to draw some trend lines I mean we bounc really heavy here from this level which was under $10 and then easily the you know there's good support at around $15 you can actually see that I have another line here because there's really good support at around just 1480 I think around 1480 there was really good support like I mean there's a good support here another one and the stock just bounced up okay so you know can there be downside sure but would I be happy to own the shares absolutely so for me selling puts is literally the best strategy now another thing you could do and it's a very similar strategy actually a lot of people blow their mind but a cash secured put is actually very similar to a covered call so if you were to buy 100 shares right now you can also sell a call option and I would I would recommend selling a call option that gives you some room for upside okay sometimes like in my double dividend strategy I am happy to sell like very close to the money like $27 like right there but the thing is with P here since I believe in the upside I wouldn't sell something close to the money I would actually go a little bit farther out of the money so for example I'd buy 100 shares and basically $27 okay then I would sell a call option I would go out to 30 honestly I would give yourself some upside because from 27 to30 that's $3 that's a little bit over a 10% return and then you still get to collect about $88 worth of Premium so for me collecting $88 worth of Premium is amazing cuz that's like 3.2% in 43 days all right so that's basically 3% per month plus 11% of upside okay and paler could could do that like if I go to the two-year chart paler is basically at a 52- we High however in this market right now guys I'm telling you momentum is one of the biggest factors literally Lally ever like when I was working at a hedge fund in Philadelphia I was working at PNC Capital Advisors we're looking at a multiactor model OKAY pay attention this is super important if you're losing attention telling you right now listen a multiactor model is basically looking at different factors for example how is like if I go to statistics right now what is the PE Ratio what is the PEG ratio price to earnings group ratio what's the price to book ratio they're looking at different statistics like what's the short ratio okay they're looking at different factors and the biggest Factor the most important factor of all that trumps all the others by far okay we looked at 48 factors one factor had 90% seriously 90% of the attribution okay attribution just means the results 90% of the results were from momentum okay that's basically like you're trying to get in shape and you're eating like chicken and broccoli but 90% of the results is through sleep okay 90% of results is through hydration same thing with the stock market 90% of the results is momentum I actually like to ride momentum I've just been scared to ride momentum on Nvidia I'm scared to look stupid it's my it's a little bit of my weakness okay but we all have a weakness and I just want to be smart I'd rather to be smart and safe than sorry but with paler I took a look at the facts I look at the momentum and the momentum just looks amazing look I'm not sponsored by the stock I could care less I'm just trying to put some money in your pocket I'm just looking out for my subscribers I hope that I'm doing basically God's work here to just help you learn learn how to invest for me being in high quality companies making a steady return in my portfolio is much more important for me than becoming the richest person ever okay I just want steady returns that's why I'm in apple apple hasn't been working out super well for me I actually just got a signed on Apple 190 but when I'm bullish I hang on I don't change my mind I have a long-term mindset when it comes to investing that's paler for me that's Apple I love Amazon um I also have Target Target k killed it on earnings absolutely crushed that we've been making money hand over fist as well as Walmart I really like Walmart posts spit it went up a little bit not as much as I would like but it went up I have a very concentrated portfolio right now and my biggest goal right now is to put more money to work on paler I don't cover many stocks on this channel paler is one of my favorite so I'm trying to be in AI right now I need AI exposure because right now the AI trend is super strong and a lot of people are investing in AMD Nvidia like if if I look at Nvidia Nvidia doesn't even make sense to me I've been wrong in Nvidia okay I admit it but it doesn't even make sense it's $900 like that is insane if I look at the three-month chart this stock is up 97% like this is a hockey puck stick this is typical like compound interest this is this is insanity okay but I guess it makes sense for some investors or or they're just missing out on the hype I don't know like let me know in the comment section do you think Nvidia is going to go up to $1,000 per share or you know is it just hype like is this stock going to pull back i been waiting for a pullback but I I'm just sitting out of this stock right now I'd rather be in something more predictable and I'd rather be early on a trend okay when I was I traveled the world right and I was in uh Median Columbia for a little bit I really like the fruit out there I like the people everyone's nice this was a while ago but I met this guy who sold the company to ethereum okay he was part of ethereum this guy was so rich and he was just telling me the best way to make money the best way to become a multi-millionaire I mean this guy might have been a billionaire I don't even know right he didn't he didn't tell me that I'm not going to ask him like Hey how what's your net worth but this guy was basically like hey I'm just meditating all day I'm just hanging out because I have enough money and I know enough money for this guy was like a lot of money like 100 Mil he told me you want to be early on Trends if you can get into a trend early that's how you make the most money I mean just look at Jeff Bezos Jeff Bezos he was you know if I were to type in Jeff Bezos his office right now right Jeff Bezos office he was grinding hard like look at look at Dr Jeff okay Mr Jeff was sitting here in front of his screen amazon.com but the thing is he was early on the internet play okay he saw that the internet was growing so he started putting out books on the internet and then Amazon you know that was history from there Amazon turned in from books to retail to you know Healthcare to uh like everything right now they sell everything then they had prime then they had like one-day delivery he just scaled up and that's what I see with paler as well as they keep winning these government contracts they're going to keep printing money and being friends with the government that pays the big bucks okay and also being part of AI implementing your infrastructure into a company like paler does it is really hard to leave guys that is a business with a wide moat that's exactly what um Warren Buffett talks about he talks about having a business with a wide moat a wide moat means it's hard to compete it is difficult to compete with paler it is almost impossible once they come in once they Implement their infrastructure the the government or you know these big companies they're hooked they can't get off because even if they wanted to get off there is Big transition cost okay that is what you want in a company and you know same thing with Proctor and Gamble people using that you know toothpaste soila paper you know they're not going to stop it doesn't matter what kind of times there are everyone needs that you know everyone's going to brush their teeth same thing with pal here it's almost like a consumer um staple within software and that's what I really like",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,rIA5tof5VKU,2024-03-07T20:03:58Z,PLTR READY TO ROCKET 🚀,NVIDIA,"I may have missed the boat on Nvidia but I have not missed the boat on paler and I've been talking about paler for a very very long time I think this company still has so much more room to run I think the momentum here on the stock is absolutely insane typically I'm looking at the bowling band and paler right now is peeking through the bowling band I mean it's going up this mountain it's going up Mount Everest but hey there is so much more fuel this is like a rocket and I think this rocket is going to continue going I mean I can can really see paler heading over to $50 per share and I want to mention that this is a AI play like they literally just won a new contract with the US Army to build AI enabled vehicles and this is basically you know what they have to say let's watch this clip really quickly and then I'm going to show you some option strategies P here having its best day in a month on news that it will become prime contractor for the US Army's Titan program to build an AI enabled vehicle initial contract $178 million for the first 10 prototypes this is a high-profile win for paler which the military picked over an industry stalwart RTX marks the first time a software company becomes prime contractor of a big Hardware program you can see shares end of the day up about 10% well paler Chief technology officer sham sanar joins us now exclusively to discuss sham it's great to have you back on the show welcome thanks Morgan great to be back with you all right so this is so this is significant it's meaningful for the company as I just mentioned this Milestone of being a software company that is now prime contractor for a high-profile Hardware program what does this enable for paler and how does it speak to the role that software and particularly AI is increasingly playing in military applications we've been talking for a while about how how software is eating the world I think this is a manifestation of just that here we have a vehicle that you wouldn't traditionally associate with the software company but we are we are delivering an AI defined vehicle that's going to provide deep sensing to enable long range Precision fires uh and really this this vehicle was built around the soldier to enable their workflows and it's another manifestation of how AI is changing the face of warfare so the CTO is very positive and just in general the management team over at paler is phenomenal so let me go into paler stock pltr now I wish I had a lot more of this stock I have a little bit of my other portfolio but overall I wish I had more Palance here it just been a little bit difficult for me because I have so much apple right now which has gone down but speaking about pal here what I'm planning to do is I'm planning to add more shares to my portfolio I want to at least triple or quadruple my position I want to get up to 1,000 or 2,000 shares and right now actually I believe in paler so much that I don't have a covered call position because I don't want to sell a covered call if I were to sell a covered call and the stock continues to go up I would have to either you know roll my position higher for a debit typically or I would have to lose my shares which I don't want to do so as soon as the Market opens up today I'm going to be buying more paler stock NOW the thing is a lot of people would say like why would you buy the stock if your average cost is 20 it's way more than your average cost thing is it doesn't matter I'm dollar cost averaging into paler I want to build my position I'm going to continue to build my position I've traded this stock a lot I've made a lot of money by running the wheel strategy so for example you know here's the wheel strategy on paler if I go to paler options this is what I've been doing I've been very very successful with it however I keep losing my shares and it's a taxable event so what I mean by taxable event is let's say I sell a put option like for example I go to sell put and then I go to March 15 if I sell a put on March 15 I get like put at $26 and then I sell a covered call right that's the wheel strategy I sell a covered call at say $26 as well or $27 and it goes to 27 I lose my shares and I've done that over and over again on Palante here because it is a volatile stock this stock goes up and down which is a good thing for an option seller I've been able to collect income I've been able to enter the stock and exit but honestly at this time I think I want to kind of settle down and I just want to build a bigger position and not lose my shares so I would do something like going out like say 8 days or 15 days heck even I can go out like 43 days so like April 19 here and I would go a little bit more aggressive so typically I say the best Delta is like 30 but for paler since I want to get assigned I'm literally itching to get into the stock I want to increase my position because I have a big belief about this stock I've been having a big belief about it for honestly like couple years now I've been talking about pal here for a long time and what I would do here is I would go for a little bit more aggressive Delta so you can see that the Delta is. 43 okay 043 Delta is pretty high that means there's a 43% chance of me getting assigned now this is actually good if I want to acquire the shares so right here you can see that the premium is a187 that is absolutely insane because 4 * 26 is a do this is almost about 7% this is about a 7% return per contract so I'm going to sell let's say 10 contracts I'm going to collect 1,000 so if I go to continue I go to 10 10 contracts I can collect $ 1,870 yeah I'm putting up $24,000 but I'm happy to buy this stock so this is a non- losing strategy this is what I like to do this is my bread and butter strategy this is what I like to focus on I like to have a non losing strategy that means if the market pulls back I'm happy because I get to own palent here the market goes up cool I still get to win because I'm collecting this premium upfront enters the cash in my account out then I'm free to use that cash for whatever I like here the Delta is 043 basically 044 the implied volatility is very high this is higher than Tesla so the premium is very juicy now this could mean they have earnings coming up this could mean there's events coming up that's fine it doesn't matter to me cuz I'm a long-term investor I am jumping into the stock for the long term for me it doesn't matter that the stock is going to pull back because let's actually take a look if it were to pull back right let's say that it pulled back to even $20 which we see there's a little bit of a double Peak and there's some selling pressures here so a lot of investors may have thought that this was the top and yeah little do they know there's some good news coming and boom We shot up like like a rocket like literally from 16 to 24 in my Discord we were actually in this place so I'm I'm I'm really happy about this but look if it pulls back and if this like let's actually go from the line to um Candlestick so if this Gap goes down you know a lot of these Candlestick technical investors will say when there's a gap up there's uh you know there's typically a gap down so here we what we can see is maybe we'll get a little bit of retracement that's fine okay I still see the long-term bull Trend like if I were to draw some trend lines I mean we bounc really heavy here from this level which was under $10 and then easily the you know there's good support at around $15 you can actually see that I have another line here because there's really good support at around just 1480 I think around 1480 there was really good support like I mean there's a good support here another one and the stock just bounced up okay so you know can there be downside sure but would I be happy to own the shares absolutely so for me selling puts is literally the best strategy now another thing you could do and it's a very similar strategy actually a lot of people blow their mind but a cash secured put is actually very similar to a covered call so if you were to buy 100 shares right now you can also sell a call option and I would I would recommend selling a call option that gives you some room for upside okay sometimes like in my double dividend strategy I am happy to sell like very close to the money like $27 like right there but the thing is with P here since I believe in the upside I wouldn't sell something close to the money I would actually go a little bit farther out of the money so for example I'd buy 100 shares and basically $27 okay then I would sell a call option I would go out to 30 honestly I would give yourself some upside because from 27 to30 that's $3 that's a little bit over a 10% return and then you still get to collect about $88 worth of Premium so for me collecting $88 worth of Premium is amazing cuz that's like 3.2% in 43 days all right so that's basically 3% per month plus 11% of upside okay and paler could could do that like if I go to the two-year chart paler is basically at a 52- we High however in this market right now guys I'm telling you momentum is one of the biggest factors literally Lally ever like when I was working at a hedge fund in Philadelphia I was working at PNC Capital Advisors we're looking at a multiactor model OKAY pay attention this is super important if you're losing attention telling you right now listen a multiactor model is basically looking at different factors for example how is like if I go to statistics right now what is the PE Ratio what is the PEG ratio price to earnings group ratio what's the price to book ratio they're looking at different statistics like what's the short ratio okay they're looking at different factors and the biggest Factor the most important factor of all that trumps all the others by far okay we looked at 48 factors one factor had 90% seriously 90% of the attribution okay attribution just means the results 90% of the results were from momentum okay that's basically like you're trying to get in shape and you're eating like chicken and broccoli but 90% of the results is through sleep okay 90% of results is through hydration same thing with the stock market 90% of the results is momentum I actually like to ride momentum I've just been scared to ride momentum on Nvidia I'm scared to look stupid it's my it's a little bit of my weakness okay but we all have a weakness and I just want to be smart I'd rather to be smart

at a multiactor model OKAY pay attention this is super important if you're losing attention telling you right now listen a multiactor model is basically looking at different factors for example how is like if I go to statistics right now what is the PE Ratio what is the PEG ratio price to earnings group ratio what's the price to book ratio they're looking at different statistics like what's the short ratio okay they're looking at different factors and the biggest Factor the most important factor of all that trumps all the others by far okay we looked at 48 factors one factor had 90% seriously 90% of the attribution okay attribution just means the results 90% of the results were from momentum okay that's basically like you're trying to get in shape and you're eating like chicken and broccoli but 90% of the results is through sleep okay 90% of results is through hydration same thing with the stock market 90% of the results is momentum I actually like to ride momentum I've just been scared to ride momentum on Nvidia I'm scared to look stupid it's my it's a little bit of my weakness okay but we all have a weakness and I just want to be smart I'd rather to be smart and safe than sorry but with paler I took a look at the facts I look at the momentum and the momentum just looks amazing look I'm not sponsored by the stock I could care less I'm just trying to put some money

of my favorite so I'm trying to be in AI right now I need AI exposure because right now the AI trend is super strong and a lot of people are investing in AMD Nvidia like if if I look at Nvidia Nvidia doesn't even make sense to me I've been wrong in Nvidia okay I admit it but it doesn't even make sense it's $900 like that is insane if I look at the three-month chart this stock is up 97% like this is a hockey puck stick this is typical like compound interest this is this is insanity okay but I guess it makes sense for some investors or or they're just missing out on the hype I don't know like let me know in the comment section do you think Nvidia is going to go up to $1,000 per share or you know is it just hype like is this stock going to pull back i been waiting for a pullback but I I'm just sitting out of this stock right now I'd rather be in something more predictable and I'd rather be early on a trend okay when I was I traveled the world right and I was in uh Median Columbia for a little bit I really like the fruit out there I like the people everyone's nice this was a while ago but I met this guy who sold the company to ethereum okay he was part of ethereum this guy was so rich and he was just telling me the best way to make money the best way to become a multi-millionaire I mean this guy might have been a billionaire I don't even know right he didn't he didn't tell me that I'm not going to ask him like Hey how what's your net worth but this guy was basically like hey I'm just meditating all day I'm just hanging out because I have enough money and I know enough money for this guy was like a lot of money like 100 Mil he told me you want to be early on Trends if you can get into a trend early that's how you make the most money I mean just look at Jeff Bezos Jeff Bezos he was you know if I were to type in Jeff Bezos his office right now right Jeff Bezos office he was grinding hard like look at look at Dr Jeff okay Mr Jeff was sitting here in front of his screen amazon.com but the thing is he was early on the internet play okay he saw that the internet was growing so he started putting out books on the internet and then Amazon you know that was history from there Amazon turned in from books to retail to you know Healthcare to uh like everything right now they sell everything then they had prime then they had like one-day delivery he just scaled up and that's what I see with paler as well as they keep winning these government contracts they're going to keep printing money and being friends with the government that pays the big bucks okay and also being part of AI implementing your infrastructure into a company like paler does it is really hard to leave guys that is a business with a wide moat that's exactly what um Warren Buffett talks

Invest with Henry,bPfQ44kVQDk,2024-02-08T15:00:39Z,I Told You… Now it’s going to be wild,Palantir,"well howdy guys we have done really well on paler so in this video I want to talk about my play on paler how much I put in it so I put in a little bit over $9,000 so not that big of a play however this play has really netted me a lot of money in the short term and I have been running a couple of interesting strategies which we have to talk about now first of all just some news on Palante here paler went up 8% so they have obviously had a really good earnings and and so many people are understanding that AI is really here and it is a trend that we want to ride so riding the AI trend is literally one of the smartest things that you can do right now I've been wrong about Nvidia but that's also an AI trend for me paler has been a very very easy play though and I've been talking about paler for a very long time on this channel paler is one of my top plays right now if I go into the chart I want to show you what paler technical analysis looks like and specifically what I think is going to happen to paler next because this is a very profitable stock to trade so in the past 6 months paler has been going pretty much sideways and you know I think that this was a $20 stock no problem and that's exactly why I ended up purchasing pound here for $20 per share now I've actually timed this stock really well I don't really believe in timing the market but I have timed this stock really well if we look at my history here with my option trading I have sold 17 calls and you know decided not to sell some more calls because I wanted to see what would happen with earnings I thought the stock would go to $20 maybe $21 and this stock went all the way to the Moon to $23.57 now look today I did sell some covered calls I am trying to generate some income on my position I'm pretty much always trying to do that for my students that's because I'm after consistent income using covered calls that's the most basic strategy that I'm always trying to implement to generate cash flow in my my portfolio that's the most important thing if you want to retire you need cash flow and you can make over $10,000 a month without even having that much money if you are catching plays like this I mean when paler look I sold paler $24 calls today I only had four contracts I sold four contracts made $224 now this is going out into February 16 but you know here's what I would basically do right now I would do a number of things I would either sell covered calls if you have shares if you don't have shares let's take a look at the technical chart what I would probably do is I would sell $21 puts so if you sell $21 puts that means you can buy the stock for $21 or you can buy shares right now and sell $24 covered calls so if you end up selling $24 covered calls then you will generate income right now as well as if you are selling puts you will also generate income at this moment which strategy is better well actually I would use both you can do a combination of selling puts and covered calls this is called the covered strangle strategy so you know it sounds really complicated but it's really not here's what you would do I'm going to go into trade paler options so you can sell some put options let's say for February 16 which is 9 days out you can sell the $21 strike which you know granted it's not going for that much but if you sell this and you do covered calls then you are dollar cost averaging because because what happens is you buy stock at 23 you know 61 or whatever the price is when you watch this video but you also sell put options saying I'm going to buy the stock at 21 I have shares right now for 2362 this is how you dollar cost average into a stock that has gone up because the last thing that you want to do is fully commit yourself to a stock that has just gone up so much now it's really easy to just say hey the Stock's going to keep going up to the Moon I am not sure because I think the stock is worth between 21 to you know maybe even $29 per share in the next 6 months so you know just looking at the news you know there's quite a lot that's going to be coming out and the most important thing to look for with paler is their earnings and it's also what their management is doing so we also know paler stock surge it does show that investors haven't had enough of AI I think being in this trend again just makes so much sense if I look at you know any of the Articles we can see that well actually if I look at the volume we can see that people are buying this stock hand over fist and they're really interested in the stock overall I mean if you look at you know just some comments here at the same time here's what an analyst said this analyst was extremely bullish on palen here and for good reason I think that you know obviously there's a lot of smart analysts out there on palen here the smartest ones they understand how AI works so um we cannot rationalize paler current valuation in the base case however you know all of them are still bullish and that's because well you know let's let's take a look at palen here's financial statements it really doesn't make sense but it's not supposed to the best companies don't make sense today they make sense in the future so price to sales Wise It's you know 22 which is you know again not super cheap price to earnings group is actually pretty good 1.2 is not high at all price earnings doesn't matter at all because we we've seen Amazon we've seen Tesla have really high price earnings I think they were in the thousands doesn't really matter this is going to come down quite a lot as palen here has more earnings and you know if we look at the financial statement you will see that you know their financials are are growing I mean they just doubled from 2020 to basically the last 12 months that's what TTM stands for so you know if they double again and again which you know that is not an unreasonable trajectory given what paler does I mean they are in the government's Pockets they're making that government money there's nothing better than government money big stable contracts that just keep flowing in those dollars from the government that's uh you know paying all these taxes for you know it's going going somewhere it's going somewhere and paler is capitalizing on that they have really good relationships in the space which is pretty much the most important thing you want to look at a company's brand which is why I'm so heavy on on uh Apple by the way and palen here they have a really good brand and once they come into a company and they download you know install their software it is hard to leave that's the thing it is hard to implement new software that's how they get you they get you because once you've already started there's so much cost to leaving them and that's you know another big benefit to to their contracts not only do they have a good relationship they also have a really sticky software so sticky software is really important in Silicon Valley if you look at the best tech companies you know there's Uber there's Airbnb there's all these platform software technology companies right where they just take a commission for creating a market of buyers and sellers that's a really powerful business model but also implementing software where the customer is hooked like a CRM right if we look at CRM this is really important to pay attention to so if you're getting bored make sure to uh really pay attention right now cuz this is really important if you understand how software works and I used to work in Wall Street as a software analyst so I looked at uh comparables looking at comparables means that um I'm looking at the entire software sector and seeing which companies have a competitive Advantage as well as which companies are fairly valued right so looking at their valuation fundamentally is what I used to do and you know that would take a lot of time I did not really like working on Wall Street it was really long hours but you know looking at a company like Salesforce same story here you know they have um let's look at their statistics they also don't have the you know the best valuation but they have a really sticky software price of sales wise they are only at eight Which is less than half of palent here it's less than half but then again this company has been around for a lot longer and still their price to earnings is very very high okay price to earnings group ratio is actually higher than paler so this is a signal that paler is actually more fairly valued than Salesforce on this one metric right here okay so you know lot of people say that pound here is you know overpriced I don't think so I think this stock still has a lot more room to run if we look at the 5year chart right here you will see that it is coming back to basically 2021 levels of $28 per share maybe even $30 per share a lot of analysts think that this is a $100 stock now I don't know if I would go that far I don't know if I would say it's a $100 stock but you know if it does double from here we'd be sitting at basically $46 to $50 per share I don't know what's going to happen in the short term but I know in the medium term what I'm planning to do is continue to sell covered calls I would specifically go for roughly 30 Delta that is my sweet spot that's my sweet spot for many different companies whether it's uh you know Apple or Google you know going for a 30 Delta is you know pretty proven in my experience so if I go to let's say March 15 say I want to do it the lazy way go 30 days out and I go for a $25 covered call that's going to be a little bit too high of a Delta 43 so if I go to 26 35 Delta this is going to be perfectly fine you would collect $90 which is B basically around 4% you can make 4% per month just off of Premium on pal here and that's because the implied volatility is very good at 55 the volume is also very high so good volume signifies that um it's easy to get in and out of pound here you are not going to get screwed on the price the bid ask spread is really good at 992 a tight bid ask spread is very important because you know not only do you guys pay fees and even Robin Hood has a 3-cent fee right now but whenever you have a wide bit ass spread it's harder to execute trades it's harder to get filled it's hard hard to open it's harder to close it's also more costly because then you know if you're buying you have to buy closer to the ask if you're selling you have to sell closer to the bid and I guess you're kind of losing a dollar every time you do that which is why I don't like spreads on palons here guys I would keep it simple straightforward you know the strategy is covered calls and you know the big portfolios out there you're going to have a lot of fun you know portfolios 50k 100K you guys can generate some really consistent income on Palante your stock by just keeping it simple keeping it simple and steady creating that safe passive income so so you know you can retire and and have more freedom in in in life and I think this is one of the best stocks that you can have in your portfolio definitely one of the 10 stocks that I recommend if you want to see all my trades and get trades just like this I was in this stock before earnings then go ahead

Invest with Henry,LLJYuq78Gmg,2024-02-04T23:00:10Z,How to BUY Call Options on Robinhood For Beginners,Amazon,now I can also show you how the strategy worked on Amazon so Amazon also had a really big day obviously not as much as meta but that's okay let me show you how much a typical call option can make during an earnings event so Amazon was trading for around $155 now it's at$ 170 that is a very big move and if we look at the call options here you will see that they also have gone up quite a lot but only 76 to 100% And that is what's more typical when you're buying call options for earnings. so for example let's say that Amazon already had earnings but there's six more days and you think that the stock can run up so let's just go over an example right here the maximum profit is unlimited so in this examp example Amazon could keep going up and you could end up making a lot of money but most likely the stock may go up a little bit and you are risking $225 here so you do risk whatever you pay for the option the premium that you pay that is an upfront value that you pay and you can lose the entire amount now you can't lose more than what you pay so here we see that $225 that is the payment that you put UPF front and then your expectation is that the stock will rise in value so let's say the stock goes up to 1722 and it ends there on Friday of expiration February 9th as I'm making this video well in that example you actually still lose $225 because your break even is$ 17475.,1.0,0.3

Invest with Henry,o1gEPMq6o64,2024-01-29T20:58:58Z,"These Secrets Scaled me to $1,000,000+",Amazon,"like for example let me go into yaku Finance I'm to show you something that I look at for Amazon okay so let's talk about Amazon and go to the statistics tab something that I really want to look at is well several different factors let's just start from the top so 1.64 trillion in market cap that's cool this is a pretty big company obviously now price to sales is actually three which is pretty low but you need to take this into account in perspective because you know for example you know on Amazon because they have such low profit margins which is only 3.62% their price of sales is not that high however if I look at a different company like say Tesla the price of sales ratio is going to be higher so I do want to keep track of price of sales ratios I do have them in my mind there is not a set rule so a lot of people ask me well is six good is five good well it really depends so for Amazon below three right now is good for Tesla below 7 is good so both of these companies are fairly expensive well Tesla's actually pulled back so much has really really shocked me so you know taking a look at the chart right here it's currently at 185 which is in my opinion pretty cheap I mean this stock actually blew down you know past all resistance levels it has gone down so insanely that's below the Binger band the volume was very heavy so overall Tesla has come down a lot and if I were to be scaling a portfolio which I basically always am I do live off of this portfolio I would be looking at basically having a diversity of about 10 stocks so right now if I go to my stock positions I only have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so I only have eight positions I am looking to add two different stocks to my portfolio so I don't necessarily have 10% and 10 picks I think it really depends on your situation so for example I have several clients and students that are you know let's say they have $150,000 well they don't necessarily want to have like you know1 $15,000 positions sometimes they go much heavier into stocks like apple and for me specifically you can see I have 57.96 of my money in apple right now so why do I put so much in apple well for me it creates Simplicity I don't want to have you know too many positions again 10 positions is plenty but I also don't want to be perfectly spread out 10% each because you know honestly you want to have some higher weights in your higher conviction play that's what Goldman Sachs basically taught me they had a high conviction list and I miss working there only because I had access to such amazing research was doing so much option Research into different studies like when do you sell puts when do you do covered calls what Delta how was the strike selection for me the way I manage my position like apple it's a bit bigger so I am doing covered calls like right now it's at 192 my average is 181 and you can see here that I have multiple different positions I have sold put options at 185 also at 190 and I'm selling covered calls so I'm doing a few different positions I'm trying to generate income and I'm also you know making money on the stock itself so I'm up looks like $55,000 on the stock itself so look if you have a portfolio that is again it's over $50,000 all you really have to do is give it time and start to you know put your money into positions that are going to be high growth in a good sector and for me that's really technology so Apple Amazon Microsoft we do see these stocks hitting alltime highs so you know I do want to preface this that it is fairly risky investing in tech companies especially when they keep hitting all-time high after alltime high after alltime high but the thing is a lot of people are asking me do I wait for a pullback and the answer is no you do not wait for a pullback despite all the videos on YouTube and that's for several reasons because if I look at the 5-year chart on Amazon there was some you know pullbacks but overall you know the stock is just going up okay so you can't really time the market it's very difficult let's go to the max here so it's very difficult and for example from 2020 up until 2021 so this is literally almost 2 years here Amazon never went lower so you know if it was right here a lot of people say well do I wait for a pullback well the pullback never really came I mean it did come but it took about 2 years and 1 month for it to come back so look all this gains right here to be honest it was zero look from 2020 to 2022 like a 2-year period it's literally zero but the thing is if you're selling options then you're creating income can you just imagine over 2 years selling covered calls if you were selling covered calls on Amazon with a 50k account or or more right you'd be pulling in like hundreds of dollars per week so in a given month maybe it's $400 to $500 and in a given year it would be like you know $6,000 $7,000 so over a 2-year period while you know this stock really went up and then back down to nothing you would have made pretty good money so for me that's why I'm a big fan of always doing covered calls I can't predict if Apple's going to go to let's say I don't know 200 per share 250 share I can't predict that but what I am better at predicting is that when I'm selling puts and I'm selling covered calls that they're going to create some income I'm going to see some income come in that's going to hit my cash account right away and I can spend that money on you know travel or whatever right I'm in Dubai right now so I am able to use this cash flow from options to me personally I have also been really reinvesting in my portfolio for a very long time I'm just not at that point anymore because you know right now I'm kind of living off of this income plus I have another portfolio which I am growing a bit more aggressively I'm doing more aggressive strategies and this portfolio now is my lifestyle portfolio so I encourage you to think about your money in a way of how can it work for you not you working for your money too many people are doing this you know full-time they're looking at the market they're getting crazy they're watching all these YouTube videos If you really keep it simple and you focus on covered calls you focus on selling puts do 30 Delta okay so for some of the technology companies you can go a little bit higher on Delta you can go 35 because yes they have a lot of volatility and going a bit higher on Delta will give you more money so let me show you an example let me go to well let's go to Tesla I have not done so well on Tesla and you may be thinking how am I managing my position I said in the beginning Let's Talk About Management so Tesla went down a lot and I'm down 133% of this position I have 700 shares 7% of my portfolio and I decided to sell 192 a half covered calls now you may be thinking to yourself Henry your average cost here is 215 and your you know your strike price here is 1925 aren't you going to lose money well yes in theory if the only metric that you're going to use and judge yourself by is your average cost which for me is 215 and then the strike price yes I am going to lose quote unquote money okay but the thing is the portfolio that I have right now in our life right now is in the present moment the past completely does not matter in the future although important to plan for also doesn't matter in this point in time was this a good decision I am asking you right now how do you decide what is a good or bad decision in the present moment well you do that by looking at the return potential today not about average cost not about where Tesla is going to head because nobody knows that you can watch countless videos and you're still not going to know that you're really not going to know where Tesla is going to go instead what I encourage you to do is first of all obviously dollar cost average this is one of the best strategies known to man it is literally better than waren buff and is better than anyone else's strategy it's a dollar cost average now for me was this a good decision well let's take a look at my history and see how much money I collected and more importantly it's not about how much money I collected it's how much I collected as a percentage return okay so if I expand this option right here you can see that I did this on January 25th okay it's been several days but the timing doesn't matter you can always watch this video in the future I open this up on the 25th this option expired February 2nd so this is roughly about a week or so basically a week okay so for 7 days I have sold an option that is worth $325 per share again the $2,000 doesn't matter that's cool yes that's how much I made but what's important is a 325 okay what is 325 okay per contract in relation to how much I put up for 100 shares so look I collected 325 and 100 shares is worth about $18,000 so really simple I'm going to take out a calculator and I'm going to do $325 divided by $188,000 roughly okay this is a 1.8% return 1.8% for 7 days that is literally so amazing 1.8% are you kidding me in 7 Days that's how you scale a big portfolio that's how you scale from 50k obviously adding a little bit of money along the way and getting this 50k to 250k 250k to 500 K 500k to a million and then all of a sudden your portfolio is generating you more money than you're spending it exceeds your income exceeds your expenses all of a sudden you're in your retirement Zone which is basically where I'm at despite living in Dubai despite spending 3040 and $50,000 a month I am still making more trading options and it's really simple and straightforward and it's because I'm using key fundamental rules of covered calls selling puts I'm sticking to my 30 Delta I am looking at technical analysis of course and I'm picking high quality companies and even stocks like Tesla it is not going well for me I have made two pretty much major mistakes this year so far and I am honestly not off to a good 2024 Financial start things are going well overall but financially n you know I've been making mistakes Tesla and Nvidia have cost me a decent amount of money specifically Tesla right now down $20,000 you know but I am confident that Tesla Tesla will eventually recover and yes I have given myself some breathing space because I'm only currently invested 7.81% so what I can do is I can dollar cost average I can buy another 100 shares in the next two weeks and then another two weeks I can buy another 100 shares okay yes I'm probably going to do that with some of my income but I'm also going to do it with some of the cash that I have available in my portfolio if you can add money to your portfolio that is the way to get rich guys it's not a secret I didn't scale $2,000 to2 million without adding any money I've added some money along the way the majority I have made with option trading but yes I've also added money and you have to do that okay you need to consistently add money to your portfolio because if you consistently add money to your portfolio then you can dollar cost average you can purchase stocks for cheaper or even if they are more expensive that is okay because the stock market goes up long term so you can definitely scale a portfolio from like 50k to a million do in a span of 5 to 10 years now that takes time als also I'm more than happy to help you of course I have the first link in description I've mentioned that I will personally take a call only from this video usually my team does take the calls but I want to encourage you guys if you have a decent amount of money I am happy to personally help you in 2024 because it is my mission and my purpose to help other people become financially free that's what I enjoy doing for me I'm picking high quality companies I'm making safe bets I'm not doing anything aggressive I am not growing my money super fast I am not I'm going after the the safe returns because going after really fast money is possible but it is only really necessary for folks that have a very tiny portfolio those guys are super desperate and I'm not saying it in a bad way I was also super desperate but the problem is when you're desperate in life you do not get good results whether it's your health whether it's your dating you're going to chase women away if you're going to be desperate and also with your money if you are desperately trying to get quick results you will make mistakes you will be overly aggressive and you will not have the best returns so my advice is focus on consistency focus on safety follow this YouTube channel obviously I'm always showing all my receipts I'm showing my wins and my losses and I'm honest I have not done so well so far this year but I'm very confident that the rest of my year is going to look fantastic because I'm always learning I'm always improving hope you are too happy to help you first link in the description see you guys in the next video",1.0,0.5

Invest with Henry,XoEgsztTKmg,2024-01-26T16:30:05Z,I TRIED BUYING OPTIONS,Apple,"Apple I have the put credit spread when I 2 and a half net I did a straddle so um this is a yellow play so honestly I was thinking about starting an option buying Discord because um it can be very successful but first of all I'm not going to promote anything or start anything until I really prove to myself that I can do it again because I did this back in 2020 and 2021 now it's 2024 so it's been some time it's not like I don't have the skill set but uh you know the market can be a little bit different maybe it's not an option buying market so of course I want to experiment with my own money before I start to promote something and start a group and say hey let's start buying options I want to First prove to myself that I can take this account to like 2 mil because you know it's kind of standing still granted I am withdrawing money if I go to the Past onee results um yeah they're not great they're not bad my return was much higher but uh as of the start of this year and because my last January was so good I went from like 28% to like 16% so like it's kind of going down in terms of results um um and yeah I guess I just want to prove to myself that I can make like 200 Grand here in the next two to three months cuz that would be 10% of my portfolio so 3 to 4% a month is good um it's especially good on a big sum of money so yeah that's kind of my goal so I started buying options and I did net straddle because well let me show you why all right so let me go to to net which is cloudflare it is a pretty volatile company and here here is the logic of why I did it if I go to chart um and let's go to 3 months so as you can see here it was having some pretty decent sized momentum going up so I thought either we're going to go up a lot more or we're going to go down um the RSI is right in the middle so I'm looking for like a breakout basically I'm looking for a breakout to the top or bottom it has pulled back a little bit however the this is where volatility is really important because the volatility is so high um in such a short amount of time time and that's why buying options is very very difficult I ended up so let's take a look I ended up doing this trade on the 22nd so it's been some time I spent $1,910 and I bought uh both puts and calls same 85 strike that's a long straddle position long like I bought to so the payoff looks like this the stock can go down I can make money the stock can go up I can make money um at 85 but I did spend quite a bit on it I spend 382 so I need to move a lot and I will be closing out this position early today unfortunately most likely for a loss unless the Market opens and it's like middle of the morning for you guys in us because I'm in Dubai and I'm like 9 hours ahead so it's my morning um so I'm looking for this stock to pull back that would be really nice and if it pulls back then I will cut this position for a gain right now I'm not really losing much money I'm at ative - 215 so um yeah I really hope I can strike the Iron Wall it's hot today maybe come out with a profit on this trade um we shall see um this is the performance of the straddle itself so it did go up a lot so as you guys can see uh well actually that's one day sorry so let's go to one week yeah so it did it did kind of come up a good amount but here's here's what Theta looks like Theta looks like this it goes down and down and down um and I'm looking for a big move and so far a big move hasn't happened so yeah down a little bit on that Nvidia I am bearish my bearishness never works on Nvidia uh this is a crazy bullish stock and so far I am wrong and I'm admitting I am wrong it's not working out so far so Nvidia is a fairly big loss but look I'm excited to talk about some losses I've had tons of gains in my life I've been successful far more than I've been unsuccessful and I'm happy to share my losses so it is what it is my portfolio is still doing fine I'm not even close to losing that much money it's 1.84% to me that's actually really bad like this is some of my worst performance is seeing like even a small like loss is bad performance because I'm an income Trader that's looking for like this type of growth I don't have huge growth it's more like step by step by step by step right I love the way of living step by step I never like plan my future too far ahead and what's going to happen happen I'm just step by step how much income can I make this month and spend that income well I'm reinvesting it cuz I make money from coaching so I don't need to spend too much of my portfolio income but I do withdraw some money from my income just to pay my team um to give to charity to yeah other other things like that spend spend spend it basically on things that make me happier better that I deem necessary whatever so I have Shopify puts I just think Shopify is fairly expensive like if I go to shop and s o uh sh o um Shopify so I'm looking for a pullback it looks promising that we could get a pullback um I looked at the RSI it was pretty high so if I go to the Chart right here yeah I'm just looking for a pullback if I go to 5 days uh yeah just looking for it to retrace down below 80 and that could actually happen cuz it's 8028 um so the put that I have is the 81 put but again with buying options you need the stock to move quite a lot in a short amount of time so even though I am right so far I'm not really making that much money on shop or net and on Nvidia I'm just not right I'm just going to stop trading Nvidia I'm just not right at all uh I have another Nvidia uh Poor Man's put not going well but it's okay I have time on this one I have time and when Nvidia pulls back it will pull back hard I promise you it will pull back by 2030 $40 eventually uh let's see so I have Netflix let me change this just to back to Total return so I have Netflix which is also um down I believe they have earnings so we will see on that Tesla debit spreads I'm bullish on Tesla actually bullish I've been cautious on Tesla for a long time and look a lot of people had a lot of their money in Tesla and they're losing money I've been waiting so I've been avoiding those losses so that's my win not losing is a win so if you're smart you'll understand that not losing can be winning so I have been not losing on Tesla and I finally started to uh buy it up so I do have a couple hundred shares in my other portfolio and actually in this portfolio I also believe that I have roughly 700 700 shares um yeah 700 shares 99.99% of my portfolio so it's actually a good size 10% of my portfolio I'm down so far on Tesla it's at 195 so yeah it's not been too fun being a Tesla investor um I do think it'll come back up um we'll see though we'll see I think the price that I'm getting for it right now is a is a good price Robin Hood is so annoying recently because every time I do Total return it just changes back so that can be frustrating all right so I probably had to cut this video cuz my throat needs some water and I'm coughing um so I do quite a bit of coaching in my like Discord Community I'm doing private videos for those members and yeah my throat just kind of gives out sometimes so uh next one will be Netflix um Nvidia we already kind of talked about Apple is one of my favorite positions so I'm making quite a lot on Apple 14k and 10K but anyways for my buying strategies yeah I already showed you all them I also have a buying strategy on Starbucks Starbucks is one of my favorite strategies um making sure my mic is still going to be working and just relaxing you know relaxing making money living life and teaching that's what I love to do I love to teach love to coach and um so yeah Starbucks Poor Man's covered call have the 315 the the 920 guys look I think the poor man's cover call is a great strategy overall because you're getting a lot of good leverage on your portfolio without having to put up that much capital and personally I think that if you pick a good stock Starbucks Walmart Walmart is one of my favorite stocks this is literally one of my top plays at the moment is Walmart um 160 right now I have it at 15591 and I think doing a covered call is just amazing I actually rolled my covered call from 160 to 165 so yeah if you want to watch a video on rolling I will leave it for you right now cuz my throat is killing me so I'm going to you know cut the video we will uh drop it off here and I'll see you guys in the next video thanks so much for watching and if you want to like And subscribe go ahead do it",1.0,0.8

215 so um yeah I really hope I can strike the Iron Wall it's hot today maybe come out with a profit on this trade um we shall see um this is the performance of the straddle itself so it did go up a lot so as you guys can see uh well actually that's one day sorry so let's go to one week yeah so it did it did kind of come up a good amount but here's here's what Theta looks like Theta looks like this it goes down and down and down um and I'm looking for a big move and so far a big move hasn't happened so yeah down a little bit on that Nvidia I am bearish my bearishness never works on Nvidia uh this is a crazy bullish stock and so far I am wrong and I'm admitting I am wrong it's not working out so far so Nvidia is a fairly big loss but look I'm excited to talk about some losses I've had tons of gains in my life I've been successful far more than I've been unsuccessful and I'm happy to share my losses so it is what it is my portfolio is still doing fine I'm not even close to losing that much money it's 1.84% to me that's actually really bad like this is some of my worst performance is seeing like even a small like loss is bad performance because I'm an income Trader that's looking for like this type of growth I don't have huge growth it's more like step by step by step by step right I love the way of living step by step I never like plan my future too far ahead and what's going to happen happen I'm just step by step how much income can I make this month and spend that income well I'm reinvesting it cuz I make money from coaching so I don't need to spend too much of my portfolio income but I do withdraw some money from my income just to pay my team um to give to charity to yeah other other things like that spend spend spend it basically on things that make me happier better that I deem necessary whatever so I have Shopify puts I just think Shopify is fairly expensive like if I go to shop and s o uh sh o um Shopify so I'm looking for a pullback it looks promising that we could get a pullback um I looked at the RSI it was pretty high so if I go to the Chart right here yeah I'm just looking for a pullback if I go to 5 days uh yeah just looking for it to retrace down below 80 and that could actually happen cuz it's 8028 um so the put that I have is the 81 put but again with buying options you need the stock to move quite a lot in a short amount of time so even though I am right so far I'm not really making that much money on shop or net and on Nvidia I'm just not right I'm just going to stop trading Nvidia I'm just not right at all",1.0,-0.3

Invest with Henry,9zgdgqbMLUg,2024-01-22T20:11:45Z,Urgent: BEARISH Poor Man's Put,Nvidia,"what's going on guys let's jump right into the chase I'm going to cut right to the action and I'm going to look at Nvidia stock I'm going to show you a new trade that I placed called the poor man's put not actually sure if this strategy exists or not but this is a strategy that just opened up on Nvidia and specifically it is a bearish play it's actually really interesting so I want to go over why I open the strategy up and my thoughts around this strategy so as you can see right here I have Nvidia two option trade so I'm going to click into this right now and I'm going to explain to you my logic my thought process you don't have to do this on Nvidia if you don't have the same view as me but why I think this strategy in general does belong in your portfolio. What I personally did on Nvidia is NVIDIA is going higher and higher it's reaching astronomically higher levels I know there's a lot of positive news out there but I am not a buyer of Nvidia I think it's one of the most overvalued stocks agree with me or disagree with me here's what I did with Nvidia. I actually purchased a $600 put this is an in the- money put okay that means I think that Nvidia is going to go down however I don't necessarily think that Nvidia is going to go below 510 in the short term this is a fairly big trade and so far I'm down $1,250 so far it's not planning out but again I don't really care about one or two days returns I'm very emotionally stable when it comes to Trading. this position right here on Nvidia my goal is that around February 16 which gives me roughly 3 weeks I'll probably make about $2,000 on this trade because Nvidia will not go to 510 right so this option will be worthless the time dek on this option will kick in very very soon here as it approaches 216 it's already not that far from expiration and I'm going to end up making two grand there but on an Nvidia put I actually needed to come down okay so Nvidia might go up and I may lose money in the short term but what I expect to happen is NVIDIA to retrace back to the mean specifically if I open up yaho Finance right now I want to show you the technical analysis on Nvidia. for me it makes a lot of sense to make this shorter term play on Nvidia. as you can see Nvidia has ran up a lot and we also know that's because of like Nancy Pelosi there's a lot of manipulation in the market. at a certain point Nvidia does become overvalued and I just can't imagine this stock being fairly priced from $475 all the way up to roughly $600 you can see see here that the RSI is over 81 so this is a hot stock it's overheating yes the momentum is high and yes I have lost a little bit of money doing H crit spreads this stock basically blew past the bowling band the bowling her band has now expanded because of the you know really high insane volatility and it's currently above the bowling your band now this stock could continue breaking rules and running up because obviously a lot of this movement is event driven and when events happen yeah you really can't stop them however you know this stock basically going up from 475 to 600 is like almost a 40ish per return or so if I'm doing the math in my head so what I think is going to happen is this stock could go up a little bit more in the short term but the next 3 to 4 weeks I'm looking for this stock to retrace back even to $560 $570 I would actually make money on this position. I want Nvidia to go down now I don't need it to go down like tremendously but I do want it to retrace back to again I would like to see it at 560 570 if I could see 550 I would definitely like absolutely like snapin my fingers cut the position and take home a lot of profit. if this stock goes down by $30 I will make about $15 so $15 time 10 contracts is going to be about you know 15 * 10 is 150 * 100 shares that's $155,000 so my goal here is to make $115,000 in 3 weeks on $70,000 which is roughly a 25% return so I'm looking for a 25% return in 3 3 weeks which is obviously a very high return this is the poor man's put strategy so it's basically just buying a put option and then rather than just buying a put option I'm subsidizing my cost making it a little bit cheaper that's the whole point of a poor man strategy is you're making it cheaper on yourself to actually play the position so in this scenario it's not that much cheaper but still it's $2,000 which I consider to be free money now if I was going to explain to you one reason why you should have this type of position in your portfolio now I'm not saying Nvidia necessarily because you know I'm not I don't know what's going to happen in the future I can't predict the market so obviously you want to learn how to fish for yourself why I recommend to have this type of strategy in your portfolio is for a number of reasons.",0.9,-0.8

Invest with Henry,9zgdgqbMLUg,2024-01-22T20:11:45Z,Urgent: BEARISH Poor Man's Put,Starbucks,"but I also want to take a look at not just Nvidia but I also want to look at uh Starbucks because on Starbucks this is kind of a similar strategy I mean again this is actually a poor man's covered call so I mentioned that in the beginning of the video my first strategy is a poor man's put now this is a poor man's covered call so basically we're really doubling down on becoming a poor man and leveraging our money as much as possible in this video nothing wrong with that I have a good siiz portfolio but I still like the poor man strategy because you don't have have to put up as much money who doesn't like some leverage. Starbucks specifically I'm not up that much at the moment but I'm pretty happy with it I'm up $118 and what I did was I bought an 85 call so this had a Delta of I believe it was around 78 so is a pretty high Delta going out into September again I'm not going to hold this position until expiration I just don't want to right if you hold until expiration data will start to kick in and since this is a buying strategy I would prefer not to be long a whole lot of theta on a buying strategy instead what I did was something very similar I bought until September 20th and then I sold some Starbucks 95 calls for March so this will expire in less than two months as I'm making this video. I have 10 long calls this is about a $113,000 position because it's $13 * 10 that's $113,000 that I am long on Starbucks Poor Man's covered calls and this is not the first time that I'm doing this I did this before so if I go into my history here actually let me go into my history of Starbucks because I do want to show you how the poor man's covered call strategy works and how much you can actually make off of it so rather than me showing you what I'm doing I want to go even a step further and actually show you my history as well. looking at Starbucks here you know back in November actually let me take a look here I have a few different strategies so October I had 1,800 I think it was actually in early October had this two option strategy so this was a Buy 80 call then a sell 95 call so this was a poor man's covered call here so yeah I ended up spending 4380 let's see so I sold a 95120 and then uh I actually bought it back for $6 so I originally sold it for $52 and then I bought it back for two sorry so there's three contracts so made like 50 bucks per contract here which was pretty good and then I ended up selling another call option because Starbucks had basically gone up to a higher level so I no longer had to sell the 95 call so instead I sold the 98 call I collected $522 and and I had to actually buy it back for a bit more however I made I made a lot of money because I did buy this back for $1,300 more but then I ended up selling my long call option because the long call option has a higher Delta so it ended up benefiting a lot more so the long call ended up going up by about $3,400 so 3,400 minus 1300 is $2,100 so is higher than 50% but it was around the 50ish per return from October 2nd to November 8 8 so basically 5 weeks roughly 5 weeks 50% it was higher than 50% actually because I also made money on the on the one covered call right so it ended up expiring and I bought it back so let's just call it 50% 5 weeks that's 10% a week that's what honestly can happen with the poor man's covered call strategy. I waited for some time and recently I opened up this uh Starbucks Poor Man's covered call again.",0.9,0.7
Invest with Henry,r4gibOYRFvU,2024-01-19T19:30:02Z,50X to 100X Your Money WIth These Small Account Option Startegies,American Airlines,"I'm going to open up AAL and the reason why I want to open up American Airlines is because the strategies that I'm going to be using today well one of the assumptions is that the stocks are not going to tremendously shoot up or fall basically our assumption is that a stock is going to continue to go sideways in fact all three strategies that I have today is going to consider that a stock is going to go sideways because part of that reason is I think the market is high but I also don't see any Catalyst for it to fall any lower so I think the market will Trend sideways but anyways you can pick your own stocks this is just me showing you what I'm going to be doing and my thought process you don't have to copy this by no means of my financial adviser just go ahead and learn everything that you can and then apply this knowledge to your own stocks and your own watch list so taking a look at American Airlines it has had some volatility however what I've noticed is as soon as it jumps up it always tends to fall back down in fact if I go to six-month chart it pretty much hasn't gone anywhere in the past 6 months I mean sure it did start off around $25 but if you take a look right over here I'm going to scroll down right now around July 19th this stock is still trading where it's been on July 19th so for the past 4 months this stock has gone up down up down it's pretty much traded sideways gone up and then back down up and then back down and I kind of understand that this pattern is going to continue with the American Airlines I don't see any reason that it's going to fall too much lower I don't see any reason why it's going to jump back up in the next couple of days so for this week I'm going to show you a strategy that is basically going to turn about $70 into 430 I'm going to open up that position in Robin Hood but real quick as you guys can see every time it jumps back up it Trends down and then it'll go sideways for pretty much a week so this is about a week this is about a couple week period right here this is from the 16th and this is going back to the 16th so this is an entire month where American Airlines has traded sideways essentially that is a thesis for American Airlines that's where I'm going to be starting here I'm going to go to trade American Airlines options a options now you can pick any date that you really want I typically like to go for weekly options or bi-weekly options the reason why I like to go for weekly options is because not a whole lot of stuff can happen in a given week I mean unless there's an event like maybe earnings or there's a Fed meeting then there's usually not a whole lot of events that can turn an option upside down and if the option doesn't go in my favor I can always set a stoploss I can always close the position and it's much easier to monitor a position in a given week then have a option that is out for a month or 3 months that longer term time period is just harder to trade because it's easier to bet on a stock going sideways in a given week then for a stock to go sideways in a whole month or a whole 3month period so now I'm going to to look at the option chain and again as an option Trader my assumption here is that the stock will move sideways so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to sell a call option that is near the money so right now American Airlines is $953 I'm going to sell the 19.5 strike and that's basically at the money it's only 3 cents off so I'm going to click right here it's going to be worth $30 and I'm going to click sell this is going to be 30 bucks and now what I'm going to do this is very important I'm going to go buy a call option you guys will see I'm going to enter a custom order so this option strategy is going to be a custom order and you're going to see on the right side right over here the exact payoff the risk that I'm taking and the profit that I'm going after okay going for buy call option I'm going to buy a leg above and a leg below this is going to be important when you guys see this strategy actually play out getting started here 19 strike this is the leg below the 19 and 1 12 that we have open so I'm going to open up this call option right here this is going to be a buy now I'm also going to buy the 20 call option right here now if you notice the cost is $42 too but what I'm going to do is right here where you see this custom order there's a little drop down menu here and I'm going to go to custom rather than a 1: one ratio I actually don't want to open up 111 I'm actually going to go ahead and sell 29.5s going to the custom clicking right here going right here where it says 19.5 the option that I have sold I basically want two of these sell orders to account for this one and one buy order all right cool now that we have ented that I'm going to scroll down and you guys can see that this is is a very beautiful chart and I'm going to explain it right now the max loss right here is $12 however your max profit is $38 so as you guys can see in this example right here you can triple your money you can actually bet $12 that is your total Max loss you can't lose any more than that and the total Max profit is 38 now again the Assumption here is that American Airlines stays right around the center point where it's currently at right now so at this point right here in the middle is going to be a Max profit of 38 and you're only going to start to lose money if American Airlines goes past $19.88 or if it goes below this point right here which is $19.12 so as long as American Airlines stays within this range which again is considering that the stock is going to move sideways you're going to be able to collect that full $38 at this very Peak and you're going to collect different varying amounts right here but obviously but obviously it's still very easy to double your money even at this point right here or this point as long as you stay within this green area you're going to see a profit around this area you're going to see a double and at the very you're going to see a triple on your money now this is a strategy that is fantastic for growing a small portfolio on a stock that isn't going to move very much. all right guys so real quick what I want to show you is this other trade on American Airlines that I found that can turn $1 into a maximum profit of $49 so basically you can 49 extra money or basically 50 extra money going from $100 to $5,000 on this single trade right here and the reason why I want to show to was because I forget where I was looking at that trade from $700 to $4,300 I don't remember what I was looking at but I found a better opportunity that I want to share with you now what I did here was the very exact same trade except I went for December 3rd again I went for the same trade that I just showed you guys but I bought the 18 1/2 call I bought the 19 1/2 call and I sold 2 19 call options now the total cost for this trade is $1 you can get started with just $1 here on this trade and essentially as long as American Airlines stays within this range from $18.50 up to $19.48 or right around where it's at right now or right around the current price then you're going to make somewhere up to $49 depending on where the stock actually ends up trading and again the maximum amount you can lose here is $1 so there's very little risk here and a very huge reward on this trade. I like using the strategy on Blue Chip stocks that have predictable charts one of these stocks which is super cheap is AAL or American Airlines Let me show you a quick example so you can see this very cheap option trading strategy and action all right so the next stock that I want to talk about is American Airlines because this stock if you look at the chart it has been a pretty steady stock so over the past 3 months it's basically up 86% it has done absolutely nothing for 3 months if I look at the one year it has gone down about 21% however typically within a 3-month TI period this stock really doesn't do too much so if you take a look it's been $22 on June 22nd and now if I go to about November which is 5 to 6 months this stock is still at $22 so it didn't do anything for 5 months now again if we take a look from about late November it's been about $19 and currently it's sitting about $18 so this stock really doesn't have a whole lot of movement it seems that investors are trading American Airlines in a very tight narrow range so at any given one month or two-month period this stock doesn't really do too much which is a fantastic candidate for the same strategy that I was just showing you however there are a few key differences with American Airlines now the main key difference is that American Airlines is an 18 stock and not a $1,000 stock that is actually an advantage in some regards and also a disadvantage in other regards Let me go over an example so again I'm going to go for an option that's going to expire on May 6th because it's about 5 weeks away and I just mentioned a stock like American Airlines isn't having that much movement in a single month so the first thing that I'm going to do again is I'm going to sell a call option I like to go for at the money call options so right now I'm going to sell the $18 strike price it is just slightly in the money with a mer American Airlines trading at $188 now what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy I'm going to buy the $17 call option and now I'm also going to buy the $19 call option so now you'll notice again that I have a total cost that is pretty significant it's $145 which is kind of a lot for a very cheap stock so what I'm doing now is I'm going to go to contract ratios so whether you're doing this on Robin Hood or a different brokerage I do recommend Robin Hood they do give you some free stocks I'm going to put that in the description but it doesn't matter which brokerage that you use it really doesn't as as long as you're following what I'm doing step by step in your brokerage so click custom order or make a custom order where you're selling the equal amount of shares that you are buying or the equal amount of contracts so I'm going to sell two $18 contracts now the total cost is only $14 if I scroll down right here we can turn about $15 into $100 which is basically an $85 profit this is over A6 6X return this 6X return Can Happen by May 6 or by about 1 month from when you're watching this video and you open up a trade just like this however again I want to caution you that you're usually not going to see the full 6X because there's a few factors at play one of the factors is there's bid Ines spread costs that you have to account for and the second thing is that typically this stock is not going to end right at the very top right at $18 in this example you're typically going to have the stock end somewhere between in this range but also you're typically or you actually should close the position before expiration because as expiration approaches this option position becomes very volatile however as long as a stock stays within this range in a few days pass a couple weeks pass this maximum loss of $15 will start to go up because these options will start having a very high probability that they will end Somewhere In the Zone and because they're going to end somewhere in the zone you are going to start seeing a profit so you might turn $15 into $ 303 or $45 so you may get a 2 or 3x gain and at that point I would look into selling this position for a profit and getting rid of it early because with this type of strategy you really want to manage it you want to keep your eyes on the profits and if you see a 2 to 5x profit you really want to get out of the trade before it can go south on you.",1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,r4gibOYRFvU,2024-01-19T19:30:02Z,50X to 100X Your Money WIth These Small Account Option Startegies,Palantir Technologies,"Now the next stock I want to talk about is paler Technologies this is a stock that when you look at the chart it has been going sideways for a very long time and recently it has fall fallen down quite a bit now regardless of the reason why it has fallen down usually this stock will move up or down very similar to American Airlines which is why I pick this stock as a second strategy that I want to show you guys because once the stock goes up it'll come down it'll consolidate it goes up again goes down consolidate goes up goes down and consolidates so this is basically the perfect time where I see another strategy that an investor or an option Trader can play for a stock moving sideways really benefiting and cashing in on a stock not doing too much in the near future so so in a given week I can see Palante here continuing to move sideways because the pattern right here is moving up down sideways up down sideways and then again up down and now I expect the stock to go sideways because once investors come into a stock and then they crash the stock by taking a lot of profit at that point if there's no Catalyst there's no reason for the stock to move up or down again so usually it Trends sideways before there's another big Catalyst or some news event or earnings or some announcement that is going to move the stock so for this given week or even the next couple of weeks I expect the stock to moved sideways because from this period of July 13th to about August 13th it was basically a whole month where the stock just moved sideways I mean it's not a full month but it was about 28 or so days from this period of October 4th to about October 15th again a 2E period sure the stock moved up but it actually just moved up from $23 to $24 so that is basically a sideways move and now since the stock is around $214 going to come into my Robin Hood platform right here again I'm going to go trade pltr options now this strategy is going to be somewhat similar but I'm going to show you guys the slight difference and exactly how much money you can make here trading Palance your options in a given week using another sideways option strategy which requires almost no money I mean I'm going to show you guys how much money is going to require first of all I'm going to go sell a call option now this is going to be very similar because I'm going to sell an at the money call option selling this one right here the 21.5 and again I'm going to do the same thing that I did before and you guys will see the difference in just a second I'm going to go buy call option okay now I'm going to move for the leg lower right under 21 1/2 okay so this is the current leg that I have open 212 and now I'm going to buy the leg under the 21 okay so I'm going to click here bought this for $75 and now I'm actually going to go back to the 21.5 and buy the leg above it so the leg at the 22 strike price now I'm going to click buy right here and that is going to complete this straight however now I just have to adjust the custom order so again I'm going to click this little drop-down menu right here I'm going to go to custom order and now for the option that I sold I'm actually going to go right here and enter three so rather than going for two I'm going to enter three that makes this payoff a little bit wonky but what I'm going to do now is I'm actually going to sell two of the highest strike call option so rather than having one I'm going to click two right here and now you guys will see right here that as long as this option stays within the certain range that you're still going to have a massive benefit now here this is another strategy that considers the stock moving sideways however now if the stock has a tremendous rise then you are going to lose some money however again taking a look the max loss is $39 but the maximum profit is $61 so you can almost double your money in this trade and again the reason why I'm going for this type of trade on Palance here as we go back to the Chart right now this stock has had a tremendous pullback and now it continues to fall so we've had one big pullback where we had a major selloff we had a little bit of a bounce back however that bounce back was not sustained and now this stock is continuing to fall and then it had another small red day actually if I go to the one month chart instead here going to be easier to see this stock has now gone down on a one single trading day of basically 9 cents so I can see the stock continuing to fall down just a little bit but again have your own assumptions don't just copy what I'm telling you right now go pick a stock have your own assumptions and if your assumptions fit this description then go ahead and run this type of strategy where you expect the stock to potentially slightly pull back but basically you expect it to Trend sideways and stay within a certain range this strategy is going to be phenomenal now it doesn't have as much return as a strategy that we just had before however again turning $39 into $61 is going to be greater than a 50% return or right around that 50% return Mark in a single week so obviously someone can put up $3,900 and turn it into $6,100 if the stock were to end around $21.50.",1.0,0.6
Invest with Henry,r4gibOYRFvU,2024-01-19T19:30:02Z,50X to 100X Your Money WIth These Small Account Option Startegies,Neo,"all right so the third strategy and what I want to show you is going to involve neostock so if I pull up the Neo chart right now on my screen we know that Neo is a stock that I've been following for a very long time and this stock has frustrated investors however it has honestly not really frustrated me as someone who's just a stock investor hoping that Neo is going to Gooden Moon it has been a very difficult Journey however for option traders who are selling put options who are selling covered calls and who are just running different option strategies that I teach my students We have basically had a blast with the stock because even though it has gone nowhere except for basically up down up down up down that's actually a fantastic thing for option Traders because option Traders love volatility and also option Traders can take advantage of a stock not going anywhere and still make a ton of money whereas stockholders cannot really do that so now taking a look Neo is currently sitting right around the moving average that it has been at for the past 60 days yes the stock has been lower the stock has been higher however it's currently at the moving average and I expect the stock to continue moving sideways until we see some really good numbers or some good deliveries and that's not going to happen until early December we're not going to know how many deliveries Neo had in November until December hits so for for this week as an example or if you're watching this in the future if there's no Catalyst there's no earnings or there's no deliveries for an EV company then again you can run a strategy that benefits from a stock going nowhere or really going sideways so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to trade Neo options very similar to what I've been doing now I'm going to start off with selling put again I'm going to have the expiration date for November 26th pick your expiration date that you want to go for again I recommend going for weekly you can go for bi-weekly whatever date you're watching in the future pick the expiration date that works best for you now what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell a put option at the closest to the money but slightly under than the current share price so right now Neo is currently trading at $424 I'm going to sell the 40 strike now I'm going to cover this up by buying the next leg lower so I'm going to buy the 39 strike right now and there we go we have opened up a put credit spread however now what I'm going to do is I'm going to continue opening up two more legs now the only thing I did right here on the top is I'm going to sell a call option the call option that I'm going to sell is going to to be nearest to the money however a little bit out of the money so rather than going down to 40 selling the 40 and buying the 39 now I'm going to sell the 41 and I'm going to buy the 42 this is going to open up a short iron Condor position you can actually see here unlike the other two strategies where we had to spend just a little bit of money and we could have turned a small sum into you know 50% gain or a double or a triple on your money here you're actually going to collect a credit you're actually going to get paid if I scroll down on the chart right here again you can see right here that the stock has to trade with a a certain range so as long as Neo stays within $398 and $418 you are going to collect a profit in this area now your max loss is $18 and your max profit is $82 so in this scenario you can basically Forex or even a little bit more than Forex your money on this single trade as long as Neo stays around this top area right here so for me this is one of my favorite strategies this is what I teach a lot of my students because I love collecting a credit to begin with rather than paying money up front I'd rather collect some money coming in this strategy is a little bit more advanced however you can turn $180 into $820 if you enjoy strategies like this or if you want to follow my trades and see how I'm trading live every single week then you can join the private Discord Community it also does come with a course on learning exactly how to trade options so if you want to learn a real skill that makes money and get results then I'd recommend you submit an application to work with myself and my team and make sure to check out more of my option trading videos here's a student in my private Discord that took the play I'm going to show you shortly it made 200 100% on his money another student messaged me in a play he opened with $111,000 reward for less than $4,000 worth of risk so basically I'm going to be talking about how to 2x to 3x your money with a small portfolio fast if you can do this even a few times a year with your risky portion of your portfolio then it will drive your returns much higher but obviously we will also talk about managing these small option trading strategies so you don't lose your money and understand how to to enter and exit these trades closing these trades is very important it can be the difference between being profitable as an option Trader or losing some of your Capital because smaller strategies do tend to have greater risk you need to understand how to get in for the cheapest price possible manage the position and then close it with a profit on your hands you're really going to like what I have for you so make sure that you take notes each of these strategies will aggressively grow your portfolio more than the basic strategies but these strategies also require more time and work to manage the position that's because more volatile strategies

based on your goals so I'd love you to just check it out book a free call no obligation unless it's a perfect fit for your needs fair enough it's the first link in the description all right so people think you need millions of dollars or something to make a lot of money but I want to debunk that myth with the first small account strategy that you're going to see you can have insane results but I'll discuss what you need to get correct to get the maximum gain which can be anywhere from 2 to even 50x returns I just want to say though this position requires attention I understand people want easy and fast money but money isn't easy it's either very difficult in terms of time and managing like this first example I will show you when I jump into my screen or it's expensive because you get a shortcut like going to college mentorship or taking a course but I'll do my very best to walk you from A to Z in this following example here's an image of the first trade it's showing a profit of $1,493 but has no risk this isn't fully true because Robin Hood isn't accounting for the costs of filling this trade which I will discuss shortly the cost is really going to be a few hundred bucks but the gain is many times more the position is created with four options consisting of two call options and two put options these calls and puts are spread out over three different strike prices all with the same experation the goal is to profit from conditions where the price remains fairly stable and the option demonstrates declining implied and historical volatility let's jump into my screen and I will open this trade for you to see step by step all right now let's take a look at this Tesla Christmas tree now that I have opened up my account I'm up currently $261,000 on Tesla but I want to show you this small account strategy using Tesla now what we're going to do we're going to go to Tesla options so that's the first step now the first step to opening up this position is to sell a call option now I'm going to pick a date somewhere in the future if you're watching this in the future it doesn't really matter because this strategy is going to work the same whether you're watching this in 2022 2023 or Beyond okay so I'm going to pick an option that's about 1 month from expiration roughly 4 to 6 weeks is fine because when a stock consolidates it typically moves sideways for about 3 to 8 weeks somewhere in that range so 4 to 6 weeks is going to be a good time period for me to bet that Tesla isn't going to have a whole lot of movement again this is Tesla so it is harder to predict because Tesla is a really volatile stock but again you can choose this strategy on a stock that you think is consolidating you can use technical indicators like RSI moving average or one of my favorites is Ballinger bands so I'm going to click May 6 right now and for May 6 I'm going to sell the $1,100 call option so step number one sell a call option now this call option that I'm selling is going to be the peak of my Christmas tree it's going to be the very Peak and if Tesla stops right around $1,100 that is where I'm going to see the biggest gains on this position but again I don't have to have this opt option expire what I can actually do is as my option approaches expiration say it's the end of April or even the beginning of may now the beginning of May would be really close to this option's expiration but let's just say a couple weeks has passed and the stock is trading for around $1,100 that's when this option is going to see a lot of gains even though it's not even that close to expiration so step number one is you want to sell a call option and again this is going to be the peak of your Christmas tree now I'm going to buy a call option now I'm going to buy a call option at 10 80 that's because I think Tesla will stay above 1080 for the next couple of weeks and now what I can also do is I'm also going to protect this position by buying an 1120 now you will see how this is going to end up playing out when I go over here and create a custom order but first of all pick a sell we picked a sell now we're buying a call option under the strike price so 1080 and now I'm going to buy a call option over the strike price at 1120 so now I have completed this order the only thing that I need to do now is I need to go into this custom order section this is going to be really important because basically you need an equal amount of buys for each sell so you don't want a One to1 ratio you want to click custom right here and because we have one buy and a second buy but we only have one sell this is not a balanced trade and as you can see it's going to be costing you a lot of money well I can imagine that many people do not want to pay $8,000 to open up a position so instead if you end up selling two of these the actual cost of this position is going to go down to just $50 $2 so this is going to change by the minute however as you will notice about 33 to 50 bucks and our total profit is $2,000 so this is an extremely powerful strategy because you're only risking a little bit of money for a very very huge gain in fact right now as it currently sits it's $13 into $2,000 it's it's pretty insane but of course if you do go fill this I do want to say one of the issues is because you're dealing with four different options right now this is is going to be a little bit more expensive than $13 I would imagine this is going to be about a $50 to $100 spread and now as I'm talking here it has actually said that the max loss is zero but again I think this is going to be about $50 to $100 if you're going to open up this trade so it's going to be about a 200x opportunity so right now it's currently trading for about a 100 bucks so again 200x opportunity is what you can get with this position now let's talk about managing this position this is pretty much the most important thing so this position currently expires on May 6th the the way you want to play this is basically if Tesla continues to trade within this range you're going to continue to have profit because you're paying very little money so even if Tesla is going to be right here around $1,080 you're going to see a decent profit if Tesla goes beyond 1100 up to $1,110 you're still going to see a profit as long as Tesla stays within this range right here in the next few days the next few weeks you're going to see a lot of profit and this position is going to move to a few hundred worth of profit now you're not going to see a full 200 200x gain until you get closer into the May expiration at that point you can close this option for a potential $1,000 gain or higher if Tesla is still within this range especially if Tesla is hovering right around $1,100 in this example however all you really need to happen is for Tesla to stay within this range so the most important thing on running the strategy whether you're doing it on Tesla or any other stock is to have a stock stay range Mount now the way I would close this trade is I would set an expectation for hey I'm putting up $100 I want to leave this trade with $1,000 so that's probably what I would do however I would probably sell this stock at a $500 gain as well so if I see that the position is up5 or $600 then I have five to 6X my money at that point I typically like to sell and take a profit because the saying goes you never go broke taking a profit now for a lot of people it's really going to depend on how aggressive you are if your thesis continues to stay that I think this stock is going to trade within a certain range and it continues to stay right around the peak of this strategy then you can keep holding that position and keep gaining more money however if you feel there's a lot of volatility in the stock you have a big profit on your hands you're scared to lose that profit I would just say don't get greedy take a five or 6X return. so right here as you see as I'm even making this video Tesla is moving closer to $1,100 per share so if I actually open up that first position that I was showing you guys I would already have a gain on my hands of about 10% because the stock is moving up towards the price that I believe it's going to be around but what I want to show you specifically is say as an investor you actually believe that Tesla is going to go up to $1,200 per share or you have a very specific view on a certain stock well what you can do is you don't have to sell a call option right the money you can actually sell a call option for the exact exact price that you think the stock will end at so let's say that we believe that Tesla is going to end at $1,200 per share that is going to happen by May 6th or actually let's say that it's going to happen next earnings and let's say next earnings are sometime in June so let's say that June 17th will capture earnings so now what we're going to do is we're going to pick June 17th now we're going to again go to sell call option and say that you think the stock is going to end at $1,200 what you're going to do now is you're actually going to sell the $11,200 call option because that is going to be the top of your profit chart so selling the $1,200 I'm going to go a little faster I'm to buy the 1150 and now I'm going to sell two strike prices above as well the 1250 and again one important thing is I need to go right here into the contract ratio click custom and I'm going to sell two call options to match each of the call options that I'm buying this strategy now costs $295 however it can bring in a total of $5,000 worth of profit or about $4,700 after you account for the money that you're paying so now the top of this strategy is actually going to end when Tesla is $1,200 per share so if your Target price is $1,200 you don't have to bet at the current level you can actually set up the strategy for anywhere that you wish and the way that you control this is by picking the strike price and selling the strike price that you believe the stock will end that on expiration or sometime in the near future so basically right here I to 1 12200 again over the next few weeks if Tesla goes up towards this price and it goes up right here that's actually going to be a very big profit it currently says $1,000 but if this happens in a short amount of time then this position can be up actually $2 or $3,000 and you don't even have to get into June 17th or wait for the option to expire you can always close this option for a profit as long as a stock is moving in the direction of the peak of your strategy strike price remember these are riskier trades you need to close before expiration when you see some profits don't get greedy on these trades because profit is profit if you need help or want

Invest with Henry,3jxZiSp8cPE,2024-01-18T19:43:41Z,NEW strategy for PLTR - Wheel Strategy + Selling Puts | Option Trading Guide,Palantir,what's going on guys in this video I want to talk about paler and the wheel strategy and specifically how I'm playing paler with the wheel strategy in a specific twist so I actually have acquired a decent amount of Palance here and I'm running a very interesting similar strategy to the wheel which is essentially the wheel but also selling puts while running the wheel strategy. for paler I have 500 shares but I'm also running the wheel strategy and I'm selling puts on top of that so this is very interesting and I want to look at the technical analysis chart of palen here. now palen here has actually had a big retracement back down to the $16 level and this stock was over $20 per share in mid to late November but since November 20th this stock has come down has actually come down below $20 it has had spikes of buying so you can see here how the volume here is very green so a lot of investors have been buying the stock you know and further on selling it so this stock has been bouncing up and down that's actually a good thing for option Traders because when stocks bounce up and down option Traders are actually celebrating because that means there's enough volatility enough premium so if you get the direction even sort of right you can make money specifically what I'm looking at right now and why I like paler so much is there seems to be a double bottom pattern and paler has actually gone below the bowling or band so the Binger band right here signifies basically where a stock should trade between it's just trying to say the stock is going to be between this yellow lines however paler has dipped below which is very strange and as you can see it has jumped back up so what I think is going to happen with paler stock is it's probably going to go sideways and that's actually a fantastic strategy for using iron Condors or my special way of running the wheel strategy so what I have personally done is I have sold some put options for 152 and I think that the stock will not go to 152 specifically because the Binger band right here is $576 so I'm holding very strong the 15 1 12 strike price and I have 15 contracts here when the Market opens up I'm actually going to be doubling my position now I'm also running covered calls so currently paler is at 1678 and I'm going to be running some covered calls. I don't think it's going to jump up in the short term specifically because the RSI is 41 and also because the Binger band is actually tightening I do know that they have earnings coming up so that's going to be an interesting time and I may shift my opinion but at the time being right now I think doing covered calls and running the wheel strategy just makes the most sense on paler and besides even if it does go up to $17 per share which is my current strike price I'll be kind of happy to sell it because I have been selling a lot of put options and I've been profiting on them but of course I don't want to lose the stock so what I'm going to be doing is actually instead of doubling my position on 15 1 12 I'm probably going to sell about a 16 or 16 1 12 put option so I'm going to show you what that looks like I'm going to to sell put option and I'm going to look at an expiration day that's in the near future so let's just say 15 days cuz that's 2 weeks you know sometimes depending on my emotions and feelings I will go about a month to 6 weeks out or 2 weeks out and this is a really big de debate amongst a lot of members people always ask me is it better to go one week out is it better to go one month out and I specifically mentioned feelings because it actually is a feeling it doesn't really matter if you go one week four weeks 6 weeks you're actually getting compensated directly in proportion for how much time is until expiration so the truth of the matter is it only depends on you how much time do you have do you want to look at your positions every week or would you rather have less trades and look at it on a monthly basis for me sometimes it's 2 weeks sometimes it's up to 6 weeks and on rare occasions I am actually Trading for 3 months ahead now check this out 15 days I'm going to go ahead and sell a 16 1 12 put option now I would execute this if the market was open and what I'm actually going to do is I'm actually going to enter in 10 contracts so the risk to reward ratio here doesn't look that favorable however you have to realize one thing that I currently have 500 shares and they are close if not going to be sold off at the $17 level I don't think the stock is going to go past 17 too much but it may go to 17 1725 and in that case I will lose my shares and that's why I'm willing to go a little bit riskier and sell some put options that have a higher Delta like right here if you look at the Delta it's 0.53 which is actually quite High it means there's over a 50% chance of Palance here being executed at 165 and you can see that probably because you know currently the stock is 1639 and after hours it's 1676 so that's why the Delta is actually higher than 0.5 although this is an out ofth money option so in theory the Delta here should be lower but the rough estimate is that this is going to be a 50/50 play but the good news is when you're running the wheel strategy it doesn't really matter because if you get ass signed you're actually lowering your average cost so I do not mind selling calls and puts almost in really large quantities even if it ends up being 5% of my portfolio or so that's not a big deal currently it's A7 position now obviously I do have two portfolios I have more pounds here in my other portfolio but still my total P here position right now is not that high and I'm actually thinking about increasing my position dramatically because again I want to be positioned for upside growth and the stock has come down but I'm finally feeling that you know now could be the time specifically because you know the CTO has had really good things to say about paler I think their overall management is AAA Plus talent I really think that they're going to be executing on Pal's vision and Innovation and just looking at their earning statements I think that they're going to report some good earnings so you know for me I think the stock will go up but again I don't think that's going to happen in the short term I think it's going to happen in the long term as more analysts are going to jump on the bandwagon for being Bush on this company as well as more investors just understanding the power of AI and an innovation that paler is bringing to the market specifically with their large contracts with the government. in addition to paler I think there's a few different AI stocks that are really interesting place for me.,1.0,0.8

I see that they're bearish on Google and Amazon for me I'm actually bullish on Google and Amazon and I'm also bullish on Walmart however I have noticed that these are out ofth money options so that also makes sense if I take a look at Google for example I want to show you the technical analysis on Google as well as my plans for Google I'm personally bullish on YouTube which is where we're watching this video right now but you can't invest in YouTube without investing in Google which is why I think Google stock is a good stock to to invest in now look at this stock it's at 144. Google may go up longterm but in the short term it does look a little bit bearish now that may be for a few reasons and specifically there is a little bit of a double top pattern here forming but what I think can happen let me just show you in the trade Google options is you can have an interesting view by profiting in the shortterm by selling a call Credit spread but going longterm with a leap option okay so this is going to be a combination this is going to be a really interesting strategy right here so I'm going to go to February 16 and I'm going to go to sell call option now me personally I would go a little bit higher than the 146 147 so I'm going to go up to 150 just a nice round number okay a lot of investors have really high volume on these nice round numbers so for example the 150 has 9008 volume but if I go to like more of a weird maybe number like 175 well the volume is still really high but if there were let's actually change from February 16 let me show you a uh different expiration date because February 16 is the traditional expiration there's going to be a lot of volume if I go to something like February 9 you can see here how there's a lot more strike prices so if I go to 147 you can see how the volume is just 12 I mean not that many people are actually trading it versus uh 150 the volume is 484 so you can see how many investors do like nice round numbers so I'm going to go ahead and sell the 150 and then I'm going to buy the 1522 so you can see right here that this is a call Credit spread but now what I also want to do is you can create a different position by buying a call option except again my short-term view is Google may not go up that much but my long-term view is that I'm bullish on Google longterm so let's go to something like May 17 for example you can see here I can actually buy a pretty aggressive option let's say 145 now the Delta here is .53 so I'm going to go ahead and buy this and now you can see that the chart is basically looking like this it is a very bullish position however you receive a lot of growth fairly quickly and then you have a slight stall this is specifically interesting because you're only putting up about $220 which is you know not bad at all here you can see you start benefiting really quickly on any upside and then you have a little bit of a slow down so if Google just goes up a bit you will realize a really quick profit you have a little bit of a Slowdown and if Google really takes off by this may expiration then you will get a really big reward and by the way this right here the 220 loss I just thought about it is not correct the reason why it's not correct is because we're actually spending $935 and we're only collecting a small amount on the call Credit spread so actually our total cost is going to be 9006 just seems like there is a glitch on Robin Hood and another thing you can do is you can actually change the contract ratios from normal to custom and for custom for example you can create a larger call Credit spread position so let's just go to five on this call and then we're going to do another five on this call now you will notice that we have a really interesting payoff chart so basically if Google goes up a little bit in the short term you can start realizing a pretty hefty you know more than double on your money well actually this is$ 790 so almost a double on your money 644 versus what you're putting up and then if it ends up in this weird area yes you'll experience a loss however this long-term call option on May uh 17 expiration just goes up so much that it will compensate for a lot of Google's upside so right here you're kind of playing with Calculus in a way but the biggest benefit of this strategy is you get a big upside and then if it ends up in this weird area yes you can experience a loss but then you still have unlimited upside potential here as Google goes up.,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,DLxpgd-9uaE,2024-01-15T15:00:11Z,Call Debit Spread | BEAR Call Spread Option Trading,Tesla,"so right here on Tesla 262 is roughly the resistance if we just take a look at the chart and nothing else all right so let's just go with 262 obviously you want to do a little bit more technical analysis than that I just want to show you how these strategies actually work so if I go to sell call this is how you would open up a call Credit spread now Tesla's currently at 219 so I'm going to go out into the future because obviously 262 is quite a while away so you want to give this option enough time what happens is if you don't give it enough time for example let's go for a really short expiration day if I go to 262 it's not really worth anything in fact even the 247 strike the 245 it's really worth nothing and that's because obviously option Traders understand that this stock cannot go that high in such a short amount of time so instead what you want to do is you want to give this option enough time for expiration so let's just say we go out 62 days now I'm going to go up you know up to 262 or thereabouts maybe we'll do 265 if I expand this option right here you will see that the Delta is8 that is a really good sign one of the most important things that you want to look for is Delta so if Delta is really high that means that there's a very high risk when you're selling options if Delta is low that means that the chances are pretty good that this option is going to expire out of the money that's what you want to happen when you're selling options you don't want the stock to go in the money instead what you want to happen is you want to collect income and you want nothing to happen you want the stock to either stand still or not go towards your strike price because again if it goes into the money then you'll be losing money you potentially have to manage that position by either closing it or rolling it higher now taking a look at this call Credit spread we open this up by going for 265 so we sell the 265 right here we collect $385 now what you can do is you can go buy a call option the reason why you want to do this is specifically if you sell a call option that opens you up to unlimited risk and you most likely can't do that to open up a proper spread you need to buy one option and sell another option now here this example we are selling the more expensive option and now we're going to buy the less expensive option this is going to create a spread and my optimal difference for a spread is about $5 that means you're risking $500 now sometimes my optimal spread Gap might be $300 or $1,000 there really isn't an optimal it just matters what the risk to reward ratio is and that's why risk to reward is the most important metric that I personally look out for so 265 I will go and sell that now I will go ahead and buy the 270 and you will see that I have just opened up a call Credit spread this is just one of the four strategies I'm going to teach you in this video so the call Credit spread right here you can collect $50 or you know roughly $60 and you risking $440 now why would you do that you are risking a lot of money okay and you're only collecting a portion or a small amount of money that's because the chances of this actually happening is fairly low we looked at the Delta it was about 189 which means there's less than a 20% chance of this actually going to the money but the return here is also about 20% so you might be thinking to yourself what is the point of option trading if I'm collecting about the same money as my risk is well the truth of the matter is you're going to want to do more technical analysis this is just how to set up the position if you want to learn technical analysis there is a video in my description that you should watch around technical analysis now to continue with the rest of the three strategies I'm going to also show you a call debit spread now before I wrap up this right here you will see that the only way you will start to lose money is if Tesla actually goes above 265 and then also even at 265 you won't necessarily lose money yet you'll actually lose money at 26560 because you've collected $60 so it's going to be 265 60 right there yep and that is your break even price anything above that you're going to start losing money so this is a bearish strategy but also you can see how the stock could literally go up it can go up to 230 it can go up to 240 it can go up to 250 you will still make money and that's what I really like about the call Credit spread is there's a lot of leeway room there's a lot of room for you to actually make this income and it enters your account right away and then you don't really have to do much managing in fact if the stock goes sideways down even a little bit up you are totally okay now something I'm going to be talking about on this channel a little bit more is going to be some buying strategies I think there is a place and time for buying strategies I'm going to show you a call debit spread so for example and we can actually get really interesting with this I'm going to show you maybe a different strategy in this video as well but let's just say that you think Tesla is going to rise you know let's just say based on the technicals you think that it's going to go up 10 20% what you can do is you can buy a call option that is right there near the money okay near the money it's at 219 you can buy the 220 so if you buy the 220 okay what you can do from there is you can now sell okay this is the Reversed you're buying a more expensive option and now you can sell a less expensive option obviously if you just buy the 220 right here you're going to have to spend about $1,700 but if you want to reduce that cost with spreads and this is why they're so powerful for growing a small portfolio it's literally probably the best strategy for growing a small portfolio next to iron Condors as well I'll put that video at the end of this after you finish watching this I'm going to show you iron Condors but go to sell call right now and if I sell let's say the 230 this is going to be a bull call spread or a call debit spread there's two different names for it both the same thing here you can see that this is actually a very interesting play because you can double your money the maximum loss here that you're putting up is only $445 so instead of putting $1,700 you're only putting up $445 which is just a small fraction this is a strategy that again I would use for small portfolios when I was working at Goldman Sachs and in the hedge fund World they were not necessarily using using this strategy as much because they're working with larger Capital but if you have a portfolio that's 1,000 3,000 5,000 even 10,000 or you know even a little bit more than that you're going to want to use smaller account strategies like the call debit spread because here you can get a lot of exposure you can get a really huge return but obviously manage your risk don't put too much money into one single trade you want to spread your risk around into 12 to 15 different positions if you're using buying strategies I would limit those to only maybe 30 or 40% of your portfolio at most so here you'll see that $445 is what I'm putting up and my potential gain here is $555 the break even here is you need Tesla to actually go up to 224 which is not that hard at all the stock can go you know past 230 that's actually where you realize your full profit so if it's at 232 235 260 1,000 it doesn't really matter as long as it hits 230 and it stays above 230 you will realize your full profit and it no longer benefits you for the stock to go up that's why this is a cool strategy cuz you have a defined Ed risk and a defined return so you know exactly what you're putting up you know exactly what you're going to get in return as opposed to just buying a call option yes you have unlimited upside but your break even is also much higher and you're putting up much more Capital up front in my opinion if I'm going to be using some buying strategies I would rather use spread buying strategies than just plain simple call options I'd rather do call debit spreads now let's talk about really expensive stocks and how you would play them using put options okay there's two different type of put spreads let's first talk about the put debit spread that's something that I have not really talked about my channel a whole lot this is actually a strategy that I don't personally really use but again there is a time and place for this and specifically if you look at a stock like Nvidia I'm going to be honest with you guys I'm personally losing money Nvidia this is the only position in my portfolio where I am down money I'm down $99,000 $9,900 so down quite a bit here and I'm just being authentic and transparent here that I'm not perfect I lose money too and not everything that I trade is always going to win so my opinion on Nvidia is it's expensive so yeah let's just talk about the put debit spread strategy so I think that I think the stock is going to go down but let's just go to put debit spread again this video is not about My Views this video is about how to actually use these strategies based on your views and how you do your own research so let's go to buy put option okay that's how you start off with a put debit spread and again let's just say in the short term let's just go to 27 days expiration date is kind of interesting because sometimes with a buying strategy you might want to go really shortterm say you're playing earnings you may want to go 3 4 5 7 days whatever you can also go medium-term I would not really recommend long-term buying spreads they can work but the market is not really going to go down long term over the long term the market goes up so I would not really use a put debit spread strategy like this for a longterm trade so let's just go to 27 days and I want to be pretty aggressive I'm actually going to show you two different variations of this put debit spread there's a couple of different ways you can do it so first of all we can actually go for an in the money put debit spread okay so this is actually going to have a higher Delta than 50 yeah 60 cuz it's in the money so I'm going to go to buy put okay so I'm going to buy this now that would be pretty expensive $2,600 and now what you would do is you would just sell a put option because remember a spread is just a combination of two different options okay you're buying one you're selling the other if you are buying the more expensive one then obviously you are spending money it's going to be a debit if you're buying the less expensive one then you are obviously collecting a credit and you're collecting income so I prefer ing income but there's a time in place for a put deit spread as well so here on Nvidia let's say I'm very bearish I can actually go a little bit wider um with buying strategies you don't have to go five difference on the spread you can go even 20 so I can go 560 and then I can go down and let's say that I'm going to sell the uh 540 okay so here this reduces my cost so my maximum loss now is only about 1,000 and my maximum profit is 965 so potential return here of about 90% And this actually happens if Nvidia goes to 540 okay cuz again this strike price that I am selling if it goes lower then well I'm not really making any money because now this option is acting against me however because I'm doing two options again this is the definition of a spread and then also I am reducing The Upfront cost I have to pay for this position so here this would already be an in the money put debit spread and this uh position would benefit if the stock went down which for me I think Nvidia will go down but you know I've been wrong so far so I don't know I guess what will happen with Nvidia it's it's pretty difficult to um look at Tesla Nvidia these these couple stocks are very very hard to predict",1.0,0.1

Invest with Henry,BFM5couZWoE,2024-01-10T16:51:12Z,17X Your Money Fast Option Trading CHEAP Strategy (Just $50),American Airlines,the stock I'm going to be covering is American Airlines now I've showed this example before but this is truly one of the best stocks because the pattern on the chart is very predictable so American Airlines has been coming down a whole lot since the middle of 2023 and then in 2024 basically this stock is pulling back up very quickly however I will show you right now that there is a peak right here at 1450 59 and currently American Airlines is at 14458 so right now I think that the stock is going to be stalling out not to mention it's about to hit its bowling or ban all of this to say that we are hitting some resistance levels now let me show you a small account strategy on American Airlines where we can capitalize on the stock not going past $15 and using a very small amount of money now you can see that I do think that American Airlines can come up but at 15 I don't think it's going to rise too much more so this is how you can make really good money and specifically on this position right here you can turn $20 into $80 in just one month that's a Forex gain and even if you do this four months out of the 12 months of the year you're going to see more than a 17x return now it's really important to understand how to manage this position so let me go back to the Chart right here what can happen with American Airlines is several things let me go to the 3mon Chart just to zoom into the picture as you can see it is swinging up very quickly Now American Airlines actually bouncing off of this 1295 level and it's over 14 and half however at $15 you can see here how this orange line is the bowling band for me I use a bowling band that's 20 days and two standard deviations all that means is that this stock is unlikely to go up past this level and it's also further supported by this resistance right here at 1459 which it is trying to break at this very moment now the strategy that showed you can forx your money CU you're only putting in $20 and you can profit $80 but the important thing is you don't necessarily want to hold this position until expiration so you may not actually fully realize the 4X return instead what you may want to do is if American Airlines actually goes to 15 you will be rewarded in the short term and at that point I would look into closing this position,1.0,0.6
Invest with Henry,BFM5couZWoE,2024-01-10T16:51:12Z,17X Your Money Fast Option Trading CHEAP Strategy (Just $50),Tesla,"now the second strategy is even more interesting so I to show you how it works on Tesla again for me I go 1 to 6 weeks for expiration that's just what I found to be the best because Theta which is the time decay of options really kicks in and gives you that premium and when you collect that premium every single day it's decaying when you're selling options and that's why it's really important to go one to 6 weeks because that DK is that it's very fastest now check this out this strategy is also very similar it will actually profit if Tesla goes sideways now I want to show you the Tesla chart and why I believe it's going to go sideways if I if I scroll down right here you will see that Tesla has been about $274 back in June over the past 6 months and even more than 6 months this stock has really not went anywhere although it is currently below 262 the top of the bowling band is 262 and the bottom is 232 so the strategy that I'm actually implementing right now where I'm making $2,355 is going to be the iron Condor strategy and I've actually opened up two of these both of them I have showed in my Discord Community you can get all my trades by clicking the first link in the description but let me show you how I would set this up so I go to trade Tesla options now this is really important because I'm looking at selecting the right strike prices if you select the right strike price then you will get the most amount of money without having to risk too much of your Capital now this is one of the best small account trading strategies that can 17 extra money or even more than that in a single year like with most stocks you want to let your profits run although you do not want to get too greedy one of the biggest mistakes that investors make is they get too greedy and they hold the position up until expiration now most of the time I am holding until inspiration for my larger account strategies but for a strategy like this what you want to do is first of all you want to start off with sellp put now what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to go low that's because I want to be very out of the money the further you are away from the current stock price the safer it is now again I want to go to an expiration that is going to be bit a ways in terms of date now for this position specifically I'm also going to pick the February 16 expiration if you're watching this in the future you just want to pick something that's about 30 days out it can be 3 weeks out it can be 6 weeks out the most important thing is that you're actually just looking at the Binger band and you have a sense of intuition for where the stock is likely to go now for Tesla the most probable scenario is Tesla will just go sideways unless there's some very big Catalyst in the market like an earnings event or some type of big news this stock will likely keep going sideways because for the past 6 months it has really gone nowhere so I actually want to capitalize on this opportunity by opening up a four Leed option okay so here's how it's going to work I'm going to start off by selling a put option I'm I'm going to go down to something that has a very low Delta now the reason why I pick a low Delta is because a low Delta gives you a high probability of succeeding on this trade now check it out the bid is 168 here the ask is 171 and the Delta is just1 when I'm opening up a trade like this I want to look at a very low Delta so I'm going to open up this position right here I'm going to sell this option right now and this is actually a selling strategy the next strategy I'm going to cover very short in this video is going to be a much higher return this is actually a safer return and a lower risk trade and it can still really multiply your money however in the safest way so the volume here is 413 and the implied volatility is 51% so that's pretty good I'm going to open up the 195 and I'm going to also buy the 190 this is super safe because it's very out of the money and as you can see the return here is actually not that high now I'm actually pretty bearish on Tesla in the short term so I don't think it's going to rise much if any at all so I'm going to sell something that's much more aggressive here at a 38 Delta the implied volatility is 45 and there's actually a lot of open interest so I'm going to sell the 255 these are the calls okay I'm going to buy a 260 so now as you will see the returns here actually are going to be realized as long as Tesla stock stays between 195 and the higher end of things is going to be 256 so here the return is actually 194 where you're risking 300 this is actually a 66% return thereabouts and if you can do this every single month then that's obviously going to compound not as much as the first strategy or the third strategy but this is still an amazing strategy and I wouldn't even close this position unless Tesla really runs up which again is very unlikely given the chart unless it just shifts momentum and as you can see right here on the RSI it is not that likely that it's going to just shift and go back up and even if it did it would still probably be in the middle area right here at 247 however our calls the strike price here is actually 255 so we're more than good on that",1.0,0.5
Invest with Henry,BFM5couZWoE,2024-01-10T16:51:12Z,17X Your Money Fast Option Trading CHEAP Strategy (Just $50),Palantir,step by step I want to show you the third strategy which is going to be on palen here this is a really good stock because pal here specifically if we look at the chart right here has actually had a very big bullish run but now again it's also trending sideways so I'm actually going to show you a put strategy where you can put in very little and literally squeeze out multiple times what you put in and this is going to be pretty insane because I've seen my students do this from time to time obviously I would not dump all my money into a strategy like this but you can absolutely get a huge return that's 15 17 20 times on your money and in a very short amount of time the profits are literally insane on a position like this so let me show you how this is going to work I actually currently already have a position that I'm slightly down on but my options are making money so that's good my options typically make money even when the stock goes down now let me show you how this put strategy works and there's actually several put strategies I would run on palen here right now so in my opinion paler is not likely to go below this area of $13 per share and that is just because as you can see right here back in June of 2023 there was a very good support level and then another double support level back in August and then another double support back in September and literally now in 2024 I think that pal here is going to have a pretty good return and I don't think that it's going to fall below $13 in fact I think it's going to stay around the $16 mark it could go up I'm not sure but the strategy that I'm going to use right now is actually going to have a very big benefit even if paler just Trends sideways so I'm going to show you something like the March 15 which is about you know 2 months away again you can do this um one month away I'm just going to choose two months away just to show you how this strategy could work with a two-month option expiration so now I'm going to uh go ahead and sell a 15 put and actually let's just say we're a little bit bullish here and we think that pound here is slightly going to rise I'm actually going to sell the 16 put option and I'm going to go ahead and actually buy the 15 actually instead of buying the 15 the way to make this strategy even more profitable is if I go all the way down to say like 11 okay so I'm going to go ahead and buy the 11 put and then I'm going to buy the 18 now the reason why I'm going for 18 is because I do think that Palante here could slightly rise but even if it were to rise to 17 I'm just kind of being a little bit safer here by going for 18 and again we do need to create a custom order because if we don't create a custom order then this is just a very bearish strategy pretty much like a ladder lad put strategy here where you are making some initial money and then a lot more money as pounds here Falls lower but obviously that's not what we're trying to do this position if you want to properly set it up you want to have uh two sells here and um obviously two buys you're going to have one buy at the 11 put and then one buy at the 18 put as you can see here this is a very interesting strategy because even on the upside you're still basically covered and right here pal here stays pretty range bound you have a peak expected profit of $23 and and here you're putting up 297 so again you are getting a roughly 66% return but the beautiful thing here is if paler goes up which is my assumption you are actually going to profit now one more thing that you could do is I'm not sure if you can actually have four legs here but I can um include something like a $20 call yes this could work right here as you can see um something like this and actually I'm not even sure if I would go for 20 in the short term I would pick a different expiration date so let's just say I'm going to go a little bit longer let's just say 6 months s if I go for something like a $20 call option you will see here that we have a really big upside this is a really interesting pattern because your maximum profit here would be unlimited and honestly like if pal here were to go past like $25 per share you would start to experience a 2x on your money you know very very quickly and you can actually close out this position in say 30 days so if P here were to have a pretty big move you could exit out of it for around these areas of $20 per share but my main goal is say that one month has passed by and you basically have a profit of 124 right here that's a 20% you know return and you can honestly get that in even less than a month sometimes literally if pal here were to stand still for a couple of weeks since these two options or these three options are actually expiring in March you can actually experience a very short-term big gain then you can cut the position early there's no reason to actually hold on to a position you know longer than than needed especially for buying shot strategies like these since you are buying some of these options it can get really complex and that is why some of these strategies are more difficult to manage and why they are not my preferred number one strategy however this is one of the best strategies for really growing a small account super fast although again hard to manage now the profit that I'm typically going after on a buying strategy is going to be anywhere from 10 to 20% in under 30 days but honestly another strategy that I use and this is going to be a bonus strategy is going to be the pmcc strategy so I would do something like let's say I'm going to buy a call at $18 okay now this is really interesting cuz this is a different way of doing things typically when people buy leap options they go for in the money you can also do out of the money so I can buy an 18 and then in the shorter term I can sell options so let's say I go for slightly less like 3 months out and I go to actually sell a call and I sell something like let's say the 19 strike price right here you can see how you get a very big actual profit here where you are more than doubling your money so you're putting up $167 but you're making $180 so you can actually double your money here this can really happen in a shorter amount of time because although this option is expiring like quite a bit out and so is this one you're not going to realize the full profit but if Palance your stock goes in this direction these options will start to profit very quickly and say for example that you make $80 on 167 so you get a 50% return in 3 to 6 weeks what I would do is I would just cut that position because again I don't want to get greedy if I get a 50% return in you know 3 to 6 weeks roughly again it depends on a few factors like you definitely want to look at the technical analysis and for example if the stock goes up and the RSI goes from like 42 to 62 then I know that the stock is kind of overheating and if I made a good enough return in a short amount of time it's basically an emotional decision where I will decide to cut the position now I know a lot of people think that it's a logical decision but in fact you want to think about it in multiple different aspects now I also want to use technical indicators that I don't commonly discuss called the ichimoku cloud with you guys and I want to show you an example that I was 100% correct on on this exact stock where I made so much money in the past 5 months in a row actually using the ichimoku clouds so pay attention to this example if you really want to get this strategy correct I want to show you something really interesting and really new so with paler what I'm looking at right now is an indicator the ichimoku cloud and essentially uh paler has been ins This Cloud for some time now of course if you're watching this video in the future you can still apply the same principles of these three strategies that I'm going to show you today to the Future Okay so taking a look it's inside the cloud and for me what that means is it's likely to continue trading within a specific range so I've done a lot of research into paler obviously it is a good company Long Term but in the short term I do think it's going to stall out and specifically if I go to the indicator RSI we're also going to take a look that the RS I is somewhere in between 20 and 80 so you know I believe that paler is going to stall out for the short term now if a company like paler is going to stall out there's actually a phenomenal strategy where you can make tons of money and I mean 25x return so let's open up this position it's going to be a little bit complicated and I will warn you that this strategy is a bit harder to manage there's a whole lot to it however if you get it right obviously there is some really really huge rewards so what I'm going to first do is I'm going to go to to uh sell I'm going to sell a $15 call option now what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy a call option I'm going to go down lower okay so I'm going to go down into the 13 and2 strike right here and I'm also going to go up into the 16 strike right here now this is going to look a little bit weird because the position setup is not ready and basically what I'm doing right here is this 15 strike is actually the anchor it's the top of the Christmas if you will is the very peak of where you think this stock is going to trade and I picked 15 again because when I look at the technical analysis I really think that Palante here is going to stay within the cloud right now so if I go to custom order and I go to uh customize you want to make sure that you have an equal amount of sells for each Buy,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,78zkSCtUgu0,2023-12-26T15:00:04Z,How To Make Income Selling Covered Calls Properly,Neo,I like Neo right now specifically I've looked at the chart the chart looks absolutely delicious insane I mean this stock was over $50 per share and since then it has basically taken the staircase case and sometimes the elevator down I mean this stock went from 55 to 45 in just a matter of a couple of weeks and then since then the stock has really been struggling but you know it is a falling knife but at some point it is time to buy the stock and for me I want to be invested in China I want to be Diversified especially what's happening with the dollar a lot of countries may go away from the dollar and that's going to hurt our US dollar a lot so I do want to be invested in China and other currencies out there and specifically Neo is very interesting because I think one of the best EV stocks there's Tesla there's Neo but for me Neo it's a homegrown Chinese company China wants it to succeed China is on the back of Neo so for me I really like Neo and as you can see the moving average is continuously just going down and currently it's sitting at 14 and Neo is sitting at $927 per share now if I go to the three-month chart you'll see why I really want to do the covered call strategy on this because Neo goes up and down and it fluctuates but there is a very strong double bottom at 825 and what you have to remember about the covered call strategy is that it's a bullish strategy okay when you're doing a covered call you are buying a 100 shares and then you're selling a call option as I'll show you in an example but when you own these 100 shares you don't want them to pull back because if they pull back then you're going to end up losing money so this is a bullish strategy and you want to find a stock that has good support and for me Neo right now $825 is a bottom 826 and currently it's sitting at 833 so I feel very very comfortable that there is a strong support in place for Neo and if I run the cover call strategy at worst this stock will probably go sideways and I'm going to end up making money on the call options that I sell now if the stock bounces up let's say to the moving average of $9.33 or just $9 then I'm going to end up selling the stock and that's why it's really important to pick the right strike price because if I sell 8 and a half I might end up leaving money on the table like let's go into my portfolio and go to trade Neo options and let's take a look at the premium and let's talk about picking the right strike because this is very important if you don't pick the right strike then you are leaving money in the table and if you pick out a strike that's really far out of the money then you're just not collecting enough premium so you really want to find that sweet spot so let's go to expiration I'm going to go to an expiration day of May 19 for me I want to pick an expiration date that's between 1 to 6 weeks a lot of my students will ask me well why don't we just do weekly trading why do we have to do monthly sometimes and the truth of the matter is it actually doesn't really matter you can pick an expiration date that is 1 to 6 weeks because regardless there's a very fast time Decay All right so I'm going to look at the May 12th because the May 19 wasn't really populating since I am doing this before the Market opens now check this out you can sell the 8 and A2 covered call option and that's great right you can make $49 which is an insanely High return this is basically a 6% return cuz 6 * 8 is 48 so this is a 6% return in 19 days Less Than 3 weeks guys this is how you build up a portfolio you collect a lot of income passive income consistently and safely and that's how you grow a portfolio whether you have a small portfolio a medium portfolio or a larger portfolio sticking to the safe strategies like covered calls is basically what I do I sell puts covered calls and I run the wheel these are my top three favorite strategies now check it out if I sell the 8 and A2 call option that's fantastic I'm collecting a lot of money and if I look at at the Delta it is048 which is really high now that's not necessarily a bad thing but what is going to happen is if over the next 3 weeks Neo goes above $8.50 I will have to lose the stock at $850 so if it goes to $9 I won't be able to capture all of that movement on the upside I won't be able to capture the capital appreciation so my sweet spot here would probably be about $9 if you go to $95 and I expand this you'll see that the Delta is24 however I am not opposed based on the technicals as you can see here that it is probably not super likely that in the next 3 weeks Neo will explode that much higher past 9 and half but it's likely to reach about $9 per share and that's why rather than selling the $95 covered call I'd rather go for the $9 covered call because this is right in the middle and if I expand the Delta it's 34 this is a great Delta to do covered calls 34 is Right Between the area which I like of 0.25 to 04. so let's just take a look at Neo again for example it has a really strong support at 825 but for example let's say that this this goes down a lot and it breaks support and it ends up falling to be honest I don't even know where it would fall because it's already such a value stock but let's just say that it goes down to $7 well in that scenario what you're going to want to do is actually roll your strike lower I won't actually hold the position until expiration in that scenario.,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,78zkSCtUgu0,2023-12-26T15:00:04Z,How To Make Income Selling Covered Calls Properly,Tesla,"specifically Neo is very interesting because I think one of the best EV stocks there's Tesla there's Neo but for me Neo it's a homegrown Chinese company China wants it to succeed China is on the back of Neo so for me I really like Neo. I uh did the strategy quite a lot when um Tesla was going up in 2020 so I was leveraging my portfolio quite a bit so as you guys know if you watched um a lot of you know my videos you would know that um yeah I took like 100k to 700k with so I'm being like transparent honest that like uh I did go pretty heavy on one stock so it was definitely a risk and I wouldn't like really recommend that uh risk for everyone but if you will use the PO man's cover call strategy you could put a lot less money down. so something like Tesla is fairly expensive actually I just opened this position up today so that's so beautiful so check it out this is a poit spread I'm going to move on from this in just a moment but you can see 7 hours ago I opened up a poit spread for at $351 um in collected premium and out of that premium I've already made like 36% of it so $143 just today that's a just a $5,000 small account trade the only reason I really did this is because I have my coaching call and I want to make trades because that's what I do like when people join the community they get access to me and then they get all my trades and I'm just growing small accounts over and over so I'm taking like five to to to $7,000 I'm trying to scale it up to like10 to $15,000 and uh there you go $143 today but anyways I wanted to talk about the poor man's cover call so that's that's a p credit spread right I made some videos on this channel you can check out Poor Man's cover call is going to be buying a call option I can go out into the future so let's just say I'm going to go out 256 days uh into June 21st of 2024 so let's go into an in the money option so let's see if I go to uh 210 that's a high Delta Delta is 78 implied volatility is 54 so it's not little surprised there's some volume here so a lot of people are trading Tesla quite out into the future this right here as you can already just see okay so controlling 100 shares of Tesla is going to cost $25,800 okay and for example buying this call option is going to cost $766 so it is a lot less that you have to put up it's in fact about 1/4 roughly 1/4 right cuz it's a little bit more than 1/4 it's like 30% so 30% of 258 is going to be like 7,6 80 maybe 7 7680 or something like that so this is essentially about 30% so you're only putting up 30% % and you can still so for example this basically counts as stock right so it's a long leap option and now I can sell like 30 days out for example like November 10th I can sell a 30 days out covered call so let's just say I'm going to go ahead and sell the 280 okay so if I sell the 280 boom now I can start making $800 pretty good so I can start making $800 on uh 7600 so that's like a 10% return in 30 days so that's how you can get some really juicy returns like 10% Plus to be honest that's just a premium so if the stock actually Rises towards 280 again your 280 call is going to expire okay so it's going to be kind of you know gone on in in 30 days let's say the stock goes up to 275 this call option is going to gain a good amount of value so you're going to make 8005 Plus for example like this 210 uh call option so let me just show you actually you can see right here U basically it's going to look like this uh if it goes up to yeah like 275 you're going to have a profit of like $1,900 so you're going to make $800 off of the short call like fully in premium then you're going to make another ,100 and just the value of the 210 long call that you have so that's how you can just you know make 10% from the short call um that you sell so the short call here is a 280 and then from the long call option it can go up in value so it can um you know Rise by like $1,000 so essentially yeah like it says you can make a Max profit of 2180 um obviously that's like in the best case scenario like that's uh that's like amazing but even as it goes up you can see like even if it goes like up a lot you're still going to be up like $1,700 so this is a really good bullish strategy especially on stocks that you like long-term stocks you know just step by step every single month collecting income and then riding that leap option again it's not a full leap option because it's not expiring in one year but um you know leap options is something that's fairly long to me definition is like over a year I guess but for me even 9 months is is is good enough so po man's cover call is a fantastic strategy and you can watch more about Poor Man's cover calls right here.",1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,78zkSCtUgu0,2023-12-26T15:00:04Z,How To Make Income Selling Covered Calls Properly,Kraft Heinz,"now there is a big difference guys I sometimes do go point4 I only do that though specifically when I have a stock that has a really high dividend so I call this a double dividend strategy sometimes I will do covered calls on something like craft Hinds so craft Hinds for example let me show you what craft hind looks like I like to do higher Delta covered calls on Craft hindes and I'm starting to get into the strategy because I call it the double dividend strategy specifically if you take a look at craft Hinds the dividend right here is 4% which is really high this is almost double or about double the S&amp;P 500 and interesting from Pennsylvania I'm from Philadelphia originally so if I take a look at craft hindes the price to earnings ratio is pretty low it's 20 so this is a very good value stock okay it's not going for a very expensive valuation has a very High dividend yield and it does not have that much volatility so despite like it looks like it has a lot of volatility in the past 3 months it's only down about 2% so this stock is not a big mover in the past year is down 10% so that's fantastic for running a covered call and a double dividend strategy where you can basically buy a company that does not have a lot of volatility and it has a good dividend yield and then you can sell at the money covered calls now let's talk about at the money in the best practice here because it's very important for increasing your returns and managing your risk guys I talk about this a lot on my channel which is basically how do you manage a position and nobody really talks about this because they don't understand it they don't have a finance degree or actual experience a lot of people are just making videos based on what they read on Google or they're using chat GPT which obviously I don't really use I'm actually giving you real information if you appreciate that please drop a like on this video but I really want to focus a little bit on psychology and the benefits of strike selection because your strategy doesn't mean a lot especially when you're looking at your profits and your losses you can increase your returns a lot and you can decrease your risk and if you can just do that by a few percentage points you are making a really huge difference in your portfolio so check it out craft hindes I have an average price of $39 42 okay so I ended up buying 200 shares of this position and then you'll actually see that I've done something really really interesting I've actually sold two different covered calls now there's a really big difference here and we need to talk about it okay so the first covered call that I sold is very short-term in nature it's expiring in just 5 days okay so this option right here is a weekly option I ended up selling a thir 39.5 covered call so as you can see my average price is $394 I ended up selling an at the money covered call for $39.50 now why did I do this why did I not give myself more room for upside and the reason is because craft hind is not really moving that much okay there's a difference between Neo stock which has more volatility and then craft hindes which is a very stable stock Warren Buffett owns it so this company is not moving a lot and for that reason I want to do closer to the money covered calls and in fact if I I look at this the Delta it has changed slightly because I've had this position open after I opened up in Discord a couple days ago but this position right here has a very high Delta 37 in fact it was a lot higher before craft hind started falling down because it has gone down by about 2% in the past few days but I decided to sell an at the money covered call because I wanted to collect the most amount of Premium so the premium is the highest the closer to the money you go so as you can imagine if I were to pick an option that's very far away it's not going to have much premium but I don't mind going very close for craft Hinds because I don't expect it to have that much movement so I can basically Bank on two things number one the dividend and then number two the call option premium that I'm collecting now the next thing that I did because this is low management and pretty good return is I ended up selling a July 21st covered call now this is a few months out but what I decided to do was go out a little bit higher to $40 per share this is still not that much higher it will give me about 1 or 2% up side in capital appreciation from the stock itself but what I'm really banking on is again the dividend and I collected A110 in premium Now $110 in premium is actually a lot because this is $110 in premium that I've collected on just a $3,900 position so this is about a 3% return plus I'm collecting dividends plus this is very low volatility so this is a fantastic retirement strategy if you have a little bit more money you can absolutely do safe companies where you sell covered calls now it doesn't matter if you have a small account either because with a small account this still makes sense because I'm all about consistency growing your portfolio slow and steady getting rich slowly I'm not a fan of doing anything risky or buying strategies because those strategies are not consistent they end up losing money you end up being stressed and that is not the point of how you want to grow your wealth using options my psychology is I'm always after safe passive income and the covered call strategy is one of my favorite strategies because it's safe it's passive it's consistent and I can also do do the double dividend strategy which is basically picking low volatility companies and then using covered costs to generate income on them.

Invest with Henry,78zkSCtUgu0,2023-12-26T15:00:04Z,How To Make Income Selling Covered Calls Properly,Starbucks,"but um the poor man's covered call that we're going to talk about is going to be on Starbucks so I want to look at Starbucks um I've actually done quite well I don't typically open up PO man's cover calls just to be honest with you because I have a bit of a bigger portfolio and at this time like I'm basically just like coaching a lot of Trades I make is for the Discord Community because it's for for other people like I don't really care about making like $351 I mean it's nice I like money too but I want to be really efficient with my time so I don't really want to open up too many positions but if I had a smaller portfolio I think this is one of the best strategies that I would be using and to be honest with you I uh did the strategy quite a lot when um Tesla was going up in 2020 so I was leveraging my portfolio quite a bit so as you guys know if you watched um a lot of you know my videos you would know that um yeah I took like 100k to 700k with so I'm being like transparent honest that like uh I did go pretty heavy on one stock so it was definitely a risk and I wouldn't like really recommend that uh risk for everyone but if you will use the PO man's cover call strategy you could put a lot less money down so if you look at my um history here I put down like $4,380 I'm not the biggest buyer of options but when I do buy I want to be really really certain because I I hate being wrong whenever I like make trades and like I'm wrong then obviously you know like I have a couple thousand people that are following me so like it's really upsetting when they lose money so I try to be try to be very careful and that's why I prefer selling strategies I prefer like consistent passive income both for myself but also I mean I guess we're all kind of selfish but in a good way like I don't want people to have problems because then they're going to bother me or you know I just feel bad for their money right so that's why I chose to have like a consistent safe approach just because like it's the least amount of headache for them it's the least amount of headache for me I think it's uh just beneficial like this is the way I trade this is the way I decide to live my life I decided to make less money and not go for the craziest returns like I don't know like maybe my $2 million portfolio I just say 2 million I have like a couple portfolios actually so it's multiple they're both seven figures but I decided that um I was going to aim for a bit smaller like return but I wanted to be more consistent I can aim for 10% a month right and I can make $200,000 off one portfolio but that would require me to be an active Trader and to be honest like I don't really spend that much money so like what do I need $200,000 for I'm Trading my stress and my health for money and I'm just not interested in that I don't really care like my health and my mental health is much more important to me than than money so if I can just make like even like 2% on 2 million it's $40,000 like I'm going to take that I'll take $40,000 over $200,000 cuz for $4,000 I'm literally doing nothing I literally do nothing I just trade Monday and Wednesday for 45 minutes on camera for the Discord and if it wasn't for those guys I would trade for like 5 minutes like Monday and Wednesday okay maybe 10 minutes but it really wouldn't take me that much time I decided to do a buy strategy on like Starbucks so it's uh it's a two-order strategy here but it's really a poor man's covered call so the poor man's covered call essentially entails like I bought a Starbucks $80 call option so I'm long you know 80 it's going to expire essentially on uh April 19th 2024 so this is quite a bit out actually not really it's only 6 months out so this doesn't even count as a leap option I know all those keyboard Warriors like well there's not a leap option it's 6 months well that's true it's technically not a leap option cuz it's 6 months so just a call option but it functions kind of like the shares because instead of owning shares like I have a call option that's kind of functioning like that and then I ended up selling a Starbucks $95 um call option so that's kind of like a covered call but obviously like if I bought 100 shares and I did one covered call on Starbucks that would be 9,267 so that's like quite a bit right so like that's quite a bit versus like I'm controlling 300 shares like three times that and I'm also only put up like $4,300 I put the same cost as 50 shares but I'm controlling 300 so I have like a 6X leverage Factor so I have like 6X the exposure with you know only a few thousand um essentially I opened this up on October 2nd so that was like 7 days ago as I'm making this video but of course if you're watching this in the future all my videos are just educational right I don't really make news content cuz I yeah it makes more views and I can cover the latest news but I'm doing this for education I want to educate you guys I want to be a mentor and a coach that's what I find meaning and passion in so um I don't really care if I get less views I'm not chasing the YouTube hype as many YouTubers are okay so I think you know this Starbucks um Poor Man's covered call is a really good position even though I'm making this video like seven days later in seven days I made $351 so that's like $50 a day including the weekend yeah I'm up 8% so far so that's really good the stock didn't even have to go up that much so let's just see in 7 Days how much did Starbucks go up okay so it went up by 82 but I'm up like 8% so I get like a 10x return Factor if you'll say it like that basically it's like a 10x right so wherever the stock returned I made a really good premium I made a really good return good profit so I could just close out this position I won't though so I typically do like to um when I open up positions I like to do a lot of no what am I saying I don't like to do a lot of work I'm very lazy okay I become very lazy I don't really care about money I don't really care about I just want to get like myself and other people good results with putting in the least amount of work so I'm trying to get like the highest sharp ratio okay a sharp ratio is basically like get a high return for a really low amount of risk that's really good right so you're getting like 50% return and it's like just a straight line up that's like amazing some people get a 300 % return but like they went broke and they went bankrupt they lived on the streets and then they made it right like I don't want that I just want like slow and steady wins the race like I wanted to go up up up and then I can like withdraw if I need to cuz obviously like I travel a lot I'm still I'm my fourth year of travel so I'm in Eastern Europe it's a lot of my roots are from here um I speak Russian and actually speak some Spanish cuz I used to live in Columbia but essentially I want a slow and steady approach because that's kind of like the income that I'm withdrawing and I'm living on that I don't need that much to live on I mean like $8 to $10,000 is is enough per month CU you know I don't have a family yet uh so a position like this is is uh is really good and essentially what what I want to happen is uh if I click into this I want the short call to expire so I want the 95 call to expire and I want Starbucks to stay you know ideally below 95 but ideally what I want to happen is I want Starbucks to rise just a little bit okay so in the next looks like 11 days right cuz this is going to expire in 11 days again just think about the logic obviously you're going to watch this in the future so just think about the logic the options going to expire in a fair fairly short amount of time so it's going to make me $63 but there's three contracts as you can see right there so 63 * 3 is 189 so it's uh it's $189 and essentially that is what I'm going to collect in time Decay so that's like the options expiring in decaying so $189 is pretty good in like essentially like a week cuz there's all also going to be a weekend so you know that's like you know $25 or whatever per day and then this option right here this ad call could also increase in value so Starbucks goes up it's going to increase so I really like the poor man's covered call in fact I haven't done enough of these and this is something that I'm probably going to mix in more um again for for you guys and for my Discord Community because I think it's a very overpowered strategy I think you can do really well and $351 is really good on $4,380 in a week so you know just imagine if you had $43,000 that would be $3,500 this week I can bet you most of you guys are probably not making $3,500 per week even in your job because that's like $144,000 a month unless you live in California New York Miami Houston Chicago unless you're living in these cities and you have a good job you're probably not pulling that in and even if you are pulling that in you can be pulling in another really solid income by by trading options so for me P man's cover call is amazing and I would probably do this strategy on you know just your expensive stocks.",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,6HJjnHDRRx0,2023-12-19T15:00:04Z,BEST Options Trading GUIDE for BEGINNERS!,Chipotle,"let's just say that we want to invest invest in Adobe stock let's just say that we want to invest in Chipotle stock Chipotle is an expensive company and if you were to buy 100 shares that would be over $200,000 basically it's like buying a Lamborghini now I know most people don't just have $200,000 laying around heck I don't even think I have that laying around in cash so what you can do instead is you can invest in any company using a lot less money however you can also make some money even buying options so so here's what it would look like you would also buy a call option just like I just showed you however instead of just buying a call option and betting on it doing something in the short term you would buy a longer term call option this would be called a leap a long-dated option with a long-term expiration day a leap is just an option that's expiring in one year that's what textbook definition is for me it's just 6 months or greater so let's take a look at for example January 17 this is about 1 year away so that is good now what I would do is yes this can be a fairly expensive strategy but again I'm just using Chipotle to show you how expensive Chipotle is if you were to buy 100 shares versus just doing a poor man's covered call which granted this would still be really expensive I can show you another example but let's just go over Chipotle just to show you how big of a difference it really is so here you can just buy a call option so let's say I'm going to buy the 2100 that's going out one year already you can see that yes it's a lot of money it's $440,000 however you would have to put up $220,000 so this is literally 1/5th of the price now how a poor man's covered call works is you would sell a shorter term expiration so let's just say I'm going to sell January 19 or roughly 1 month out if you're watching this in the future the logic is the same this is a course that's meant to test time and however many views it has I expect this to continue getting views because I want it to be the best course so please if you will like this video I would be so so appreciative and if you subscribe I promise I will make you a consistent option Trader yeah so now what we can do is we can go to sell and for example I can sell something that's really close to the money so let's sell the 2300 now you will see that I'm actually able to make about $2,300 or $3,000 in in premium so I'm collecting $3,000 but I can make a lot more I can make more because this option can still increase in value but the long story short here is that you can actually collect income on a call option now I get this is a very expensive position so let's just go to something a lot cheaper so let's go to pay",1.0,0.6
Invest with Henry,6HJjnHDRRx0,2023-12-19T15:00:04Z,BEST Options Trading GUIDE for BEGINNERS!,PayPal,"I'm going to show you an example on PayPal by also opening up a poor man's covered call so again a poor man's covered call would start out with a leap option so I'm going to go out to let's just say July 19 which is 222 days out and I'm going to buy a 50 call so of course this is much more affordable it's only $1,300 and now you can still sell something shorter term so let's just say I sell something out into February which is basically this is a covered call a poor man's covered call is very similar to a covered call except you don't have have to own 100 shares that's what makes it so amazing it's such a cheap strategy so here you can see how I'm collecting $224 this position is great because now I'm only putting up about $883 in in premium I am collecting roughly $224 and sorry I'm not actually sure why this Max loss say 883 we're actually in fact putting up $1,146 and I know that because uh I've been doing this for 10 years so I can see that this is uh some type of mistake I'm not sure why Robin Hood got this incorrect but it is in fact incorrect because um when you're putting up 1370 and I'm collecting 224 this would be the difference that you have to put up so a little bit over $11,000 and on a little over $1,000 you're basically collecting $200 which is like a 20% return so I'm literally making a 20% return in a couple of months and I can actually make a lot more so if PayPal Rises you can see how the chart here shows that if PayPal Rises towards the 65 strike I can actually make $600 that's a 60% return in roughly 60 days or 1 1% per day absolutely insane but of course you do have to be right on Direction",1.0,0.7

Invest with Henry,P28_QyrfN7A,2023-12-09T16:58:19Z,"PLTR Wheel Strategy - Option Trading $5,000 Small Account",Palantir,I want to talk about paler and paler is a stock that I own I don't have a huge position right now but I am loading up on it in my other portfolio I have a few hundred shares and I'm actually running the wheel strategy so this is a strategy that I've been using for a very long time in fact I have three videos on this channel about the wheel strategy let me explain to you what the wheel is how I'm using it and how specifically I am training Palance here using the wheel strategy if paler goes below 15.5 I will have to buy it I get paid either way but the only difference is I may have to buy it if it's below 15.5 if it's not below then I don't have to buy and I can just keep selling puts first of all I did get assigned I was running the wheel on paler to begin with at $20 that's why my average cost is exactly 20 I didn't just buy the stock or set a limit order at 20 what happened was I sold some put options and I got assigned at 20 and now I am down 10% on the stock now that's totally fine I'm not all in on Palante here I'm fine to be down 10% I personally believe that it's going to recover and I'm running the wheel here but I want to get my average cost lower so I am continuing to run the wheel strategy and actually dollar cost average for me I like paler so I want to keep increasing my position on Palance here currently 500 shares and I ended up selling five more contract so I want to get 500 more shares at 15.5 at some point this stock is going to bounce back up now I'm not saying like it's really bad because it's not I'm only down 10% this is literally nothing and from here on in the next one or two years this stock could be a $30 stock could be $35 there's a lot that paler doing they have a lot of amazing contracts their revenue is increasing and overall they are really good AI I play and AI is very valuable you guys know that I don't like Nvidia but I do like paler I think paler is one of the best stocks in the market longterm shortterm nobody knows I'm going to go to trade P your options and if the market was open I would totally execute on this in fact I may do a limit sellp put just to have it open that way when the market does open up this will get executed for me right away the implied volatility is 55 which is fairly high this just means that the option is volatile it's volatile making its premium more juicy however here the premium is really not that high but at the same time it's because the expiration date is so low especially a stock like Palante here because the implied volatility is good as you can see here on January 19 this is a 3% return implied volatility is really good and the volume is really good now why is the volume important well you need liquidity you need liquidity when you're trading and here pal is a really good stock because the bid is 48 the ask is 49 there is a ton of liquidity I mean you can really trade this easily because there's not a huge wide Gap when there is a gap that's costing you money but here it's very good because it's very tight and the open interest is also very high so pal here honestly trades like an apple like this stock is so liquid which makes it very good for option trading,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,lVFnEAYaEhE,2023-12-06T20:01:34Z,LOADING UP! 🔥📈,Palantir,today I am loading up on paler you guys do not want to miss this because this is going to be literally a huge opportunity as we have seen in the market and actually there's some really big news so paler specifically fell basically 10% whereas the market did not really fall so this is an isolated event this is exactly what I like to look out for because when the stock market is going sideways and one specific stock gets crushed I want to figure out why is it getting crushed and is this a good opportunity and right now I believe this is is honestly a very good opportunity because pounds here being down about 9 or 10% so let's just take a look at some technical analysis and I'm going to tell you why they're down and why this is a reason that I'm currently buying the stock and I'm going to add to my current position American Airlines JetBlue and Palante here are actually my three top stocks specifically because as it bounces back and forth this makes it a really good opportunity for trading remember volatility is actually your friend so many people are afraid like oh my gosh the stock is going up and down it's actually a good thing when the stock pulls back that's an opportunity to actually get into the stock and one thing that I always look out for is can I dollar cost average because if I can dollar cost average into the stock and reduce my average price that is a very good thing so check it out palen here right now went from $20.27 all the way down to $18.30 that's a $2 drop doesn't seem like a lot but that's actually 10% So currently paler stock 1830 and specifically the reason why it's down is because analysts are raising a lot of concerns and questions over the Army contract renewal now of course paler makes a lot of money but it has to really land those contracts these contracts are worth 50 mil 100 Mil but if they're not being renewed then that's not going to make the company Revenue which obviously goes down to the bottom line profit which is what investors care about so paler had a strong run in 2023 obviously the stock did really really well but you know there's an analyst William Blair he's basically bearish he is a bear he is saying that it's going to underperform but I'm not really falling for it okay so there's a lot of analysts out there that are bearish and bullish that doesn't really mean anything to me I'm taking a look at this stock realistically I'm using logic okay and this company has a very positive future so in the short term it's not clear and I can't guarantee that the stock is going to you know keep their $458 million Army contract which is set to expire if they don't that is going to be a bummer and that is going to hurt the stock however this stock has a very positive future and I wrote a few specific points one of them being Innovation just taking a look at Innovation and AI you guys see that I'm not bullish on Nvidia but I am bullish on Palante here because it's a very different valuation I mean there's nowhere to go for NVIDIA since it's such a high market cap whereas paler this stock is not currently a very high market cap in fact if I go to summary right here you will see that the market cap is 40 billion but can this stock be a trillion I don't know but can it be 400 billion I think so it can 10x from here not saying it's going to be one year or two years but a 10x and 10 years come on now that's a lot that's a very huge return especially if you are playing the stock correctly right using a little bit of Leverage so just taking a look at this stock what I'm going to be doing is I'm actually going to be dollar cost averaging you guys can see that I currently have you know my average cost being 20 this is not a huge position for me but this is a great opportunity because I want to make my position bigger okay so I want to start investing in Palance here more getting my average cost lower because honestly I made a lot of money on paler but I also did Miss quite a bit of a bull run so I did end up missing from you know 1480 to 20 bucks but if take a look at the one-year chart I did actually scoop this up in in the $7 range but then I ended up selling it you know at at$ 1394 or so right so I had this huge runup but then you know I did kind of miss out on this you know quite a lot actually I missed out a lot but I can't be right on all them guys I really can't I can make some profits but I can't be perfect right I can't perfectly time the market absolutely nobody can some people can in the short term but no one's going to like longterm perfectly time the market it's just not going to happen so other points that I wrote here is that the stock lost billions of dollars in market cap that's literally billions with a be so it has become a lot cheaper to actually buy this company as a whole and then just the market in general again this is an isolated event so this is what you want to look out for if you want to become a better investor what you want to do is you want to catch stocks that are falling and yes some people call it a falling knife but listen that's where the opportunity is okay you do want to catch a falling knife at some point a falling knife doesn't mean that's going to hit the ground all the way this stock is not going to go bankrupt and many other companies are not going to go bankrupt I am loading up on the stock I'm going to double and maybe even triple my position soon as the Market opens but I am still keeping my position sizing appropriate you do not want to go more than 10% in any one position in your portfolio unless of course it's Apple stock or something like that I've been teaching and preaching dollar cost averaging this is the simple stuff that literally people keep forgetting but if you keep buying high quality companies that are innovating and they're going to rise then you're going to make money long term it's not about making money in one week or one month it's about making money at the end of the year how is your year how is your decade we are playing a long-term game here and taking a look at pounde stock if I look at the 5year chart okay this stock was over $35 per share back in 2021 now if this stock can go there again that's going to be basically a double on your money that could take 2 to three years fine I don't mind waiting 2 to three years if I'm beating inflation by literally multiples multiple times inflation because as you continue to build your wealth what your main goal should be is just to you know not only beat inflation but have a steady consistent income Source So eventually you don't have to work that's the whole point of life you don't want to keep working day and night having a boss you want freedom and that's why I'm looking at opportunities that provide freedom but of course I want to take appropriate risk and that's why paler is one of my favorite stocks right now and when I look at analysts you know how they're being very bearish that's a good thing cuz when everyone is bearish and everyone is not enthusiastic that's when you want to be enthusiastic when everyone is enthusiastic like Nvidia you do not want to be enthusiastic it's called being conservative and it's called being a contrarian investor so I'm going against the Grain and that's where I find opportunity I want to do something different from the market that way I can get different results the analyst also said the Army might offer a twoyear renewal for 116 million with Pounders Revenue reduced by additional vendors sharing in the de basically even paler does affiliate marketing right so they have someone that's recommending them and getting them business they're giving referral fees and the William Blair analyst is basically speculating that data ownership could be an issue between the Army and paler data is very important we'll get into that in just a second paler aims to use customer data to train artificial intelligence models okay so guys that's super important that's also why I'm invest in the stock because I have a degree in data analytics that was part of my degree when I graduated and data is the new oil so companies that control data right now have a lot of power specifically looking at meta looking at Tesla looking at um paler even looking at Nvidia right the reason why these companies are performing so well is because data gives you an advantage and when you have a competitive advantage that's where you can print money you can literally kill your competition also Uber beating its competition with lift all right so data data data that is what I'm looking at right now if I could invest in just one company it would literally be other than Apple it would literally be palen here because they have such a huge data Advantage as well as Tesla of course if I had to make a 10-year bet this is the stock that's going to have the biggest return I'm not saying the safest return the biggest return so if I wanted to make the most amount of money this would basically be the stock that I would put a decent size of my wealth into however I would have to be very patient because obviously this stuff doesn't take a day or two so looking at the government agency's biggest customers pounder stock edged up Friday after uh dealma released a note on the stock market today paler stock fell 99.2% so again big big fall here you know looking at paler stock you know it did hit a 52 we intra high on November 21st so not that long ago so as the stock has really strong momentum this is really important And then we continue going up and we've seen that with meta we've literally seen with meta that every time it has a pullback back that's literally the best time to buy cuz if we look at the chart right here I'm going to paint you the picture of what has happened with meta over the past 6 months every time that it's had a basic fall especially pretty big correction here from 316 to 291 by the way that's not that big that's only about probably about 20% here that's been a fantastic buying opportunity then again fall here rise a little bit of a pullback rise pullback huge rise same thing with meta right now I would be a buyer of meta stock the same way because the Trend looks the same as it does for Palante here every time a stock pulls back that's the best time to basically get in now two last points first of all encourage you guys to subscribe you guys that are not subscribed you're going to be missing out on live updates trades and advice that I have on this channel of course I'm not a financial adviser but I would really love it if you would subscribe to this channel we are trying to hit 250 all right then the next thing I want to talk about is honestly I think if Warren Buffett was younger he would be investing in paler and the only reason that we don't see bigger hedge funds investing in paler is because it is a long-term play there's plenty of hedge funds but more are not investing in it because it is a more longer term expected outcome and many hedge funds are just looking at a stock from quarter to quarter because they have a quota to fill most hedge fund managers get paid a you know a fee 2 and 20 it's called two 22% of assets and then 20% of performance and they're just looking at the short term because these guys want to make a big amount of money short term so they can pay their New York penous and whatever else they're doing with their money right so a lot of these Wall Street analysts they're just looking shortterm they're not thinking longterm cuz they don't care they don't even know how long they're going to be in their career for these people on Wall Street are just trying to make some short-term money get in get out that could be their career so I want to encourage you guys to think longer term and I honestly I think this is a really interesting play for you to look into obviously do your own research and make sure that you have the correct position sizing and also make sure that you not only have a good entry which I think right now is a good entry but have an exit strategy because this stock could pull back what will you do if it pulls back let me know in the comment section below and I will see you guys in the next video.,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,LBLv_254OP8,2023-12-01T21:00:10Z,How to Enter and Exit Options Positions & Manage Risk (ULTIMATE GUIDE),Apple,"if Tesla Nvidia Apple Amazon paler or whatever popular stock you're interested in makes a big move how should you handle it if you have an option position open for example if I have an apple covered call as you see here I am down on it but this is a very low risk of assignment because Apple's at around $187 if Apple was at like $250 this would become a highrisk of assignment although there is still roughly 3 weeks until this option expires the reason for it is nobody's going to exercise an option when they can just sell the option for a bigger profit so right now let's just go into Apple I'm going to show you why assignment risk is low and I'm also going to show you another trick about rolling that will absolutely change your game check this out it's currently in the money by $4.90 you see that the current price is $189.90 and the strike price is 185 so if you were to exercise this option you would make about $4.90 however that is completely silly to do as you can see that the option is going for $6.63 so why in the world would you exercise and as you can see in this example a real life example you're never going to really get exercise until you get into Thursday or Friday and that's why I usually decide to roll one day before expiration now on Thursday I will decide to roll an option and typically again I'm going to move two to four weeks out now in terms of strike price selection right I'm usually going to move up by as much as makes sense now this is different in every single scenario which is why I recommend that you check out the first link in the description which is my Discord Community you can communicate with me send me pictures and ask me how to roll and manage any single position that's really important because rolling really depends on the stock and the market and right now looking at Apple for example if I'm going to roll this and I will by the way as the expiration date approaches so let's just say that that the expiration day is only a couple days away and currently I'm in the money well what I would actually do in this scenario is I would move from 185 to 190 that is a really simple choice for me because I know that 190 is not that much more than 185 it gets me out of being in the money just barely and it's also not going to be expensive so let me just show you how I know that it's not going to be expensive and how I would go about it so for example instead of 12:15 I can go for let's say January 19 which is going to be a 4-week difference now instead of 185 I can go for 190 so in this example I'm going to be moving up by about $5 or actually exactly $5 and the difference here is only about $1 so I'm moving up by $5 okay that means I make $5 and I pay $1 or not even $1 it says 88 so I'm paying 88 cents to make $5 that is an absolute no-brainer decision to make and the reason why it's so much $3,000 is because I have so many contracts currently open but what's really happening here is 88 cents being paid as a debit will turn into $5 in total value",1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,LBLv_254OP8,2023-12-01T21:00:10Z,How to Enter and Exit Options Positions & Manage Risk (ULTIMATE GUIDE),Amazon,"if Tesla Nvidia Apple Amazon paler or whatever popular stock you're interested in makes a big move how should you handle it if you have an option position open all right so I want to show you guys two different examples of rolling the first one is going to be Amazon so I currently have some Amazon shares. I currently have a covered call which I actually losing money on so let's first talk about a covered call where I'm losing money and how you can recoup and make money out of a losing position so currently Amazon's at 146 and I am up on the stock however I am down on the option so this option right here is sort of in trouble because the stock is above my option strike price so if you'll notice the 138 call is my strike and the current stock is at 146 that means I'm going to lose my shares and this is going to expire on 128 so here's what I can do can actually click into this option right here and I can create a rolling order so when creating a rolling order again I'm going to be closing out this position and opening up a new one to replace the current position now how close do I want to do to expiration I'm going to show you right now so I'm going to roll this position and here's the thing this currently expires on 128 so I do want to go out into the future let's say that I'm going to go from 128 to January 5th which is about a month extra okay so as soon as I click January 5th right here I'm going to look at another call option to replace this current 138 so let's just say that I want to move up okay there's two ways to do this there's a credit roll and there's a debit roll I'm going to go over the example of both of these as well as on a stock that I'm making money on and losing money on So currently right now 138 I'm going to move up to say um 140 so you will notice right here that I can go from 138 to 140 the extra time or the time change is 28 days so I have to wait an additional 28 days and I actually get paid $100 for this roll now here's the interesting thing yes I want to roll all the way up to um 146 obviously that's where the stock price is however you don't actually have to do that so you can move from 138 to 140 you can move up by $2 this $2 move times the five contracts I have is actually $11,000 so not only do I get to collect 100 but I also get to move up by $11,000 of inth money returns so this is $1,100 in just 28 days this is very beneficial because I'm moving up from 130 to 140 but you know check this out I can also move up to 141 however now this is not going to be a credit this is going to be a debit a debit is not as attractive and most of my students like to roll for credits rolling for a credit is a no-brainer because you're making money and you're moving up in your cost basis however a total Deb debit is actually a decision that you have to make so in this scenario it's $410 but this is going to free up $1,500 how do I know that because 138 and 141 the difference is three times the five contracts so that's $1,500 now when you're running the wheel strategy rolling up is actually very simple but when you already have a covered call you actually need to decide do you want to roll for a credit or a debit so I'm actually going to show you another example of a stock that I'm currently running the wheel strategy on this is going to be JD so JD I currently have 600 shares and I am down in the stock so unlike Amazon I'm actually down here",1.0,0.7

Invest with Henry,LBLv_254OP8,2023-12-01T21:00:10Z,How to Enter and Exit Options Positions & Manage Risk (ULTIMATE GUIDE),JD.com,"so I'm actually going to show you another example of a stock that I'm currently running the wheel strategy on this is going to be JD so JD I currently have 600 shares and I am down in the stock so unlike Amazon I'm actually down here this is a very common question people always ask me if I'm down on a stock how do I even sell covered calls since it's below my cost basis and here's the thing you only have two options number one you can wait for the stock to recover and that is a very tough task because it may not recover to your average cost for quite some time so for example JD is currently at 2876 but my average cost is 35 that is very far away and just looking at the past 3 months it's most likely not even going to go to $35.80 as my average says anytime soon it can be way more than 3 months or 6 months so instead what I do decide to do is I do decide to sell some covered calls that are below my average cost So currently my average cost is 35 and I did sell some 272 covered calls now they're currently in the money also just like Amazon but I'm down on the stock so it's even more painful to lose the stock when I'm down on on it so in this scenario I can just click this option and just taking a look at the option as you can see it's going to expire on 12:15 um I have six contracts currently it's actually a one Monon expiration right so I ended up selling it on 11:15 and expires on 12:15 and the bid is 180 the ask is 184 and actually the implied volatility is pretty good at 38 I do like to look at implied volatility because higher implied volatility is actually good for Rolling options that's because when you add extra time implied volatility is helping you because time plus volatility equals premium so in many ways a higher implied volatility and a stock that has more implied volatility like a Tesla or another tech company is going to be much better for trading options because volatility is actually your friend when you were trading options especially when you're rolling them so currently the Delta right here is 71 that is a very high Delta so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click roll this position now what I'm going to do is I'm going to roll from 272 up towards Wards a better figure because again I don't want to lose the stock and my plan is to keep rolling Higher and Higher and you can actually do that in infinite amount of times that's one of the superpowers of rolling options you can continue to roll as much as you need as many times as you need into the future so how much time do you actually roll into the future well typically I'm going to roll into the future by 2 to 4 weeks so in this example let's move over by about 1 month so I'm going to go from 12:15 over to January 19th so that's a one month change now as you will see I can actually move up to let's say $30 and this will be a debit but in this example this would not only free up a126 roughly right because it's currently at 27.5 and the stock is at 2876 but in addition to the $126 I'm also getting a bigger upside up to $30 so in this scenario I'm not only making 126 I'm I'm also opening myself up to another 124 so the difference between 30 and 2876 is about 124 I believe so you are making about $3 in total potential which is $3 * 6 that's $1,800 and you're paying $342 so in this scenario this is actually a really good deal however I can make it an even more no-brainer so if I just move up to 2876 which is one of the weird strike prices I'm not even sure why so weird must have been a split or something but this is a really weird strike price that I've not actually seen before but as you can see right here the total debit is $18 now $18 is basically next to nothing because I have over $10,000 in this position so basically consider $18 zero so actually what's going on here is I'm moving from $27.50 up to 2876 so that's about a doll and change that's a126 and I'm actually paying nothing for that except for time the time change is 35 days and during this 35 days I essentially am moving up in my cause basis from 272 to 2876 and that's one of the biggest powers of rolling is you can manipulate your strike price you can actually change your strike price so if you end up selling a put option or a covered call and it goes into the money you want to decide if you want to roll actually a few days before expiration",1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,ckOsiaAZG-s,2023-11-30T22:10:18Z,AMC About To Explode,AMC,"what's going on guys back with another video and today we're going to talk about AMC stock and today instead of Uncle Henry it's King Henry because you know not only my king I'm going to show you how to be a king with your money all right so let's talk about AMC AMC is a very interesting stock and I specifically see some opportunities now because you know covid-19 pandemic has been a challenging time for entertainment industry and AMC was no exception and this stock went down quite a bit guys I mean if I take a look right here you can see how this stock went down to the dumpster but now I specifically do see some opportunities and this stock has some in insane I mean insane implied volatility and implied volatility is an option Traders friend I'm telling you in terms of its options the options look extremely juicy and there's quite a lot of heat that you can catch here and really jump in with the momentum and make some really short-term stacks of cash all right but there is a lot of important things that you do need to consider because this stock is again it's volatile I mean just look at the six-month chart there has been a lot going on specifically in 2020 the company's Revenue actually dropped by 89% compared to the previous year and as short sellers shorted the stock and they just put so much money into shorting it and that's really risky AMC actually experienced a similar stock explosion like GameStop did in 2021 because the community on Reddit Wall Street bets and all the so-called Apes bought the stock regardless of all the shorting okay I mean if I look at the statistics right now you guys can see that when I look at the short interest you can see that there's currently 22.8 million shares short 11% of the shares outstanding so again there is a whole lot of controversy on the stock and that's why the implied volatility is so high I mean if I look at AMC options right now I'm going to show you how much opportunity there is to make short-term money of course you have to be right on Direction all right so let's go open up to 7 and A2 132% volatility now this would not be my main strategy this would be a side strategy this would be a side strategy where essentially I put some money into this and kind of you know just hope for a really big multibagger return because AMC actually peaked at around $70 hundreds of perc gain gain in only a few months and then it dropped ever since then right in 2023 the return has been negative over 70% all the Apes right all these socalled Apes that are just jumping in trying to make that money they still believe in a short squeeze even though the current stock price tells another story right look at the September 22 you know the CEO Adam Aaron introduced a dividend AMC stock called AP okay to raise more cash he diluted AP to keep the company alive and almost one year later the reverse split happened AMC and and ape combined are now worth $7 and you know about 90 right so this stock is are worth about $7 and you know even today look the stock is jumping up 7% I mean just catching in one day swing you're getting quite a bit of a return so this is a really good strategy especially for some of the Swing Traders some of the more active guys they're just basically printing money here if you can you know correctly jump in on the momentum like you have to be careful but again 7% return one day is is wild so if you end up dividing AMC at its peak by 10 because of the reverse split we received a share price of almost 80 C so you know this stock looks like a really good bargain at these levels and the current situation basically looks like this to raise more Capital CEO Adam Aaron introduced a dividend AMC share called ape in 2022 and you know after nearly one year both stocks AMC and a plummeted to the ground conversion of both stocks and 1 to 10 reverse split are the reason for today's share price that's why most AMC investors are underwater with Average stock price of you know like $ 30 $40 $50 I mean people were paying absurd prices here and you know before the reverse split because of the conversion and dilution it's not 100% the same anymore AMC is at an all-time low AMC still faces a lot of debt that's why the company needs more revenue and it needs more money and it needs to prove itself I mean for it to come back if I look at the one-year stock price for it to really come back to these levels you know it really needs to start pumping in more cash it needs to start seeing some you know Revenue hit the bottom online it needs to become you know more profitable clearly and you know this position for me I mean I wouldn't really put more than 5% of my money here this is more of a YOLO play but you know I've been getting some some folks just asking me what are some more of those YOLO plays I want to build my wealth faster I want to make more short-term money I want to swing trade I have some you know play capital and that is totally fine I agree with that because I did make a lot of my money on Tesla I mean I was very positive on Tesla so that's how I made $100,000 into $700,000 you know basically doing put credit spreads on Tesla however I was very confident I was very confident I was going for very high Delta so I was breaking rules I was doing like 50 Delta on Tesla I was you know buying some call options buying leaps I was doing a whole bunch of interesting strategies on Tesla but I think AMC is another one of those names where if you catch the fire correctly you'll really heat your wealth up and you'll grow it so in terms of fundamentals that is really important to me right I was an analyst on Wall Street I have quite a bit of experience looking at stocks and individual stocks so fundamentals in general they change for the better so in Q3 2023 earnings uh you know they were reported not that long ago and the earnings look like this the total revenue grew by 45% compared to Q3 in 2022 $1.4 billion and the expectation was 1.26 billion so the earnings were beat and you know the total revenu is finally going up so people are going to get their entertainment again diluted earnings so loss per share improved by $2.2 okay from negative $2.2 to positive 8 guys 8 cents we're in the positive now okay so that is a big deal because even looking at Amazon you know they were running at a loss for such a long time they finally hit a profit the stock skyrocketed so I think something similar can happen with AMC where the stock can Skyrocket because finally it went from huge negatives to a little bit of positive so you know looking at movies like The Oppenheimer and Barbie this caused a really huge Revenue increase okay because people are going to movies again they're starting to consume that entertainment and that's good the outlook for Q4 2023 is Taylor Swift and Beyonce concert tickets and you can watch the concert in the cinema exclusive partnership with AMC and I think will result in good numbers but maybe not as good as Q3 2023 because of the lack of you know many you know AAA movies but instead of you know celebrating the huge beat in the earnings actually the CEO announced that the dilution of more shares the reason for the recent surge in the stock price he he wants to gain another $350 million so you know a whole bunch of interesting stuff is happening with the stock which is you know a lot of catalyst for movement and that's why specifically I think you know doing some interesting strategies on AMC you know whether it's uh you know buying some call options getting in on a swing I think this is this is uh this is what I would be doing with my play capital I mean I don't have that much play Capital myself because I'm very comfortable and I don't you know I don't have that itch to play with my money but you know then again it doesn't hurt to make a big swing it feels really fun sometimes to catch a big win and just celebrate it so AMC is a highrisk you know High reward play because we don't know when AMC will be done with diluting shares but we are currently at an all-time low of a fundamentally stronger company in comparison to where it was in 2020 this is a lot stronger of a company the picture is finally more clear so since we've came out of the co times now people are coming back in I think the trend is finally more positive and selling cash secured puts can also be a good way of building a position in a stock that you want to keep in your portfolio so let's say that we want to jump in here I would go to sell put I'm going to tell you some pros and cons by the way so you know I can do a short-term trade can do a longer term trade okay I can go out any length of time actually because you're getting compensated for the degree or the length of time that you are pursuing so if you check this out right now even if I sell a $6 put the return here is ginormous I mean in just 51 days you can see how the return here is over 10% I mean 10% of $7 is70 this is 80 you're getting over 10% so you know just for example I'm going to go ahead and sell a contract here just want to make sure that um I'm doing as I say because I do have some belief here although I don't want to have too big of a position as I don't currently have that much cash you guys know I'm quite heavy on a number of stocks like um Apple anyways there we go I made I made a one sell here so this is an AMC cash secure put that was just an example you see how I did that so quickly it's because if AMC goes below 7 I am going to be committed to buying 100 shares of AMC now I want to talk about the positive argument for AMC and I also want to talk about the negative argument you really need to understand how to manage this position because this is an important one to manage so on the positive side people they like movies they like Cinemas guys we all like to have fun we want to have that uh entertainment so and also just looking at investors out there which you know I'm going to call Apes for the AMC crowd you know apes are still holding or still hoping for huge gains in the stock price they're still averaging down guys there's a lot of support in this stock because people are still buying it people are literally still buying it because they have a lot of belief in AMC and again it's an it's at an all-time low I mean there is a lot of support here not just technically and fundamentally but also just from the sheer volume of people buying now of course there's some negative you know there's a negative argument the company is still in debt you know they have a lot of debt but you know then again if you look at some of my positions in my portfolio I'm going to go to my portfolio real quick you'll see that I do have some stocks that do have quite a bit of debt in specifically Airlines you know American Airlines uh where is American Airlines I have American Airlines and I have JetBlue these companies have a lot of debt you know there is a lot of debt in the airline industry so I'm not really scared of that again I'm not putting all my portfolio and I'm not going all in on this company this is just a interesting play that I think can have quite a bit of return right right and uh looking at more negatives though dilution will you know kind of hurt the company diluting will save the company in some ways but might also destroy the share price in the short and medium term so yes we need strong earnings in 2024 that is really what needs to happen for AMC so there you know there's a couple things that you can do you can also utilize the wheel strategy because the premiums are just absolutely nuts okay and I just recently uploaded a video on the wheel strategy I actually want you to check it out in the description so anyways I just want to bring up that AMC is one of the interesting plays that I'm looking into more right now",1.0,0.3

Invest with Henry,YkslFnFf2kU,2023-11-27T14:36:28Z,QQQ Trade Management,QQQ,"hey guys this is another video about QQQ and how I'm managing my position so just a few weeks ago I have made a QQQ trade it was a covered call position and actually in the past 1 month QQ is up about 13.3% so QQQ has just gone up a lot and a lot of people are asking me how am I managing my covered call position so that's what I want to talk about and I also want to talk about if you have a small portfolio how would you trade QQQ what expirations I'm looking at for trip Q so yeah let's go over this first of all I just want to cover some small account trading here before I go over my covered call position I would specifically use uh credit spreads on Triple Q right now credit spreads are you know obviously a fantastic strategy for putting small amounts of money to work and with a credit spread you are collecting a defined premium and you also have a defined set risk so it's a fairly safe strategy at least it's defined what I mean by that is you're making $50 you're risking for 50 that risk to reward board may seem really off but it's all about the chances of profit it's all about the chances that you're going to be successful right so let's just go over an example so 389 is the current price if I look at year to date we are sitting at an all-time high so just being honest with you things have been going really well but at the same time it's getting increasingly risky to hold technology companies so it's always a double-edged sword when things are going well you feel good but at the same time there is a potential crash or potential correction right around the corner or just a potential dip right you don't have to have a crash just you know for example the market could be sitting pretty high and then just have a bit of a correction before you know going higher just like we just saw this year from you know mid July to currently end of November early December so what I would do with triple Q is obviously I have a covered call I'm using quite a bit of money I'm using all of my Capital essentially in my account let's go to uh sell put okay so a put credit spread is fantastic for riding the momentum higher so let's say that QQ Rises a put credit spread is going to benefit you can also do really short-term put credit spreads so you can go like one day expiration and just pick a put credit spread that's like simply out of the money so you would sell a 385 for example then buy the 383 so as you can see here that's a very small return now what I would do instead right now cuz you know the market is sitting pretty high is I don't really like to bet against indices or index funds right so let's go to an expiration date let's say uh November or December 1st so I don't like to bet against the market just because the market does tend to rise when I was working at a hedge fund the lead quantitative analyst said that essentially he's almost always long stocks since stocks are rising for all of history and they have been for many many decades especially if you look on a longer term Horizon so stocks do have a tendency to rise and therefore it is not so smart to do call Credit spreads but I'm going to show you a call Credit spread because when the market is at a 52- we High then yes it can be smart to start to mix in call Credit spreads because you want to be balanced okay so let me just go into 398 right now 10 Delta so really really low so this is a very low Delta High chance of not happening okay and then you can just buy something like this all right so this is what I would do I would play credit spreads right now not a bad return actually this is 5 days and almost 10% so yeah anyways that's how I would play it but now let's take a look at my position so specifically a lot of you guys have asked me you know Henry you opened up a triple Q position it went up and your cover call is losing money oh my gosh it's losing money well not even close if you think I'm losing money then basically you don't understand how a basic covered call even works and this is the most basic strategy that you need to understand okay you just really really need to understand triple q and index funds but you also need to understand how covered calls just simply work um I'm actually doing quite well a lot of my positions right now are for a gain uh basically actually every single position I currently own does have a gain except for the covered call so in some ways I am down but honestly that's not how it works the way I covered call works is it's one position just TD Mar trade has them SE separated right you know if I went to the total position like my total exposure to Triple Q then my gain would be this 86,000 minus the 43,000 so it's literally about $42,500 in gains so I have a $442,000 gain now what I have been better off had I not done a covered call the answer is yes I would have actually been better off not doing the covered call however I didn't know that at the time so when I ever I opened up this position right it was several weeks ago I didn't know that so the fact of the matter is at that point of time I made the best decision possible which was doing a covered call because when you're not doing covered calls on average you are leaving money on the table that's because whenever you have a stock or an ETF where you have 100 shares you're able to sell covered calls on your position and start generating income on that position position and that's why when folks have 76 shares or some random amount of shares right I always tell them to round up the shares buy more until you have 100 shares and then start doing covered calls the covered call strategy is proven and it's been around for decades now and the covered call strategy is essentially just a simple way to make income on assets all right so whenever I hold a stock I'm always you know really not certain of where it's going to go in the short term nobody really knows um not Warren Buffett or really nobody can predict the market so whenever you're holding a stock say um you know really any stock you don't know how high or high how low it can go in the short term so when you sell a covered call you're doing a couple things first of all you're creating a margin of safety so if the stock ends up going down you have a cushion well actually let's just take my QQQ for example so I uh sold a 375 call here and when I ended up selling it I sold it for let's just say about $10 the current price is 27 and and it looks like I'm down about 61% so uh let's just call it about $10 or so in all reality I think it was a bit higher than $10 it was probably around 13 or $14 but let's just say 10 so what that means is if QQQ were to go down okay whenever on my stock here I would actually look like a genius because when I sold it for $10 that's you know $4,200 if this went down by 10 grand um at least I would be down 10 grand here but this would be up you know $4,200 right so this is basically acting as a support system so when the stock or ETF goes down I am saving money I'm not losing as much as the market is losing okay but when it goes up yes it is limiting my gain to a certain extent So currently it's 43,000 but you know there's quite a couple factors here so for example in March 15 as this option approaches expiration it's also going to decay in value now it's not going to Decay like crazy because if you do the math right now it's 375 right that's that's the strike price and then the current price of buying this option back so like why don't I buy back like when can I make this decision well right now 375 plus 20 uh 27 is uh is going to be $42 and 54 okay so 40254 but currently QQQ is 38951 so you can see there's a discrepancy here and that's because this option has you know more value because of the time because of the time and and the implied volatility so the volatility in the future and the times the time is how much this uh is worth more then it is in the money so I'm in the money by you know 389 - 375 is about $14.51 right this option is is uh is worth a lot more than that okay so the difference there is what I'm going to make by waiting and I do have a decision though as I do approach March 15 I will look to roll this option up but I I typically don't roll so early so it's only been a you know a few weeks so it's definitely too early to roll at this time unless I really think that triple Q is going to rise know a lot in the short term now I also have some positions in triple Q that's also helping my position so it's not just this covered call I've also decided to sell some 350 puts so right here I'm up $5,200 so this is adding Delta or adding exposure into QQQ so not only do I have a cover call that's now in the money yes it's in the money but now I'm also selling puts so if it you know jumps down then that's going to you know get me more exposure but if it doesn't jump down well it is what it is okay so I can't make any more money on the covered call per se but at least this position where I sold puts is going to continue to make money so I'm currently up 49% it's going to make me another $5,000 and then I also have another QQQ position that's expiring basically December 29th the last day of I think this is the last trading day of this year where I just sold this very recently it was was uh maybe like a couple days ago and it's a very uh early position for me right I sold 20 contracts quite a bit of money like I am using margin guys I love margin and margin is something that I teach in my one-on-one program anyways 375 I have more exposure into triple q and so far I'm up $600 so again you know I'm just long on Triple Q it's one of my favorite ETFs to have and specifically I like it so much because it already holds the stocks that I really like so rather than having to buy all the individual stocks if I scroll up here apple is my number one position personally so I've been invested in Apple for quite some time I bought Apple at $176 and now it's around the high 180s low 190s so Apple has been my favorite position I'm so happy that I ended up putting a majority of my money into it and I'm also really bullish on the rest of the tech companies now Microsoft I'm a little bit shy on because Microsoft has run up quite a bit I mean if I look at the chart on Microsoft it's really no joke it's around a 52 we high so if I go to your to date it is sitting at a 52- we high but so is triple Q so that does make sense Amazon I really like it is also at a 52 we high so a lot of these stocks are now peaking and it's becoming a bit uh scarier and I'm becoming more reserved on the market again so I made quite a bit of money shortterm in the market and now I do want to kind of uh protect myself in the next 2 to 3 weeks and then obviously as the New Year hits the new year is a fantastic time to invest because there's something called the January effect where um stocks rise quite a bit in January it's a known fact meta is good Nvidia I I don't like I have call Credit spreads on Nvidia which is a bearish strategy yeah on Nvidia I am a bit reserved and then um Google I I love Google Google is great Tesla's also good Tesla's pretty volatile so Tesla has some of the best uh options on the market period",1.0,0.6

Invest with Henry,YrmMTKTRR7c,2023-11-24T20:00:54Z,Huge Market Catalyst 💰📈,Apple,"Apple has been one of my best plays I've been very vocal about that on my channel and I have a very big position on Apple I have made numerous videos saying how Apple was going to crush it during earnings and I have done very well on Apple making $51,000 I do have some options right now some of them being down my total return is down 9,800 now here's what I would do if you have a small portfolio with apple I would go to trade Apple options there's specifically a few strategies that I would use okay with a small portfolio you would want to do a sell put credit spread a put credit spread is a position that benefits if the stock goes sideways if the stock goes up and even if the stock goes down a little bit so you can go for shorter term expirations again if you're watching this in the future doesn't really matter you can go for expiration days that are you know zero Days 7 Days however for me I want to give it a little bit of time so I'm going to go to December 15 that's 21 days out very easy to manage this position because 21 days out not that much is probably going to happen with Apple so I'm going to pick a strike and the strike that I'm going to first look at is going to be the 1822 now taking a look at the Delta it's 14 one of my favorite Deltas is between 10 to 20 20 being a bit more aggressive and 10 being super duper safe so this is a decent option so I'm going to look at the 1822 the implied volatility is actually very low which is not a good thing you want it to be a little bit higher but that is because Apple just had earnings and the stock is up a lot nonetheless this is good because apple is unlikely to go down to 1822 so I'm going to sell the 1822 and then I'm going to buy the next leg lower okay so the 180 right here has a Delta of 10 pretty good so if I were to buy this then you will see right now that I have a put credit spread and the return here is almost 10% cuz you know 19 divided 231 is about 9% so this 9% return is going to come to you in 21 days which is 3 weeks so that's 3% per week now this is a good strategy but it is not the best strategy there's a few different strategies I'm going to show you so make sure you pay attention you know right here this is fine however if it goes below 1822 you will start to lose money but I doubt that this will happen so this is a very safe position and if the market were open right now then I would be opening up this position however I also already have a put credit spread on Apple currently so I actually have the 187 1/2 and the 182 and 1/2 which has done very very well cuz it's going to expire today and that's why there's only 3 cents left on this as well as this option right here the 165 160 there's also 3 cents left here so that is a put credit spread position and I'm using that over and over again on Apple. but I am selling puts on margin um with apple and I'm not getting charged any interest so I'm pretty excited about that um we already talked about a lot of Apple",1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,YrmMTKTRR7c,2023-11-24T20:00:54Z,Huge Market Catalyst 💰📈,Amazon,now I'm also doing something very similar on Amazon so if I click into my Amazon position right here I have also played a put credit spread isn't that funny Robin Hood glitch okay so I made $190 here this is not a lot of profit however you do have to realize that I did not really bet that much money on this position so I have sold the 142 okay so the 142 I sold and then 138 I bought okay if I were to open up a new position here's what it would look like I would go to view all options I again go to sell put option I will go out a specific date and time so again I think 21 days out is perfect and then again you know rinse and repeat I would look for a Delta that is around 15 so right there you guys tell me is that too much or is that too little and what would a 29 Delta be okay tell me in the comment section is that too much too little and why why let me see let's go to 139 okay's go to 137 looks good okay so I would sell this then and you know here's the difference okay some people like well why do you do a two spread why you do a three and why do you do five what is the optimal well actually what is optimal is all of them they're all very similar so whether you do two three or five here let's actually take a look at each of those scenarios okay so if I go to buy 135 you'll see right here that I am going to be making $20 and risking 180 and if I go down to say seven no it's actually four so let me go to Five if I go to five right now I'm making $38 on 462 so which is better well actually neither is better or worse they both have advantages and disadvantages so the 137 and the 132 that I'm looking at right now you are risking a little bit more max loss here more collateral and you're making a little bit less money but why would that be the case that's actually weird that's actually completely backwards right you may think to yourself well the other one was a better deal and it is a better deal in terms of return but it is a worse deal in terms of risk risk okay finance and trading it's all about risk and return write that down it's the most important formula ever risk versus return okay so here you're getting $38 you're risking quite a bit but it's a little bit harder for Amazon to go down to 132 versus in this example at 135 yes the return is 20 over 180 which is quite good it's a better than the first example that we're just looking at however it is easier for Amazon to hit 135 right so if Amazon goes down it you know could hit 135 but it not hit 132 so this right here you're risking less Capital you have a higher return but your risk is higher because um you know just because Amazon could hit 135 easier and the break even here is you know it's a lot easier to hit so that is the benefit and the difference between a $3 spread and a $5 spread,1.0,0.3

Invest with Henry,0PWF_MJDcv8,2023-11-02T20:17:28Z,"How to Trade Options for Beginners with $1,000",Apple,"if you go to trade Apple options okay for example let's say you don't have enough money to buy the stock because if you were to buy 100 shares that would be about $17,200 and I know not everyone has that just laying around especially if you're trying to learn how to trade options from the beginning you only have $1,000 how would you go about buying some expensive stocks you really can't okay and obviously Apple Tesla Microsoft Google some of these companies are really good but they are expensive so here's what I would do okay if you're watching this in the future it's okay you can always pick an expiration date that is 30 days out okay when I buy call options I want to give it some time you don't want to give it too much time because then that is going to be pretty expensive so here check this out if I think apple is going to go up in the next 30 days I would pick an option that is close to the money so let me explain close to the money means that it's close to the current stock price the current stock price for Apple is $72.50 now because this current price is very close to 175 that makes 175 a pretty good call option because it's not super expensive it's currently $450 as you can see right here it's 4.5 and this actually allows you to control 100 shares so that's what's really awesome about options and that's what people love about buying options because when you buy an option you get control of basically 100 shares and like I said buying 100 shares is really expensive but buying a call option is not that expensive so for instance let's say that Apple went to $200 per share okay if it went to 200 a stock investor made the difference from 200 minus 172 that is about $28 $28 divided by1 172 well you can see the return on screen right now not so bad but check this out if this call option the stock goes to 200 then this call option is going to be worth $25 so $25 is what it's worth and you only paid $450 so as you can see on the screen the return is astronomically higher in very different because of the leverage factor with a call option if you think Apple will go higher than 180 you need it to actually go up to 182.5 right whatever the current price of this option is which is always changing that's the thing about options you can buy them and you can sell them you actually don't have to wait until expiration if I buy a put option and I think that apple is going to go lower than 170 and I hit continue here okay you will see that I'm actually making money if the stock goes lower okay if it goes below about 16555 that's when I start making money so buying a put option gives you the right to get rid of your stock and throw it to someone else even for a lower price so if I do the 170 okay and the stock goes down a lot let's say that it goes down to like 150 I still get to get rid of the stock for 170 that's the beautiful part about buying put options",1.0,0.4

Invest with Henry,xffTDm15bEQ,2023-10-31T23:44:53Z,Apple Trade,Apple,"hey what's going on guys in this video I want to make a trade on Apple I'm actually going to open up a live trade and tell you exactly why I'm doing it first of all on options F I've noticed that when I go to the sellp put strategy apple is being recommended here at a sellp put for 1622 and that is going to capture in earnings this expiration day right here is for November uh 10th for November 10th captures in in earnings and specifically this portfolio right here already has some apple but I'm going to open up some more right now I think apple is going to have a really interesting earnings event you know it's happening ASAP on November 1st Apple announces a new M3 chip and cuts the price of the entry-level MacBook Pro obviously that's going to be a big deal I think more people will switch over to MacBooks and then just in general the new news is really interesting here so China puts the world's biggest apple supplier I think overall apple is one of the most interesting companies I've been doing quite a bit of research here I'll show you what I really like about Apple specifically their valuation is very very fair and overall this is actually a Warren Buffett favorite stock he has no incentive of you know selling any programs he doesn't have an incentive like a hedge fund to put your money in different things to look good Warren Buffett is just trying to get the most results and apple being down 1% under 170 I have quite a bit at Apple to be honest with you in in Robin Hood I have I think it's about 60% of my portfolio in apple and I'll just kind of be transparent here let's go through everything cuz I kind of forget exactly how much let me just show you how much Apple I have and just kind of I'm putting my money where my mouth is okay a lot of people here oh this stock is good that stock is good like guys I have million or millions of dollars in apple let me take a look right now apple is 50% of my portfolio I have $589,000 invested in Apple stock right now I have some more sellp put options which are actually in the money so I'm actually making a really big BET right now like a really really big bet like look 170 put right here you know options 5 is recommending the 622 and now in my TDM trade account you can see that my Apple position I have 165 out to June I'm down on it but I will show you what I want to do right now which is I will go a little bit shorter term on Apple I'm going to go for a also 165 okay it's going to be a little bit somewhat aggressive and uh it's going to be a lot of premium and by the way the valuation I was talking about is uh the PE Ratio is is pretty decent at 26 for a you know quickly growing tech company I mean it's not as quickly growing as it used to be but apple one of the best brand names in the world you know we all probably most of us have an Apple iPhone so let me go to TD Mar trade as you can see here I have 25 contracts by the way this portfolio has a lot of margin a lot a lot of margin I mean a lot uh I have 1.5 mil in spy and then the rest here are all like margin plays I have an apple in June 21st so what I think I'm going to do is 25 contracts here that's going to be about $400,000 it's about 400k in fact it's probably 4 and 12 $425,000 exposure so I'm going to increase this little bit I'm also going to add a position that's going to expire pretty soon here so yeah let me go ahead and go to Apple you may not be able to see the option chain cuz I'm using a software where you can only see one screen so bear with me if that is the case so if I go to option chain actually I can show it you on Robin Hood and I can actually execute it on TDM trade so I'm just going to go to trade Apple options and then before I execute this I'm going to execute this on the other screen I'm going to show you proof as well I like to show my receipts if I go to November 10 okay that's going to be on the 10th that's what options SP was recommending again the 165 wow it's going for a lot so the Delta is pretty high right implied volatility is like almost double from what I usually see it now this is I know pretty good thing this basically is just saying that the stock is more likely to have a decent move I mean 40% doesn't mean it's going to move 40% it's just an implied volatility of 40% surprisingly the the volume is really low today I mean the market did did just open so I'm making a a market trade right now now what I think I'm actually going to do is I'm actually going to go down to 1622 and I think this is perfectly fine the premium difference is not that much and the Delta is still 30 so that's perfectly fine with me so 1622 I'm going to go to uh the option chain right here I'm not sure if you guys can see it I actually believe you cannot so just bear with me for one second I'm going to show you why I'm going to execute the 1622 now you can see it on my screen okay cool yes now you can see it so sell to open I will go ahead and do 10 contracts here so 10 contracts is about 162,000 500 once 62500 so I'm going to go for a market order guys remember like you can go for limit orders and you can put in a price but when you're trading a liquid stock as you can see the bid is 26 and ask is 219 at the moment it doesn't really matter so I just go for a market that way I save time so I'm going to go to review okay so as you can see I'm going to collect 22170 okay and then I'm going to have to pay a commission of $6.50 one of the downsides here of using a different brokerage account other than Robin Hood but it is fine it's not a huge deal I'm going to go ahead and place the order here okay and I got filled all right so here I just got filled so I col collected probably have to go into my history here let's go into my history transactions Okay cool so I did add some money to the portfolio I had JP Morgan spy Apple meta Microsoft but where's the trade from today uh if I go to one day let's see what we got going on here Apple there it is there is the apple right there Apple sold 10 contracts $21.73 $6.50 you know fee also Robin Hood started charging fees that is not ideal of course but uh you know it's not huge it's only 3 cents per per option contract it's not too bad and Apple stock I just sold the put but if you have a small portfolio you can also you can also buy call options",1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,7SrGwN3y4LY,2023-10-31T17:04:34Z,Palantir Stock - Do This Now,Palantir,Palantir has earnings on November 2nd I believe the long-term strategy justifies buying a small amount of call options before earnings or just outright purchasing the stock. Dan IES of wedbush Securities calls Palantir the best Pure Play AI name in a CNBC interview in August of this year. Since 2003 the secretive company has built custommade AI or ml which is machine learning Solutions and sold them to the government or large commercial Enterprises. This video is going to be jam-packed with analysis on Palantir going over the stock the technicals and what I see with the options. I am bullish regarding Palantir because its key operating metrics demonstrate strong performance. The company delivered a 38% year-over-year customer count which I think is a strong bullish sign for investors. Gaining more customers allows the company to significantly improve its financial performance due to the wide range of offerings for customers. Having a diversified set of products and modules means that solid cross- selling and upselling opportunities are are present for Palantir. Cross- selling and upselling can make Palantir a lot of money within its already current customer base therefore it is unsurprising that the Billings growth significantly outpaced the number of customers increase with a 52% year-over-year growth. I am very bullish for this earnings now of course I can't predict the future but I have a pretty high certainty let's take a look at the chart and the options so here's Palantir right now. I'm using yaho Finance the market cap is 31 billion and the PE Ratio is currently not available because obviously their earnings per share is currently negative so it's really important to take a look at their chart and also I'm going to show you why it's important to take a look at the statistics tab in just the moment but taking a look at the chart right now the stock has been doing pretty well actually over the past 6 months this stock was under $10 per share I was buying it and then I was also selling puts on it and then you know the stock really exploded so I've been kind of shy to buy it around these prices but currently as the stock has pulled back I think it's becoming a really interesting opportunity especially because if you look right here here it has a really strong support at around 14 in fact it has a super strong support at 14 if I draw a line from here you know this is going back into July actually even before July in June all right so in June this stock was around $14 so let's click right here and then if I go you can see here how much of a strong support there really is so if the stock goes down I expect it to basically bounce off pretty hard even if earnings isn't that good so that's the really interesting part that right now earnings sort of matter because in the short term the stock can go up a lot or down but even if it goes down I expect this stock to continue going back up and bouncing off this support level because the market is actually very simply psychology it's investors looking at what price they want to buy a stock for and when there's a lot of support like this this is a very clear indicator to me that it is actually a really good opportunity and the support is very clear. Now let's take a look at the options because I think there's a few things that we can do do with the options right now I'm going to go to Palantir and I did forget to show you guys the statistics tab so something that I look for in the statistics is I look for price to sales ratio so here 15 is not necessarily that low but Tesla was way over 20 now price to sales is important because companies that don't have a lot of earnings it's much better to obviously look at price of sales because they have sales but they don't have strong earnings I also look at a whole bunch of other things here I do look at the moving averages I also want to see that the shares are not super short Palantir is super short so I'm just going to be honest with you this is not a play where I would put all my money this is a play where I put maybe 5% of my Capital into you know because obviously there are safer companies than this one but the volatility here makes it really attractive so if I go to the options they are very attractive there is a whole bunch of money to be made so you know there's a risk and reward tradeoff if you want you know a higher reward then obviously the risk is going to be a little bit higher so if I go to trade Palantir options and again you know if I just look at your to date this stock is currently up 122% so when I was recommending it pretty much doubled now okay so let's go to trade Palantir options I'm going to show you what I would be doing okay I'm going to go to first of all buy call option I don't love buying call options but if you have a smaller portfolio this is a pretty necessary strategy you have to plow more Capital into your portfolio as much as possible on a consistent basis along the way you might have to buy a little bit of call options or leap options I have videos on that let's go to buy call option and November 3rd would capture in earnings so that's why right here you will see that this is very expensive the market is is pricing in a pretty significant move actually since the 15 strike is going for you know 80 cents that's you know $80 that you have to put up and the Delta here is really high at 4848 implied volatility is insane guys this is insane this is Bonkers absolutely like implied volatility for the S&P 500 is like 30 and here it's like 165 okay this is one of the highest implied volatilities I have literally ever seen except for some really crazy biotech companies that are about to report like uh FDA approval or drug approval here very high implied volatility so that just tells you that the market is you know expecting a really huge move up or down you know and it's not certain if I go to buy put options for example you will see that uh the 142 is also going for a lot of money in fact one strategy that you could look at you know let me just educate you on everything one strategy that you could look at is going to be a a strangle so you can actually bet on the stock going down or up okay this is a really interesting strategy because you don't have to know the direction which way Palantir will go but if you believe that the stock is going to pop higher or lower in like you know potentially disappoint then this is a really good strategy right here but me personally I would not be buying put options uh because you know as I said I am more bullish than bearish so with this call option you know obviously the max profit is unlimited I mean the stock could go up a lot and in theory it can go up you know unlimited but you I expect the stock if it pops up it would go up to about 17 which means that this would be a little bit more than doubling your money you know if it goes to 17 then it would be a $2 profit you pay 80 so you know that's a little bit more that's actually two and a half times in a very short amount of time in 3 days obviously high risk but at the same time I can see Palantir going up so you know I would use a little bit of my Capital I currently have a whole bunch of cash sitting on the sidelines but you know I would use up to 5% of my money on Palantir especially if I had a high conviction in it which I personally do now the rest of the strategies obviously you can lose uh $80 and uh yeah that could be 100% of the capital that you put up that is the risk with buying call options. Another thing that you could do is you can do a covered call meaning that you can buy 100 shares you can go to sell uh call and uh this is actually what I'll most likely be doing today once the Market opens up I'm going to acquire some shares I was trading the stock uh in this account on 1016 you can see here that I sold some puts actually made some money and then I just didn't revisit the stock for a little bit which is pretty good you know the stock went down so I was really good with my timing actually I wasn't a fan of the momentum going down so this actually turned out really well on October 2nd and then I didn't touch the stock for a little bit and now it's actually under my strike price so this is really good that's why I'm going to jump in as soon as the Market opens up and I'm going to get in position to play Q3 2023 you know that the earnings is going to be really interesting. She does analysis on Palantir as well as Sofi and she is just overall fantastic.

Invest with Henry,PboqMrQ7exY,2023-10-26T16:33:35Z,My Positions,Apple,so Apple okay so I have a sell puts right now I did this as basically a zero DTE strategy but actually when I was coaching in Discord I couldn't get any trade filled so there's like an issue on sibo so whatever happened with that issue I couldn't get a zero DTE trade in I thought it was because of the liquidity and so it happens to be something else but anyways I decided to do a Friday trade so very often times guys you know I don't necessarily want to hold positions overnight especially big margin positions cuz they obviously make me a little bit nervous you know I just want to be a safe long-term investor anyways I decided to do Apple 167 sell put and I'm up I'm up about $50 so far apple is my biggest position I actually have it in this portfolio and I have it in this portfolio as well.

Invest with Henry,PboqMrQ7exY,2023-10-26T16:33:35Z,My Positions,Hershey's,"also Hershey's I am kind of short on Hershey's at the moment because Mr Beast Mr Beast has a chocolate company febles and he's getting a lot of views he's getting so many views on YouTube I actually think that his chocolate is going to take quite a bit of market share so I am short on Hershey's that's actually one of my high conviction plays right now and so far I'm up $593 I am bearish on this and I think you know I think what you can do is actually do a call Credit spread so let me just show you what that looks like you can go to Hershey's and then you can go to a trade Hershey's and then you can go to sell call okay you'll want to play this out maybe like three months out or so so January 19 2024 New Year's coming pretty soon so if you end up selling let's say you do 220 one of the bad things about Hershey's is that they don't have $5 spread so you're going to have to do a $1,000 spread which is a little bit riskier you know it's kind of a bit to lose but anyways here you get $68 you're risking 932 so this is about a 7% return yeah it's not a lot of money but 7% in 3 months is about uh 14 28% per year not bad you can definitely compound your wealth with 28% per year that is a pretty decent return",1.0,-0.8

Invest with Henry,tLCvwJaTSmc,2023-10-23T20:17:00Z,Billionaire Investor: Market Crash,S&P 500 / Spy ETF,"billionaire investor Leon cooperman says S&amp;P 500 won't hit a new high for years and housing prices will probably fall so today I want to read this article and I want to talk a little bit about the market because I get a lot of questions about where the market is headed and I think this is really interesting because Leon cooperman told insiders in an interview he thought the stocks were overvalued to some certain extent I've actually seen this in the portfolio where my portfolio has had some pretty rough days lately with the stock market going down and I'm sure you guys have also seen numerous red days in a row and the billionaire investor said that he didn't expect S&amp;P 500 to hit a fresh high for a long time now I'm going to discuss whether this is true or not if you look at the S&amp;P 500 that's basically the S&amp;P 500 ETF here the Spy I always looking at this it used to be my biggest position I have since gotten out of this and I have a big position on Apple you know it's obviously very important because whatever the S&amp;P 500 does it obviously has many components within it so if this goes up the rest of the market goes up you know it's kind of like a rising tide raises all all boats or a low tide you know lowers all the boats you know essentially cooperman said a rolling correction was underway in housing or house prices were likely to drop Leon cooperman said the stocks were overvalued overpriced and the S&amp;P 500 wouldn't Notch a fresh high for a long time I made my money being a bull but I find myself somewhat pessimistic at the present time now guys I feel kind of like that as well right now I am a little bit pessimistic on the market now also I do kind of you know lean on pessimism anyways because I want like protect myself and be conservative in general but I do have this feeling right now especially as a lot of you know even good companies are coming back down so more than a decade of near zero interest rates and uh gratuitous government spending have pulled gratus this is uh yeah I was more of a math guy uh driving up asset prices and running up the national debt he said ultimately the piper has to be paid you know here's the thing the the interest rates are no longer zero they've gone up quite a bit so we had a little bit of a pullback as well so things are looking a little bit better and if you look at you know statistics the market has pulled back 20 times since 1980 it's only pulled down 50% two times okay so you know even if this is a correction right now it's unlikely to get that much worse but at the same time I could see the stock market going sideways and that is possible you know let's say the next one year uh the S&amp;P is still around 421 now you know that actually wouldn't be bad for option selling cuz if you're selling options and you're collecting income from you know basically when the market does not move okay so if it goes sideways that's actually good for option sellers now if it goes down obviously we're going to get executed if we're selling puts so we will get assigned some shares but that's fine right for me dollar cost averaging is the best strategy especially dollar cost averaging into high quality companies so you know I would say that if we're dollar cost averaging into high quality companies that's fine over the long term because it's only a matter of time until the market does become bullish you know continuing cooperman predicts that the S&amp;P 500 which has returned at least 12% in five of the last 7 years would underperform for the next few years and not surpass its current record of about 4,800 points for a long time just because S&amp;P 500 doesn't um surpass this Mark doesn't mean certain stocks won't and also doesn't mean that certain stocks won't crash so there's still going to be a lot of opportunities obviously looking at some single stocks you know especially for me I think the tech stocks are going to outperform the General market it just because their gross margin is going up as well as their revenue and you know consolidation in the industry I mean these companies keep you know purchasing others and doing Acquisitions so the value does stray or the value does go to the top companies I mean that's true inequality basically in all areas of life not just money but uh the best results go to the few top people and that's just how it works so he said buying an index fund wouldn't be a winning strategy and investing would be more of a stock pickers game yes okay I am a big fan of actually stock picking although I've been in index funds for quite a time right now when I look at my portfolio I do have a lot more single stocks right like apple Amazon Microsoft little bit of meta so I have been more of a stock picker but doesn't mean I'm an active Trader okay there's a big difference all right I'm not actively going into the market and trying to pick that next winner right I've had a little bit of failure on Oatley and other uh stocks but very small positions my current position only is 19% not even 1% of my portfolio same thing with Neo small position but when I put big money to work it's going to be apple it's going to be you know the higher quality companies like there's Exxon Mobile okay there has uh been plays in my portfolio when I put big money to work it's almost always a big large cap company Blue Chip okay so the former boss of Goldman Sachs Asset Management arm who converted his Omega advisor's hedge fund into a family office in 2018 by the way family office is basically he's investing for himself and like private investors usually taking pretty big fees so even if he outperforms the market his fees are probably very very high so you just don't even break I mean you're still getting an S&P 500 return so doesn't always doesn't really make sense a lot of people look up to these big asset managers they typically underperform the market so honestly that's why you should learn how to do this stuff yourself and uh I do have a Discord Community obviously like I'm a coach and I get paid that way but you know if you take a look at it financial advisors are completely useless these hedge funds are completely useless so yeah I'm still being authentic that I you know I'm a little bit bias but I literally have the best program out there for you to learn how to trade and pick stocks yourself because that's what you should be doing you should be managing your own wealth you should not rely on financial advisers or anyone else or the news because the news gets paid based on views right so anyways pointed out there had already been a bare Market in the vast majority of stocks a handful of big Tech names including Tesla Nvidia and Microsoft have pulled the major indices higher this year but excluding the so-called magnificent 7 stocks are virtually flat right right so magnificant magnificent 7 is exactly what I am going for I think those are the best so let me just click this link real fast um magnificent 7 tech stocks okay Tesla Nvidia Tesla Nvidia are two stocks I'm actually kind of short on if you guys watch my last video had a lot of call Credit spreads actually on Nvidia you can see right here had a lot of expire because expiration was on Friday and as I making this video it's the weekend but Nvidia you know I have call Credit spreads and then Tesla what was Tesla uh I actually had put credit spreads on Tesla so I'm on the wrong side of Tesla because it's going down okay not good but I'm fan of the magn the Magnificent five okay English is kind of my first language I was born in America but I learned it simultaneously with Russian CU my parents my mom came pregnant from Eastern Europe and basically my parents spoke Russian at home because they didn't really know any other language and you know since my mom was with me and my dad was like mopping floors and working um at night at a restaurant washing dishes my parents never really got that good at um English even though you know they've been in America for 29 years now but still you know it was a big barrier for them because they had to put food on the table and you know many of you guys might be in a similar position where you're trying to take care of your family you're watching my videos because you want to be financially free and I just want to say that you're doing a fantastic job and you should hang in there because you're going to be successful you just have to keep your head in the game keep learning keep you know watching my free videos you don't have to join my Discord only if you want to only if you want that extra help but I'm here to support you sometimes I call this financial therapy because there's no right answers in the stock market if you watch all these videos like what's going to happen um up or down we really don't know but sticking to a simple strategy over the long term Works compounds your wealth and it gets you into a good place financially so I just want to say hang in there if you are making decent money but you can't save it that's why investing is important if if you're making good money and you are able to save it that's an even bigger reason you should be investing and if you're not making any money and you want to go full-time that's a tough position you know that's a desperate position I feel for you because I've had the same position I went through so many struggles in life I'm still going through so many struggles in life they're just not Financial I just want to encourage you that hang in there and this investing stuff really works it really works for the long term trust me all right so home values have been uh shored up by a decades long shortfall in the number of new homes built each year prospective sellers have also bed at listing their homes and taking on a new mortgage uh when 30-year interest rates are 8% that's true so basically his argument is that a lot of things are overvalued this is a uh you know cerman was recently published in a memoir titled from the Bronx to Wall Street so I wouldn't really look up to these investors these investors you know I want to throw out investors Loosely when you see someone on YouTube and hey I'm you know a little bit guilty of this too when you see anyone in in the media okay these investors so-called you know they are getting paid other ways this guy is mainly actually a sales guy so is Kathy Wood so is you know Warren Buffett these guys are excellent at raising Capital having large amounts of money where they take lots of fees okay same thing with with a lot of YouTubers right they're getting views and they're getting paid and then they have programs and look there's no good guys I'm also selling a program but at least I am 100% dedicated to delivering good results and I didn't do this because of money it just happens to be a byproduct of my passion and hobbies and helping other people it just a byproduct it wasn't my main goal to you know create some big you know Discord or anything like that from the get-go it was I want to help people all right and that was my goal but anyways I just want you to be cognizant of this because a lot of these guys that are saying they're investors it's Loosely right they're they're investors Loosely same thing with YouTubers they're saying they're Traders and they have 10 screens uh i' be careful I would really dig under the hood and ask yourself what is that person's motivation okay and I'm just kind of educating you here about everything life stocks investing you know because I think it's important I think the more you know about life the more money you will make unless you just throw all your money into S&P 500 which is also a good strategy like you don't even need me you don't need anyone you have completely yourself and if you throw all your money into S&P 500 you never have to watch another YouTube video again you can be done off YouTube and just put all your money in S&P 500 and that's going to do pretty well like the past 5 years it's up 58% I would encourage you to also do covered calls I think that would get you even better results selling puts but honestly if you keep it super simple I think you could do really well and I don't think this investing stuff is really rocket science it's just the function of time and that's like the most important thing that I learned in college was time compounding your wealth is mainly time and then the obviously the number you know the percentage return that you get but even a high percentage return is usually not that worth it if it's a lot of volatility I know I know so many many people you guys want to become financially free because you know there's pain points whether you have a boss or you're going to a job you know I I sometimes forget that feeling but I really hated coming to work like I was at Goldman Sachs in Los Angeles and the market opened at 6:30 a.m. in California some of you guys in actually many of you guys are in California many of my clients are in California but I'm not a morning person so it was really tough for me to manage my life and wake up early so I'll be honest with you like you know when I was working at Goldman Sachs it was a really tough time in my life like I learned a lot but at the same time I had some major issues I mean I'm we're still always evolving and improving in life emotionally physically and stuff and just coming into work was so difficult for me and by the sixth month I was working there honestly like I was coming into work late because I was I was so broke even though I was getting paid well to be honest I wasn't used to spending money so I wanted really cheap rent I got kicked out of my place that was not that far from the office and I had to move in with with with an ex-girlfriend of mine at the time I really didn't have a whole lot of savings I just had to really you know maybe I had some but I really couldn't spend it like mentally I was just such in a tough place with money even though I had like I don't know let's say 20 grand or something saved it felt like nothing to me it just felt like I don't know I was just scared of not having any money and living at home with my parents you know they're obviously from Eastern Europe and you know it's just not easy you know Soviet Union parents are really tough like emotionally so I was in a really rough place and I really needed money I so I decided that you know I was going to commute to to Goldman sacks I had to wake up at like 5:00 a.m. and I was just screwed like I just felt so so exhausted emotionally and one morning I actually almost ran someone over because it was pitch dark outside and they were crossing the street and I was like half asleep and I was like oh my gosh I could have killed someone and yeah it was just a really tough time for me and I think a lot of this pain really led me to realize that I just really wanted to focus really hard on money so I took it really seriously and you know luckily I continued to save money right I um started with $2,000 kept learning kept educating myself I read so many articles at Goldman Sachs and when I was reading articles there they were all just options and to be completely honest like I was a financial analyst and kind of a confession I wasn't really doing my work I didn't feel passionate about like looking at these billionaire portfolios or even someone that has like $50 million and the financial adviser was going on a meeting with them I felt like it was sort of like a scam like the financial adviser just collects like a fee he puts his money into like just random funds and then he just kind of has a meeting where he just like you know kind of kissing butt like how's it going and how are you and it's like just seems really fake to me so I really kind of felt attached to really like doing my work you know a lot of what I did was just research options I was really interested in options and I had the the portal to just learn so I learned not the strategies guys like the strategies are free on my YouTube channel right like if you watch my YouTube channel everything is free like covered calls Etc but where the real difference comes is like the management of the strategies like when do you roll when do you close how long do you hold a position and how do you like think about Delta and like these type of little things right they they matter they can make a really big difference and that's what I really studied when I was there I was looking at specific stocks and expiration days and what was working and I was super fortunate to have experience there obviously it's something that has really changed my life and yeah it's crazy how how fast time goes",0.95,0.0
Invest with Henry,tLCvwJaTSmc,2023-10-23T20:17:00Z,Billionaire Investor: Market Crash,Apple,"I have a big position on Apple you know it's obviously very important because whatever the S&amp;P 500 does it obviously has many components within it so if this goes up the rest of the market goes up you know it's kind of like a rising tide raises all all boats or a low tide you know lowers all the boats you know essentially cooperman said a rolling correction was underway in housing or house prices were likely to drop Leon cooperman said the stocks were overvalued overpriced and the S&amp;P 500 wouldn't Notch a fresh high for a long time I made my money being a bull but I find myself somewhat pessimistic at the present time now guys I feel kind of like that as well right now I am a little bit pessimistic on the market now also I do kind of you know lean on pessimism anyways because I want like protect myself and be conservative in general but I do have this feeling right now especially as a lot of you know even good companies are coming back down so more than a decade of near zero interest rates and uh gratuitous government spending have pulled gratus this is uh yeah I was more of a math guy uh driving up asset prices and running up the national debt he said ultimately the piper has to be paid you know here's the thing the the interest rates are no longer zero they've gone up quite a bit so we had a little bit of a pullback as well so things are looking a little bit better and if you look at you know statistics the market has pulled back 20 times since 1980 it's only pulled down 50% two times okay so you know even if this is a correction right now it's unlikely to get that much worse but at the same time I could see the stock market going sideways and that is possible you know let's say the next one year uh the S&amp;P is still around 421 now you know that actually wouldn't be bad for option selling cuz if you're selling options and you're collecting income from you know basically when the market does not move okay so if it goes sideways that's actually good for option sellers now if it goes down obviously we're going to get executed if we're selling puts so we will get assigned some shares but that's fine right for me dollar cost averaging is the best strategy especially dollar cost averaging into high quality companies so you know I would say that if we're dollar cost averaging into high quality companies that's fine over the long term because it's only a matter of time until the market does become bullish you know continuing cooperman predicts that the S&amp;P 500 which has returned at least 12% in five of the last 7 years would underperform for the next few years and not surpass its current record of about 4,800 points for a long time just because S&amp;P 500 doesn't um surpass this Mark doesn't mean certain stocks won't and also doesn't mean that certain stocks won't crash so there's still going to be a lot of opportunities obviously looking at some single stocks you know especially for me I think the tech stocks are going to outperform the General market it just because their gross margin is going up as well as their revenue and you know consolidation in the industry I mean these companies keep you know purchasing others and doing Acquisitions so the value does stray or the value does go to the top companies I mean that's true inequality basically in all areas of life not just money but uh the best results go to the few top people and that's just how it works so he said buying an index fund wouldn't be a winning strategy and investing would be more of a stock pickers game yes okay I am a big fan of actually stock picking although I've been in index funds for quite a time right now when I look at my portfolio I do have a lot more single stocks right like apple Amazon Microsoft little bit of meta so I have been more of a stock picker but doesn't mean I'm an active Trader okay there's a big difference all right I'm not actively going into the market and trying to pick that next winner right I've had a little bit of failure on Oatley and other uh stocks but very small positions my current position only is 19% not even 1% of my portfolio same thing with Neo small position but when I put big money to work it's going to be apple it's going to be you know the higher quality companies like there's Exxon Mobile okay there has uh been plays in my portfolio when I put big money to work it's almost always a big large cap company Blue Chip okay",0.9,0.7

the way family office is basically he's investing for himself and like private investors usually taking pretty big fees so even if he outperforms the market his fees are probably very very high so you just don't even break I mean you're still getting an S&P 500 return so doesn't always doesn't really make sense a lot of people look up to these big asset managers they typically underperform the market so honestly that's why you should learn how to do this stuff yourself and uh I do have a Discord Community obviously like I'm a coach and I get paid that way but you know if you take a look at

have call Credit spreads and then Tesla what was Tesla uh I actually had put credit spreads on Tesla so I'm on the wrong side of Tesla because it's going down okay not good but I'm fan of the magn the Magnificent five okay English is kind of my first language I was born in America but I learned it simultaneously with Russian CU my parents my mom came pregnant from Eastern Europe and basically my

washing dishes my parents never really got that good at um English even though you know they've been in America for 29 years now but still you know it was a big barrier for them because they had to put food on the table and you know many of you guys might be in a similar position where you're trying to take care of your family you're watching my videos because you want to be financially free and I just want to say that you're doing a fantastic job and you should hang in there because you're going to be successful you just have to keep your head in the game keep learning keep you know watching

answers in the stock market if you watch all these videos like what's going to happen um up or down we really don't know but sticking to a simple strategy over the long term Works compounds your wealth and it gets you into a good place financially so I just want to say hang in there if you are making decent money but you can't save it that's why investing is important if if you're making good money and you are able to save it that's an even bigger reason you should be investing and if you're not making any money and you want to go full-time that's a tough position you know that's a desperate position I feel for you because I've had the same position I went through so many struggles in life I'm still going through so many struggles in life they're just not Financial I just want

other ways this guy is mainly actually a sales guy so is Kathy Wood so is you know Warren Buffett these guys are excellent at raising Capital having large amounts of money where they take lots of fees okay same thing with with a lot of YouTubers right they're getting views and they're getting paid and then they have programs and look there's no good guys I'm also selling a program but at least I am 100% dedicated to delivering good results and I didn't do this because of money it just happens to be a byproduct of my passion and hobbies and helping other people it just a byproduct it wasn't my main goal to you know create some big you know Discord or anything like that from the get-go it was I want to help people all right and that was my goal but anyways I just want you to be cognizant of

screens uh i' be careful I would really dig under the hood and ask yourself what is that person's motivation okay and I'm just kind of educating you here about everything life stocks investing you know because I think it's important I think the more you know about life the more money you will make unless you just throw all your money into S&P 500 which is also a good strategy like you don't even need me you don't need anyone you have completely yourself and if you throw all your money into S&P 500 you never have to watch another YouTube video again you can be done off YouTube and just put all your money in S&P 500 and that's going to do pretty well like the past 5 years it's up 58% I would encourage you to also do covered calls I think that would get you even better results selling puts but honestly if you keep it super simple I think you could do really well and I don't think this investing stuff is really rocket science it's just the function of time and that's like the most important thing that I learned in college was time compounding your wealth is mainly time and then the obviously the number you know the percentage return that you get but even a high percentage

Invest with Henry,Hhj2H-rncig,2023-10-12T21:40:32Z,Poor Man's Covered Call Trade,Tesla,"I uh did the strategy quite a lot when um Tesla was going up in 2020 so I was leveraging my portfolio quite a bit so as you guys know if you watched um a lot of you know my videos you would know that um yeah I took like 100k to 700k with Tesla so I'm being like transparent honest that like uh I did go pretty heavy on one stock so it was definitely a risk and I wouldn't like really recommend that uh risk for everyone so something like Tesla is fairly expensive actually I just opened this position up today so that's so beautiful so a lot of people are trading Tesla quite out into the future this right here as you can already just see okay so controlling 100 shares of Tesla is going to cost $25,800 okay and for example buying this call option is going to cost $ 7,660 so it is a lot less that you have to put up it's in fact about 1/4 roughly 1/4 right cuz it's a little bit more than 1/4 it's like 30% so 30% of 258 is going to be like 7, 680 maybe 7 7680 or something like that so this is essentially about 30% so you're only putting up 30% and you can still so for example this basically counts as stock right so it's a long leap option and now I can sell like 30 days out for example like November 10th I can sell a 30 days out uh covered call so let's just say I'm going to go ahead and sell the 280 okay so if I sell the 280 boom now I can start making $800 pretty good so I can start making $800 on uh 7600 so that's like a 10% return in 30 days so that's how you can get some really juicy returns like 10% plus to be honest that's just the premium so if the stock actually Rises towards 280 again your 280 call is going to expire okay so it's going to be kind of you know gone on in in 30 days let's say the stock goes up to 275 this call option is going to gain a good amount of value so you're going to make 8005 Plus for example like this 210 uh call option so let me just show you actually you can see right here U basically it's going to look like this uh if it goes up to yeah like 275 you're going to have a profit of like $1,900 so you're going to make $800 off of the short call like fully in premium and then you're going to make another ,100 and just a value of the $210 long call that you have so that's how you can just you know make 10% from the short call um that you sell so the short call here is a 280 and then from the long call option it can go up in value so it can um you know Rise by like $1,000 so essentially yeah it says you can make a Max profit of 2180 um obviously that's like in the best case scenario like that's uh that's like amazing but even as it goes up you can see like even if it goes like up a lot you're still going to be up like $1,700 so this is a really good bullish strategy especially on stocks that you like long-term stocks",1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,CoOfyMTpHHQ,2023-10-05T20:47:26Z,HUGE SPREAD TRADE (Small Account Option Profits),Nvidia,I have call Credit spreads on Nvidia and this is probably one of my very favorite call Credit spreads. of course this is a call Credit spread that I opened up not that long ago on Tesla CRM and Nvidia let's just go over Nvidia first. as you can see I was very heavy on any video in fact I did 30 70 and 80 80 contracts in total okay this is 80 contracts which is quite a bit of money because if you'll notice these are all about 500 and this is actually a thousand dollars so this is a really big bet I mean I went like 50 Grand on call Credit spreads here so I was very very confident okay. so look Nvidia 560 570 calls this means that I have sold a 560 and then I have bought the 570. so the total that I collected right here is going to be 60 so I collected sixty dollars as my average credit and so far I have made 95 of the position 1710 now I could close out this trade but I'm not going to do that because it's going to expire pretty soon and although I made 95 I don't feel like paying any fees I'd rather just wait wait and make my ninety dollars which is almost guaranteed this is pretty much guaranteed position right here okay. now what this position is is betting that Nvidia won't rise in value past 560 per share that means that Nvidia could go up to 450 480 490 510 550 and it wouldn't matter I wouldn't lose any money because these are very very far out of the money okay. so you know take another example let's take you know Nvidia so let's just say you don't think it's going to go past 500 which telling you it's very unlikely because this stock is already pretty expensive you can take that to the bank I'm telling you the stock is overpriced anyways.,1.0,0.5

Invest with Henry,lovHAjsyJYk,2023-10-02T17:09:07Z,100X Your Money Using THIS Cheap Option Trading Strategies,Tesla,Alright now let's take a look at this Tesla Christmas tree now that I have opened up my account I'm up currently 261 thousand dollars on Tesla but I want to show you this small account strategy using Tesla now what we're going to do we're going to go to Tesla options so that's the first step now the first step to opening up this position is to sell a call option now I'm going to pick a date somewhere in the future if you're watching this in the future it doesn't really matter because this strategy is going to work the same whether you're watching this in 2022 2023 or Beyond okay so I'm going to pick an option that's about one month from expiration roughly four to six weeks is fine because when I stock consolidates it typically moves sideways for about three to eight weeks somewhere in that range so four to six weeks is going to be a good time period for me to bet that Tesla isn't going to have a whole lot of movement again this is Tesla so it is harder to predict because Tesla is a really volatile stock but again you can choose this strategy on a stock that you think is consolidating you can use technical indicators like RSI moving average or one of my favorites is Bollinger Bands so I'm going to click May 6 right now and for May 6 I'm going to sell the 1100 call option so step number one sell a call option now this call option that I'm selling is going to be the peak of my Christmas tree it's going to be the very Peak and if Tesla stops right around eleven hundred dollars that is where I'm going to see the biggest gains on this position but again I don't have to have this option expire what I can actually do is as my option approaches expiration say it's the end of April or even the beginning of may now the beginning of May it would be really close to this options expiration but let's just say a couple weeks has passed and the stock is trading for around eleven hundred dollars that's when this option is going to see a lot of gains even though it's not even that close to expiration so step number one is you want to sell a call option and again this is going to be the peak of your Christmas tree now I'm going to buy a call option now I'm going to buy a call option at 1080. that's because I think Tesla will stay above 1080 for the next couple of weeks and now what I can also do is I'm also going to protect this position by buying an 11 20. now you will see how this is going to end up playing out when I go over here and create a custom order but first of all pick a cell we pick the cell now we're buying a call option under this strike price so 1080 and now I'm going to buy a call option over the strike price at 11 20. so now I have completed this order the only thing that I need to do now is I need to go into this custom order section this is going to be really important because basically you need an equal amount of buys for each cell so you don't don't want a one-to-one ratio you want to click custom right here and because we have one buy and a second buy but we only have one cell this is not a balanced trade and as you can see it's going to be costing you a lot of money well I can imagine that many people do not want to pay eight thousand dollars to open up a position so instead if you end up selling two of these the actual cost of this position is going to go down to just 52 dollars so this is going to change by the minute however as you will notice about 33 to 50 bucks and our total profit is two thousand dollars so this is an extremely powerful strategy because you're only risking a little bit of money for a very very huge gain in fact right now as it currently sits it's 13 into two thousand dollars it's it's pretty insane but of course if you do go fill this I do want to say one of the issues is because you're dealing with four different options right now this is going to be a little bit more expensive than thirteen dollars I would imagine this is going to be about a 50 to 100 spread and now as I'm talking here at has actually said that the max loss is zero but again I think this is going to be about 50 to 100 if you're going to open up this trade so it's going to be about a 200 x opportunity so right now it's currently trading for about a hundred bucks so again 200x opportunity is what you can get with this position now let's talk about managing this position this is pretty much the most important thing so this position currently expires on May 6th the way you want to play this is basically if Tesla continues to trade within this range you're going to continue to have profit because you're paying very little money so even if Tesla is going to be right here around one thousand eighty dollars you're going to see a decent profit it Tesla goes beyond 1100 up to 1110 you're still going to see a profit as long as Tesla stays within this range right here in the next few days the next few weeks you're going to see a lot of profit and this position is going to move to a few hundred dollars worth of profit now you're not going to see a full 200x gain until you get closer into the May expiration at that point you can close this option for a potential thousand dollar gain or higher if Tesla is still within this range especially if Tesla's hovering right around 1 100 in this example however all you really need to happen is for Tesla to stay within this range so the most important thing on running the strategy whether you're doing it on Tesla or any other stock is to have a stock stay range bound now the way I would close this trade is I would set an expectation for hey I'm putting up a hundred dollars I want to leave this trade with one thousand dollars so that's probably what I would do however I would probably sell this stock at a 500 gain as well so if I see that the position is up five or six hundred dollars then I have five to six x my money at that point I typically like to sell and take a profit because the saying goes you never go broke taking a profit now for a lot of people it's really going to depend on how aggressive you are if your thesis continues to stay that I think this stock is going to trade within a certain range and it continues to stay right around the peak of this strategy then you can keep holding that position and keep gaining more money however if you feel there's a lot of volatility in the stock talk you have a big profit on your hands and you're scared to lose that profit I would just say don't get greedy take a five or six x return you have seen how to place the trade but there's also a lot more factors you need to know to make money from this trade the trade profits as expiration day approaches if the price lands within a range near the sensor strike price the most important thing is you pick and forecast a Target price you believe the stock will land on at some point in the trade because I don't hold this position until expiration it's only important the stock approaches the top of the profit chart at some point in the future but doesn't have to end there that's because when I open this trade my goal is to close the trade when the stock moves toward the strike that I sell in the example we sold 1100 strike so basically the stock really has to do nothing for a few days and the position will see a nice profit even if the stock moves up a bit then down that's still fine as the position will see daily profits if the stock stays within a tight range so so this first strategy is really for when you see a stock consolidating and not having much movement this typically happens after earnings has come in and there isn't much more news expected on the stock. All right so now we're going to go back to Tesla I want to show you a slight variation of this strategy and how you can actually bet on the stock doing something very specific if you get that right you can again see a five to 200x on your money so right here as you see as I'm even making this video Tesla is moving closer to eleven hundred dollars per share so if I actually opened up that first position that I was showing you guys I would already have a gain on my hands of about 10 because the stock is moving up towards the price that I believe it's going to be around but what I want to show you specifically is say as an investor you actually believe that Tesla is going to go up to twelve hundred dollars per share or you have a very specific view on a certain stock well what you can do is you don't have to sell a call option right the money you can actually sell a call option for the exact price that you think the stock will end at so let's say that we believe that Tesla is going to end at 1 200 per share that is going to happen by May 6th or actually let's say that it's going to happen at next earnings and let's say next earnings are sometime in June so let's say that June 17th will capture earnings so now what we're going to do is we're going to pick June 17th now we're going to again go to sell call option and say that you think the stock is going to end at 1 200 what you're going to do now is you're actually going to sell the 1 200 call option because that is going to be the top of your profit chart so selling the 1200 I'm going to go a little faster I'm going to buy the 1150 and now I'm going to sell two strike prices above as well the 1250 and again one important thing is I need to go right here into the contract ratio click custom and I'm going to sell two call options to match each of the call options that I'm buying this strategy now costs 295 dollars however it can bring in a total of five thousand dollars worth of profit or about 4 700 after you account for the money that you're paying so now the top of this strategy G is actually going to end when Tesla is one thousand two hundred dollars per share so if your Target price is 1 200 you don't have to bet at the current level you can actually set up the strategy for anywhere that you wish and the way that you control this is by picking the strike price and selling the strike price that you believe the stock will end that on expiration or sometime in the near future so basically right here I sold it twelve hundred again over the next few weeks if Tesla goes up towards this price and it goes up right here that's actually going to be a very big profit it currently says one thousand dollars but if this happens in a short amount of time and this position can be up actually two or three thousand dollars and you don't even have to get into June 17th or wait for the option to expire you can always close this option for a profit as long as the stock is moving in the direction of the peak of your strategy strike price.,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,lovHAjsyJYk,2023-10-02T17:09:07Z,100X Your Money Using THIS Cheap Option Trading Strategies,American Airlines,I like using the strategy on Blue Chip stocks that have predictable charts one of these stocks which is super cheap is AAL or American Airlines. Let me show you a quick example so you can see this very cheap option trading strategy in action. All right so the next stock that I want to talk about is American Airlines because this stock if you look at the chart it has been a pretty steady stock so over the past three months it's basically up 0.86 percent it has done absolutely nothing for three months if I look at the one year it has gone down about 21 however typically within a three month time period this stock really doesn't do too much so if you take a look it's been 22 dollars on June 22nd and now if I go to about November which is five to six months this stock is still at 22 so it didn't do anything for five months now again if we take a look from about late November it's been about 19 and currently sitting about eighteen dollars so this stock really doesn't have a whole lot of movement it seems that investors are trading American Airlines in a very tight narrow range so at any given one month or two month period this stock doesn't really do too much which is a fantastic candidate for the same strategy that I was just showing you however there are a few key differences with American Airlines now the main key difference is that American Airlines is an 18 stock and not a one thousand dollar stock that is actually an advantage in some regards and also a disadvantage in other regards let me go over an example so again I'm going to go for an option that's going to expire on May 6 because it's about five weeks away and I just mentioned a stock like American Airlines isn't having that much movement in a single month so the first thing that I'm going to do again is I'm going to sell a call option I like to go for at the money call options so right now I'm going to sell the 18 strike price it is just slightly in the money with American Airlines trading at 18 and eight cents now what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy I'm going to buy the 17 dollar a call option and now I'm also going to buy the 19 call option so now you'll notice again that I have a total cost that is pretty significant it's 145 dollars which is kind of a lot for a very cheap stock so what I'm doing now is I'm going to go to contract ratios so whether you're doing this on Robinhood or a different brokerage I do recommend Robinhood they do give you some free stocks I'm going to put that in the description but it doesn't matter which brokerage that you use it really doesn't as long as you're following what I'm doing step by step in your brokerage so click custom order or make a custom order where you're selling the equal amount of shares that you are buying or the equal amount of contracts so I'm going to sell two 18 contracts now the total cost is only 14 if I scroll down right here we can turn about 15 into a hundred dollars which is basically an 85 dollar profit this is over a 6X return this 6X return Can Happen by May 6 or by about one month from when you're watching this video and you open up a trade just like this however again I want to caution you that you're usually not going to see the full 6X because there's a few factors at play one of the factors is there's bid in ask spread costs that you have to account for and the second thing is that typically this stock is not going to end right at the very top right at 18 in this example you're typically going to have the stock and somewhere between this range but also you're typically or you actually should close the position before expiration because as expiration approaches this option position becomes very volatile however as long as the stock stays within this range in a few days pass a couple weeks pass this maximum loss of 15 will start to go up because these options will start having a very high probability that they will end Somewhere In the Zone and because they're going to end somewhere in the zone you are going to start seeing a profit so you might turn 15 into 30 or 45 dollars so you may get a two or three x gain and at that point I would look into selling this position for a profit and getting rid of it early because with this type of strategy you really want to manage it you want to keep your eyes on the profits and if you see a 2 to 5x profit you really want to get out of the trade before it can go south on you,1.0,0.8

curious how much do you think I'm using I said 500k but I'm not fully sure so I'm going to do some rough math right now on screen and you tell me before I do this math how much margin do you think I'm

so I'm going to go right here I'm going to go to my total Equity if you'll notice right now there's 1.24 million in spy 159k here so when I combine that that's about 1 Point 4 million okay and the rest is not too much but let's just add 100K here so that's about $1.5 million okay so 1.5 this is another six grand this is probably a few more thousand but here we go we have another 16 and 9,700 this is not that much let me just get to the big dog let me get to the position where it's going to be clear that I'm using margin and here it is here's a very clear position I have 20 cells QQQ 301 this right here is a $600,000 position which already puts me at $2.1 million okay this position this option itself is already proof that I'm using margin I already have more invested okay but that's not it I'm still using more okay so I still have another big position I know somewhere on spy right there okay so 15 contracts times about 400 is another $600,000 okay this is you know maybe 500 so I just did the math it's actually $582,000 that already puts me at like 2.6 million so I'm already at 2.6 and granted I don't have that much more I still have some more options that I'm using margin on but I think overall the number is$ 2.7 million and I only have an account of $266,000 and by the way this year has gone phenomenally I'm up $200,000 10% in the past 3 months so that's going really well but 2.7 / 2 is essentially about 35% margin so the safe amount of margin to use in my opinion is about 30% now where did I learn this so actually I didn't really learn this from Goldman Sachs or my education I was actually reading a research article by Yale economists that were basically saying that since markets go up over time and especially every 10 to 15 years the market is almost never down even if you pick a random rolling 15-year period throughout history even the worst time like 1929 when there was like a Great Depression you are still up over 15 years and for that reason if you're not retiring and literally 1 2 3 or 4 years and you have some time Horizon it is silly not to use margin because the market rises in fact the market is basically always going up and I just wanted to pull up this image just went online right and I went up to 120 year history of the market since 1896 as you can see there are some really hard periods of course I mean one time there's a 25-year recovery which I guess contradicts the 15 years that I just talked about but the thing is this means that you never added another dollar but if you did some dollar cost averaging even if you put 50 bucks a month right something super small you would average your cost a lot lower and you would break even a lot faster than 25 years so even the worst period is likely less than 15 years if you were dollar cost averaging and I am not factoring in also using options for hedging which we're also going to talk about in this video I'm not factoring ENT in in creating income with covered calls or selling puts to get in or dollar cost averaging so the truth of the matter is even in some of the worst times like even during 2008 and by the way I'm going back to 1929 this is literally 100 years ago if you look at anything in the past 50 years the longest recovery is literally just 6 years and if you're dollar cost averaging using options to hedge the true amount of time it is to recover is like 2 years or less I mean for me I was investing very risky during 2020 I had a whole lot of Tesla I was not following any safe risk management practices and I was not following a lot of rules that I'm going to discuss in this video and that I teach my clients at the moment I was just basically 100% Tesla and it was kind of dumb but at the same time I did a lot of research and I was very confident that Tesla's going to rise I mean I was very certain on it and I was willing to take a risk and I guess my risk paid off okay it was a little bit dumb but also I did my research and that's that's kind of the moment that was the season that I was in in my life I wanted to be more risky but even though I had a lot of Tesla and during 2020 we obviously had you know the pandemic and everything we had a huge crash and my portfolio must have lost a quarter million dollars in that same year I actually made all of it back it was incredibly easy because well the market recovered and as soon as it shifted I made so much money using options so even if the market ends up pulling back you can make it all back if you know what you're doing all right so we discussed that I'm using 35% margin okay but how do you manage margin how do you you know put it to work well here's the thing you want to pick high quality stocks to use margin with that's pretty obvious now my number one rule is I don't really buy options and I'm certainly not going to buy options using margin it's completely silly so when you're buying options you're essentially already making a leveraged debt because well check it out let's go to spy as an example okay okay so trade spy options all right so check it out if I buy a call option say that I go out 7 Days okay a call option basically means that I get to own a 100 shares and bet that it's going to rise and I get to pay a fraction of the cost so for example if I bought 100 shares this would be $41,500 now most people don't have this laying around even if they're doing pretty well even if they have a successful business they're an older guy you know 50 60 and they have a million dollar portfolio they still might can have $41,000 just laying around so option buying is very attractive but you know the whole point is that it's already leveraged so right now I can buy this option for $231 and I can essentially own a 100 shares which is $40,000 worth okay so with a small amount of money I am controlling a large amount of shares now I can lose a whole $231 here the entire amount that I pay for this option okay so using margin to buy op options is silly because it's already leveraged why would you use more leverage to be using more leverage okay",1.0,0.0

leveraged why would you use more leverage to be using more leverage okay a lot of people ask me you know do you like trip X leveraged ETFs and my answer is no I don't like using triple leverage ETFs I don't think you need to use leverage to get rich okay but I do think that you can use margin safely to get rich and the example that I give is if you have a business Say a pizza shop okay and you have a line out the door 50 people and you're making awesome pizza neopolitan or deep dish Chicago i' never been to Chicago one day I want to go if you're from Chicago you know maybe we can have some pizza but you know I also plan to visit New York so if you're from New York maybe we can also have some pizza but let's just say you have a pizza shop and there's 50 people out the door and you only have one oven you are crazy not to borrow more money from the bank let's say you're completely completely broke still crazy not to borrow money to open up a second oven come on now you have a line out the door so it is going to be a good move to borrow money which is essentially margin and what you're doing with real estate if you don't own your house and you have a mortgage you're also using margin people use margin every day in their life they just don't realize it in business and real estate and mortgages you are nuts not to take a loan and to open up a second oven so you can make more pizzas and serve more of your customers and that's the same exact way that I see margin trading if you can use margin to basically make more money safely and you know that you're going to make that money then of course you should use it but you should not use it on buying strategies because buying strategies are already leveraged and they are in fact super leveraged because you're only spending 231 to control 40 Grand and that's why there's a huge risk and that's why people that buy options typically lose I mean I think 80% of option buyers lose and all my clients come to me saying I bought options I had lots of success my first month and my second month was a big loss and I lost everything I made plus some more and I'm not surprised it's because it's basically a casino and that's exactly what happens when you play Blackjack you might win a few hands then you might lose a few hands and then by the end of the night you kind of realize well I lost more than I made so what strategies am I using well I am actually selling puts on margin you probably already realized that because as you can see I currently have American Airlines where I sold a put option at 13 I have Alibaba where I made $184 I sold the 87 put at the moment again if you're watching this in the future what I'm teaching you doesn't change so you can watch this anytime in the future and still have the same benefit Disney I literally opened up a Disney position today in my Discord because you know I got a question about it and Disney is not really profitable because the implied volatility is low but guess what because I'm selling a put option out of the money on a safe stock using margin it's free so I don't really care if I make 35 bucks on $99,000 because the 9,000 is free it doesn't cost me anything thing and the reason for that is because when I sell a put option it's an obligation in my account but it's actually not shares so I don't have to pay any interest because all I'm holding is a put option that I've sold it's an obligation but at this point in time it's not actually in my account it's just an IOU or a contract that says I will take your shares if those shares go down so yes I'm ready to buy them and I'm ready to buy them on margin and sure I will pay interest if I do get put to shares however that that's where we're going to talk about rolling but first of all you know going back to Disney it's very easy it's a no-brainer I'm selling something for 9,000 yes I'm only making 35 bucks but if I know my chances of making that 35 bucks is like literally 95% and even if I do get put I like this stock and I can start running the wheel strategy which I recently made a video about I'm going to link it in the description super important to know the wheel because I basically run the wheel using margin but if I get put not a big deal I'm going to run the wheel strategy but guess what usually I don't even get put because I'm using technical analysis to know where the stock would be cheap essentially where is their support for the stock if the stock goes to this level it can happen but it would be very unlikely and if I'm at a risk to get ass signed I'm going to roll the position down I'm going to roll away from the strike price and go back into my safe territory okay...",1.0,0.0

Invest with Henry,Yd9FwDjG8zo,2023-09-26T23:45:09Z,SPY Spread Trading - Examples of Credit Spreads Delta,SPY,I'm going to be talking about spy in option trading. The Spy is a very good ETF it has broad Market exposure so if you check out the sectors that's within the Spy they have technology Financial Services consumer defense utilities and basically everything. I want to show you an example of how I would trade spy options. ETFs like spy are typically highly liquid which means there are many buyers and sellers in the market. 30 days is a very good expiration day for spy. Spy is basically you know the top ETF because you know it's the S P 500 it's the most standard it's what everyone judges themselves against. If I just show you an at the money put uh by the way at the money just means that the current ETF value is 430 and something really really at the money would be you know 430. There's a lot of liquidity for spy. If I go to the charting feature in Yahoo finance and I just you know pull up spy. Here's spy it's at 4 30. It's actually the opposite there's a chance there's a 14 chance that spy will be at 410. This is exactly how I would be trading SPY and specifically I would be looking to yeah collect about 10. Chances of spy go going down to 405 is obviously less than the chances of spy going to 410. By selling out of the money options on spy and using credit spreads that is a profitable strategy.,1.0,0.9

interesting indicator and you should not use it in and of itself by itself but if you use it with other technical indicators then it is a very good indicator to take look at for the strength of the stock whether it's falling or if it's you know overbought or oversold that's what this indicator is supposed to do it's supposed to tell you specifically like for example if we take a look right now and we look at Nvidia and it's at 42 42 is actually not that bad so basically the stock is going down from 474 down to 425 42 means that we're not necessarily like oversold but we're getting into a better territory for a better entry into Nvidia stock now if this was 80 that means that would be overbought and we did see that it was around 80 right here but you know it has short-term pullback here because it hit 80 and uh you know it stayed pretty high honestly it stayed pretty high again it was really high right here and then recently with the peak it almost went back to uh it went to around 80 right there at 474. now it's at 42 which is actually a pretty decent sign if a stock ever hits like 20 that's an indicator of being oversold you know that's basically a signal to buy the stock okay that that's the RSI it's very simple and if it's between 30 and 70 that's pretty normal if it's above 80 it's like whoa this is a stock that you have to sell and if it's below 20 this is a stock that you have to buy okay that's basically what that indicator is saying my very favorite indicator is still going to be the Bollinger band I've mentioned this over and over many many times but if I actually zoom into a three-month chart right now you can see that the Bollinger band is this Orange Lines here and what it's trying to say is what is normal statistically okay so if you're a man that's five foot ten and you have a son your son is going to be about five foot ten okay that means that that would be at the zero of the Bollinger band okay literally zero all right if your son is five foot seven that would be one standard deviation or one pulling your band down okay that would be like somewhere around here this is two standard deviations okay like if I go right here all right this is two certain divisions two certain deviations for example in human height would be about three inches okay so if you're five foot ten that means your sum would be five foot four it's possible but it's very unlikely right something probably had to happen maybe the nutrition is what was off right now on the flip side if you're five foot ten um six foot one six foot four six foot four would be literally uh two certain deviations on the high end so that would also be unusual your son was significantly taller than you now obviously that's depends on genetics that depends on your um on your spouse but still you get the point that with human hype there's a tendency right we have an average height of five foot ten all right what I'm the average myself that's what the bull in your band is trying to say it is what is average okay like if I go to India and I pick out a person a man on the street and ask him his income um it's going to be it depends on the city but it's going to be twenty thousand dollars if that man says four hundred thousand dollars that's not even two standard deviations that's like five standard deviations okay that's going to be like really really unusual okay but if I pick someone that's twenty thousand dollars that's probably gonna be right around the middle so that's what this Bollinger band is trying to say is trying to say statistically based on volatility where's the stock likely to be within and as you can see right now that Nvidia is going towards the bottom of its Bollinger band again that is fairly unusual it was at the top and then it swung back down so it's pretty interesting in technical analysis terms uh it was reaching 80 and then kind of the stock fizzled out and now it's it's at 41. so overall this is a really good indicator and the Bollinger band for me basically tells me where I should buy and sell a stock but also really dictates where I pick my strike prices for my options so for example if uh if the stock is this high and I mean it has been pretty high so that's why I have been doing Nvidia call Credit spreads I mean you can see right here I have two call Credit spreads so one is at 560 570. and I went pretty heavy here honestly my Discord Community I went pretty hard here on Nvidia I ended up doing 30 contracts and 40 contracts so I usually don't do that I really want to be cognizant of fees especially for students because obviously there's fees and then when you are opening 70 contracts it's quite a lot of money but you know you know Robinhood the platform I'm using again I'm not biased I don't really care what brokerage people use get that question a lot it doesn't really matter a brokerage is a vehicle gets you from point A to point B so I don't really mind if you're driving a Toyota Honda or a Ferrari to work I just want to make sure that you get to work on time right if you're an employee or if you're an entrepreneur I want to make sure you get to your destination and video right here is uh is it easy call Credit spread so I did a 565 70. I also did a 585.85 this is pretty interesting you know why did I go a thousand dollar spread here and a five dollar spread here the fact of the matter is you're always compensated with options so if you are doing a 500 spread versus a thousand there's just pros and cons there okay the Thousand you can lose a little bit more money you can lose a full thousand dollars versus Five Hundred however it's a little harder to lose that full thousand dollars because the stock has to go a bit farther in terms of direction to actually lose that thousand so it's always like an even Money Trade if that makes sense to you so basically let's say that on a 500 spread you're getting paid fifty dollars you know for five hundred dollars of risk if you're doing a credit spread you're making 50 you're risking 500. on the thousand dollar spread you may make ninety dollars but you're risking a thousand and you might say to yourself well I'd rather 50 on 500 than 90 on 1000 but that doesn't really work out that way because what if I said that the chances of that 50 to 500 is a 10 chance right that's a 10 chance of you losing money right that's a pretty even trade right there right because if you lose 10 of the time you would lose that entire 50. so that's even money you you win 9 out of ten you lose one you lose it all right in this example the 90 out of 100 what if I said that it's 50 50. so you only lose once but then you win five times or that would actually be 400 dollars and 500 so you'd still be negative but what if I said you win eighty percent of the time right now all of a sudden you would be fine losing that thousand and making that 90 because eight times the ninety dollars is going to be 720 so you're gonna win 720 uh you know that many times so you see how it really depends now obviously I didn't prepare for this video I don't really script my videos I just talk on the cusp I don't practice because I've been doing this for such a long time and I like to be authentic and transparent so I don't really prepare things but even if I gave an extreme example and say that you won 99 of the times on that trade of the thousand dollar spread obviously would be better so you really want to play around with probabilities in Delta I could talk more about Delta if you want to video on that just drop me a comment down below but Delta really is obviously important now I'm talking about too many topics here today let me go back on the technical analysis topic right now that's Nvidia I just finished exploring my Nvidia position and exploration just happened I did extremely extremely well because the market is down quite a lot you know in the past week but I've done extremely well been very happy and fortunate actually and that's going to be Nvidia Tesla Shopify any Tech stock tech stocks have so much movement so you know whether you're going to be a Buy and Hold investor which is fine I mainly am or you're going to be more on the swing trading side there's a lot of money to be made if you understand technical analysis"",",,,

Invest with Henry,8yQ4qfTzAZ8,2023-09-17T14:48:36Z,Technical Analysis For Beginners,"""excerpt"": ""Now I also want to talk about Tesla um I just want to do the same thing honestly RSI I'm going to show one more thing on on Tesla I'm going to do RSI all right I'm also going to do the Bollinger band and then I'm also um going to introduce moving average all right so moving average I also use macd's a little bit so definitely a lot to cover so let's just do step by step okay now we're 10 minutes in please bear with me so the Bollinger band right here is just showing you again where Tesla's likely to trade and it's very rarely that a stock pulls out of the Bollinger band it's typically based on a pretty big event or some news or a really big earnings Miss and honestly stocks do move a lot based on earnings so if it beats earnings or loses in earnings and you know they report a a loss that wasn't expected you know the Market's all about expectations so if a company is doing really well but the market was expecting it to do really well then that Stock's actually not going to go up just because it has good numbers doesn't mean that the Stock's going to go up and we've seen that many times companies report really nice numbers yet the stock doesn't really rise anywhere and that's because the stock market is an expectations game so when the stock is um well when everyone's opinion is on a stock that it's good and it's good that just is what it is but if everyone thinks it's good and it turns out bad that's when the stock actually has a big movement so it's when someone is shocked right it's kind of like the muscle if you are going to the gym and you're just lifting a tuna can right you're not going to build any muscle but if you're uh you know lifting something pretty heavy and you're shocking your muscle you're shocking your system and you're pushing yourself to a new limit or you're doing a brand new exercise you're going to see some transformation in your body because your body is adapting to the the stimulus that you're putting on it so the same thing with uh with the stock market okay and that's why like I said the Bollinger band is trying to measure tendency central tendency okay most of the time stocks are not reporting earnings they're not having some really big news events that's why they should be staying within the Bollinger Bands in this scenario 95 of the time okay because the two standard deviation will in your band is capturing 95 of the data okay so 95 of time you should be good and I do tell students sometimes that if you want to go even safer okay so let's say that you have a bit more money that you're managing and you want to be super safe or you're like newer to Trading and you're like oh I really don't want to lose any money and I'm fine making a lot less right now you can even go three standard deviations okay three standard deviations would completely open up the Bollinger band more and you see how it has uh expanded right here so in terms of technical analysis you can go a lot safer with it or you can you know go riskier you can also go shorter terms so I recently made two trades on Shopify and apple where I made a ton of money and I'm going to talk about Apple in just a moment but you can even go shorter terms so I mean I'm going to be honest I don't really do this myself but obviously I know how to do it and when I was working at a hedge fund in Philadelphia the main guy who's managing it was about nine billion dollars sounds like a lot but um you know it's just a big company I was working at PNC actually it was a subdivision of PNC so the PNC bank right he was managing a ton of money and the guy had some type of certification from like Harford home technical analysis so he was really really into it you know we can look at candles so you can even look at five day candles you can see how um how they move however for me I think that there are kind of useful especially when you see like a lot of momentum but I wouldn't necessarily count on short-term candles because they can be good I guess if you're really paying attention to the market very closely but just in my experience like I've I've been around so many different companies and I've talked to different Traders and I do remember that I visited New York City many times I used to work there for uh six months I worked in New York City and I've met so many people that have their little own home offices right um well in like you know when you go to a place and there's like many like office uh spaces that's what I'm trying to say it's like a small small space there's many Traders and I was the kind of guy that uh and I would bother them I would uh not bother them but I have met a lot of different Traders because I was super curious I was always trying to learn new things I was always trying to network that was really important for me and I've talked to many traders that um were doing this full-time it was like a little office little room in New York City where you like rent it probably cost like three thousand dollars just to rent a little room nowadays but um I would talk to them and I would ask them like their strategies and what they were doing obviously they were super busy so sometimes they would uh just kind of like tell me to leave but at the same time you know like you gotta take some risk and you gotta go out of your comfort zone and I've talked to some some guys that were doing candlesticks and um I didn't really have anyone tell me that uh that is their like Secret Sauce they would just say yeah I use this in conjunction with they would always say I use this with something else okay so I think it could be really interesting uh specifically if you see like a gap up okay that's the most common thing if you see a gap up oftentimes it could gap down all right that's what they say but then in all in all reality if you think about it if everyone's just following a certain indicator and uh if there's a gap up and now everyone thinks that there's going to be a gap down well that indicator is not going to be as useful it's kind of like if there is a Uncharted Island okay and we know that there's Gold Everywhere it's worth a trillion dollars and it's only one square mile okay it's a square mile so like that's that's you know that's a really small place well if everyone knows about it everyone's gonna go ahead and start digging gold there and then there's not going to be any more gold to dig so you always kind of have to be on the cusp and adjusting with your trading and that's why when I use technical analysis I use it in conjunction with option analysis I use it in conjunction with fundamental analysis and again that's what I'm actually going to be covering in The Bootcamp that's the first link in the description I'm going to be covering not just technical analysis but also fundamental analysis I'm going to tie it all together I'm going to tie a lot of technical things together they're not super technical but I also want to cover uh dollar cost averaging and I want to cover a financial modeling so Financial modeling is when you actually look at the cash flows so I kind of consider that technical analysis it's fundamental analysis but nonetheless it's analysis that no one really is doing on YouTube everyone's talking about oh this Stock's going to go up because of the Innovation but how about we like talk about what the Stock's actually worth how about we talk about the cash flow how about we see if it actually has a competitive Advantage there's there's many things to to look at at a stock and there's also some other indicators that can be really interesting like the ichimoku cloud okay this is something that to be honest I don't use on a daily basis but I have seen it use and I know how to teach it and how to how to use it this cloud is actually really interesting to take a look at and it basically tells you where stock is again likely to trade all of these indicators are trying to see if a stock is a you know above a certain range or below a certain range if it's in the middle it it tells you some information on how to make a buy or sell decisions but um in all reality I like to have a scorecard I like to have a scorecard of moving average of RSI a Bollinger band I can throw ichimoku cloud in there I don't because I've not seen it in practice but in fact if you if you take a look at Yahoo finance I'm going to be covering a lot of these things actually in the boot camp there's a whole lot of stuff there's an alligator there's an ATR band uh you know there's beta there's obviously the Bollinger band there's a center of gravity there's a lot of indicators now obviously I'm not going to cover all them because quite frankly I don't think all of these are useful the more you start to over analyze the worse it gets so my scorecard I like to keep it simple I like to have about five different indicators that I'm looking at and the higher that they get like the higher my scorecard is the more conviction I have to continue to dig into the stock and do some fundamental analysis on and that's when I start making decisions like that's when I get into an Nvidia position and exploration just happened I did extremely extremely well because the market is down quite a lot you know in the past week but I've done extremely well been very happy and fortunate actually and we've had a crazy good amount of success on PayPal PayPal is something that I've used more fundamental analysis on I've taken a look at the price to earnings ratio just absolutely looks amazing PayPal as a company just has really good you know balance sheet they have a good cash flow statement they're just fantastic overall this company is probably my highest conviction play and we ended up doing really well on PayPal I have one two three PayPal but I also I had more up the four positions on PayPal but I just had a lot that just expired on on Friday because I'm making this video over the weekend just amazing overall company and in apple again you know if I take a look at Apple and I want to quickly take a look at not just the you know each local Cloud which would probably take a very long time to kind of explain here again it's all about tendency and signals but uh I want to show you basically the Bollinger band because I I think this is the my favorite one and just overall Apple has gone very low I mean just very low it had a huge pullback now luckily I avoided this pullback I actually avoided it and uh I traded it very correctly and then recently I just jumped in I have a whole lot of shares of Apple a lot of shares I'm going to show you the position real fast and a lot of this was based on short-term technical analysis which again I'm going to teach I don't teach it on YouTube because it is kind of it takes a quite a bit and the video would be like an hour long and I don't think anyone wants to really watch an hour it's a little too much detail and uh you need a long attention span the stock has gone down a lot I have quite a bit of money at the moment in apple and uh my options have all expired but I've been let me actually show you instead of just telling you let me show you so on Apple you can see I've sold puts I've sold calls I've sold another put another call and I made a really interesting swing trade it where I yeah I just made the difference here because I was owning apple and I got out of it because uh I saw there's a little bit of a breakdown in its technicals so it went from 182 down to 176. I didn't own it I sold it okay so you can see it sell first at 182 and then I bought it back in at 176. so on 3 000 shares that's about eighteen thousand dollars and along the way I was also um collecting uh looks like I made about 420 there on a swing trade I've been swing trading a little bit more lately all right so I don't necessarily like love swing trading for for most people because again I'm traveling the world as you can see I'm filming in a hotel I've been to Latvia Sweden now I'm back in Poland but um I don't like to swing trade often because it does take a little bit more energy and time I like to trade for consistent safe passive and stable weekly and monthly income but I'm not gonna lie swing trading can be really good and I've done quite well on Apple as well as Shopify we had a really good trade in the community like I made six hundred dollars on Shopify and uh let me actually just wrap up real fast with that with Shopify I want to show you how technical now this can really give you some good results especially on something like Shopify because when implied volatility is high and you see a stock like swinging up and down this is in theory pretty bad if you're a stock investor but it's really good if you're an option Trader okay so if you can catch uh swings of a stock and you're actually you know having some buy strategies you know you guys already know I like sell strategies but I actually entered a bull call spread and that thing printed money 600 in three days so now as you can see you know it might be coming down and one of the signs is going to be a momentum actually this is a good time to do the the cloud you want to see if it's coming out of the cloud if it's going to stay within so this is quite complicated and that's again why I'm doing the technical analysis boot camp because uh this stuff you want to really understand you probably do need to spend a little bit more time on it but you can see how it's shifting so much and there's you know there's a lot of buy and sell signals here I'd simplified by getting rid of these other so if you can go right here you can see that there's a baseline a leading spanner a leading span being a lagging span okay I do get rid of these so I have a clearer picture of the stock but as you can see if you look at different indicators there's a whole lot of entries and exits into a stock so if you want to be more of a swing Trader which sometimes I do I have signals where I swing trade you can do really well especially on something that has good volatility and that's going to be Nvidia Tesla Shopify any Tech stock tech stocks have so much movement so you know whether you're going to be a Buy and Hold investor which is fine I mainly am or you're going to be more on the swing trading side there's a lot of money to be made if you understand technical analysis"",",,,

I didn't own it I sold it okay so you can see it sell first at 182 and then I bought it back in at 176. so on 3 000 shares that's about eighteen thousand dollars and along the way I was also um collecting uh looks like I made about 420 there on a swing trade I've been swing trading a little bit more lately all right so I don't necessarily like love swing trading for for most people because again I'm traveling the world as you can see I'm filming in a hotel I've been to Latvia Sweden now I'm back in Poland but um I don't like to swing trade often because it does take a little bit more energy and time I like to trade for consistent safe passive and stable weekly and monthly income but I'm not gonna lie swing trading can be really good and I've done quite well on Apple as well as Shopify we had a really good trade in the community like I made six hundred dollars on Shopify and uh let me actually just wrap up real fast with that with Shopify I want to show you how technical now this can really give you some good results especially on something like Shopify because when implied volatility is high and you see a stock like swinging up and down this is in theory pretty bad if you're a stock investor but it's really good if you're an option Trader okay so if you can catch uh swings of a stock and you're actually you know having some buy strategies you know you guys already know I like sell strategies but I actually entered a bull call spread and that thing printed money 600 in three days so now as you can see you know it might be coming down and one of the signs is going to be a momentum actually this is a good time to do the the cloud you want to see if it's coming out of the cloud if it's going to stay within so this is quite complicated and that's again why I'm doing the technical analysis boot camp because uh this stuff you want to really understand you probably do need to spend a little bit more time on it but you can see how it's shifting so much and there's you know there's a lot of buy and sell signals here I'd simplified by getting rid of these other so if you can go right here you can see that there's a baseline a leading spanner a leading span being a lagging span okay I do get rid of these so I have a clearer picture of the stock but as you can see if you look at different indicators there's a whole lot of entries and exits into a stock so if you want to be more of a swing Trader which sometimes I do I have signals where I swing trade you can do really well especially on something that has good volatility and that's going to be Nvidia Tesla Shopify any Tech stock tech stocks have so much movement so you know whether you're going to be a Buy and Hold investor which is fine I mainly am or you're going to be more on the swing trading side there's a lot of money to be made if you understand technical analysis"",",,,

Invest with Henry,8yQ4qfTzAZ8,2023-09-17T14:48:36Z,Technical Analysis For Beginners,"""excerpt"": ""I recently made two trades on Shopify and apple where I made a ton of money and I'm going to talk about Apple in just a moment but you can even go shorter terms so I mean I'm going to be honest I don't really do this myself but obviously I know how to do it and when I was working at a hedge fund in Philadelphia the main guy who's managing it was about nine billion dollars sounds like a lot but um you know it's just a big company I was working at PNC actually it was a subdivision of PNC so the PNC bank right he was managing a ton of money and the guy had some type of certification from like Harford home technical analysis so he was really really into it you know we can look at candles so you can even look at five day candles you can see how um how they move however for me I think that there are kind of useful especially when you see like a lot of momentum but I wouldn't necessarily count on short-term candles because they can be good I guess if you're really paying attention to the market very closely but just in my experience like I've I've been around so many different companies and I've talked to different Traders and I do remember that I visited New York City many times I used to work there for uh six months I worked in New York City and I've met so many people that have their little own home offices right um well in like you know when you go to a place and there's like many like office uh spaces that's what I'm trying to say it's like a small small space there's many Traders and I was the kind of guy that uh and I would bother them I would uh not bother them but I have met a lot of different Traders because I was super curious I was always trying to learn new things I was always trying to network that was really important for me and I've talked to many traders that um were doing this full-time it was like a little office little room in New York City where you like rent it probably cost like three thousand dollars just to rent a little room nowadays but um I would talk to them and I would ask them like their strategies and what they were doing obviously they were super busy so sometimes they would uh just kind of like tell me to leave but at the same time you know like you gotta take some risk and you gotta go out of your comfort zone and I've talked to some some guys that were doing candlesticks and um I didn't really have anyone tell me that uh that is their like Secret Sauce they would just say yeah I use this in conjunction with they would always say I use this with something else okay so I think it could be really interesting uh specifically if you see like a gap up okay that's the most common thing if you see a gap up oftentimes it could gap down all right that's what they say but then in all in all reality if you think about it if everyone's just following a certain indicator and uh if there's a gap up and now everyone thinks that there's going to be a gap down well that indicator is not going to be as useful it's kind of like if there is a Uncharted Island okay and we know that there's Gold Everywhere it's worth a trillion dollars and it's only one square mile okay it's a square mile so like that's that's you know that's a really small place well if everyone knows about it everyone's gonna go ahead and start digging gold there and then there's not going to be any more gold to dig so you always kind of have to be on the cusp and adjusting with your trading and that's why when I use technical analysis I use it in conjunction with option analysis I use it in conjunction with fundamental analysis and again that's what I'm actually going to be covering in The Bootcamp that's the first link in the description I'm going to be covering not just technical analysis but also fundamental analysis I'm going to tie it all together I'm going to tie a lot of technical things together they're not super technical but I also want to cover uh dollar cost averaging and I want to cover a financial modeling so Financial modeling is when you actually look at the cash flows so I kind of consider that technical analysis it's fundamental analysis but nonetheless it's analysis that no one really is doing on YouTube everyone's talking about oh this Stock's going to go up because of the Innovation but how about we like talk about what the Stock's actually worth how about we talk about the cash flow how about we see if it actually has a competitive Advantage there's there's many things to to look at at a stock and there's also some other indicators that can be really interesting like the ichimoku cloud okay this is something that to be honest I don't use on a daily basis but I have seen it use and I know how to teach it and how to how to use it this cloud is actually really interesting to take a look at and it basically tells you where stock is again likely to trade all of these indicators are trying to see if a stock is a you know above a certain range or below a certain range if it's in the middle it it tells you some information on how to make a buy or sell decisions but um in all reality I like to have a scorecard I like to have a scorecard of moving average of RSI a Bollinger band I can throw ichimoku cloud in there I don't because I've not seen it in practice but in fact if you if you take a look at Yahoo finance I'm going to be covering a lot of these things actually in the boot camp there's a whole lot of stuff there's an alligator there's an ATR band uh you know there's beta there's obviously the Bollinger band there's a center of gravity there's a lot of indicators now obviously I'm not going to cover all them because quite frankly I don't think all of these are useful the more you start to over analyze the worse it gets so my scorecard I like to keep it simple I like to have about five different indicators that I'm looking at and the higher that they get like the higher my scorecard is the more conviction I have to continue to dig into the stock and do some fundamental analysis on and that's when I start making decisions like that's when I get into an Nvidia position and exploration just happened I did extremely extremely well because the market is down quite a lot you know in the past week but I've done extremely well been very happy and fortunate actually and we've had a crazy good amount of success on PayPal PayPal is something that I've used more fundamental analysis on I've taken a look at the price to earnings ratio just absolutely looks amazing PayPal as a company just has really good you know balance sheet they have a good cash flow statement they're just fantastic overall this company is probably my highest conviction play and we ended up doing really well on PayPal I have one two three PayPal but I also I had more up the four positions on PayPal but I just had a lot that just expired on on Friday because I'm making this video over the weekend just amazing overall company and in apple again you know if I take a look at Apple and I want to quickly take a look at not just the you know each local Cloud which would probably take a very long time to kind of explain here again it's all about tendency and signals but uh I want to show you basically the Bollinger band because I I think this is the my favorite one and just overall Apple has gone very low I mean just very low it had a huge pullback now luckily I avoided this pullback I actually avoided it and uh I traded it very correctly and then recently I just jumped in I have a whole lot of shares of Apple a lot of shares I'm going to show you the position real fast and a lot of this was based on short-term technical analysis which again I'm going to teach I don't teach it on YouTube because it is kind of it takes a quite a bit and the video would be like an hour long and I don't think anyone wants to really watch an hour it's a little too much detail and uh you need a long attention span the stock has gone down a lot I have quite a bit of money at the moment in apple and uh my options have all expired but I've been let me actually show you instead of just telling you let me show you so on Apple you can see I've sold puts I've sold calls I've sold another put another call and I made a really interesting swing trade it where I yeah I just made the difference here because I was owning apple and I got out of it because uh I saw there's a little bit of a breakdown in its technicals so it went from 182 down to 176. I didn't own it I sold it okay so you can see it sell first at 182 and then I bought it back in at 176. so on 3 000 shares that's about eighteen thousand dollars and along the way I was also um collecting uh looks like I made about 420 there on a swing trade I've been swing trading a little bit more lately all right so I don't necessarily like love swing trading for for most people because again I'm traveling the world as you can see I'm filming in a hotel I've been to Latvia Sweden now I'm back in Poland but um I don't like to swing trade often because it does take a little bit more energy and time I like to trade for consistent safe passive and stable weekly and monthly income but I'm not gonna lie swing trading can be really good and I've done quite well on Apple as well as Shopify"",",,,

Apple's actually one of Warren Buffett's biggest Holdings and one of the biggest ones is Warren Buffett I really want to pay attention to this because Warren buff is the only person that actually has a significant amount of money in apple and there's a really key difference between Warren Buffett and the rest of the managers and again that's incentives. Warren Buffett has a totally different incentive structure and that's why he's so heavy on Apple because it's the most obvious play. I have a lot of Apple Amazon Google.

I bought Amazon for 132.89 and I ended up selling 135 dollar call options so what that means is I have the shares the call option that I sold means that I will have to sell my shares at 135 but I'm happy to do that because the stocks that 13 32 and if it goes to 135 I made a profit plus I collected income right here I made money on the stock and I'm up overall on my options. For example Amazon at 135 I'm pretty happy of course it's higher so I may have to roll it but you know we'll see we'll see what happens there.

(NEW Strategy),PayPal,PayPal is actually another big name I've seen it on YouTube everywhere I am very bullish on PayPal PayPal is literally one of my very favorite stocks right now because it is at a 52-week low all right and because it's at a 52-week low I looked at the price of sales ratio and price to earnings ratio actually PayPal has a very very good solid PE ratio it's actually around 17 while the S P 500 is around 20. so in my opinion even if the bridge just kind of gaps from 17 to 20 this stock is over undervalued by you know roughly 20 or so so I think this could be easy a 72 dollar per share stock now of course if you go to YouTube and you type in PayPal you're going to see that this stock is a hundred dollar per share our stock all right people are going to say it's a hundred dollars and I've seen those thumbnails everywhere right breaking news hundred dollars uh this is actually more realistic actually like um that these guys are saying 63 dollars but you know hundred dollars you know way too aggressive my price Target is actually 73 that's actually really really accurate,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,_O3wn7E1uRQ,2023-09-07T15:15:03Z,Strategies Only Top 1% Options Traders Use,Tesla,all right so for you guys I'm going to do a real life Call example I'm going to be selling a covered call One Call option on Tesla stock so I'm looking at the option chain this is called an option chain I'm going to look at October 23rd and um actually they have earnings this week on Wednesday so I don't want to sell a call option that is near the money I want to sell an option that is very far out of the money I'm going to click sell call and essentially what I'm going to be doing here is going back to the exit strategy that I was talking about when you sell a call option once it hits your strike price that call option is going to be called away from you the stock is going to be called away from you 100 shares of that stock in fact are going to be called away so I don't want to sell something near the money because I don't want to exit Tesla at 435. just in case Tesla runs up I want to make sure that I'm going to be selling at a much higher price I'm going to scroll up and I want it to be at least ninety percent my favor this strike price of five hundred dollars is way out of the money it's very far away from the current price of 432 dollars in fact it is 70 away or for 100 shares that's going to be 70 times 100 or about seven thousand dollars so I wanna earn at least seven thousand dollars this week and if I don't earn that that's totally okay but I'm not ready to sell Tesla until it reaches 500. that's what I'm saying here so I'm gonna click 345 or 343. I'm gonna click continue and guys I have the stock I have a bunch of shares of the stock so for me selling one call option it's being covered by the shares that I hold so what I do here is I click one and here we go 3.45 345 I'm putting it because here is the bid and here's the ask 3.45 is the lower end it's the bid 3.5 is the ask so I'm going for the bid and me talking so much I just lost five bucks 3.4 and I want to get executed here because there's only seven more minutes until the mark closes so I'm just going to place this trade in real fast here we go yep that is totally okay they're just saying you're agreeing to sell 100 shares of Tesla 500. see I told you guys it's 100 shares you know that though you know that I'm not gonna play here what happens there is you collect 342 dollars right there on the spot and I opened this up because I was waiting for a whole lot of time I was like any second now I'm gonna go over this when am I gonna get filled finally got filled anyways the volatility is very high on Tesla specifically because they have earnings this week and options are priced based on volatility which is how much a stock moves up and down as well as how much time is left and now this option is trading fairly expensive I mean that's a lot of money to be made for an option that is so out of the money I mean it's 90 chance not likely to reach this point but there's still a lot of Premium because of earnings so earnings during the week of earnings stocks have a whole lot of volatility because a lot of surprises may happen and investors know that so for Tesla I sold the call option that is very far to the money because I want to be safe and I do not want to be executed but I want to collect some premium so I hope this example was helpful for you,1.0,0.6

Invest with Henry,1m_Hw0PVL6w,2023-08-28T21:30:32Z,25X Your Money With These Cheap Option Trading Strategies,Palantir,let's first of all start with palantir I want to show you something really interesting and really new so with palantir what I'm looking at right now is an indicator that ichimoku cloud and essentially palantir has been inside this Cloud for some time now of course if you're watching this video in the future you can still apply the same principles of these three strategies that I'm going to show you today to the Future Okay so taking a look it's inside the cloud and for me what that means is it's likely to continue trading within a specific range so I've done a lot of research into palantir obviously it is a good company Long term but in the short term I do think it's going to stall out and specifically if I go to the indicator RSI we're also going to take a look that the RSI is somewhere in between 20 and 80 so you know I believe that balancer is going to stall out for the short term now if a company like pouncer is going to stall out there's actually a phenomenal strategy where you can make tons of money and I mean 25x return so let's open up this position it's going to be a little bit complicated and I will warn you that this strategy is a bit harder to manage there's a whole lot to it however if you get it right obviously there is some really really huge rewards so what I'm going to first do is I'm going to go to uh cell I'm going to sell a 15 call option now what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy a call option I'm going to go down lower okay so I'm going to go down into the 13 and a half strike right here and I'm also going to go up into the 16 strike right here now this is going to look a little bit weird weird because the position setup is not ready and basically what I'm doing right here is this 15 strike is actually the anchor it's the top of the Christmas tree if you will it's the very peak of where you think this stock is going to trade and I picked 15 again because when I look at the technical analysis I really think that balancer is going to stay within the cloud right now so if I go to custom order and I go to customize you want to make sure that you have an equal amount of cells for each buy so I'm going to have two cells and then obviously there's a buy 13 and a half and then they buy at 16. now you'll see right here that the return potential is pretty interesting at 66 dollars but the maximum loss is 84. now I didn't necessarily expect this because typically you want a really favorable risk to reward ratio here so all that means is I'm going to move up and I'm going to play around and you'll see that you can actually do a lot of playing around with this strategy now if I go to 14 and a half you'll see now how and let me actually take this 16 down to 15 and a half you'll see now that I can turn ten dollars into forty dollars you know eleven dollars into thirty nine dollars and that's basically by playing around and getting more specific with where the stock is going to end okay the more you open it up of course um you know you have a more a certain return because uh it's going to be wider here your green profit zone is going to be higher but if you want to make a bigger bet on a very specific price Target then uh the return can be you know really really large and specifically again turning ten dollars into forty now um with this strategy if you're turning ten dollars into forty once per week I mean that's turning uh ten dollars into 160 once per month and you know in just two months you're gonna be well into turning ten dollars into three hundred dollars so I'm just saying you're not going to have the ability to perfectly do this it takes some management because essentially you're not always going to close here at the peak I mean that's pretty silly you're not going to be able to do that but in one year here if you are doing this strategy properly there's some really huge returns that can happen especially if you are right about your technical analysis now of course you're going to want to use multiple indicators you know that could be the Bollinger band which I teach on this channel all the time and RSI and specifically the cloud that I'm showing you right now so in one year this strategy could take ten dollars into 250 dollars and essentially you're aiming for a profit area right around here right at fifteen dollars but even if balance your stays currently where it's at you're going to see a pretty handsome profit of around 20 bucks and then even if it overshoots a little bit you're still going to see you know in 25 area 20 worth of profit so you're going to see some really good profits as long as it doesn't go outside this area of 1540 on on the break even and then 1460.,1.0,0.6
Invest with Henry,1m_Hw0PVL6w,2023-08-28T21:30:32Z,25X Your Money With These Cheap Option Trading Strategies,Neo,now the next stock I want to talk about in the next strategy is going to be uh Neo so taking a look at Neo Neo is actually in a very interesting position because uh the stock has gone up a lot um you know in terms of the shimoku Cloud it's been above the cloud for for a long time and for me it's had a recent pullback and now it's still it's still above so what I think is going to happen here is that Neo is going to stay and it's a bullish trajectory I think Neo is going to continue to go up and uh for this reason it's actually a very interesting trade so if I go to uh trade Neo options I'm going to show you a very interesting uh put combination okay this is going to be a put combination now let's just say that we're going to go out a little bit further in terms of dates okay you don't have to do short-term trading I'm a fan of weekly trading but I'm also a big fan of monthly trading I think if you are getting either one down the time period isn't as important because you know whether you're making easy income you know per week or per month it's still the most important thing is still making income on a weekly or a monthly period and in my personal opinion is as an option Trader it's just very important for me to be profitable it's important for me to aim for the proper profit Target I want a good really good payoff and then you know really important I want to make sure that I'm being smart with my risk management because if you don't have the proper risk management you end up losing a bunch of money I mean that's no good right rule number one is don't lose money so let me go ahead and go into a sell put option to get started here again this is going to be a little bit complicated but just follow along okay take some notes so check it out I think that Neo is going to go up it has a bullish skew to it and I think that the momentum is going to rise in the next uh you know roughly two weeks again you can apply the same principles and the same logic into the future with other stocks if you wish but you know for me it's pretty clear that Neo is uh is a pretty good stock in the short term I expected to go up about a dollar so I think it's going to end at roughly 12 dollars per share so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to sell a put option here and then again I'm going to go ahead and uh you know buy some things around this area that I'm creating so uh the 12 strike I'm going to go ahead and buy 11 and then I'm gonna go ahead and buy the 13. I'm just gonna play around with this because one of the keys here is you want to make a custom order you want to obviously have uh you know two cells for each box Ai and as you can see right here this is an even more favorable trade I mean yes you're betting on it really ending towards 12 but I mean just check it out 17 turning it into 83 dollars uh you know the return here is basically a Forex return in 11 days so you know obviously you can turn ten dollars into you know some insane amounts of money even with small amounts of capital if you're right on the strategy multiple weeks in a row now I will say that this strategy is a lot harder to scale up and my bread and butter is still going to be selling posts covered calls in the wheel which I cover on this channel all the time but a strategy like this is really ideal for small portfolios that have a lot of certainty and if you pick the right stock and you're really certain about a uh the direction of the stock and a specific price point you don't have to be exactly correct obviously again you're not going to sell it at 12 per share um you know that might not happen because that's kind of like a lottery ticket but if it starts to go up towards expiration here you're going to see a really nice profit I mean if you're up forty dollars you put in 17 you're up you know basically more than 2x then this makes sense to cut the position early I mean if in two days you double your money I would be cutting this position I don't have to hold until expression now if it is going up though and I think it's going to continue going up and it's going to go towards my um you know my Max profit right here my expected profit uh the maximum amount of 83 dollars if it's in this range and I'm up seventy dollars that's even better right and even if it overshoots that's cool now of course if it's going to the opposite direction and it happens you know after three four days I would not want to hold this position until expiration because then I have a risk of losing this entire amount that I'm putting up and if I see 50 decline nine dollars I'm going to cut the position but more often than not if I did my homework correctly and I see this uh position going up you know I'm risking nine dollars because I'll have you know I don't want to say stop loss because I don't love stop losses but I'll manually take a look at this position and if I'm down about nine dollars I'll end up closing it right if it goes down but if if it goes up I'm only going to take profit if I'm up 20 or even forty dollars so my risk is roughly nine dollars but my reward is roughly 40.,1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,1m_Hw0PVL6w,2023-08-28T21:30:32Z,25X Your Money With These Cheap Option Trading Strategies,Tesla,now the third strategy that I want to go over is going to be on Tesla Tesla is a really popular stock of course and if I take a look at the cloud here uh Tesla is on the bottom range so it's a little bit you know potentially going to be bearish I don't know if it's going to break trajectory or not um you know if I take a look at some other factors so let me get rid of the cloud I actually want to take a look at the Bollinger band which is a very common metric that I use the period is going to be 20 days okay this is standard and the standard deviation is two okay two make sure that's that's really important okay but that is the standard on Yahoo finance so you'll notice right now that uh Tesla's actually in the middle of its Bollinger band I mean it's right in the center so again I think the stock is gonna end up going sideways and you know one of the most perfect strategies to run is going to be the iron Condor strategy now if you focus here I think this is one of the best strategies that you can use ongoing because the first two strategies are quite hard to manage except um this third strategy that iron Condor is not that hard I think it's literally one of the best so the way I typically start an iron Condor is I go to sell a put option okay I'm going to go out for uh you know there's nothing wrong with doing 30 days to expiration or even more than that so I'm gonna go to October 20 okay I'm gonna pick October 20. um again if you're watching this in the future not a big deal I like to go for a monthly iron Condors monthly spreads you know nothing wrong with that it actually gives me um less to manage and you know managing strategies is really important how you manage a position makes you know the biggest difference between getting good returns and getting you know not so good returns and going 30 days out lets me actually relax monitor the position and um you know just make sure nothing goes wrong but in most cases I just wait until expiration I just let it expire now just notice right here the bottom of the Bollinger band is 243 so that's going to be my strike selection okay so in terms of picking a strike and expiration day okay I'm you know expiration day 30 to 60 days out is fine but you know taking a look at the strike price 243 I mean right here simple as that okay the Bollinger band is doing it for me so 243 is the bottom of the Bollinger band okay it's quite interesting actually because uh let me actually just refresh here I don't know why this says 260. something's really weird so let me go ahead and refresh this real fast because I have a feeling that the 243 is uh is incorrect so I'm going to refresh the screen right now and yes that was indeed correct okay so 215 is actually what I'm looking at okay that's really important you don't want to just look at a chart and say hey that's what it is you also want to verify refresh obviously so 250 and I knew something was wrong there so 215 okay I'm going to go down to 215 if I expand 215 you'll see that the Delta is 0.27 so 27 Delta implied volatility is 55. that's really good you know anything over 40 is high obviously you don't want to go above 100 that's too high but 55 very good and the volume is 244. really good open interest as well and the bid ask spread is is very tight on on Tesla so that's a good thing right I'm looking for a tight bit aspect the wider this is you know the more money you're really losing to slippage right so I'm going to start off with selling the two 215 here now this strategy is selling the 215 and then I'm just going to go ahead and buy the next leg down which is going to be the 210 so I'm going to go ahead and buy the 210. this is just a put credit spread an iron Condor was just really a combination of pokeret spreads and color credit spreads so 215 210 now I'm going to go ahead and you know sell a call option all right so I'm going to go up for the call option and let's just take a look at the Bollinger band again the top is 264. so pretty easy I'm just going to go for 265. uh 33 Delta is a little bit High here but again um you know that's the Bollinger band The Bollinger band is based on statistics so I'm going to go ahead and sell the 265. then I'm going to go ahead and buy the 270 now I want to discuss the risk and return okay so the max loss is only 227 okay but the max profit is 273 so you have a very favorable profit to loss ratio and honestly if a Tesla bounces around in this green zone then it doesn't matter you're going to see a you know a profit on your hands and the only way you would see a loss is if it went down below 212 or above uh 267. now the iron Condor strategy is one of my favorite strategies because you know the market could go up it can go down you're still going to be making money what's also really important about taking profit on the iron Condor is if it's in the green area you don't actually need to take profit you can just keep waiting because as you wait time Decay and Theta keeps eating away at the option and making your position more profitable so you can wait until expiration now if it goes out of hand and it hits one of your um Break Even points right here then you have to make a really big decision do you want to close this position because you can ask equals this position and see a small loss because that's much better than you know seeing momentum really go you know to the downside or really to the upside and then you end up losing the full amount that you pay so for me I am a big fan if I see the momentum shifting and it ends up in one of these red areas I'm going to be looking to cut this position actively and I'm going to again be using my technical indicators to see should I cut my losses or should I keep holding this position and hope that it goes back into this green area and of course in this green area I don't even need to take profit because I just wait until expiration,1.0,0.7

I mean you got to be kind of insane like you have no Financial education if you're watching other YouTubers they're like oh buy Nvidia like please unsubscribe to those YouTubers they don't know what they're talking about I know Nvidia is innovational and I know they're in AI I don't care if the p e ratio is bad it doesn't matter okay I don't care you can't be making these silly mistakes following people and videos going to the Moon I'm gonna buy some call options yeah if you buy some call options your pocket's gonna be hurting real bad okay don't do that if anyone tells you Nvidia is a good stock they're not investors they're not investors okay it just doesn't make sense okay valuation's off now prices sales 45 like come on now I've been using options 5 software and it is literally screening Nvidia as a call Credit spread now they're saying 550 555. the fact that call Credit spread is screening well for NVIDIA more reason to believe because this is you know based on AI I actually contributed a little bit to this algorithm looking at Nvidia right here easy easy money call Credit spreads anyone who's buying calls yeah have fun burning your money on fire okay just have fun so Nvidia way overvalued okay I'm selling call Credit spreads I'm profiting on Nvidia you can actually see in this portfolio I probably still have more Nvidia yeah I do actually I sold the 600 and 605 call Credit spread this is a strategy that you guys should be implementing right now,1.0,-0.9

Invest with Henry,99HEWl3itfE,2023-08-22T22:40:13Z,Iron Condor Option Strategy For Beginners,Netflix,now I'm going to open up Netflix I think Netflix is one of the best stocks to do an iron Condor strategy specifically if I look at the last one year return this stock has been going up a lot but if I look at the short term time frame like three months there is some very good setups for an iron Condor specifically for example if you were to open up an iron Condor on June 12th you could have waited up until August 12th right two months and this stock basically went nowhere now again if you're watching this in the future if a stock is going nowhere an iron Condor strategy can fit very well for this specific stock it can also fit very well for very volatile stocks such as Tesla so first of all let's just go over this Netflix example okay okay Netflix I'm going to go to trade and Netflix options okay I'm going to tell you where this strategy is profitable so we know that Netflix has been kind of bobbling back and forth at the 412 dollars per share so it's not really going um up a lot it's not really going down a lot this is a really good setup so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pick a 30-day option again I do like 30 days out that makes this position um very easy to hold you don't have to do too much you just open it set it and forget it now check it out we don't think that the stock is going to go up too much it's been going sideways you still want to build in some security that's why you see me moving up okay I'm moving up because to set up this trade right now it's at 412 dollars I'm going to be setting it up a lot higher so if I go to 440 you will notice that this right here has a Delta of 0.27 right so this roughly has a 27 chance of happening and the premium here is very solid 640 dollars okay the implied volatility is 32.93 that is pretty high it's not exorbitantly high it's the point where this is very very dangerous but it's also not low because if it's too low then really there's not that much money to be made because low volatility is usually low premiums and we want to have some good premiums to collect because in this first scenario right there's two scenarios we're going to do a credit iron Condor and then I'm going to show you a debit iron Condor okay so this credit iron Condor I'm going to start off by selling the 440 okay I'm going to sell the 440 right now and then I'm also going to buy an option okay so if we were just to sell the 440 that is risky right that's a whole lot of unlimited upside you see the max losses unlimited we don't want that okay what we want to do is we want to go ahead and buy an option okay so 440 we're going to sell and notice this right here 640 is expensive so we're going to sell expensive and buy cheap so sell expensive buy cheap so we're going to be spending 545 dollars but we're collecting 640 and bada bing bada boom we've already gotten started on collecting about 118 dollars but that's not it right we want to go back and now we want to sell some put options okay we've sold call options now we want to sell put options all right so we're going to go down again I want to look for around 27 Delta okay so that's a little too far down I'm gonna go to 380 here 19. let me go a little bit higher to 385. this is a 22 Delta now it is okay to go a bit lower okay in fact the lower Delta you go the safer that this trade becomes okay a 22 Delta nothing wrong with that now we can talk about uneven iron Condors but you know let's finish this example first I'm going to sell the 385 all right so I'm going to be selling 385 and then I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to buy the 380. so right now you'll see that I'm going to buy the three um the 380 strike right here again good implied volatility 36 I'm going to go ahead and buy this now you'll see that the full iron Condor is made okay look at this the profit Zone okay it's between 385 and then it's going to be on the high end 440. so as long as the company stays here right as long as the stock bounces back and forth you're going to actually realize 220 dollars of profit okay you are going to collect this right away this does enter your account right away a lot of people ask me you know is this money that I've made yes it's money that you've made however this position will be open in your portfolio and the only way to manage this position is by waiting until expiration so that means that you're going to be waiting 31 days now whenever close the position early in most scenarios I would not close it early unless it goes very into the Red Zone okay that means they would fall below 382 even below 380 here if it was hovering in this area yep you would want to close so you don't realize the full loss and the same thing on this side but in general you know terminology here if we were to stay in between I'm not going to touch it I'm going to sit put and collect my full premium of 220 even if it's bouncing around really close to the edges here profitability as long as it's profitable I'm not going to worry about closing this position okay so in this position right here you want the stock to stay the same.,1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,99HEWl3itfE,2023-08-22T22:40:13Z,Iron Condor Option Strategy For Beginners,Tesla,now we can pick a very volatile stock all right so if we look at my portfolio right now I'm positioned very safe now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to something like Tesla Tesla is a really good example of a stock where you may want to be buying iron Condors because the trend for Tesla is very unpredictable it'll go up a lot and then it'll go down and then up a lot and this stock does have some really big swings I mean if I go to the one-year chart this stock is swinging hard okay so buying an iron Condor or a debit iron Condor is going to do very well in fact you can see right here I am having a partial iron Condor that I've sold it's a call Credit spread right here I'm up 600 now let me show you what that's going to look like okay so we're going to be buying an iron Condor now this is going to be a little bit different okay it's going to be a debit when I'm buying an iron Condor I want to bet right at the money like really really close so here's what I'm going to do all right it's at 232. I'm going to be buying the closest to the money option here so 235 I'm gonna buy because I think it can go up or it could go down a lot so I'm going to buy this all right now I'm going to sell right very similar except now I'm buying the more expensive one I'm gonna sell the less expensive one so instead of paying all this money I'm gonna you know subsidize my car it's going to be a lot cheaper so it's gonna be a lot cheaper right now you see I have a Max loss of 225 now my Max profit of 275. so many of my students are very successful with this strategy because you know although I'm not a fan of buying strategies you can have a really good return and it gets a lot better so if I go to buy uh put option okay so now we're going to also buy a put option all right so let's say that I want to buy you know let's just say we're um we're a bit more uh bullish okay so we're going to go ahead and do the 235 we're going to go ahead and buy that and then we're going to go ahead and sell um the 230 okay so you'll see right here that this is an iron Condor but it is a little bit different because it's going to look like a straddle in fact to make it look like an iron Condor actually I would have to not do the 235 I would have to do something like the 230 you know not much of a difference I'm going to do the 230 and then I'm going to go ahead and sell the 225 that is going to look like an iron Condor okay so right here you'll see that there is an area here where um you know I can lose money but then again um I'm gonna I'm gonna change this by the way this right here expects a little bit of a move okay so if you move a little bit to 240 boom you're already profitable boom you're already profitable okay so the risk reward here doesn't look good but it is in fact good because it's going to move One Direction Another and it's very easy for it to move quite a bit down or quite a bit up in such a short amount of time now if you want a true iron Condor okay you want it to be you know a lot more aggressive you want to put up very little Capital here you could do something like you know you can buy something really out of the money okay so you know this would be a very big swing you know 53 volatility here on this option all right then you're gonna go ahead and sell the 190. you can see here now you're getting a much more favorable uh risk to reward ratio on paper okay on paper not in actuality because all trades are actually even money okay so if you're getting a higher return in most cases it's a higher risk but let me go ahead and let me do uh 260 here that's really out of the money okay you do the 265. now you'll see that I've manipulated my risk to reward ratio by a lot okay I'm getting a really big profit small loss but doesn't necessarily make this position big uh better because in this scenario now the stock really has to move a lot okay so it is really a trade-off do you need a stock to move up a whole lot up or down or do you need to move up or down just a little bit to realize a smaller profit okay so this is up to you this is how I would do iron condors,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,kDUjv1QU0_I,2023-08-18T13:47:48Z,I SOLD EVERYTHING,PayPal,so the first thing I want to talk about is Paypal just a recent stock that I ended up selling some put options on PayPal is just basically at a 52-week low so if I take a look at this stock I mean it's come down from really big highs I mean this stock was over 300 per share now after hours you can see that it's down about two percent at 57.47 so you know this stock is at a 52-week low it's not near it's at like literally today is the 52-week low so this is one of the most important things to really uh pay attention to if I go to the one month chart you can see here just absolute uh chaos and the RSI is 30. now if I end up going to indicators and adding a Bollinger band I'm going to be using the 20 um day Bollinger band and two certain deviations um you know the Bollinger band it just kind of uh expanding here that's because the stock is likely to you know potentially move down further because of where the Market's momentum is so looking at 57 and a half we could potentially see 54. now what I'm going to be doing is I do have PayPal sell puts but a cell put and a covered call both those two strategies my number one strategy is to deploy really in any Market environment so you can see here I sold a 57 and a half giving myself some cushion we're about to blow past that we're about to be below 57.5 as of the pre-market as I'm recording this video right so that's you know not the best territory now what would I be doing though right now if I didn't have this cell put because since I have this I'll put I'm going to leave it alone but generally speaking I'm running in the money covered calls okay usually we're selling out of the money covered calls you know we're going to give ourselves some capital appreciation potential with the stock rising and we're going to be collecting premium but now guys it's the time to to really be aggressive to sell 50 Deltas to sell 45 Delta heck maybe even 55 Delta in the money covered calls so let me show you what that looks like on PayPal specifically at 57.48 if I go to trade PayPal options and again we're going to go over so far Apple Alibaba and video and Neo all in this one video here so if I go to cell call option what I would be doing is I would be sticking to a little bit shorter time frames because the stock market's you know very volatile right now if I go to something like let's say we're going to go two weeks out to September 14 um I look at uh for example and in the money would be 57. this has a 67 Delta however you'll notice that the the strike Price Right Here 57 plus the 260 and premium those two combined have a break-even price of 59.67 so you are entering this position you are creating a cushion about 2.60 in fact even more than that because you're only going to be losing money below 57 not below 57 you know 50 where the stock is trading at right now so you know you have a really good cushion of of two dollars and sixty cents plus 50 more cents because um you know again it's at 57 so the difference there and 57 minus 260 is going to be 54. and uh 40 cents so that's your break even that's that is quite fantastic um that's giving you a really good cushion now you're also having a guaranteed um basically return if it stays above 57 um you're going to be getting a really nice return of 59.67 so see how that works because that premium that you're collecting gives you a cushion and margin on the downside but then also gives you a guaranteed exit point so you'll be exiting the stock if it ends at 57 you'll be exiting the stock you'll be getting a sign but your total profit will be 59.67 so the return right here is almost five percent in just two weeks so you know fantastic return in a month that's 10 so you know even if you're trading you know 40K 50k that's that's quite a bit of money that's that's a lot of money right 10 return it is quite a lot of money so um that's what I would be doing on PayPal and the Delta here is 67 which is quite high now I wouldn't really go higher than that I think higher than that is uh for example if I go to 56 now you're getting into the territory where yes you have more safety and that's actually fine in many ways but in other ways your break even is going to go down so if the market kind of shifts up in two weeks you're gonna miss out miss out on a run-up so you want to give yourself the opportunity to both create a cushion and margin on the downside but also give yourself a really good upside,1.0,0.3
Invest with Henry,kDUjv1QU0_I,2023-08-18T13:47:48Z,I SOLD EVERYTHING,American Airlines,Now American Airlines is another stock that I have covered in my Discord Community since the dawn of Ages since I've started the Discord Community back in July 2021 so it's been over two years of 3 000 members being you know mostly successful pretty much everyone that puts their mind to it is going to be successful unless they literally don't care and they don't put in the work that's up to them but anyone that puts in the work gets the results American Airlines has been a key component of getting results literally it's the best stock because it is incredibly predictable if I go to the one-year chart or the two-year chart anyways this stock goes up and down I mean it just goes like this kind of like a heartbeat okay and that's a really good pattern because volatility and a volatile environment is actually a very fantastic place for option Traders there's absolutely nothing wrong with volatility they love volatility in fact it's a very good thing okay so one of the best Traders I've worked with when I was working on Wall Street was basically in love with volatility and that's because they all like it okay volatility creates opportunity when there is no volatility and implied volatility is low you know if I go back and you know the second stock if we go to American Airlines because I'm going to show you the two strategies are really the one strategy is the in the money covered call that I'm utilizing right now um you'll see that implied volatility has has gone up so if I go to sell call option and I go to let's say next week um and I go to the 15 strike the implied volatility is is getting quite good it's getting quite juicy at 37.5 that's not bad implied volatility and the volume is also very healthy on on some of these companies you know American Airlines being a very good one with 54 Delta right now if you sell a uh a 15 covered call now again it depends where the Market opens up if it opens up a lot lower I might be selling the 14 and a half covered call but again that's given me some really you know decent upside um but right now where it stands the 15 is looking really good okay the pattern is is so consistent on American Airlines it's very easy to do both in the money covered calls super simple or selling puts and by the way both those strategies are very related they're very similar okay,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,kDUjv1QU0_I,2023-08-18T13:47:48Z,I SOLD EVERYTHING,Sofi,Now with Sofi this is a company that also is very popular specifically because it's cheap it's high growth it's really good for small portfolios I think a lot of people are having success with it right now we've been looking at it at five dollars per share this stock is has gone up like a Monster okay but now it's pulling back a little bit and now this is an interesting position I don't want to time the market I don't know if this is the best opportunity to buy the stock right now I don't know I don't like being um you know timing the market because I just can't do that um however dollar cost averaging is a fantastic strategy and then selling puts to get in or in the money covered calls is basically the same thing okay so right now you can see that sofa is probably going to open up under eight dollars per share so if I end up doing a eight dollar covered call on Sofi the return is actually much better than American Airlines does it mean that you should open up your entire portfolio on this because that is you know pretty dumb you need you need to have diversification okay but looking at Sofi I can guarantee you that the implied volatility will be a lot higher now I don't know if it's you know 46 or 47 we could take a look here 61 way above my expectations here this is a very good return as you can see in just seven days uh the H strike has 34 dollars you know eight times four 32 um that's a it's a little bit higher than a four percent return so essentially here you're getting over four percent in seven days so four percent a week that's some insane money and that's what happens when the market is uh more volatile that's what happens when the market starts to shift and pivot um there's a lot of opportunities there there's just so many opportunities and that's why when I talk about consistent weekly returns um I'm trying to go for one to two percent okay sometimes 0.75 depending on the amount of capital that I'm trading with obviously bigger portfolio is you probably want to be safer smaller the portfolio you can take on more risks so this is the perfect smaller portfolio or perfect medium-sized portfolio um you know option to trade for a risk adjusted return because you're getting a really massive four percent obviously a lot of people can really hit their target income goal by by trading things like this and look the Delta here is 0.58 now this Delta is not being adjusted because now Robinhood has um after market activity so clearly a sofa has fallen after hours or should I say pre-market hours where the option prices have not currently adjusted so there's a little bit of a discrepancy here since I'm recording this uh one hour before the Market opens and I'm trying to release it ASAP,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,kDUjv1QU0_I,2023-08-18T13:47:48Z,I SOLD EVERYTHING,Apple,now apple is another stock which I've uh really transparently I've been selling call Credit spreads and um you know those went really well and now I'm selling some put options um and I've been really spot on with Amer uh with apple actually Apple has been literally one of the best stocks that I've had as of recently it looks like today I'm going to have some trouble with apple but essentially when it was right here at the top of you know the five-year High goodness look at that five year high I was very bearish you know I'm very bearish on Apple at 190. I don't think it belongs there and I was executing strategies like call Credit spreads now right now as it comes down it's becoming a much better company to invest in and I think right now is one of the best times to do this new strategy it's not really a new strategy but it's a new twist it's a new spin two covered calls okay covered call is really simple it just you have 100 shares you sell some call options now with the in the money cover call which is what I'm recommending you guys to start doing right now because of the volatility you need to save your Capital you need Capital preservation okay so many people are super aggressive and let's make all this money but they're blind to risk they just don't understand that there is quite a lot of risk in the market right now we've seen that with some professionals starting to shift gears trying to sell out a lot of their stocks okay and I've been specifically saying this for a number of weeks I think there's better opportunities to invest in the market and you know not to be fully invested right now or at least hedged okay and then in the money covered call is a fantastic hedge in the portfolio and that's what I would be doing for Apple,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,kDUjv1QU0_I,2023-08-18T13:47:48Z,I SOLD EVERYTHING,Alibaba,Now for Alibaba Alibaba I think at 90 this is a great company I mean this stock um it's been really good lately because you know when I say really good people are like whoa this stock is not a 52 week high it's not doing good okay your definition most likely if you're not an advanced Trader is good is when a stock goes up down is when it's you know it's bad news up is good news that's not actually how it works we shouldn't really care if a stock is up if it's down we should be making money regardless it doesn't matter if a stock is going up a whole bunch we should be making money when it goes up and when it goes down you shouldn't be upset you should be like hey I'm Switching gears here I'm going to be doing some in the money covered calls which is what this video is about and I'm going to be hedged so as this stock falls down as the market falls down five percent I'm gonna fall down nothing I might even make money maybe I'll fall down one percent but either way I'm not going to succumb to the s p to the stock market generally to NASDAQ to Russell 2000 I'm not gonna succumb to the entire stock market falling down and just kind of sitting there and you're not able to do anything okay with option trading you're able to hedge yourself within the money covered calls and as the stock market falls down because you have an in the money covered call you really don't care so much in fact you're basically laughing every single day as everyone else experiences the pain now it's not good to laugh at other people experiencing pain that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is you're in a fortunate position you're very grateful because as the market falls down and other people are experiencing pain you are not so you're literally blessed if you're using this strategy right now properly of course because again let me show you for example on Nvidia even if you use a covered call in the money strategy here and it goes down 20 percent well it's still a bullish strategy at the end of the day a covered call a syllable strategy so you still can't be invested in trash companies,1.0,0.8

I mean look if you look at something like in the short ratio um share short there's quite a bit now not as high as I thought I thought this would be a two or three percent um short position but I'm very I'm not bullish at all so you shouldn't run and in the money covered call on on Nvidia it doesn't make sense although you are having some cushion probably not enough cushion until this thing really stabilizes to the point where I see a really good entry that's where we can answer but right now no,1.0,-0.9
Invest with Henry,kDUjv1QU0_I,2023-08-18T13:47:48Z,I SOLD EVERYTHING,Neo,Now Neo is a a popular stock that I've honestly been bullish on since the dawn of time as well okay now it has been really expensive I've made mistakes in the past I'm only human but overall I am up on this position okay it might not seem like I am up but my portfolio is at a all-time high okay if I go to years to date um it's at an all-time high now recently it's been kind of Dipping here and what I really need to do I'm not adjusting fast enough myself and I knew this was going to happen yet I didn't position myself correctly also because I'm being a little bit impatient I should have had more in the money covered calls I have some you can actually see in my biggest position on spy I have in the money covered calls I have 445 but now that this thing really fell down so much gosh look at that fall from 448 down to 433 I was in the right position but I'm not even enough not enough I should be more on the higher Delta I should be hedged more okay so biggest lesson you can learn right now is in the money covered calls do more with those so you can head your portfolio more for this crash or this incoming potential crash,1.0,0.7

Invest with Henry,aDF6Ue7kDpA,2023-08-15T20:04:50Z,100% Proven By Research (Crash Incoming?),Tesla,I went through um you know quite a bit of crashes and I've had a lot of Tesla my portfolio I haven't even followed the best risk management practices however I've never had a margin call... for example I have uh 235 put option on Tesla I finally jumped into teslafter it's gone down a bit um looking at the 235 put I sold 15 contracts which is uh you know that's roughly right you would take 10 times 235 that's 235 000 plus another like 112 and a half so that's going to be uh 300 and uh basically 350 352 500 in notional value okay so I have about 350k that I sold okay so this is money that I don't really have this is money that I'm using on margin um and in Tesla's example it's a little bit riskier because it's really close to the money but a majority of what I'm selling puts on is going to be those safer spy and QQQ ETFs,1.0,0.0

Invest with Henry,aDF6Ue7kDpA,2023-08-15T20:04:50Z,100% Proven By Research (Crash Incoming?),American Airlines,you can still sell put options on just high quality companies right it could be the American Airlines that I've been recommending on this channel for two years now I mean I've been talking about American Airlines everyone's talking about the rivian and the I don't know and the sofa and and the pounds here I love Palance here too and I've I've recommended at seven dollars but truly speaking you know there's a lot of hype out there there's a lot of interest out there I know you guys are super excited for some of these stocks to 1050x but truly speaking American Airlines has been a bread and butter stock for me it's been absolute money it's been just printing cash because the you know if I take a look at the chart you know let me just show you what American Airlines looks like and why I'm comfortable using margin on a stock like this if I'm going to use margin I'm going to pick a stock that's stable I'm going to pick a stock that um has tremendous support and I want to also sell options that are very low Delta so you know I talked about not getting a margin call and the way you do that is by going for you go for a 10 Delta you go for a 12 Delta you pick an ETF that has you know tremendously high quality companies inside there right the the big Mega cap companies like spy those are all components right you know the 500 largest companies in the world and even if the market crashes you roll down so I'll show you an example of that in just a moment but American Airlines right 1585. this stock over the past five years I mean I wasn't trading it in 2018 but as soon as it fell to you know these levels in 2020 which is basically when I was you know starting this this YouTube channel from the very beginning I said I love American Airlines this is one of the best companies I've seen because it's American Airlines like it's America right it's it's a pretty good bet to bet on America financially okay financially speaking and then airlines are essential part of the economy so you know this was covid and covet crashed Airlines because people can't travel but you know people are traveling more and they really can't go bankrupt because they're gonna get saved by the US government and yeah American Airlines the only downside is they have tons of debt the debt is is very high okay but that's besides the point I think this company is going to get bailed out in worst case scenario and then Airlines also historically have always had a lot of debt it's not easy running an airline business because the airplanes are super expensive and there's lots of other costs associated with being uh Airline business I mean the pilots are pretty expensive and there's also maintenance and repair and there's also tons of insurance there's also tons of debts and Loan um interest payments that they have to make but taking a look at American Airlines I mean just one of the most most stable stocks I mean truly speaking you guys are chasing those uh sofas those you guys that are watching those palantir videos um you know I try to keep this channel away from recommending specific stocks because I've done that in the past I've been right but as soon as the stock pulls back I get a bunch of comments saying how I was wrong but look on a long-term basis I've been one of the most successful investors even though I'm investing in sometimes companies that are fairly expensive I've caught new at four dollars and I've kept recommending it since four dollars okay and I've recommended it yes at higher points than it is now and people that started watching me are upset because they missed the four dollars that I recommended but from the very beginning if you you know from my results over a long period of time it's been incredible it's been incredible but from any short period of time sure like I've had my mistakes I'm only human like I don't always know the exact right price to buy everything I just don't and nobody does and if they say they do I mean it's it's a lie like I don't no and I worked in this industry for a long time and the people that are the best Traders they don't know and they're bosses they also don't know this is a completely random game however there are nuances and there's strategies that just work and that's the research of it okay so I always try to understand this game but there's truly you can't really fully understand it because there's a random walk hypothesis which basically means that the stock market is pretty random okay but looking at American Airlines this is anything but random I mean this is one of the most predictable companies I just can't speak enough good things uh I've been just destroying it with with this company and um you know the you know I have a 10 return right now but I do this every single week or every two weeks right because I've been getting a little bit lazier lately I don't want to trade weekly because if I can make the same money in two weeks then why not and I've been telling my students like hey relax we're making money we don't need to over trade here okay because way too many people they they joined the Discord Community which again as always first link in the description you can watch your free training book a call and learn about the pricing and pick a package that works for you and that way you don't get scammed because there's too many scam comments in my description in everyone's description I can't control that okay so please be careful of scammers I'm not going to personally reach out to you it's only the first link by getting on a live call is how I actually sell my Discord that's it nothing else and basically a lot of people they come in and they have this notion of being an active Trader but that's really not what I'm teaching on the channel I'm really teaching the passive income component and you know believe it or not but outside of making these videos which you know it's only like maybe what 30 minutes every couple of days I'm trying to upload maybe three or four times um a week you know aside from coaching my group coaching I'm really not trading outside of that everything I do is on camera everything I buy and sell is posted I really don't want to make this a full-time job because it shouldn't be investing should be investing making your money work for you not working and chasing your money and like paying really close attention to it because that kind of defeats the purpose of investing just go get another job right American Airlines is the exact example of I just sell options one to two weeks out I pick a pretty low Delta so actually there's a difference sometimes I look at Delta but with American Airlines I'm looking at the support there's tremendous support of 1550. in fact if I go over my history and this is this is this is how well I know American Airlines it went up to 1835 recently okay and I really started to not like it I mean I love the company but I don't like it at 1835 so if you look at my history um I sold puts 15 16 15 and a half 15 and a half 15 and a half 15 13 and a half 13.5 you don't see me chasing it to 18. you don't see me chasing it to 17. unfortunately I had to back off of American Airlines for a whole month I mean I mean look I sold uh June 26 and I didn't touch it again until July 24th I I had to avoid the stock for you know 28 days and that's because I think that it was getting very expensive so look if I continue to look at my history of American Airlines I mean it's just 13 14 and a half 13 14 and a half 13. I'm just running the will strategy which is like my very favorite strategy that I can do on American Airlines and as you can see I continue to go back into 2022 I'm still selling 13 puts 13 and a half 12 and a half covered calls I'm just running the wheel strategy around the 13 level 14 level 13. I mean look I'm literally going back and showing you guys my history I mean you know just transparently I don't want to just talk to talk I'm you know just just take a look at my screen you know we have July 18 July 11. um you can still see that it's just the same strikes and it's just collection of Premium you know 300 bucks 55 bucks um you know I had shares here and actually sold the shares at 15.25. I literally sold the shares here at 15.25 so you can see how I've been selling puts covered calls and then finally getting into a 15.27 so uh selling the shares I mean I've been perfect on this I'm not trying to brag here again I'm not perfect I don't have a 3X return in here some people claim they have that I don't believe them okay but you know I'm having a good return it's not enormous but it's a really good consistent return again that's that's all I really care about is consistency um you can see here how uh looks like I had a cell call at 19 and a half 2017 so uh you know American Airlines was hovering a little bit higher in 2021 uh you can see how I'm still going back now 2020 guys 2020. I'm going back three years showing you showing you again I'm not I'm not just telling you showing you uh 2020 uh maybe I'll even go I don't know how far back does this go you can still see I'm still running to quick heal three years of running the wheel still scrolling here 2020 July of 2020 June of 2020. I'm gonna I'm gonna scroll to the very bottom um trading it since 2018 okay in the in this portfolio right I've had you know I've been moving portfolios um but in Robinhood since 2018. I've been trading the same the same stock,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,apXXtLFz9Pc,2023-08-12T23:28:04Z,"Replacing $100,000 Income With Option Trading",S&P 500,as you can see my results are very close to the S P 500. Robin Hood I had a 21. uh one four percent return so just slightly a hair higher than spy with lower volatility. specifically speaking what I look at is trying to beat the Spy because spy is The Benchmark okay The Benchmark is what you are trying to Target right if you are playing a sport you wouldn't compare yourself playing that sport to a different sport you're trying to compare apples to apples not apples to oranges so for me that's my main goal because I know that if spy has a decent return 10 I'm typically trying to double that now this year I did make a little bit of a mistake where I just wasn't aggressive enough however I have no complaints because as you can see my portfolio is a lot less volatile than the spy and actually I am beating it very very lightly but here's the thing okay I promise you if you're new you might not understand this but regardless of what someone promises you regardless of what videos people are making of a stock doubling tripling and doubling and tripling your portfolio if you actually want to trade for the next 10 15 years if you actually want to make a living doing this I don't know about you but most people they are all hot about trading and then in three to six months they're gone sayonara because they lose money they don't know what they're doing they don't know how to manage positions they don't know how to close positions you know people are kind of whimsical they they have a naivety to them they think that everything is easy and then this is something that's you know just gonna happen overnight the fact of the matter is most people don't even come close to the Spy not even close they don't even smell the Spy okay they're so far away in the short term some people can beat spy but I will bet you right now and this is actually a bet over 10 years okay 90 of people in fact 90 five percent of people won't even come close to spy especially when you factor in fees and taxes and other things okay so beating spy or beating the market is extremely hard and that's why you know there is textbooks written about there's as many professors that just talk about investing in index funds and that is kind of what I do with a lot of my money however I am trying to actively beat the market a it's fun and B I do like the income and I'm trying to withdraw this income anyways to you know basically fund my lifestyle so check it out okay for spy what I did was essentially I have less volatility now this is really confusing because you know one can argue that I'm making less money when spy goes up in certain periods of time and yeah that's not necessarily the best thing but I'm also outperforming very significantly and then yes as spy you know basically Rose a lot in July we had a crazy month I underperformed but right now years to date not only have I beat spy but I have less movement so my Sharp ratio is incredibly high,1.0,0.5

I do have a TD Ameritrade portfolio as well I don't really show this on YouTube in fact I only show it really in my Discord Community it is a little bit more advanced and it does you know kind of associate more people with a higher income okay so people that have you know a higher income or a higher net worth or at least a portfolio of like twenty five thousand dollars you know somewhere in the five figures then I want to show those people how to get to six figures and seven figures but if this portfolio is a little bit larger however it didn't really start large and in fact in January uh it started with really nothing now just to be clear just to be straight I have added money to this portfolio um I have added quite a bit but um the thing is I wanted to show you this because it's hard to track but at the same time um you can see here how I've done extremely well a lot of this was adding money of course I might have added like a mill right but my portfolio return here is roughly 50 year to date in this portfolio,1.0,0.7

Invest with Henry,1kPNnLHDxVo,2023-08-08T17:00:01Z,PLTR - I Warned You To DO This,Palantir,this is a very important palantir video that's unbiased I want some of you Bulls to consider selling to avoid getting rolled over I want some of you Bears to consider the opportunity of playing options on palantir because of the volatility and everyone else in between I want you to Simply understand the risk and reward of palantir as an investment this stock has a lot of volatility right now and specifically something that nobody talks about is this stock has a lot of social velocity social velocity basically means that a lot of people are looking at balance here on YouTube on Twitter on Instagram and other social media platforms so that makes this a high social play and basically you can predict this stock by looking at what other people are doing because you know this is an emotional game the stock market is not really a mathematical game in the short term it's all based on what people are doing what people are saying if I look at the balance your news right now we can see that palantir just reported earnings they reported 13 Revenue growth but issues around the guidance that tops estimates okay so palantir raises Revenue Target on AI boost and also announced the share buyback and you know share BuyBacks are really powerful so that is a good long-term Trend but in the short term it does look like they may have slightly disappointed. I was issuing a warning although I think this is a good long-term stock I'm not really convinced that this stock is going to go to the moon in the short term and actually we can already see that it's likely going to open up you know somewhere in between today it could be a little bit up it could be a little bit of down we will see closer when the Market opens I do expect a lot of volatility so I expect this to be a very interesting open today now also palantir you know it's likely to dip I'm seeing news here it's not really clear yet since the market isn't open but this is a really interesting stock overall because once it opens up there's going to be a lot of opportunities if it comes down what I would do is I would actually buy into the weakness now if it goes up I would sell call Credit spreads into the strength so you see how I kind of move with the waves of the market so if the market is being really aggressive and people are getting very greedy um you know just starting off with people being greedy that's a good opportunity to basically take advantage because um a stock that has a lot of greed in it will likely have a strong Peak so if we go back to pounds here here and I go to three months um this could be a very strong Peak especially right here on August 1st I mean peaking at twenty dollars and this stock went you know back down to 18. now that is a significant move so many people underestimate the amount of money that you can make on an option position when a stock moves from 20 to 18. I mean really if I take a look at the options right here for example if I go to uh buying put options right in the short term you will see that it looks like they're changing by five to to seven percent and that's because palantir didn't have a huge move but you know looking at the strike price of something like 19 even if it was going for say two dollars this position could have very likely Changed by 30 percent in just a day or two so palantir is a fan fantastic position specifically to do spreads on because a lot of people with smaller portfolios you know they're always looking for smaller or cheaper stocks. So for example like palantir is actually a really good example so if I go to palantir right now we can take a look that the market cap is 38 billion so this doesn't really have I mean it does have the biggest investors in the world but it's not really a trillion dollar company me so this is a type of company and this is also why I suspect there's so much Social velocity and so much interest because AI is a big play AI is a big Trend so this company could become a 380 billion dollar company so it could 10x and obviously if you have something like a leap option I haven't talked about leap options on the channel for a while but uh check it out so if I go out um into let's say let's just say I'm going to go out really far in the future now this is super far you have to have a super long-term mindset here into 2025 but um look you can buy 20 call option for 625 now say in 2025 you know people's predictions you know go go correctly and this is a 50 stock well you're gonna have a 25 gain right because essentially your break even is 26 so you know if it's 50 bucks 50 minus 26 is about twenty four dollars okay so you're gonna have a 24 profit but you know check it out you're not going from 20 to 50 you're going from six dollars to twenty four dollars worth of profit it's actually a 4X return. For me looking at balance here I think it's a fantastic opportunity where I throw all my money into it absolutely not I think it's ridiculous that um how how heavy the you know social velocity is right now and I see investors just going absolutely nuts over Palance here and I've been saying again warning you have to be careful because you know guys like this you know Palance here oh my gosh with you know with their clickbait titles um you know I'd be very careful because I don't think you know I'm not sure what this thumbnail is trying to say 500 that's a bit aggressive I don't think palantir is going anywhere near the 500 Now 50 yeah 50 could happen but um again I would be very cautious um you know to to be watching some of these videos like palantir will 10x full proof I mean there is no full proof this this guy is just straight up in my opinion um you know to me it looks like deception because you know 10x saying foolproof come on now come on now let's let's be a little bit more grounded let's have a little bit more of a long-term mindset... and this stock is not going to double okay maybe it'll double in in five years but you know in a short amount of time no no sorry it's not. So here's what I would do I would basically look at balance here and I would do two things I would look at the covered call strategy which you know that makes a lot of sense because if this stock goes sideways which you know it looks like you know I'm not sure what's going on with Robinhood here but if you sell a covered call at the moment money you can make in three days a hundred and thirteen dollars now excuse me but that's almost ten percent in three days now that is a big return that's a safer return. And also I would look at selling puts so um for example you know maybe I would not do the 18 put you know that is a you know a little bit aggressive because it's at the money and the Delta right here is 46. I'm typically not selling 46 uh puts I'm not selling 46 Deltas excuse me I am going for you know let's take a look at a more sensible option 16 is a no-brainer 23 Delta no-brainer boom High implied volatility high volume High open interest now this to me is good looking at the bid ask spread it's also very good it's tight you know from 50 to 53 you're not losing too much again if you have fees that reduces your return if the bid ask spread is wide that reduces your return so you need to be aware of this so trading stocks that are illiquid is a silly move okay you need to trade stocks are liquid and right now to be honest palantir does have some of the best options on the market some of the highest implied volatility that's what makes this stock a really good play because implied volatility really benefits you and I think the best two strategies are covered calls and selling notes and you can watch more videos on my playlist on both of those strategies.,1.0,0.4

Invest with Henry,6pyIvuT532Y,2023-08-06T16:43:26Z,PLTR Option Earnings Warning,Palantir,what's going on guys in this video I want to talk about palantir and the earnings that are coming up so I have done a lot of digging into pounds here I've been following the stock for a very long time and I've actually been talking about this stock for over a year on this YouTube channel now with palantir um again this stock I have a feeling that it's going to be a very interesting earnings event that's what I'm going to say because when I look online what's going on um there is a lot of hype there's a lot of people getting really excited I mean if I look at Yahoo finance and we take a look at palantir this stock is going ballistic I mean everyone is talking about the earnings and I think for you know honestly good reason if you take a look at their earnings report in previous quarters the stock really does move a lot because it is at that stage where becoming cash flow positive is making a very big difference for financial analysts on Wall Street to actually make some projections so for example if I go to the financials I want to show you that basically you know the total revenue has been obviously Rising but if I go to the cash flow statement this is really important because you know for a long time palantir was in the negative numbers and then you know as it becomes more positive this is really a big deal for the company I mean Alex carp the CEO he has a big bet on AI there's a lot of Technology here and just in general riding this trend makes a lot of sense now I I believe that this stock can head up to 50 per share in the future but as to when it will happen I am not sure and I'm in that camp of investors you know if you look on YouTube A lot of people are saying this Stock's going to go to the moon tomorrow and you have to buy it before the earnings I'm in the camp of I am fairly neutral in the short term and very bullish in the long term so what I want to look at is actually the options because well for palantir I think there's a lot of interesting option plays in the past three months the stock is up 142 percent which is obviously a lot how do you bought some call options I mean you'd be up multiple times your money I mean maybe five or ten times on your money so for example if we look at the options okay I want to look at some different plays now I'm kind of more of the neutral Camp so I want to just give you different plays whether you're bearish bullish or you're neutral because I think there's way too many bows right now again I like this stock but at the same time when I see so many bulls when I see a lot of content creators pumping the stock you know in some ways it does scare me because I've seen this happen over and over on YouTube where people will talk about the hottest stocks right um you know Kathy woodplays big growth stocks and of course sometimes they're right but oftentimes they're wrong and many content creators don't really have a clue on what the actual fundamentals or technicals are even though they say they do so for me I'd rather be very cautious because the market is a fairly random game and instead of me coming on this video and telling you um 10 different facts about Palance here to be honest it doesn't really matter does it really matter that some other person on YouTube is giving you 10 to 15 facts about Palance here and why he thinks it's going to go up I mean it's cool it gives you conviction and motivation but does really conviction and motivation and outside sources and just facts mean that the stock itself is going to go up because at the end of the day the stock is going to rise based on humans human emotion so even if it has good earnings the stock is still go down and vice versa you can have bad earnings but Alex carp could say something on the earnings call that could just really excite investors and because this is more of a trend stock I think just playing options is more interesting because you can have a small risk and a really big reward so again I've actually taken a look at some you know Reddit posts and you know obviously people are making some yellow plays you know they're buying call options and let me just tell you what I would and would not do okay so first off buying call options um obviously you know the earnings are very very soon so even August 11th is fine right because on August 11th uh that will capture in earnings now you can see right here that the call option the 18 and a half is going for a dollar and 34. so that is pretty expensive to be honest that is almost 10 so obviously the options are pricing in a wow just wow okay 163 percent volatility and the volume is six thousand four hundred so you know I don't like buying options I don't like buying call options I don't like buying put options I don't like buying uh debit spreads in general I'm more of a boring investor but look this palantir stock has a lot of social momentum what I mean by social momentum is if you just YouTube balance your earnings um I mean there's so many videos that just have tons of views I mean like right away and to me that tells me that a lot of people are going to be fairly emotional and that is the key emotional about this stock most people don't really understand the technology behind pounds here even if you read about and watch videos there is still a lot of technical Innovation which is a good thing that's happening that we might not fully understand unless you actually work inside the company and that's why so many people that work at Palance here get so much stock options right but you can see people promising you like a thousand dollars on Monday I don't think that's true because there is no guarantee to investing so I wouldn't like me personally I wouldn't write a thousand dollars right some people um are saying that the stock is good and they say the stock is bad and then they say the stock is good um I've seen that a lot why I never sold Palance here um some buyers remorse here or sellers remorse however you say it um but just in general you can see that there is a lot of social velocity um palantir being a very very hot topic and an urgent topic and for good reason again you know Q2 earnings are are going to do something good or something bad that's the thing guys some people will say oh it's going to do good some people's gonna say it's gonna do bad for me I don't know and because I don't know I'd rather play options so for example I don't know if it's going to go up but since I don't know I don't want to dump a lot of money into balance here especially as it has gone up a lot and actually if you look at my history I'm going to show you my history in just a couple minutes I just want to go over the options I'm going to actually show you what I've been doing on balance here but right here this call option is breaking even at 1980 too so the stock would have to go up to about twenty dollars for you to see really that much benefit so this is something that I would do I'll be honest I would because the stock can pop up by 20 that could happen but again not a huge return because the implied volatility is massive so balancer is already factoring in and already pricing this in to the options um however I do have a solution for this but anyways this is what I would do I would buy an at the money option or even the 18. so as you see the more in the money I go uh the break even does come down and that's because you do have higher risk I mean it is a higher amount of Premium so I actually think if you're a bull on balance here that it would make a lot of sense to buy an in the money option I mean look even a 16 call option right here it has a little bit lower volatility because it's in the money right the volume is still pretty good the open interest is also you know pretty high and it has a high Delta so right here you have a big benefit you can put up you know a small amount of capital 269 and still get a big benefit of palantir rising so that's that what I would not do and a lot of people are gonna do this is I would not buy something like a 24 call option like you're silly I know the implied volatility is huge and a lot of people are buying this but let's just be honest the stock could pop up 20 30 and you would still lose 100 of your option um premium right so I would not do this this just doesn't really make sense to me and way too many beginner option Traders end up doing that they end up buying call options that are out of the money and then they lose their money and sometimes they have a big home run and then you know they just lose all the Home Run money sooner or later anyway so that is a really bad idea because after you know working at Goldman Sachs I basically know what works which is just selling options I actually I would so I think it could make a lot of sense to just buy palantir stock and say that you're bullish on the company but you don't want to experience all the volatility I would sell a call option and you know create a covered call on balance here so selling put options is basically just like selling Insurance you sell a put option you're telling the market that hey I'm you know I'm convinced or I'm ready to buy this stock and if you guys are afraid and you want to pay me if the stock falls down sure pay me okay so you could say hey at 16 I'm super happy to own Palance here I know a lot of people that are invested in the stock and heck you know I said I would show my history I have invested in pounds here numerous times over and over but I am cautious when the stock is up 142 percent because you know there just has to be a little bit of hype I don't know how much hype okay I like the company but you know I would rather have been and I was investing when I was seven dollars per share now unfortunately I didn't have the shares I've just been making money by selling put options which has been you know doing pretty well and actually I've even sold call Credit spreads so check this out if you look at this position right here this call Credit spread okay I have sold the 21 call oops the 21 call and then I have bought the 23 calls so I have done some spreads you know I made sixty dollars to your betting that balancer wouldn't rise okay so in you know for the past few weeks I haven't really touched this stock because again you know the stock is on the expensive side at least I don't know it could go up higher doesn't mean it's a good thing to buy just because you're buying something expensive and think it's going to be more expensive doesn't mean it's a good long-term strategy okay it's a good short-term strategy for sure but still you know I'm cautious I'm you know I'm really looking to avoid any big volatility in my portfolio we will see what happens with palantir earnings but I would play options and I would use your view and use a certain option strategy like a covered call or a sell put to play out balance your earnings I think that's going to make a lot more sense because with call options you can you know bet a certain amount a very limited amount and risk a limited amount of capital okay or with put options you can buy the stock for lower than it's trading at today so just in general options makes more sense on balance you're earnings so if you're going to be playing palantir earnings make sure that you paid attention to this video and watch some of my other videos on option Trading,1.0,0.4

Invest with Henry,6vE0oFvZKwA,2023-07-28T23:48:10Z,New Super Iron Condor Option Strategy,Netflix,all right here's Netflix Netflix is a very interesting setup right now and if you're watching this in the future it doesn't really matter you just have to understand where the stock is currently trading in relation to its history so look at this Bollinger band right here I love Bollinger Bands because it gives me a very good sense of where the stock is likely to trade within based on statistics now Netflix is somewhere in between its Bollinger band which makes it the perfect setup right now for an iron Condor because you see if it was at the top of its range that would make it pretty expensive now if it was at the very bottom like right here then that could be a signal that this stock is oversold and it might rise but currently right now it's sitting right in between which is a very strong signal and a very strong setup because if a stock has already kind of fallen down from its peak but it doesn't look like the momentum is going down that makes it a very good candidate for an iron Condor since an iron Condor benefits if the stock continues to move sideways and something like Netflix right now is moving sideways you don't have to use Netflix you can find a different stock as long as it's going sideways the iron Condor strategy is the best one that you can Implement choosing the correct strike prices and expiration dates is vital to ensure that the trade has a high probability of success properly executing the opening leg sets the foundation for potential profits and it minimizes risk a lot of people ask me no how do I manage this position correctly well the most important thing that you can do for managing the position correctly is is opening the position properly to begin with if you open an iron Condor properly you have done 90 percent of the work required when executed with a disciplined and a precise strategy the iron Condor strategy can provide Traders with a reliable stream of monthly income so let's open this up in my Robinhood portfolio right now which I do have a link for in the description if you want level 3 access now taking a look at a Netflix trade Netflix options okay what I'm going to do is I'm going to pick an expiration out into the future now check out the chart I am using the Bollinger band it's going out about 20 days not about exactly 20 days so what I want to do is actually this is 20 trading days so I'm going to go out roughly about a month so that would be August 25th again if you're watching this in the future it doesn't really matter you usually want to go out roughly one month you can do weekly option trading and iron Condors are a suitable strategy for that however for me I like monthly trading because it's less work it's less management and if I open up a good position I can set it and forget it and just have a monthly profit now how will I pick my strike prices because this is the most important thing that you can really do if you pick the correct strike prices then you don't have a lot to worry about even the stock bounces up and down most likely your iron Condor is going to be very profitable so for example check out the bottom of the Bollinger band here is roughly 400 in the top is 482. now that's very wide but the good news is that Netflix has a lot of implied volatility so if I go down I go to sell put option and that's how you want to start off an iron Condor you want to get started with the puts you can see here that the 400 strike price right here is still a 21 Delta so not low and the reason why this Delta is not super low and we'll talk about Delta in just a minute is because the implied volatility here is pretty good I mean it's pretty big 33 almost 34 is not low it's not super high but this is a very good amount of implied volatility and this is actually going to give you really good premium so for example if I go ahead and sell the 400 or put option here now my typical iron Condor here is going to be a five dollar Gap meaning if I sell 400 I do 395 on the buy if I sell 390 I do 385 on the buy okay so I like to have a 500 spread now you can do 300 you can also do more than that I just like 500 for many reasons if you have any questions or preferences yourself for the strikes that you pick let me know in the comment section below and I will answer so I have sold the 400 now I'm going to go ahead and buy the 395 so um if I go ahead and buy the 395 this is a put credit spread now to actually make an iron Condor I'm going to have to also sell call options right I'm going to have to scroll up and the top of the Bollinger band I'll remind you was around 482. so to be extra safe I'm going to go ahead and sell the 485 right here now you will notice that the Delta is going to be lower and yes it is lower I can already I already knew that because I could look at the premium and see that the premium was a lot lower than what we collected here which was no 500 now we're only collecting 247 which is fine that is what it is it's basically based on the Bollinger band here okay so 485 I'm going to sell that I'm going to go ahead and buy the 490. and now this is an iron Condor this is actually a short iron Condor and the benefit of a short iron Condor is that the stock continues to move sideways and again reminding you that Netflix is likely to move sideways based on the technical analysis that I have done my work on so right here you can see that you are risking about 350 dollars but again if it stays in between here you will be successful in collecting and making 150 dollars per month with just 350. now look management is the secret sauce because you know you really need to listen to this it's really easy money if you understand how to manage this position and I really do look at Delta for example a high Delta is not really good especially if you're doing a selling strategy so this is a selling strategy you know that because we have sold the 485 which is the closer to the money option what I mean by closer to the money is we're at 427 485 is closer than 490. so this is a selling strategy because I am betting that Netflix won't rise up above 485 right so my goal is it doesn't go above 45 because that's where I will start to lose money and potentially go into this red zone now on the put side I wanted to not fall below 400 and again I don't think that is likely I think Netflix will trade within this range okay but if it falls below 400 then I will start to lose money for me I'm always looking for a Delta of 0.2 or less the lower Delta you go the safer this iron Condor will be but of course if you pick a Delta that's super low like you know 0.03 0.05 then it's going to be very safe but then at the same time your premium collected will also be very low so you want to have a very healthy balance of making really good money but make it consistent and that's exactly why I pay a lot of attention to how I open an iron Condor to begin with and the iron Condor is the fastest way to grow your portfolio because it has both sides you're selling both the puts and the calls as long as you get your entry correct then you are going to be very profitable,1.0,0.7

Invest with Henry,6vE0oFvZKwA,2023-07-28T23:48:10Z,New Super Iron Condor Option Strategy,Amazon,before Amazon on actually split in 2021 I had a very profitable iron Condor as well as on Facebook making 50 in a short amount of time although old if you're smart you will pay attention to these two examples because that's the exact big contributor that I had to my portfolio where I grew it from 100 to 700 000 in one year so pay attention to these two examples right now all right guys we're gonna be taking a look at my screen right now I'm going to be showing you a real life example of an iron Condor on Amazon now I had a heavy debate between using Amazon apple or a different stock but I chose Amazon because it's actually very interesting to play Iron Condors since Amazon is such an expensive stock it's very difficult to really do any put selling on Amazon or any covered calls because you would need a whole lot of capital so instead there are other strategies that we can use without requiring so much capital and that is an iron Condor so I'm going to walk you through an exact example of what I would do now I do want you guys to understand that it is after hours right now so the market is not open I'm just going to show you a hypothetical example of what I would do if the market was open but don't worry because you can use this type of strategy and I'm going to explain my full logic my thought process and how I think about option trading especially in terms of an iron Condor so you can pretty much copy mimic the same thought process the same logic and use it on a different stock so it doesn't have to be Amazon it can be any stock that you choose that you think is going to stay somewhat range bound that's not going to explode higher so what that means is it's very important that you do iron Condors on stocks during time periods when they don't have earnings because of course an earnings event could really shoot up a stock either upwards or downwards which would hurt an iron Condor position so with that being said let's go over this example with Amazon so I'm going to go out a little bit in terms of time right now it is July 7th and it is not going to be appropriate to do July 9th that gives us absolutely no time to work with and since an iron Condor does have four positions I do like to go out just a little bit farther so I do like to teach students to do weekly option income strategies however what I'm going to do is with iron Condors the returns are so big they can be over 10 20 um even 30 in a single month I'm actually going to go out um about one month I would pick August 6th but something that you guys might not know is that options historically actually expire the third Friday of every single month so without going through too much time and wasting time here I'm not going to pick August 6 because I already know that Amazon is going to have options for August 6th but they're not going to be as high volume they're not going to have as good of a liquidity um for August 6th so I'm going to go for August 20 and by the way just to prove my points you don't see September 9th or September 8th you see September 17th which is the third Friday of September um same thing for October same thing for November December January this is a very specific reason that that happens I don't know the history itself but when I was working on Wall Street an option Trader told me that so instead of going for August 6th I know it's not going to have the best liquidity we are going to click August 20th guys and I just want to say stick with me if it doesn't make complete sense after I pick all four different options to create the iron Condor I will have a visual for you guys on the side here in Robinhood that's a new feature that they have so I will explain to you a visual feature so do not worry if you don't fully understand first of all okay so the first thing to do when opening up an iron Condor is we're going to be having four different legs so what happens is you sell a put option okay so for example we're going to be selling a put option I'm just going to go step by step with you guys okay step by step and give you an exact explanation So currently the stock price is at three thousand six hundred and ninety six dollars okay so what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to open up an iron Condor for about five hundred dollars we're gonna see it might be 1000 I have to do some analysis on what is the best option here but it's probably going to be 500 worth of risk and we're probably going to collect a whole bunch of money it's probably going to be around 25 return but that is my prediction so let me actually do um the actual picking of options so the reason why I'm going down is because well first of all we're opening up a put credit spread and I'm going to make a whole video on put credit spreads very soon basically the first thing we have to do is we have to sell put and buy a put sell a put and buy put that's how we get started on one leg of the option okay so we're going to pick a put that is far out of the money and the reason why I'm picking a put that as far out of the money is I want as little risk as possible I do not want to get executed on the iron Condor I don't want it to go into the red territory and I will show you exactly where the red territory is in a couple of minutes so first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to pick let's say the 34 50 strike and that is going to have a 24 Delta that is good because that's a fairly low Delta so here we go I'm going to sell this put um and there we go so now what I'm going to do and this is very important guys you have to do the opposite now you have to buy a put that is going to be a little lower and the reason why you do that is if you sell a put you have a whole bunch of risk but now if you buy a put no matter what happens to Amazon if Amazon goes to zero that would totally be fine because now you are kind of covering your butt now you have an exit if if this option goes against you this option will go in your favor and it's going to close off the potential downside of three thousand four hundred and fifty dollars with this 3445 dollars and the difference guys is just five it's five dollars or in option terms it's five hundred dollars because each option is 100 shares so this is a 500 worth of risk okay guys and because this option is closer to the money and this option is farther from the money this option has more premium and this option has less premium so you're selling the option that has more premium and you're buying the option that has less premium guys so look now I completely closed off um the trade now we only have a 500 worth of risk okay you only need five hundred dollars here and check that out guys you are actually collecting 113 dollars which may not seem like a lot but your maximum loss is only 300 87 the reason why it's only 387 it's really 500 but because you're collecting 113 in actual reality your maximum loss is only 387 dollars which makes it even juicier than 500 so um if you were to take 113 divided by 500 I'm just giving you guys the percentage return if you double 113 that's 226 so 22.6 percent return that is a 22.6 return guys and what is it about six weeks or so so 22.6 return is one leg by the way guys we're about to sell a second leg so we're about to collect more premium but just from the put side of things we are collecting 113 dollars and our maximum loss is 387 dollars so so far if you actually do the math 113 divided by 387 we're going to be around a 30 return so this is going to be a very high High return trade in six weeks guys very high so the break even is 34.48 and the reason why it's saying 3448 is because you guys won't lose any money at expiration until better yet if Amazon goes down to 34.48 because well unless it really touches this option we're good we it really doesn't matter as long as Amazon stays above 34.50 we're fine and that's why I picked 34.50 because it is significantly below 36.96 so 34.50 is significantly below so we're pretty safe here okay and the break even is basically 34.50 it's saying 3448 because we do collect some premium and because we collect some premium we actually reduce the break-even point just a little bit from 3 500 to you know 34.48 so that is one side of the equation guys and this is going to make a lot more sense when I open up the second leg of the iron Condor because this chart right here is going to change is going to look different than I'm going to explain to you guys basically how it works how this iron Condor behaves during the whole process from opening it all the way to expiration so now what we're going to do is I'm going to scroll back up to a higher price than what Amazon currently is because this second leg essentially the first leg that we opened was a put credit spread we we sold the put we bought a put now what we're going to do guys is very similar we're going to sell call and buy a call cell call and buy a call and the first call that we sell that first call is going to be closer to the money because it's going to be a little bit more expensive it'll be a little bit more cash in your pocket and then we're going to buy a call that's a little bit farther out of the money again it's going to be 500 and because we're buying a call we're protecting ourselves we're closing off that trade because if you sell a call it's unlimited risk but if you sell a call and then buy a call just a little bit higher for that 500 we close off that risk you don't have unlimited risk anymore now we have 500 worth of risk again however it gets very very interesting because when you do an iron Condor guys only one side of the leg can happen only the put side of things can happen or the call side of things can happen think about it Amazon can't end up hurting you on both sides at expiration it's either going to be somewhere between which is very very likely or it's going to end up below or above therefore even though we are risking another 500 your account will not be um another 500 will not come out of your account basically it's going to be a total trade of 500 even though the put side of things is 500 the call side of things is 500 only one can happen so you're still only risking 500. so although this has 387 Max loss it's going to get better guys it's going to get way way better and you guys are going to be astounded when you see what happens so let's go into cell call all right guys so for the second part I'm going to show you how to open up a second leg and that's going to be by selling the call option and then a further out call option however guys I have a little bit of a tragedy here I put in so much work into this video but I realized that with Amazon it doesn't have any five dollar spreads anymore for the call option side of things because it now becomes fifty dollar spreads so it's not going to be a perfect example unfortunately Amazon is such a large stock in terms of its price that 500 spreads are just too little actually most investors are going to need to risk maybe one thousand dollars or even five thousand dollars so this strategy is fantastic for stocks that are between um 100 200 and actually I'm going to show you guys a trade on Facebook real quick,0.9,-0.3

I'm actually going to show you guys a trade on Facebook real quick so I'm actually going to show you the full iron Condor on Facebook but this time it's going to be a little bit different but you know I do apologize I'm gonna do the same thing I'm just going to show you guys an example so we're gonna sell sell a put just like we did before now we're going to buy put just like we did before here the trade is 125 and the risk is 375. very very very similar to Amazon however this time we're going to have more luck with Facebook because Facebook is a stock between 20 to 800 range so yes we have options that look good thank you thank you so much because I put in a lot of work to educate you guys and I thought that this video was going to just go to the trash so no we're going to sell you know for example the 425. now we're going to buy the 420. what you guys will notice here is that we actually have collected more premium and now our Max loss has gone down and that's because we're selling both sides of iron the iron Condor or essentially the put credit spread and the call Credit spread so now we have collected an extra 13 here for Facebook on the 425 430 425 430 is way way way far away from the current price and actually we can probably dial in the risk more and have a higher return if we go closer to 400 so let's say we sell the 400 instead and we buy the 405 and again we're closing off our risk from 400 to 405 we only have 500 worth of risk take a look at that guys we now collect a hundred and sixty four dollars and we're only risking 336 so basically we have a 50 profit because half of 336 is right around the 160 168 it's right around 168 or 163 so we have an exactly 50 return guys up until August 20. so in six weeks you can make 50 return as long as Facebook stays within this range right here so basically if it stays between the range of our break even of 325 on the downside again we sold 325 so at 325 we start to lose money because one side of the leg starts to go into the red this is what I mean by the red you can lose up to 336 dollars on the call side of things again our break even is around 401 dollars and the reason for that is because well you know we start losing money around 400 but because we collected 164 dollars our real break even for this iron Condor will be right around 401.64 so as long as Facebook stays between this range right now it's 350 as long as it stays between you know 3 325 ish to 401 you have a profit on your hands and that is very likely to happen as long as Facebook is trading within this within this range right here in the green you're going to be in the green and most of the time this is a very successful trade because both times when this option would start to lose money is when Facebook would have a very fast and adverse move to the downside or a very fast momentum move to the upside,1.0,0.9

that I think this is the best strategy because this is a very active strategy and as you guys already know I'm more of a lazy Trader I like collecting income that's more passive but if you're into more active trading and you want to get more rapid results and you want to see what can happen with daily SPX and just daily trading in general then zero DTE trading is a very viable option and there are lots of benefits such as rapid feedback but of course with any trading strategy there are pros and cons now check this out if you look at spy or SPX which is about the same thing right it's just an ETF if you look at the 450 strike and I expand this right now you can see that the bid ask is very tight so this is a very good start and the volume is also very high this makes this a fantastic option or actually a fantastic selection to trade on because you want to look for high volume High open interest you want the bid ask spread to be very tight which is amazing now check it out if you look at the option chain the expiry dates that's uh one day two day three day four day obviously we skip the weekend but there are daily expirations on ETFs like spy SPX QQQ as well there are many ETFs that have daily expirations and this is very attractive for many investors because as you can see here in the short term there are expiration days that are up to 14 days that are daily so you can open up a position and on the same day you can have that position expire or you can even close on the same day one of the biggest benefits to zero DTE options is you don't have to worry about holding the option overnight I mean if there's a big data release or there's earnings or there's like a price Gap there's a lot of different events that you can avoid there's also a lot of different events that you can capture with a zero DTE option so you really do have a lot of flexibility and adaptability that you can maneuver through any Market condition so if the market conditions are rough then zero DTE trading can be very beneficial and also if the market is very quiet but you're expecting there's to be a really huge move you can also position yourself in a very interesting position because zero DTE trading is only really a few hours but you know for me I do want to expand it from a few hours to one or even two days so because I'm such a longer term Trader and I like more passive income which is like weekly and monthly trading for me two days is basically a very very short-term option trade I mean anything under a week is really short term so there's multiple expiration dates that you can actually go for in my opinion it can be zero it can be one it can be two days to expiration anything that's super short term I put in the category and in this Camp of zero DT options now you can see here that it's very possible to collect some you know big income 263 dollars 200 twelve dollars now you can also do this on things like QQQ for me spy and triple Q are two ETS I have a lot of money in okay so for spy I had about 83 percent and for QQQ I have about 11.74 now I'm not using the zero DTE strategy I just want to educate you on it I'm not currently using it because it is too much work in my opinion but again there are many benefits and this is a very popular strategy in fact it's the most popular trading strategy in my Discord and I realize that's probably because it's a very fun strategy and you get rapid results and you know exactly what you made for the day so it gives us a lot of dopamine it gives us a lot of like reward to our brain but in all honesty it is a little bit of a tougher strategy in terms of management so as you can see here triple Q also has you know one day two day three day expiration so if I go to two days I do want to show you something interesting it's not about just selling puts because you know that's a larger account what you can also do is if I scroll down here you can also play spreads so for example let's say that you know we're fairly bullish on Kiku especially because Tesla has pulled back a lot and it's part of triple Q now it's looking a lot more attractive so what you can do is you can play a spread so for example so put two days out okay you can go down let's just pick up the 370 take a look at it 24 Delta pretty high not ideal okay not ideal I don't like high Deltas I like the lower the Delta uh the better but obviously you do want to balance it out a Delta that is too low will give you very low premium okay and obviously we are trading for income so we want to collect a good amount of premium and there is no point of running any of my strategies if the premium is too low and the same thing goes for implied volatility so if implied volatility is super low it's below you know 20 then we're not going to have any premium to collect now here the volume is over a thousand so that is amazing so for example I can go ahead and sell the 367 put option right here but that's obviously a lot of capital what I can do now is I can go to buy another put option and again two days out two days out until expiration very short term so I sold one put option I'm going to go ahead and buy another put option I'm going to go down by one two three I do like 300 spreads or something wrong with 300 spreads some some people want to do 100 spreads I don't prefer those because I'm just opening up a lot of contracts doesn't make a lot of sense it does cost you money as well and fees so I'm gonna go ahead and buy this put option at 40 and now as you can see I'm collecting 32 on 268 which is above a you know roughly 11 percent return in just two days in fact when I'm selling an option that has like nine dollars to it as I'm trading it it'll oftentimes go from like nine dollars to eight dollars very quickly and that's because if you sell an option at 10 A.M Eastern or 11 A.M Eastern that option expires at 4 pm Eastern well it's going to be decaying a hundred percent within the next like five or six hours so obviously very fast reward and very limited risk but again you're not actually going to make that much money because you're just filling up a cup of water really really fast and you're chugging it and then that's it but it is really nice because it's consistent so honestly I've been doing this every single day for the past like two weeks because I'm pretty bearish on the market something that people don't understand is yeah I was a Tesla bull I was a palantir bull but I actually don't have it in my portfolio like if you look I don't have Tesla and I don't really have talents here in fact I'm making money on Tesla as it falls lower by doing call coded spreads and I'm only updating this on Discord because it's really impossible for me to update every single trade that I make which I do like 15 20 trades a week so you're always welcome to check that out in the first description below now I also do like selling options like this because well right now I don't want to be fully invested in the market the market is very shaky it's a bear market so rather than holding cash if I sell a zero days to expiration option it's very low risk and I can still make like 400 a day granted I am obviously trading a large amount of money but as you can see here I did make a short-term put sell on Palance here I actually did this today and so far it's down two dollars well basically it's flat but if you actually think about it you can also do weekly options on talents here or you can do this on Fridays so if palantir has an option expiration on Friday you can literally sell the same day but typically I do like to do this on spy and I also like to do this on QQQ now an alternative to selling poets because not everyone has the collateral in their portfolio is you can actually do a put credit spread instead so if I go to trade options I can just go to sell put option and as you can see here today's the 29th and I can actually do a put cred spread today and well the market closes in like 30 minutes but check this out let's say I do it for tomorrow the last day of the year so expiration is December 30. what I can do is I can literally go for the same day so let me go down to 378 and the Delta is 11. okay so super low Delta I can sell this and then buy the next leg lower from 378 to 377 and boom you have a credit of you know roughly six dollars on 94.,1.0,0.7

So you know when I look at Nvidia it is really up there. I mean this stock, if I go to the Chart, I'm going to show you the technical analysis that I look for. You can see that the volatility has increased and that's why the Bollinger band that I'm using here has also expanded. Recently Nvidia stock has continued to climb higher however the volatility is now a lot more predictable and for that reason I think this is an interesting stock to trade right now. Now you will also notice that the RSI right here is currently sitting at 70. I don't personally think that Nvidia is going to keep going too much higher, it's already a really expensive stock, the top right here is around 465. I've seen this happen on options 5 they're recommending call Credit spreads on Nvidia. So let's go to Nvidia stock, given all those reasons we are going to open up a put debit spread. We're gonna see if Nvidia does come back down to 445 that could easily happen and that's why I'm still holding this trade and I'm not closing it because I do see that Nvidia is somewhere towards the top of its range. I'm going to go to trade Nvidia options. This stock did go up to 472 and this would have been the perfect time to open up this trade on Friday actually. I personally think that Nvidia is going to go below 440. The volume has been very very hot for NVIDIA. I like Nvidia because the bid ask spread here is very tight. You do need Nvidia to fall down, I mean it would actually have to fall down to 442.90, that's where you start building up your profits. For example, say that Nvidia is currently at 456. Say that over the next week and Nvidia starts to pull back, and we saw Nvidia pulled back a lot actually, it pulled back from 479 down to 454 so that's what that's like 25, that's literally a 25 fall. If Nvidia even falls down twelve dollars, this position would gain a lot of value. If it fell down by about ten dollars, your position would actually be up. You can end up closing out this position early because Nvidia has basically done what you were hoping it would do in a very short amount of time. If I go back to Nvidia, if I sold that and I bought the 465 you can see here how now I'm spending 330 to just make 170. Then Nvidia is unlikely to reach that price.",1.0,-0.6

Invest with Henry,U-j7ejze3KQ,2023-06-28T14:04:15Z,Update on Trading Spreads,YouTube,what's happening with YouTube and my performance so there's a little bit of a mistake where people thought that my year-to-date performance was about eight percent it's actually 18 as you can see on the screen um in terms of clickbait titles I'm gonna do my very best to keep it as honest as possible with you guys not make those fancy titles but to be honest the views are up by like 50 because clickbait titles work and all my competition does it so if I don't really do it I like being a legit guy so I'm not really doing it much but once in a while don't get upset because people just click on that and you guys are telling me that it works based on my YouTube analytics like if I go into my analytics you can see here that it's the highest click-through rate ever it's the most views and it's a top performing video so um I mean not a big deal I don't really make that much on YouTube I really don't care that much but again I want to reach more people and I want to help more people learn how to invest so once in a while you know I might have some clickbait titles I'm just being honest with you okay but I'm gonna do my best not to do that,1.0,0.1
Invest with Henry,U-j7ejze3KQ,2023-06-28T14:04:15Z,Update on Trading Spreads,Discord,Discord does have a discount for July 4th which is coming very very soon so uh yeah I post all my trades and uh yeah there's a coaching call link every Monday and Wednesday There's a spreadsheet there's tons of management videos and then you have basically 24 7 access to me anytime you want so if I go into ask Henry um you know someone asked me a question we have a coach but you know someone tags me so see no one's tagged me but if they tag me like at Henry then I'm just gonna respond to like hey do I close out Tesla do I buy leap option what Delta do I pick on a spread Henry I have 15 of my money in Neo and I have you know x amount of contracts when do I get out of it or should I close or should I diversify etc etc etc and then I give Uncle insights as well so like honestly my uncle insights tab is pretty uh empty because if I did everything properly Monday and Wednesday then Friday it just like we're just laughing to the bank you know we're just like hahaha we're having a good weekend okay so I said no action needed today for expiration how was last week and that's because like literally everything went well all right I made this example in my Discord Community we were having a call and a lot of people ask me like when do you actually close are you closing it um as it hits the money if it's in between the two strikes so um it's a really complicated question because it really does depend but the the answer really is that most of the time you want to leave it open and not touch it until Friday of expiration that's where I found to be the biggest raw return Okay so by not touching it that is the best and how do you avoid getting um into that situation to begin with well there's only one way to avoid it okay so tell me if this makes sense hopefully I don't hurt anyone's feelings but I'm being super direct with you all right it's pretty simple like honestly when people draw my Discord it's like a caveman they can just follow and get results obviously they learn and do it themselves too that's cool but it's you have to be a caveman your intelligence has to be as much as a k bet to understand that you have to go out of the money I can't stand when people trade right at the money they're like oh why didn't my position blow up it's like your position blew up because you're too aggressive like of course you're going for like 55 return in in three weeks okay do you think that's possible why do you think that Warren Buffett gets 20 why do you think the stock market average is 10 and why do you think that you can get 55 in in three weeks like obviously you are taking excessive risk and it's a clear correlation okay there's a clear correlation risk returned they go like this okay I don't know why people think oh I can get a high return without risk okay well that doesn't make any sense okay it just doesn't make any sense you have to be logical here this is this is emotional game but you also have to use logic okay so it's a combination of both right just like poker It's a combination of both you have to use logic but you also have to use emotion all right so that's why you know there's so few good Traders because you know some people are way too analytical and I have lots of doctors and lawyers contacting me I have lots of clients that are you know they're very well off they're professionals and they're always like perfectionists like I want to put in more work Henry I'm going to do more I'm like if you want to work harder for the same results be my guest but it's pretty simple you only need a couple hours a week and you're going to get about the same results um as as you can get I mean putting in more work and trading gets you less results like literally uh teachers that are English teachers that have a bachelor's degree outperform physics and astrophysics and Mathematics phds who are scalping and swing trading and day trading all it's all I'm sorry I'm telling you the truth at least I'm honest okay yes I like you know I'm a coach I make money from Discord um I also make money from Trading I do both but just to be honest with you guys I'm not out here to like you know fake Guru on you and tell you oh this is going to work and this is this you can trade uh all day you get crazy results no it doesn't work like that that's why I sell uh passive income I sell that story because that's what I do why would I work harder for the same results I always tell people why would you want to be a full-time Trader this is nonsense this is so stupid you want to trade full-time by screen to be stressed out all day to get the same results I'm getting in two hours doesn't make any sense that's why I believe in you know passive income a weekly and monthly income just safe trading low volatility um because I'd rather make three to five hundred dollars a day than you know these swing Traders oh I made I made three and a half Grand they're all bragging and they spent two hours bragging only the next day they lose their profits it's like what are you wasting your life on that you have nothing better to do I always tell them like you're not going to get it tomorrow but it's going to take some time you know focus on the plan focus on the long term and uh yeah we're gonna get there so for example actually I want to show you guys a net worth calculation sheet that I always like whenever I have a new client I show them this um you know basically here there's a few nuances here right so basically um say that you're starting off with five thousand dollars okay and then let's say that you can make three percent a month so that's like 36 a year and then you're gonna be able to save and put away I always tell people if you can put away two thousand dollars a month you're good if you can't yet you should be able to in the future um and if not like there's just some something's up something's up if you can't save two thousand dollars a month you gotta upgrade your skill set I'm sorry but like you know doing something wrong if you can't save two thousand dollars a month or you're overspending okay so here's the plan um obviously 36 a year is not going to continue on into Infinity but it is pretty easy to get to Seven figures like this I mean even more than that but I don't want to promise people the world because I'm not one of those type of guys that's like oh we're gonna make one percent a day guys that I have the secret formula no it's like I don't have the secret well I have a lot of skills and I know a lot of things but it's not a secret I don't consider it a secret formula okay so I'm not going to promise people to dream and oh like everyone else I'm not I'm gonna be realistic okay so here's realistic all right put away money you get a 36 return you get to you get to Seven figures in nine years all right that doesn't excite you then you got a broke person's mentality um and that's like the wrong mentality right but uh anyways so uh listen again most people they freaking die and they uh they never get to Seven figures they they never even reach this amount so I have a plan for basically every person that joins Discord it's like hey you're going to become a millionaire not tomorrow not next year over time for sure you are going to become a millionaire it's not even that hard you can also become a 10 10 a Deca millionaire it's just time I mean New York was bought for like I don't know like seven dollars an hour's worth like 70 trillion or something or 7 trillion I don't know right but compound compounding is freaking powerful okay,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,U-j7ejze3KQ,2023-06-28T14:04:15Z,Update on Trading Spreads,Chipotle,for example I do like Chipotle a lot um and I would love to do Chipotle spreads because what are the benefits of spreads is that you can kind of get into expensive stocks right so you know there's a lot of expensive stocks out there if you sell a put option on Chipotle you need two hundred six thousand dollars that's that's a lot of money right not everyone has that laying around in fact I would say most people don't have 206 000 and most people die without even having this amount of money it's freaking sad freaking sad uh it's really tough and I get it you know most most of the wealth is really concentrated on the one percent actually took a class on a wealth inequality and stuff like that um you know I think it's important not that I'm like some kind of crazy woke guy it's like oh it's really important I just I just thought it was really uh interesting because I wanted to study wealth I wanted to understand how the wealthy how they get rich what do they do right um but anyways so you know Chipotle just super expensive so you're not going to be able to sell puts unless you're one of my doctor dentist lawyer software engineer clients which is just really just forced or you know business owners so there's only five types of people that are actually you know they're like they have decent amounts of money like multiple six figures and then obviously they make crazy money and it's really easy to work with them but I don't expect that most people are not there most people are just regular jobs you know they make 40 50k they just want to save for retirement they need to have a plan they have kids they have family they have to get to some Financial Freedom eventually you know I always tell them like you're not going to get it tomorrow but it's going to take some time you know focus on the plan focus on the long term and uh yeah we're gonna get there so for example actually I want to show you guys a net worth calculation sheet that I always like whenever I have a new client I show them this um you know basically here there's a few nuances here right so basically um say that you're starting off with five thousand dollars okay and then let's say that you can make three percent a month so that's like 36 a year and then you're gonna be able to save and put away I always tell people if you can put away two thousand dollars a month you're good if you can't yet you should be able to in the future um and if not like there's just some something's up something's up if you can't save two thousand dollars a month you gotta upgrade your skill set I'm sorry but like you know doing something wrong if you can't save two thousand dollars a month or you're overspending okay so here's the plan um obviously 36 a year is not going to continue on into Infinity but it is pretty easy to get to Seven figures like this I mean even more than that but I don't want to promise people the world because I'm not one of those type of guys that's like oh we're gonna make one percent a day guys that I have the secret formula no it's like I don't have the secret well I have a lot of skills and I know a lot of things but it's not a secret I don't consider it a secret formula okay so I'm not going to promise people to dream and oh like everyone else I'm not I'm gonna be realistic okay so here's realistic all right put away money you get a 36 return you get to you get to Seven figures in nine years all right that doesn't excite you then you got a broke person's mentality um and that's like the wrong mentality right but uh anyways so uh listen again most people they freaking die and they uh they never get to Seven figures they they never even reach this amount so I have a plan for basically every person that joins Discord it's like hey you're going to become a millionaire not tomorrow not next year over time for sure you are going to become a millionaire it's not even that hard you can also become a 10 10 a Deca millionaire it's just time I mean New York was bought for like I don't know like seven dollars an hour's worth like 70 trillion or something or 7 trillion I don't know right but compound compounding is freaking powerful okay without making this video too long let me wrap it up with uh with spreads so for example on Tripoli what I was trying to say was um I just want to show you the last liquidity and then let you guys go remote respect your time time is valuable time is money uh so uh July 21st so let's go to cell put uh uh for example really bad Tripoli is not good although I would love to do it so if you look at here look at that bid 740 and look at the ask it's 9 30. so it's trash learned that lesson and watch my playlist because my place playlist will help you uh learn how to trade options thanks,1.0,-0.2

Invest with Henry,EGdzJBfvZA8,2023-06-10T15:53:40Z,Option Rolling Strategy Is Free Money (How to ROLL Options for Beginners),Tesla,so what we can do is we can take a look at this Tesla position right here and the interesting thing is I can actually roll up for a profit as well but also increase my risk so for example um I have been selling puts on Tesla every single week and we have been doing really well as a Discord Community because this is actually a medium account account trade I do all kinds of Trades I do small account medium account and a large account trading and I also have a challenge and which is by the way the first link in the description of this video but what I'm doing is I'm selling lots of put options on Tesla I'm even utilizing some margin when I'm selling put options and I'm doing this in a very safe way so as you can see I have sold the 182 and a half put option and you know Tesla's up a lot I mean this stock is honestly going wild back to 245 dollars per share and I have made 800 on this position and I know I'm really happy about this position because as you can see my history is I did this on June 1st and now um it's going to be expiring today on June 9th as I'm making this video okay so 820 but here's the thing this has already made all of its money it's already up 97.56 percent and it's really worth almost nothing so here's what I would do you don't always have to roll down if it's in the money so if it's in the money obviously you would roll this 182 down to let's say 180 or 175 but in this scenario since all my positions are actually very profitable and we're just killing it as a group you can actually roll up to increase your risk as well so rolling actually works in two ways like I said in the beginning of the video you can minimize your losses or you can actually increase your gains so what I'm going to do right now is I have a 182 and a half put option I can go out somewhere into the Future Let's just use uh let's go out a little bit further let's go to August 18 let's say that you're a little bit of a laser Trader but you still want to make lots of money but you're as busy as a lawyer doctor or other professional then you can actually go like two months out three months out there's nothing wrong with that now Tesla is currently a 245 dollars per share so what I can do is I can roll this option higher not too high obviously I don't want to have too much risk but I can move it up to say two hundred dollars okay so this is still a 20 Delta all right not that pretty good implied volatility is 56.15 now this is really important because when I'm picking stocks I really want volatile ones with higher implied volatility because higher implied volatility is better the premium is higher and when the premium is higher I can collect more income and again is there a difference between rolling an option and closing a position to open a new one no there isn't but I really like to do it in one transaction so what I'm going to do here is I can actually move from 182 and a half and open up to 200 so I'm going to click this right here you can see here that the time change is 70 days I'm collecting a really nice snack credit of 7.66 which is 766 dollars,1.0,0.95
Invest with Henry,EGdzJBfvZA8,2023-06-10T15:53:40Z,Option Rolling Strategy Is Free Money (How to ROLL Options for Beginners),SPY,my folios already invested in the S P 500 2500 shares so basically what I'm trying to get at is I'm using margin to sell puts and this isn't the safest strategy nor do I recommend using margin I think you need a lot of experience for that preferably you're in my Discord for at least six months and you're profitable but I do want to show you how I am rolling a position and how I turned a losing trade into a winning trade and this is super important especially for a small portfolio a medium portfolio or heck even a large portfolio it really helps to not lose money and that's kind of the key to success is in the long term if you don't lose a lot of money on certain trades then well you're going to be fine right because you're going to win some trades you're going to win big on some trades and if you can minimize your losers or ideally not even have any losers then you're set up for a lot of success over the Long-Haul and even over the short haul right you're going to make a ton of money and basically let me ask you this if every trade that you made ended up being a winner and then every trade that was a loser you actually turned that loser into a break even what would your profits look like how how would your results look like and this is actually one of the biggest secrets to growing a small portfolio because a lot of people out there they're trying to grow a small portfolio which is amazing right but one of the biggest issues is it doesn't take too much to really break down a small portfolio if you just have a couple losses then you can turn you know 5K into like 2K right you can lose a lot of money so rolling can save you from losing that money right so for example let's go over the first stock that I ended up rolling and this was a very interesting role and at one point it actually showed negative thirty thousand dollars or even more than negative thirty thousand dollars now I was kind of panicking because yeah I've experienced some losses just like everyone else has right I'm not immune to the market falling however I'm on 150 margin actually 152 percent if you do the math I mean this is about 800 000 position this is 280 so that's one point that's one million eighty thousand and then if I go into spy you'll see that here I have about something like nine hundred thousand dollars yep about nine hundred thousand dollars so I have about a two million dollar investment and even a little bit more than that because I do have some Apple shares these Apple shares right here let's see how much I have in equity 57k so I mean still a lot of money right that is probably the size of most people's portfolios out there but obviously I've been doing this for like nine years so that's why I have large portfolio it took me a lot of time to definitely get to this point but anyways if you'll notice I have about a two million dollars worth of Investments yet my portfolio size is only 1.4 million dollars so I'm basically borrowing around 50 I do have some other positions like Oatley and xly selling American Airlines puts we're really successful in this by the way in the Discord but anyways what I'm doing is I'm borrowing money and I cannot lose my money and that means that you probably also can't lose your money even if you're not using margin again I'm not recommending margin I think that is a thing that you do when you're super Advanced you're part of a community and you have some guidance at least doing it yourself can get really really risky by the way you can always schedule a free call by clicking that first link in the description to join the option coaching Academy but essentially what I want to do is I want to protect myself from ever ever losing money so let's go into spy Spy right here I currently have the 397 put so if I go into my history you can see that this this isn't just a put cell I didn't just go ahead and sell puts this is actually a short put role now what this means and the reason why it says this is because I previously had a position that didn't really go well and let me show you what that looks like so previously you can see here that on 610 which is on June 10th I had the 408 put okay now obviously spy has gone down a lot if I go down to the one month this is actually the option view itself but I have to go back to the stock view so let me go back to the stock view lets quickly look at what happened for three months so for three months this thing is down 13.57 percent and I sold a 408 put so clearly it went below 408 and I would have had to buy a whole lot of contracts let's see how many contracts I would have to buy 20 contracts so again 20 contracts times the 400 dollars would be 800 Grand and as you guys can see I do not have 800 Grand in my account so I need to do something to basically protect myself from losing all of this money or you know of course I can use margin to get put 800 Grand worth of stock but you know what there's an interest rate to that and and I do not want to pay interest on eight hundred thousand dollars of loan money so the secret to not having to pay interest is by Rolling that position and basically you can keep rolling until you become profitable so let me go back into this 397 put option let me show you how I protected myself and basically got myself out of a really bad situation I mean I was in a complete pickle it was like that OMG moment I don't know you guys probably experienced that at one point in your life you're like OMG is my life over or are things about to get really really bad what do I do and you got to think really hard and critically on how to get out of that situation but luckily with option trading you don't have to be super quick you're just think it through and the best thing that you can do is roll down so it's called it's called rolling down actually what I did was I rolled down and out so for example let me go back here I had a 408 put okay this was expiring on 6 10 on June 10th um so what I did was I bought back 20 of the contracts okay now that would be super expensive because 20 contracts times 16 would be what like thirty two thousand dollars so I like I said I was down over thirty thousand dollars so this would be a thirty two thousand dollar in fact might have even a little bit more than thirty two thousand dollars because of this 34 cents here so it was probably like thirty two thousand six hundred eighty dollars so I had a big hole in my pocket now if I were just to buy this back that hole will be permanently burnt like my wallet that got stolen when I was traveling okay that wallet was gone I never got it back unfortunately I had to get all those credit cards back and order them to Europe right but what you can do to actually kind of get your wallet back or get your money back right so let's say you have a hole that's burnt in your pocket that wallet just fell through the cracks and someone found it well what if I told you that you could basically have like a line like a rope attached to your wallet so when someone was trying to take your wallet or when it just fell out you would have felt it like dragging on the ground or you would have felt a tug basically all I'm saying is there's like a safety net to protecting yourself from losing your wallet and in option trading the way you don't lose your wallet and you don't burn your cash is by Rolling so these 20 contracts right here I bought them back the 408 was a strike and the date was 610 then what I did was you can see here that I closed but then I actually opened simultaneously you can see right here that was like 1206 pm and then I um opened another 20 contracts by selling them also at 1206 pm on June 10th now in this situation though I went down so you can see I went from four-way to 397. if you do the math there that's 11 might not seem like a lot but 11 since each option is a hundred shares eleven dollars actually one thousand one hundred dollars and because this is 20 contracts I ended up saving about 11 times 20 which is two hundred twenty dollars times a hundred which is 22 000 in collateral so I'm going down by twenty two thousand dollars I have saved myself twenty two thousand dollars and guess how much you already know this you can already see on my screen guess how much I had to pay to save twenty two thousand dollars I paid one thousand dollars to save twenty two thousand dollars this is called a roll this is rolling down and Robin Hood and many other brokers is out there right I like Robin Hood because it's super simple I've been using it for a long time so it is kind of hard for me to transition but you can use this on any broker out there even if you're in Canada right there's quite straight there's other Brokers out in Canada but it doesn't really matter whatever brokerage you have and by the way you don't even have to have this button for example you don't have to have a roll button in your brokerage you can just close it out and then as soon as possible open up a new position manually in two trades but Robinhood allows you to do it in one trade which is amazing okay so this is the button where you would do it at okay it says roll this position Now quickly just to recap I went from 610 to 715 so you know I had to wait a little bit more this is about a five week period okay a little bit less than five weeks so I had to roll out five weeks and then I rolled down which is a benefit to me by twenty two thousand dollars so I actually ended up saving twenty one thousand dollars because I'm saving 22k but I paid a thousand so ended up saving 21 000 for about five weeks so twenty one thousand dollars for five weeks that's like four thousand dollars a month okay amazing obviously I have larger portfolio but even if you have a smaller portfolio just apply the same principles to a small position you could sell a balance here put out option for eight dollars and fifty cents and if it goes down to eight dollars you can roll it from 850 down to eight dollars there you go you would say fifty dollars so when you click roll this position all right it is going to give me the opportunity to take my current position of 397 and right now spy is lower than 397. so for example let's say that you know bearish I'm afraid or whatever I just want to roll down again I can roll to a future date so my current expiration date is June 15 and I can roll out to let's say another 30 days or even less than 30 days it doesn't matter I can go for less than 30 days so August 12th okay so I'm gonna go for August 12th this is less than 30 days out now I'm going to show you a couple different scenarios okay so if I went from 397 and I actually just kept it at well there is no 397 for some reason but if I rolled it down to 396 you actually see here that I would collect 6980 literally nothing has changed in fact a little bit has changed I'm actually benefiting myself down by a dollar but really not much has changed let's just pretend this is basically the same strike but because I'm going out in terms of expiration date right so I'm going from July 15 to August 12th because I'm going out about 30 days actually like 28 or 27 days actually 28 days it says right there I'm actually going to collect a credit this is really important I'm actually collecting a credit and I'm basically doing nothing this whole premium is actually coming from time value this is all coming because you know options have Theta which is time Decay and because I'm going out for an extra 28 days there's inherently a little bit more risk because it's 20 days out so because it's 28 days out I'm getting paid I'm getting compensated about seven thousand dollars for going out but wait you don't actually have to pick the same strike you can go down as I just showed you so let's just say that you know you don't know if spy is going to go up or whatever stock is going to go up right let's say you think it can pretty much stay the same or whatever you think you can go up but maybe it's not going to go up to the 397 Mark you can go down as you can see by the premium even if I go down to 390 390 right here I can again buy myself seven dollars you can see from 397 to 390 I'm buying myself seven dollars 20 contracts for this is 4 fourteen thousand dollars so I'm basically saving fourteen thousand dollars by Rolling this option and it's not a big amount of money I'm getting a net credit of nine dollars it's 180 bucks but basically I'm getting paid to save money so I'm getting paid 180 to save fourteen thousand dollars so this is a win-win this is how you would roll a losing position so you can continuously roll on a monthly basis or even on a weekly for every two week basis you can continuously roll down and down and down and eventually You're Gonna Roll Down enough to the point where that stock is going to be higher than your put price okay So eventually you can actually never lose money by continuously rolling and this especially works on very very safe stocks like spy,1.0,0.7

Invest with Henry,EGdzJBfvZA8,2023-06-10T15:53:40Z,Option Rolling Strategy Is Free Money (How to ROLL Options for Beginners),XLY,I do have some other positions like Oatley and xly selling American Airlines puts we're really successful in this by the way in the Discord. now I do want to show you exactly what I did as well on xly so xly is another position that I had that I was down a lot of money on and it's the same situation as SP why so I want to show you this exact example as well so you get a better understanding you can actually Master rolling options because I think this is the most important skill that you can literally have in option trading for at least managing your risk okay there's more important things like how to enter a stock which strategy to use technical analysis but for managing a position and most importantly managing your risk and not losing money because I've talked to so many people in Discord who before them joining the Discord they're down like tens of thousands of dollars or you know I've seen people down even more than that right or even a few thousand dollars that is still sad to see because your hard-earned money is important you do not want to lose it and as Warren Buffett says rule number one don't lose money and rule number two is to look at rule number one so basically you really don't want to lose money and just to paint the picture okay I'm gonna paint the picture of why it's so bad to lose money imagine this so let's say you have a hundred dollars you invested a hundred dollars okay you did something really risky it didn't work out and you're down 50 okay so you know how much would you have you're probably saying I would have fifty dollars exactly so you went from 100 to 50 you're down 50 but check this out to go from fifty dollars to a hundred dollars it's not a 50 gain it is now a double on your money you actually have to double fifty dollars to get back to your original hundred dollars and that's why it is so detrimental to your long-term success it is so bad when you're losing money because losing money is way worse than just staying even or breaking even right or obviously breaking out a small profit but when you lose money that is going to be much more difficult to make back so you want to protect yourself at all costs against losing money in your portfolio so that's basically what I'm always trying to do in terms of risk management and really good risk management means that yes you can lose money sometimes but your winners far outweigh your losers and when you do lose that loss is very minimal okay so I had xly I sold the put option and as you'll see right here it also says short put role so if I open up xly see right here that I actually bought back same date right it was the same day it was two minutes later I bought back the 150 puts the 150 put was way in the money I would have to pay about ten thousand dollars to buy it all back but instead you know obviously I bought it back and then I rolled it so I actually ended up selling 20 contracts to replace the 20 that I previously had but now I went down to 141 make sure that you keep watching some more videos in my option playlist to master your option Trading,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,NnT_PoNKu7I,2023-06-06T22:13:09Z,LEAPs Options Apple 2X Small Account FAST,Apple,so as you can see Apple is very resilient although we're going through a bear Market Apple is still holding very steady in comparison to most other stocks I currently own 700 shares and it's about eight percent of my portfolio but say that I wanted to increase my exposure and say you don't necessarily have as much cash that I have in my portfolio now this isn't a bad thing we all have to start somewhere so what you would do is you would go to trade Apple options. I'm going to be buying a call option on Apple now notice if you were to buy a hundred shares of Apple how much would that cost the answer is about fourteen thousand seven hundred fifty dollars right because that's 100 shares. There's an 80 chance that Apple will be above 120 dollars per share by September 15 2023 but actually these options are mispriced a long-term option is really mispriced because on a long-term basis the stock market always goes up the chances for Apple to be less than 120 per share is very low in fact the chance is about 20 percent according to the Greeks. Apple Google all these high quality tech stocks I would love to do leap options on them. If I think that apple is stalling out if I don't think it has any more room for upside then I'm going to cut this position and just leave it at a 25 gain on my money and basically that's going to happen in about six months now if I think Apple has some more room for upside I'm not going to close the option instead of closing this option I'm going to aim for more upside so if this option were to go up to about 177 dollars per share in that case I'd be much closer to about a 50 return so if there is more room for upside I am going to cut it but later I'm going to cut it maybe 177 per share or even higher than that and then I'm going to Target to do this two times a year so 50 two times is going to add up to about a 2X return on a yearly basis this is much easier to scale than just buying shares because if you think about it the stock going from 147 to about 177 it isn't that much upside it's only a 20 return however you're making a 50 return so basically you're getting two and a half times leverage or two and a half times the return you're actually putting up less risk up front because you're putting up less of a dollar cost upfront in capital for me doing leap options on Apple makes a lot of sense rather than owning Apple shares I think this strategy can return a lot higher than just owning stock outright I actually think you can manage your risk very well by cutting this position when it reaches 167 dollars per share for example or on the flip side say that apple is going to pull back if it pulls back by about 10 percent you would lose roughly the same amount however that amount will be on a lot less money up front so you would lose less money than a stockholder.,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,Dowsg15COoQ,2023-06-04T15:15:00Z,My $2.8 Million Dollar Portfolios. TSLA. PLTR. AMZN + More,Nio,I love Neo okay I know Neo has volatility but Neo is a good company to trade options on okay if you're just holding Neo you're not getting the most fantastic returns because Neo has not had the best performance but if you're trading Neo options you're selling puts you're doing covered calls this is a really good strategy and specifically I'm gonna go into why it's a good strategy so if we go into Neo right now you'll notice that Neo auctions are very attractive for a specific reason so despite obviously the stock peaking way over 50 per share I sold it around like you know forty dollars per share I actually got in around like these prices back in like 2020 I was making YouTube videos on Neo okay so I was really really early I did write it up I didn't sell the peak guys I'm not a genius okay I'm not a miracle worker I'm not I'm not like a bser okay they're just trying to sell the dream okay because I didn't sell at the top I wasn't smart enough I don't think anyone's smart enough I think it takes a lot of luck but I noticed that the trend was going down and I wanted to protect my profits so around 40 per share I got out of Neo but then as this company continues to break down I think at this point it makes sense like right here I know we're a little bit lower than this right now but nonetheless this makes a lot of sense to me under ten dollars I mean that makes complete sense to me to be invested for the long term because we don't know when it's going to recover I I have no clue nobody knows right all these people predicting these gurus that predict the stock will go up or down um they're literally as right as a quarter right the quarters heads or tails and they're the same heads or tails in fact sometimes they're even worse because they're usually recommending hype stocks that are at the peak okay I don't do that all right I'm going for Value I am going for growth as well I do like growth stocks but I like to go for Value I want to get a good price so as you can see uh my average cost on Neo right now is eight dollars per share because I sold some put options and I'm running the wheel shot at you okay. I mean for example Neo okay yes I have 2 000 shares okay but if you sell one put option on Neo to get the wheel started then it's only eight dollars okay and eight dollars times 100 shares is 800 bucks so you can literally trade with just 800 bucks and start making consistent cash flow okay. you'll see right here that I got assigned Neo at eight dollars per share and then I just went ahead we looked at my history I like to show everything guys I'm not you know just hey do this let's take a look so my history is I sold a put on Neo um to to get in it looks like at eight dollars right uh this is 20 this actually 20 contracts right here you'll see so 20 contracts I sold it for dirt cheap for four dollars and Neo ended up crashing so um yeah I ended up kind of getting hurt here um this was not the best position right but I'm honest this is not a bad position and I do not mind at all because with the wheel strategy you're supposed to like the put that you sell you're supposed to like it if you don't you're being silly and you're gambling and you're chasing um High premium and you're chasing High premium at the expense of not high quality okay. so look on Neo very simple small portfolio medium portfolio large portfolio I don't care if you have a five million dollar portfolio and you run a big business okay it doesn't matter you can sell some puts using safe risk management okay. so look Neo Eight dollar put I ended up selling it for 80 bucks not a lot of money okay that's not gonna build a whole lot of wealth but you know this is a short-term trade this is only a three-day trade and I like that right. but essentially on that Monday slash Tuesday because of the holiday I ended up collecting 640 on this position okay so um you can see right here I'm already up about 40 return now this is not a small position it's like a medium position fifteen thousand dollars but this is what I'm doing with Neil it does you don't need a lot of money to do this strategy it's a very consistent strategy,1.0,0.7

Let's get into it. Right here, Coinbase doesn't have any price to earnings because hey, this stock isn't that good. It doesn't have any earnings. It's losing money. Okay, so this stock was trading at a 52-W week high of 290 and many many YouTubers were pushing the stock at 290 and I've never had it. I did not blow up my account on Coinbase. Anyways, without wasting too much time, let's go into Coinbase. I'm actually going to show you how to make money. Okay, Coinbase call credit spreads. And the reason for it again is because this stock is in bearish territory. Look at it the three months. Okay, it's negative 35.9%. Okay, people are blowing up their money. People are very upset. I'm going to show you how to do this on Coinbase, but I'm also going to show you my other positions on Airbnb and Tesla because I think you can really, really benefit, okay? Okay, I'm bearish on Coinbase, but it doesn't mean just because I'm bearish and I don't think this is an amazing stock, it still doesn't mean that I'm going to sell a call option at just 43, right? So, look, so coin 96 implied volatility. I'm going to go ahead and sell this. I would play Airbnb, Amazon, and Coin because they have really good implied volatility.",1.0,-0.4

Let's get into it. I'm going to show you how to do this on Coinbase, but I'm also going to show you my other positions on Airbnb and Tesla because I think you can really, really benefit, okay? The first one is going to be Airbnb. Okay, Airbnb is a very interesting stock. I've been looking at it closely for a long time and I specifically think that there's a lot of competition. So, this strategy benefits when a stock doesn't go higher. So, if I go to the chart right now and I look at the technical analysis, you will notice that Airbnb goes up a lot and then it goes down. And that's because Airbnb volatility is going up. This is capturing a lot more potential movement in Airbnb. So, look, this stock took a nose dive from 127 down to 106. And that's why my current position right here has benefited a lot. Okay, so currently Airbnb is 10660. I don't expect this stock to heat up or I also don't expect it to really have any more further dips. I do expect this stock to go pretty much sideways, but if it does heat up, it could go back up to its moving average of 116. Okay, Airbnb, I'm already up on this 1451 150 call credit spread. And now this Airbnb call credit spread expires on July 21st. So, I would play Airbnb, Amazon, and Coin because they have really good implied volatility. So, for example, if I'm holding Airbnb poker spreads, which I wouldn't do since I don't like the stock, but as it plows down, say that I have the $113 strike, as soon as it hits here right at 113, I would probably say, ""Hey, I'm out.""",1.0,-0.3

Let's get into it. All right, so the next thing that I really want to talk about is going to be Amazon. I think Amazon is a really good breadandbut trade for me, especially using put credit spreads. So, for Amazon, I've actually been trading put credit spreads for quite some time. Amazon as a stock has shot up quite a bit. In fact, in the past 12 months, it is up uh 12%, excuse me, in the past month, it's up 12%. And um this is a good stock to be selling put credit spreads on. However, since it is high, it's getting riskier to sell the put credit spreads on. But, I want to open up my position. For some reason, uh Robin Hood is not showing it at the moment. Now, the way a put credit spread works is actually very similar to a call credit spread, but it's the opposite. Okay, so you're going to be selling one put option. That's cool, right? We're going to sell a put option at 97. Okay, that's a whole lot of money. But now, we're going to buy another put option at 93. So, you can see how I made this trade on May 10th. basically going out 30 days. So, I would play Airbnb, Amazon, and Coin because they have really good implied volatility.",1.0,0.7

I have American Airlines I have craft Heinz I'm just trying to look for an example where my covered call has made a lot of money and I may want to roll it down lower because of the stock most likely fell a lot.,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,cGGz3Q9Fhic,2023-05-23T17:00:27Z,Covered Calls in 10 minutes - Option Trading For Beginners,Neo,there's a difference between Neo stock which has more volatility and then Kraft Heinz which is a very stable stock Warren Buffett owns it so this company is not moving a lot and for that reason I want to do closer to the money covered calls... so let's just take a look at Neo again for example it has a really strong support at 825 but for example let's say that this goes down a lot and it breaks support and it ends up falling to be honest I don't even know where it would fall because it's already such a value stock but let's just say that it goes down to seven dollars well in that scenario what you're going to want to do is actually roll your strike lower I won't actually hold the position until expiration in that scenario,1.0,0.0

Invest with Henry,cGGz3Q9Fhic,2023-05-23T17:00:27Z,Covered Calls in 10 minutes - Option Trading For Beginners,SPY,I also have spy so spy could be a really good example for us yeah let's go into spy Spy is a perfect example because I have a lot of money in spy specifically if we take a look at my position I have about 85 of my portfolio and spy at the moment this is basically the Rock and the stability in my portfolio kind of like the anchor because I look at spy for diversification I have a lot of money at this point right two million dollars so I don't want to invest my entire 2 million dollars in single stock so what I do is I make my life a lot simpler by investing in S P 500 and I also have single stocks as well but S P 500 is really my anchor and it provides me income because I am doing the covered call strategy hence the title of this video on spy as well so as you can see a big position on spy 84.5 3000 shares I have 1.2 million dollars and what I want to point out is that the current stock price is 412. and the position that I have right now is the 419 covered call all now if you'll notice that if spy goes down my covered call is benefiting so if I expand this covered call right now I want to show you something really interesting about managing and also rolling and adjusting a position to make more money with it using the covered call strategy so the 419 covered call is what I have right now and you'll notice that I'm Up 3 420 now this is interesting because spy is falling down and obviously my covered call position is benefiting it's creating income is decaying which is fantastic because when you're an option seller you want the stock to basically stand still potentially fold down a bit if you're doing the covered call strategy but ideally it stands about still so that's exactly what Spy is doing and that's exactly why I've been making so much money on spy it's very stable as you can see I just did this last week and I made about 630 dollars and then again I'm up about 3 420 which is you know a pretty good stable return if I'm able to do this on a weekly basis then I'm making about twelve thousand dollars a month just on spy that's a very safe massive consistent income for me so I want to show you how to roll this though because check it out I've already made about 13 now this is not as high of a percentage as I want to see to roll this position but for example purposes I've already made three thousand four hundred twenty dollars so if I want to make more money and I don't think that spy is going to go up a lot I think it's going to continue to be stable what I'll actually do is I will roll down now I've shown you guys before and I've shown my Discord how to roll up which is protecting your gains okay this is actually making more money which is slightly different so what I will do here is I have spy 419 covered call I'm going to go to roll this position okay and because spy is pretty stable and it's falling down a little bit what I'm going to do is I'm going to roll down so right now I have the June 16 expiration so let's just say I still want to use June 16. you don't always have to roll out although you could so I can use June 16 or I can just do june 30. let's just use June 30 because it's a very slight change it's only a few extra days actually two weeks about 14 days out first further but now what I will do is I will go from 419 down to let's just say 418 okay this is not even a big deal this is a very small difference but if I just move down by one yes I'm increasing my risk very slightly but I'm also collecting a total credit of five thousand one hundred dollars so rolling can make a very significant difference in your profits and there's a lot of benefits to Rolling as well because if the stock is moving up and you can't make any more money you can roll up and out that's going to give you the benefit of having more capital appreciation and collecting more income and the biggest mistake is to sometimes just hold a position and let it expire because if it's already in the money and it continues to go up then you are leaving money on the table so if that happens what you want to do next is you want to roll up what I want to do in this scenario is I'm actually going to roll down because the benefit of rolling down is I get an extra five thousand one hundred dollars yes I'm increasing by 14 days but because spy is trending a little bit lower I can make a little bit more money now this is still safe risk management because I'm only going down by about one dollar and risk management is super important so what you would not want to do is you would not want to go from 419 down to 412 which would be the current stock price because if spy just goes up like one percent you're going to miss out a lot of gains so I would not change your strike prices too drastically what I usually do is I adjust my strike prices very slightly to make more money to protect my gains or to reduce my risk and that's really important because reducing your risk and reducing the volatility in your portfolio not only will make you feel better but it's also going to look a lot better in your results because when you have less volatility and more stability then you just basically see a portfolio that's consistently going up like if I go to my year-to-date return you will notice that you know it doesn't have a lot of volatility so it's very easy for me and it's also simple for me just to rely on this income and just to prove that I do rely on this income if I go into my portfolio I just want to show you that I am consistently taking money out I'm withdrawing from my portfolio so if I go to transfers right now I'll show you that I'm consistently taking money out of my portfolio because I do use this portfolio to pay my team my team cost me over fifty thousand dollars a month so I am taking a lot of money out of my portfolio and I use this for lifestyle and I also pay my team

Invest with Henry,wyLI5JKZy8A,2023-05-22T16:30:08Z,SPY Options Strategy - Profitably Day Trade and Long-term Trade SPY,SPY,"hey what's going on guys so in this video I want to talk about my spy strategy I want to go over both my portfolios and how much spy I have what positions I'm running right I have so much spy and that I'm going to basically plot it on an Excel sheet and show you how I think about risk my Delta exposure managing my position uh potentially ruling my position as well so now I have so much to trade on Monday and that probably means I may add to spy but also other positions but anyways let's go to spy right here but let's go to um spy so it's currently 418 okay I have about 3,000 shares that's a whole lot of shares about 82% of my portfolio I do a little bit of zero DTE trading on spy as well just in general spy is super easy and straightforward to trade and honestly you can have your entire portfolio in spy it's not a huge problem for risk management since spy has basically 500 companies within it it's an index fund it has you know technology Financial Services Etc unfortunately the position expired so I wanted to show you how large I go on spy and I'm going to be adding to it Monday morning but since this is not currently my account I mean it is what it is my position is going to look smaller but I most likely will open like half a million dollars worth of spy on Monday maybe even more than that in theory one could argue my exposure to spy in this portfol folio is not 3,000 in fact it's 1,500 and again it's because I have 3,000 shares but my covered calls have a you know 50 Delta so half my position is in theory able or likely to get sold off so that's this my expected exposure now let's go into my TDM Merit trate account so I currently have 400 shares of spy my next position which is uh spy 390 and I have 10 contracts I have a million doll exposure in spy this is how I think about it although um clearly my portfolio values are probably pushing almost 3 mil so I have about 33% or 33% of my account value in spy although it's tying up most of my Capital again I don't really mind tying up a lot of my capital in spy because it is so Diversified if it goes down by a dollar it's getting closer to my put option and because it's getting closer my put option is more likely you know to be in the money so right now it's an 11 Delta but if it moves down by a dollar what's the new Delta well actually if it moves down by a dollar you multiply the Dollar by the gamma which is 01 okay the answer is 01 because a1ar * 01 is 01 and then you're just going to add that to Delta so the new Delta will be2 if it goes down $2 it'll be3 and then $3 it will be you know4 right so but gamma also increases so the closer it gets to the money the more the gamma will be so this is just an example so as you can see this is a huge position but I'm not worried about it from a risk management perspective because the gamma is very low and yes my Delta is very low it can get higher but it's not changing by much because this option is very out of the money it's expiring in less than a month so the chances of this going to the money is very low even if the stock is moving down or the ETF spy is moving down right even if spy moves down by a dollar uh the gamma is not going to change by too much even if spy moves down a dollar I like literally my gamma changes by like one which is like nothing it's like what like $1,000 whatever the math is right it's it's very low it's a very low amount even though yeah it's $1,000 I have 30 contracts yes I'm it's like a $30,000 difference for me at most and at least it's like you know it's not much it's like four contracts is like H it's nothing right Now if spy moves down by a dollar then this Delta will be 38 so my exposure will go from 320k to 380k that's a huge jump that's a $60,000 jump whereas with my the rest of my portfolio if spy moves down a dollar I like literally my gamma changes by like one which is like nothing it's like what like $1,000 whatever the math is right it's it's very low it's a very low amount even though yeah it's $1,000 I have 30 contracts yes I'm it's like a $30,000 difference for me at most and at least it's like you know it's not much it's like four contracts is like H it's nothing right",1.0,0.7

They're commission free as well as Robinhood so that's really good. I've had a lot of issues with Robinhood because Robinhood actually froze my account for some time and that's also why I was looking at other brokerage accounts. I have a big Robin Hood portfolio as well I just want to spread my money across because you never know what's going to happen.

MooMoo was founded in Silicon Valley and was backed by a NASDAQ listed fintech which has nearly 20 million users worldwide. MooMoo is a Hands-On brokerage it also has zero commissions and it also has option trading. I'm currently under the option analysis tool it gives you volume it gives you volatility term structure gives you volatility smile gives you open interest by strike price and I have just added one thousand dollars to the platform. If you're having issues with Robinhood MooMoo is a great alternative. I am a big fan of MooMoo because as an easy to use Pro grade tools and the tools are free. For example I use the price calculator a lot and I think it's useful for option Traders no matter if you're a beginner or experienced investor. The MooMoo platform is basically telling you right here that there is a deviation in the theoretical price. I also really like that they're listing the Greeks right here so Delta gamma Vega Theta and row this is an example of the price calculator tool that I use. They're commission free as well as Robinhood so that's really good commission free is always good they're easy to use Pro grade tools which are also amazing for options they have 24 7 customer support for me that's really important. I finally took MooMoo up in their opportunity to deposit money start getting free stocks and also tell you guys about the opportunity of MooMoo. This is what it looks like if you have zero dollars you open up a free account then you get a free stock you deposit 100 you get five free stocks and then if you deposit a thousand you get a total of 15 free stocks. I put a thousand dollars into MooMoo. I'm planning on adding more money into MooMoo. MooMoo has phenomenal startup bonuses. Thank you MooMoo for sponsoring this video. At the very least I would recommend you guys putting a small amount of money into MooMoo to try out the platform there is a lot of tools the platform is very clean 24 7 customer service and you get 15 free stocks when you sign up depending on your deposit.,1.0,0.9

making well not ended up I'm still making money on the stock itself and then I also have a covered call the really cool thing is I mean I show everything guys I don't have anything to hide I'm just going to go into my history you know people always show you their wins but they never share their losses um I actually think on Baba I only have wins obviously I have losses and other stuff but um I only have wins on Baba it's just been an amazing company Baba Neo I mean Palance here you guys know I've been talking about palantir forever so if you watch this channel I mean you're making money I I'm sure I've already made you several thousand dollars if you've been following my channel um religiously and you have the Bell notification on and you're subscribed it's always amazing to be a subscriber because whenever I release videos sometimes they're very insightful they're like actionable so anyways Alibaba um 3350 I ended up holding this for a good amount of time so I can't like really brag that this is a lot of money because it's not I only made 400 but I'm really proud of this position because I'm not really an option buyer but here I did end up buying some options right I bought 10 contracts of the Alibaba 83 call option and it ended up doing really well but in between there was a lot of turmoil I mean actually let me show you the turmoil because in between it was very volatile I mean robust stock was going up and down and at some point I actually thought I had to close it for a loss but things ended up going really well but I'll show you kind of like the process in between because many people with like weak hands or like not that much experience would end up you know basically dropping this call option losing a bunch of money and complaining that you know option trading doesn't work but it's really it's because you have to get a little bit better don't wish life was easier wish you were better whoever said that quote right I really like that quote because I mean I grew up with nothing my parents came to the states um I mean my mom came pregnant actually so Mom came pregnant had me and then for the first 20 years of my life we had literally nothing and my parents never spent any money and everything was super difficult so it wasn't easy but you know I'm really proud that I'm you know self-made and all of this trading and and being a successful coach as well I'm not gonna lie guys I do well as a coach and that's because I'm a great coach I love coaching people I'm passionate about it and all my students get success I mean at least 90 percent of people get a success the ones that take you seriously anyways but we were talking about Alibaba so you know I kind of want to show you a little bit of like emotional Control Management this is stuff that people don't really talk about I know everyone wants to see like how do you buy a call option at 10x or money and that's that's cool guys but what I'm trying to teach you is how to be a better Trader how to have a better psychology how to have a better mindset okay how to be like just an ultimate mindful good investor okay that's really important as an investor it's not about mathematics or physics those guys on Wall Street actually don't do that well I sat next to plenty of Traders and let me tell you like the best Trader has really just had a good mindset they came in hungry they came in willing to learn and you know the craziest thing is Jeff Bezos talks about this is some of the smartest people are actually able to change their mind really fast so let's say you're in a bad situation and you're in love with the company well you might have to change that position get out of it but anyways let's check this out okay Baba April 25th all right so let's look at April 25th and again if you're watching this in the future all of my teachings I try to make them Evergreen and available for you so even if you watch in the future you get a lot of value I try not to make too many things like in this very moment because to be honest all these YouTubers that are making like in the moment stock videos they're just pumping for more views and I don't really care about that I just want to make sure that I'm educating you to my highest ability but you know let's look at April what was it April 25th I believe yes so it's April 25th so I ended up buying calls on April 25th and yes that's because Alibaba keeps going up and down and I was pretty sure that it's going to go up down and then on the 25th yes it was a pretty good bottom right I mean at least I thought it was on this three-month chart it was yeah essentially was hitting a bottom so I ended up buying some call options here now what happened next was not that great because on April 25th I ended up buying call options and it pretty much did nothing I mean it went up a little bit then down and yeah I ended up losing money well I didn't lose money I was losing money on paper but I had a big belief that this stock would bounce back and it would do well so I told my Discord Community everyone was asking me are we going to close this position we have a big paper loss the big paper loss was about 1500 so that's pretty significant especially for folks with smaller portfolios so I felt really bad about this trade that I ended up buying call options and I felt really bad because because you know whenever I trade I make a trade my reputation's on the line I want to make sure that I am doing the best job possible because I mean it's not just my money everyone basically follows my trades so whenever I have a trade then everyone either makes money or loses money and my goal is to be really really safe and conservative because I have a lot of investors that are close to retirement you know they have 500k accounts or more and I mean I don't know about you and I'm pretty sure this applies to everyone but we don't want to lose our hard-earned money I mean making money is extremely difficult uh I mean I again I grew up with nothing and when I made like two thousand dollars I was super happy super blessed and going to Chipotle to me was like oh my God I get to actually go and eat out at a restaurant and I was like 21 22 at that point so I'm really appreciative of what I've built and I understand that you guys are probably in a similar boat you don't want to lose your money you basically need a plan to grow it consistently and secure your retirement even if you're not retiring yet you still need to get there at some point and I'm really happy that I'm part of your journey but you know check it out so Alibaba went from you know the 25th from 82-29 to essentially you know nowhere 82.95 right um I almost closed it here guys I literally almost closed it but you know it was 5 10 I said you know we're going to hold this until expiration I really have a feeling um you know based on what I've seen Baba do in the past I think that we can pull up and then we woke up next day on on the 11th it was a Thursday this actually last Thursday I said guys we're out of here we are out of here on May 11th we are done we are taking our 400 of profit this has been a tough what was it like a tough two weeks I mean I didn't lose that much money but this position was down probably about 50 percent and then in just one day we ended up having a gain so ended up getting out of this position for a 400 game,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,VLQxZxYDJ2E,2023-05-16T22:00:13Z,Margin Trading - Nobody Understands This.,TD Ameritrade,now this is a portfolio that I have with TD Ameritrade now this is a portfolio that I have with TD Ameritrade and I also have a Robinhood portfolio now in the description you're going to see a link for Robinhood I think they're one of the best because because they are fairly easy to get level 3 approval and they also have no fees whereas TD Ameritrade has a lot of fees and that's why I decide on this account to go more big I'm using big account strategy so I'm not selling any small cap stocks I'm actually going for things that are really huge so as you can see I have spy and actually I have a whole lot of spy then I also have triple Q I actually have Chipotle and Amazon now this portfolio right here is not that huge I'm actually going to calculate how much margin I'm using I'm using a ridiculous amount of margin however this portfolio is actually doing really well so let's jump into the math of my portfolio right now and then after I do the math what we're going to do is we're actually going to go over the strategies the management of the strategies my thought my logic around it and all that good stuff okay so let's just start off so I'm going to actually calculate the math right in front of your eyes okay the first one is Amazon I have a hundred dollar put I have seven contracts okay so each put option is ten thousand dollars and if I have seven of these that's seventy thousand dollars now the next thing I'm doing is Chipotle I have two contracts of 1750. if you do the math there each of these is seventeen thousand five hundred so two of these would be thirty five thousand dollars so now when I add thirty five thousand to seventy we're already at a hundred thousand five hundred dollars so basically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna calculate this math right here you're gonna notice that my portfolio is not anywhere near the amount of puts that I'm selling okay I'm deciding to sell lots of puts on margin and the real secret there is because when I sell puts on margin it doesn't really affect me I'm not really paying any interest in fact if you notice my account I'm actually getting paid interest although I'm using a load of margin like an immense amount of margin I actually don't even know how much but I have done my risk management and I've actually calculated how much I'm using and I determined that was pretty safe and I didn't mind taking that amount of risk okay so so far we're at a hundred thousand five hundred next thing that I did was Triple Q so this is actually twenty seven thousand dollars per position I have eight of these so that's another two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars so when I add two hundred sixteen thousand plus a hundred thousand five hundred that is going to give us 360 thousand dollars as you can see it's adding up really quickly and again this portfolio is about half a million dollars so it's not a big portfolio I'm not even halfway through and as you can see this portfolio is already at 316 000 okay now if I go to my next position which is spy I have 400 shares and these 400 Shares are currently at four hundred and eleven dollars so that is another 164 thousand dollars so we're at roughly five hundred thousand dollars I'm gonna put it up on the screen right now the next position that I have is going to be the Spy 391 put and this one I'm going very aggressive and very hard with 30 contracts okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do 30 contracts times 391 which is my strike price times 100 which is actually 1.173 million dollars and again this portfolio is less than 500 000 okay so this position right here is 1.173 plus 500 and like twenty four thousand dollars or whatever is on the screen right now this is already pushing 1.7 million dollars now if I actually end up doing spy the 405 which is my next position and it has five contracts here that's roughly another 40 000 and then I have five of these so it's going to be another 200 000 so let's add 200 000 to this position and then actually this is a covered call so doesn't count we can skip that because this is a covered call on the 400 shares that I have and then last but not least I have an spy 390 put which is 39 000 and I have 10 of these so if I add another 390 000 my portfolio here is around two million dollars in potential and this is a really big Point okay because this is the huge misunderstanding yes I am leveraged up to well you know what right like people have all these quotes right I'm leveraged up to the blank blank right I want to be family friendly here but you know if you understand this that my portfolio is not that big and I have a huge risk here of two million dollars um is this risky well it is pretty risky I mean in my opinion it's sort of risky the reason why it's sort of risky is because some of these positions right here so let me go to Let's actually go to my largest position okay let's go to my one million dollar position let's actually open this up and I don't use TD Ameritrade a whole lot so what I'm going to have to do is I'm actually going to open this up on my Robin Hood so spy June 16 2023 okay so we're gonna go to spy I'm going to actually show you the Delta right here because when I do end up selling puts on margin I'm not stupid about it I'm being very very safe with it okay so if I go to sell put and then I go to June 16 which is you know if you're watching this in the future you can always apply this in the future I've been using margin for literally probably the past six or seven years I mean I've been trading for almost a decade but I don't think I was new to use margin so actually when I started using Robinhood I started using a lot of margin because yeah they're very easy to Grant you margin I think Robin Hood gold has it so again check out my link in the description I have a link to Robinhood you can actually get pretty easy approval I mean they are a third party so I can't help you but they have been giving really easy approval to anyone that uses my link and they also get like a few free stocks or something like that so anyways go check that out but I'm gonna go to June 16 which is about 33 days out again if you're watching this in the future doesn't really matter okay you can apply these same principles and same logic to your own portfolio Okay so June 16 let me go down to the current price okay actually no we're going down to 391 right because I have the 391. yes I have the 391 put for June 16. so let's open this bad boy up and boom yeah you'll notice that the Delta is .18 so let me explain something to you right so no one ever really goes down into the Greeks and whenever anyone talks about the Greeks people just lose attention click off the video and yeah it just doesn't work out because it's kind of technical but let me explain it to you as simple as possible okay so Delta is 0.18 now check it out I have 30 contracts right I have 30 contracts of this so 30 contracts doesn't actually mean that I have 30 contracts worth of exposure because a Delta is roughly 0.2 you can actually pretend that I only have six contracts worth of exposure now where am I getting six and you're probably thinking like how did you get six well check it out 0.2 okay that's a Delta times 30 is 6. 20 of 30 is 6. so essentially because my exposure here is only a Delta of 0.2 that means that my exposure is only like really 20 so 20 of 30 is six and that's not that much so I basically have six contracts instead of 30. now again 30 contracts is like an exposure of over a million dollars but six contracts is only an exposure of a little bit over two hundred thousand dollars right if I do 400 times 6 that's like 240 000 dollar so it's actually a little bit less than that since this is a 391 put now yes there is some gamma risk I mean if this stock ends up going down it's not a stock it's an ETF it's spy but if spy ends up going down yes my Delta will increase and that's going to increase my exposure but honestly not that much and the worst that can happen is well there is some really bad stuff that can happen of course the market can like tank but you know the worst that can happen most likely in like 99 of the time that the market could pull back a little bit okay you can pull back to let's say it's 410 right now I can pull back to 405 I'd end up winning I could pull down to 400 I would end up winning it can pull down to like 395 dollars and that would be a significant fall for spy it would be pretty unlikely I mean it could happen but it's pretty unlikely now if spy fell to 391 what would I do you know we always talk about management and closing strategies which is really really important how you manage a trade but if it went down to 391 look this is super unlikely I mean it could happen it's an 18 Delta but if it does happen what I can do is I can just roll lower so I can actually show you a rolling position right now because I think using margin and rolling really goes together I mean having a lot of advanced skills and option trading will help you manage trades so much better and just make you a whole lot more money so let me check it out right now everything is going really smooth my life is pretty good my Discord Community is freaking happy everyone is super happy I mean we're all having a good time and so far this year what am I up I think I'm up like yeah 13 which is pretty solid right I mean guys I don't promise you to become a millionaire overnight here I mean that's some other fake Guru with maybe like a Lamborghini not that there's anything wrong with having Lamborghini but that's another guy that's just flexing and telling you that he'll help you become a millionaire or follow my trades or blah blah blah right but I'm not promising any of that I'm just promising consistency I'm promising to teach you how to be a better Trader hopefully take this full time I mean I'm I currently moved out to Poland because I mean I do this full time my income's online so I don't have to be in the States you can have a very nice lifestyle in other countries by focusing on trading so that's exactly what I've been doing and yeah this year so far I'm up 13 now if my portfolio was smaller I would obviously be a little bit more risky I would probably do more spreads as you can see here I'm winning on an Apple spread I'm putting on an Airbnb spread I would probably do more spreads I would also do more iron Condors as you can see my iron Condors are doing fantastic every time I open up an iron Condor I am posting in a Discord Community which as always you can book a call for that you can book a free call in the description it's the first link it's always the first link you can go through some training and then book a call to see everything that I'm buying and selling but yeah if I had a smaller portfolio that's exactly what I would be doing I'd be focused on spreads I'd be focused on iron Condors I mean those strategies are obviously higher return but you know inherently when you have something that's high return it's also going to have a little bit more risk so I think you're out of your mind if you're going to use margin for like the riskier stuff for me the only thing that I use margin is by selling put options and maybe I mean maybe maybe covered calls so again looking at my portfolio I am mostly selling puts okay that's basic basically probably like 90 of my strategy for margin trading and sometimes I Do cover calls but thing is with covered calls you will be charged interest because you're holding the shares this stuff can get really nuanced so if you want a specific strategy again you can just shoot me an email and we can figure something out I don't usually do one-on-one coaching I am super busy and more money to me doesn't really matter but I do really want to help you guys and I really understand that helping you guys make more money is really awesome for your family for your future so and I am really passionate about this so yeah I am really willing to to help as much as I can and give back as much as possible because I really love this I mean trading options has really really changed my life I mean I've been traveling for like the past three years and it's all because of options and I don't really have any Financial issues that's because even something as simple as this right I don't have that much money but using margin I mean this is actually interesting I should have you know I didn't even look at this but just just check it out I mean how much gains I have and I'm recording this on a Sunday evening um it's actually morning in Europe but this is a Sunday evening so there's like no way that I'm probably shopping list or anything like that you know this is just literally old gains I don't have any losses and that's the beautiful thing about you know trading with me that's the beautiful thing about understanding the way I trade my strategies is yeah some people go for like big wins they go for like Heavy Hitters like they're trying to make twenty thirty thousand dollars a month with a small portfolio is that possible it is but you are taking excessive risk and whenever you're rushing for something and you're like desperate or needy it's actually like really bad behavior and it's not going to end up being like a long-term successful strategy and that just applies to lots of things in life right relationships Health there's no real like get fast or get results pill it's just about learning getting better honing your craft and I mean at this point option trading is really easy and it's really boring that's why I really enjoy coaching because option trading doesn't take me much time it's like a couple hours a week but as you can see here I mean it's just super consistent a thousand dollars I mean 268 is not that much on Chipotle but um Chipotle has shot up a lot and I ended up selling a really really safe out of the money put option I'm not just using margin and leverage in my other portfolio where it's like really safe and like really large account strategies this portfolio on Robinhood I'm also using margin I mean I have a whole bunch of positions way too many to count which I'm always posting of course but yeah it's a lot of positions accidentally clicked into Alibaba but this has actually been a really good stock for me I ended up making well not ended up I'm still making money on the stock itself and then I also have a covered call the really cool thing is I mean I show everything guys I don't have anything to hide I'm just going to go into my history you know people always show you their wins but they never share their losses um I actually think on Baba I only have wins obviously I have losses and other stuff but um I only have wins on Baba it's just been an amazing company Baba Neo I mean Palance here you guys know I've been talking about palantir forever so if you watch this channel I mean you're making money I I'm sure I've already made you several thousand dollars if you've been following my channel um religiously and you have the Bell notification on and you're subscribed it's always amazing to be a subscriber because whenever I release videos sometimes they're very insightful they're like actionable so anyways Alibaba um 3350 I ended up holding this for a good amount of time so I can't like really brag that this is a lot of money because it's not I only made 400 but I'm really proud of this position because I'm not really an option buyer but here I did end up buying some options right I bought 10 contracts of the Alibaba 83 call option and it ended up doing

hundred and sixteen thousand dollars so when I add two hundred sixteen thousand plus a hundred thousand five hundred that is going to give us 360 thousand dollars as you can see it's adding up really quickly and again this portfolio is about half a million dollars so it's not a big portfolio I'm not even halfway through and as you can see this portfolio is already at 316 000 okay now if I go to my next position which is spy I have 400 shares and these 400 Shares are currently at four hundred and eleven dollars so that is another 164 thousand dollars so we're at roughly five hundred thousand dollars I'm gonna put it up on the screen right now the next position that I have is going to be the Spy 391 put and this one I'm going very aggressive and very hard with 30 contracts okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do 30 contracts times 391 which is my strike price times 100 which is actually 1.173 million dollars and again this portfolio is less than 500 000 okay so this position right here is 1.173 plus 500 and like twenty four thousand dollars or whatever is on the screen right now this is already pushing 1.7 million dollars now if I actually end up doing spy the 405 which is my next position and it has five contracts here that's roughly another 40 000 and then I have five of these so it's going to be another 200 000 so let's add 200 000 to this position and then actually this is a covered call so doesn't count we can skip that because this is a covered call on the 400 shares that I have and then last but not least I have an spy 390 put which is 39 000 and I have 10 of these so if I add another 390 000 my portfolio here is around two million dollars in potential and this is a really big Point okay because this is the huge misunderstanding yes I am leveraged up to well you know what right like people have all these quotes right I'm leveraged up to the blank blank right I want to be family friendly here but you know if you understand this that my portfolio is not that big and I have a huge risk here of two million dollars um is this risky well it is pretty risky I mean in my opinion it's sort of risky the reason why it's sort of risky is because some of these positions right here so let me go to Let's actually go to my largest position okay let's go to my one million dollar position let's actually open this up and I don't use TD Ameritrade a whole lot so what I'm going to have to do is I'm actually going to open this up on my Robin Hood so spy June 16 2023 okay so we're gonna go to spy I'm going to actually show you the Delta right here because when I do end up selling puts on margin I'm not stupid about it I'm being very very safe with it okay so if I go to sell put and then I go to June 16 which is you know if you're watching this in the future you can always apply this in the future I've been using margin for literally probably the past six or seven years I mean I've been trading for almost a decade but I don't think I was new to use margin so actually when I started using Robinhood I started using a lot of margin because yeah they're very easy to Grant you margin I think Robin Hood gold has it so again check out my link in the description I have a link to Robinhood you can actually get pretty easy approval I mean they are a third party so I can't help you but they have been giving really easy approval to anyone that uses my link and they also get like a few free stocks or something like that so anyways go check that out but I'm gonna go to June 16 which is about 33 days out again if you're watching this in the future doesn't really matter okay you can apply these same principles and same logic to your own portfolio Okay so June 16 let me go down to the current price okay actually no we're going down to 391 right because I have the 391. yes I have the 391 put for June 16. so let's open this bad boy up and boom yeah you'll notice that the Delta is .18 so let me explain something to you right so no one ever really goes down into the Greeks and whenever anyone talks about the Greeks people just lose attention click off the video and yeah it just doesn't work out because it's kind of technical but let me explain it to you as simple as possible okay so Delta is 0.18 now check it out I have 30 contracts right I have 30 contracts of this so 30 contracts doesn't actually mean that I have 30 contracts worth of exposure because a Delta is roughly 0.2 you can actually pretend that I only have six contracts worth of exposure now where am I getting six and you're probably thinking like how did you get six well check it out 0.2 okay that's a Delta times 30 is 6. 20 of 30 is 6. so essentially because my exposure here is only a Delta of 0.2 that means that my exposure is only like really 20 so 20 of 30 is six and that's not that much so I basically have six contracts instead of 30. now again 30 contracts is like an exposure of over a million dollars but six contracts is only an exposure of a little bit over two hundred thousand dollars right if I do 400 times 6 that's like 240 000 dollar so it's actually a little bit less than that since this is a 391 put now yes there is some gamma risk I mean if this stock ends up going down it's not a stock it's an ETF it's spy but if spy ends up going down yes my Delta will increase and that's going to increase my exposure but honestly not that much and the worst that can happen is well there is some really bad stuff that can happen of course the market can like tank but you know the worst that can happen most likely in like 99 of the time that the market could pull back a little bit okay you can pull back to let's say it's 410 right now I can pull back to 405 I'd end up winning I could pull down to 400 I would end up winning it can pull down to like 395 dollars and that would be a significant fall for spy it would be pretty unlikely I mean it could happen but it's pretty unlikely now if spy fell to 391 what would I do you know we always talk about management and closing strategies which is really really important how you manage a trade but if it went down to 391 look this is super unlikely I mean it could happen it's an 18 Delta but if it does happen what I can do is I can just roll lower so I can actually show you a rolling position right now because I think using margin and rolling really goes together I mean having a lot of advanced skills and option trading will help you manage trades so much better and just make you a whole lot more money so let me check it out right now everything is going really smooth my life is pretty good my Discord Community is freaking happy everyone is super happy I mean we're all having a good time and so far this year what am I up I think I'm up like yeah 13 which is pretty solid right I mean guys I don't promise you to become a millionaire overnight here I mean that's some other fake Guru with maybe like a Lamborghini not that there's anything wrong with having Lamborghini but that's another guy that's just flexing and telling you that he'll help you become a millionaire or follow my trades or blah blah blah right but I'm not promising any of that I'm just promising consistency I'm promising to teach you how to be a better Trader hopefully take this full time I mean I'm I currently moved out to Poland because I mean I do this full time my income's online so I don't have to be in the States you can have a very nice lifestyle in other countries by focusing on trading so that's exactly what I've been doing and yeah this year so far I'm up 13 now if my portfolio was smaller I would obviously be a little bit more risky I would probably do more spreads as you can see here I'm winning on an Apple spread I'm putting on an Airbnb spread I would probably do more spreads I would also do more iron Condors as you can see my iron Condors are doing fantastic every time I open up an iron Condor I am posting in a Discord Community which as always you can book a call for that you can book a free call in the description it's the first link it's always the first link you can go through some training and then book a call to see everything that I'm buying and selling but yeah if I had a smaller portfolio that's exactly what I would be doing I'd be focused on spreads I'd be focused on iron Condors I mean those strategies are obviously higher return but you know inherently when you have something that's high return it's also going to have a little bit more risk so I think you're out of your mind if you're going to use margin for like the riskier stuff for me the only thing that I use margin is by selling put options and maybe I mean maybe maybe covered calls so again looking at my portfolio I am mostly selling puts okay that's basic basically probably like 90 of my strategy for margin trading and sometimes I Do cover calls but thing is with covered calls you will be charged interest because you're holding the shares this stuff can get really nuanced so if you want a specific strategy again you can just shoot me an email and we can figure something out I don't usually do one-on-one coaching I am super busy and more money to me doesn't really matter but I do really want to help you guys and I really understand that helping you guys make more money is really awesome for your family for your future so and I am really passionate about this so yeah I am really willing to to help as much as I can and give back as much as possible because I really love this I mean trading options has really really changed my life I mean I've been traveling for like the past three years and it's all because of options and I don't really have any Financial issues that's because even something as simple as this right I don't have that much money but using margin I mean this is actually interesting I should have you know I didn't even look at this but just just check it out I mean how much gains I have and I'm recording this on a Sunday evening um it's actually morning in Europe but this is a Sunday evening so there's like no way that I'm probably shopping list or anything like that you know this is just literally old gains I don't have any losses and that's the beautiful thing about you know trading with me that's the beautiful thing about understanding the way I trade my strategies is yeah some people go for like big wins they go for like Heavy Hitters like they're trying to make twenty thirty thousand dollars a month with a small portfolio is that possible it is but you are taking excessive risk and whenever you're rushing for something and you're like desperate or needy it's actually like really bad behavior and it's not going to end up being like a long-term successful strategy and that just applies to lots of things in life right relationships Health there's no real like get fast or get results pill it's just about learning getting better honing your craft and I mean at this point option trading is really easy and it's really boring that's why I really enjoy coaching because option trading doesn't take me much time it's like a couple hours a week but as you can see here I mean it's just super consistent a thousand dollars I mean 268 is not that much on Chipotle but um Chipotle has shot up a lot and I ended up selling a really really safe out of the money put option I'm not just using margin and leverage in my other portfolio where it's like really safe and like really large account strategies this portfolio on Robinhood I'm also using margin I mean I have a whole bunch of positions way too many to count which I'm always posting of course but yeah it's a lot of positions accidentally clicked into Alibaba but this has actually been a really good stock for me I ended up making well not ended up I'm still making money on the stock itself and then I also have a covered call the really cool thing is I mean I show everything guys I don't have anything to hide I'm just going to go into my history you know people always show you their wins but they never share their losses um I actually think on Baba I only have wins obviously I have losses and other stuff but um I only have wins on Baba it's just been an amazing company Baba Neo I mean Palance here you guys know I've been talking about palantir forever so if you watch this channel I mean you're making money I I'm sure I've already made you several thousand dollars if you've been following my channel um religiously and you have the Bell notification on and you're subscribed it's always amazing to be a subscriber because whenever I release videos sometimes they're very insightful they're like actionable so anyways Alibaba um 3350 I ended up holding this for a good amount of time so I can't like really brag that this is a lot of money because it's not I only made 400 but I'm really proud of this position because I'm not really an option buyer but here I did end up buying some options right I bought 10 contracts of the Alibaba 83 call option and it ended up doing really well but in between there was a lot of turmoil I mean actually let me show you the turmoil because in between it was very volatile I mean robust stock was going up and down and at some point I actually thought I had to close it for a loss but things ended up going really well but I'll show you kind of like the process in between because many people with like weak hands or like not that much experience would end up you know basically dropping this call option losing a bunch of money and complaining that you know option trading doesn't work but it's really it's because you have to get a little bit better don't wish life was easier wish you were better whoever said that quote right I really like that quote because I mean I grew up with nothing my parents came to the states um I mean my mom came pregnant actually so Mom came pregnant had me and then for the first 20 years of my life we had literally nothing and my parents never spent any money and everything was super difficult so it wasn't easy but you know I'm really proud that I'm you know self-made and all of this trading and and being a successful coach as well I'm not gonna lie guys I do well as a coach and that's because I'm a great coach I love coaching people I'm passionate about it and all my students get success I mean at least 90 percent of people get a success the ones that take you seriously anyways but we were talking about Alibaba so you know I kind of want to show you a little bit of like emotional Control Management this is stuff that people don't really talk about I know everyone wants to see like how do you buy a call option at 10x or money and that's that's cool guys but what I'm trying to teach you is how to be a better Trader how to have a better psychology how to have a better mindset okay how to be like just an ultimate mindful good investor okay that's really important as an investor it's not about mathematics or physics those guys on Wall Street actually don't do that well I sat next to plenty of Traders and let me tell you like the best Trader has really just had a good mindset they came in hungry they came in willing to learn and you know the craziest thing is Jeff Bezos talks about this is some of the smartest people are actually able to change their mind really fast so let's say you're in a bad situation and you're in love with the company well you might have to change that position get out of it but anyways let's check this out okay Baba April 25th all right so let's look at April 25th and again if you're watching this in the future all of my teachings I try to make them Evergreen and available for you so even if you watch in the future you get a lot of value I try not to make too many things like in this very moment because to be honest all these YouTubers that are making like in the moment stock videos they're just pumping for more views and I don't really care about that I just want to make sure that I'm educating you to my highest ability but you know let's look at April what was it April 25th I believe yes so it's April 25th so I ended up buying calls on April 25th and yes that's because Alibaba keeps going up and down and I was pretty sure that it's going to go up down and then on the 25th yes it was a pretty good bottom right I mean at least I thought it was on this three-month chart it was yeah essentially was hitting a bottom so I ended up buying some call options here now what happened next was not that great because on April 25th I ended up buying call options and it pretty much did nothing I mean it went up a little bit then down and yeah I ended up losing money well I didn't lose money I was losing money on paper but I had a big belief that this stock would bounce back and it would do well so I told my Discord Community everyone was asking me are we going to close this position we have a big paper loss the big paper loss was about 1500 so that's pretty significant especially for folks with smaller portfolios so I felt really bad about this trade that I ended up buying call options and I felt really bad because because you know whenever I trade I make a trade my reputation's on the line I want to make sure that I am doing the best job possible because I mean it's not just my money everyone basically follows my trades so whenever I have a trade then everyone either makes money or loses money and my goal is to be really really safe and conservative because I have a lot of investors that are close to retirement you know they have 500k accounts or more and I mean I don't know about you and I'm pretty sure this applies to everyone but we don't want to lose our hard-earned money I mean making money is extremely difficult uh I mean I again I grew up with nothing and when I made like two thousand dollars I was super happy super blessed and going to Chipotle to me was like oh my God I get to actually go and eat out at a restaurant and I was like 21 22 at that point so I'm really appreciative of what I've built and I understand that you guys are probably in a similar boat you don't want to lose your money you basically need a plan to grow it consistently and secure your retirement even if you're not retiring yet you still need to get there at some point and I'm really happy that I'm part of your journey but you know check it out so Alibaba went from you know the 25th from 82-29 to essentially you know nowhere 82.95 right um I almost closed it here guys I literally almost closed it but you know it was 5 10 I said you know we're going to hold this until expiration I really have a feeling um you know based on what I've seen Baba do in the past I think that we can pull up and then we woke up next day on on the 11th it was a Thursday this actually last Thursday I said guys we're out of here we are out of here on May 11th we are done we are taking our 400 of profit this has been a tough what was it like a tough two weeks I mean I didn't lose that much money but this position was down probably about 50 percent and then in just one day we ended up having a gain so ended up getting out of this position for a 400 game,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,VLQxZxYDJ2E,2023-05-16T22:00:13Z,Margin Trading - Nobody Understands This.,Chipotle,I actually have Chipotle and Amazon now this portfolio right here is not that huge I'm actually going to calculate how much margin I'm using I'm using a ridiculous amount of margin however this portfolio is actually doing really well so let's jump into the math of my portfolio right now and then after I do the math what we're going to do is we're actually going to go over the strategies the management of the strategies my thought my logic around it and all that good stuff okay so let's just start off so I'm going to actually calculate the math right in front of your eyes okay the first one is Amazon I have a hundred dollar put I have seven contracts okay so each put option is ten thousand dollars and if I have seven of these that's seventy thousand dollars now the next thing I'm doing is Chipotle I have two contracts of 1750. if you do the math there each of these is seventeen thousand five hundred so two of these would be thirty five thousand dollars so now when I add thirty five thousand to seventy we're already at a hundred thousand five hundred dollars so basically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna calculate this math right here you're gonna notice that my portfolio is not anywhere near the amount of puts that I'm selling okay I'm deciding to sell lots of puts on margin and the real secret there is because when I sell puts on margin it doesn't really affect me I'm not really paying any interest in fact if you notice my account I'm actually getting paid interest although I'm using a load of margin like an immense amount of margin I actually don't even know how much but I have done my risk management and I've actually calculated how much I'm using and I determined that was pretty safe and I didn't mind taking that amount of risk okay so so far we're at a hundred thousand five hundred next thing that I did was Triple Q so this is actually twenty seven thousand dollars per position I have eight of these so that's another two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars so when I add two hundred sixteen thousand plus a hundred thousand five hundred that is going to give us 360 thousand dollars as you can see it's adding up really quickly and again this portfolio is about half a million dollars so it's not a big portfolio I'm not even halfway through and as you can see this portfolio is already at 316 000 okay now if I go to my next position which is spy I have 400 shares and these 400 Shares are currently at four hundred and eleven dollars so that is another 164 thousand dollars so we're at roughly five hundred thousand dollars I'm gonna put it up on the screen right now the next position that I have is going to be the Spy 391 put and this one I'm going very aggressive and very hard with 30 contracts okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do 30 contracts times 391 which is my strike price times 100 which is actually 1.173 million dollars and again this portfolio is less than 500 000 okay so this position right here is 1.173 plus 500 and like twenty four thousand dollars or whatever is on the screen right now this is already pushing 1.7 million dollars now if I actually end up doing spy the 405 which is my next position and it has five contracts here that's roughly another 40 000 and then I have five of these so it's going to be another 200 000 so let's add 200 000 to this position and then actually this is a covered call so doesn't count we can skip that because this is a covered call on the 400 shares that I have and then last but not least I have an spy 390 put which is 39 000 and I have 10 of these so if I add another 390 000 my portfolio here is around two million dollars in potential and this is a really big Point okay because this is the huge misunderstanding yes I am leveraged up to well you know what right like people have all these quotes right I'm leveraged up to the blank blank right I want to be family friendly here but you know if you understand this that my portfolio is not that big and I have a huge risk here of two million dollars um is this risky well it is pretty risky I mean in my opinion it's sort of risky the reason why it's sort of risky is because some of these positions right here so let me go to Let's actually go to my largest position okay let's go to my one million dollar position let's actually open this up and I don't use TD Ameritrade a whole lot so what I'm going to have to do is I'm actually going to open this up on my Robin Hood so spy June 16 2023 okay so we're gonna go to spy I'm going to actually show you the Delta right here because when I do end up selling puts on margin I'm not stupid about it I'm being very very safe with it okay so if I go to sell put and then I go to June 16 which is you know if you're watching this in the future you can always apply this in the future I've been using margin for literally probably the past six or seven years I mean I've been trading for almost a decade but I don't think I was new to use margin so actually when I started using Robinhood I started using a lot of margin because yeah they're very easy to Grant you margin I think Robin Hood gold has it so again check out my link in the description I have a link to Robinhood you can actually get pretty easy approval I mean they are a third party so I can't help you but they have been giving really easy approval to anyone that uses my link and they also get like a few free stocks or something like that so anyways go check that out but I'm gonna go to June 16 which is about 33 days out again if you're watching this in the future doesn't really matter okay you can apply these same principles and same logic to your own portfolio Okay so June 16 let me go down to the current price okay actually no we're going down to 391 right because I have the 391. yes I have the 391 put for June 16. so let's open this bad boy up and boom yeah you'll notice that the Delta is .18 so let me explain something to you right so no one ever really goes down into the Greeks and whenever anyone talks about the Greeks people just lose attention click off the video and yeah it just doesn't work out because it's kind of technical but let me explain it to you as simple as possible okay so Delta is 0.18 now check it out I have 30 contracts right I have 30 contracts of this so 30 contracts doesn't actually mean that I have 30 contracts worth of exposure because a Delta is roughly 0.2 you can actually pretend that I only have six contracts worth of exposure now where am I getting six and you're probably thinking like how did you get six well check it out 0.2 okay that's a Delta times 30 is 6. 20 of 30 is 6. so essentially because my exposure here is only a Delta of 0.2 that means that my exposure is only like really 20 so 20 of 30 is six and that's not that much so I basically have six contracts instead of 30. now again 30 contracts is like an exposure of over a million dollars but six contracts is only an exposure of a little bit over two hundred thousand dollars right if I do 400 times 6 that's like 240 000 dollar so it's actually a little bit less than that since this is a 391 put now yes there is some gamma risk I mean if this stock ends up going down it's not a stock it's an ETF it's spy but if spy ends up going down yes my Delta will increase and that's going to increase my exposure but honestly not that much and the worst that can happen is well there is some really bad stuff that can happen of course the market can like tank but you know the worst that can happen most likely in like 99 of the time that the market could pull back a little bit okay you can pull back to let's say it's 410 right now I can pull back to 405 I'd end up winning I could pull down to 400 I would end up winning it can pull down to like 395 dollars and that would be a significant fall for spy it would be pretty unlikely I mean it could happen but it's pretty unlikely now if spy fell to 391 what would I do you know we always talk about management and closing strategies which is really really important how you manage a trade but if it went down to 391 look this is super unlikely I mean it could happen it's an 18 Delta but if it does happen what I can do is I can just roll lower so I can actually show you a rolling position right now because I think using margin and rolling really goes together I mean having a lot of advanced skills and option trading will help you manage trades so much better and just make you a whole lot more money so let me check it out right now everything is going really smooth my life is pretty good my Discord Community is freaking happy everyone is super happy I mean we're all having a good time and so far this year what am I up I think I'm up like yeah 13 which is pretty solid right I mean guys I don't promise you to become a millionaire overnight here I mean that's some other fake Guru with maybe like a Lamborghini not that there's anything wrong with having Lamborghini but that's another guy that's just flexing and telling you that he'll help you become a millionaire or follow my trades or blah blah blah right but I'm not promising any of that I'm just promising consistency I'm promising to teach you how to be a better Trader hopefully take this full time I mean I'm I currently moved out to

I've been doing and yeah this year so far I'm up 13 now if my portfolio was smaller I would obviously be a little bit more risky I would probably do more spreads as you can see here I'm winning on an

have losses and other stuff but um I only have wins on Baba it's just been an amazing company Baba Neo I mean Palance here you guys know I've been talking about palantir forever so if you watch this channel I mean you're making money I I'm sure I've already made you several thousand dollars if you've been following my channel um religiously and you have the Bell notification on and you're subscribed it's always amazing to be a subscriber because whenever I release videos sometimes they're very insightful they're like actionable so anyways Alibaba um 3350 I ended up holding this for a good amount of time so I can't like really brag that this is a lot of money because it's not I only made 400 but I'm really proud of this position because I'm not really an option buyer but here I did end up buying some options right I bought 10 contracts of the Alibaba 83 call option and it ended up doing really well but in between there was a lot of turmoil I mean actually let me show you the turmoil because in between it was very volatile I mean robust stock was going up and down and at some point I actually thought I had to close it for a loss but things ended up going really well but I'll show you kind of like the process in between because many people with like weak hands or like not that much experience would end up you know basically dropping this call option losing a bunch of money and complaining that you know option trading doesn't work but it's really it's because you have to get a little bit better don't wish life was easier wish you were better whoever said that quote right I really like that quote because I mean I grew up with nothing my parents came to the states um I mean my mom came pregnant actually so Mom came pregnant had me and then for the first 20 years of my life we had literally nothing and my parents never spent any money and everything was super difficult so it wasn't easy but you know I'm really proud that I'm you know self-made and all of this trading and and being a successful coach as well I'm not gonna lie guys I do well as a coach and that's because I'm a great coach I love coaching people I'm passionate about it and all my students get success I mean at least 90 percent of people get a success the ones that take you seriously anyways but we were talking about Alibaba so you know I kind of want to show you a little bit of like emotional Control Management this is stuff that people don't really talk about I know everyone wants to see like how do you buy a call option at 10x or money and that's that's cool guys but what I'm trying to teach you is how to be a better Trader how to have a better psychology how to have a better mindset okay how to be like just an ultimate mindful good investor okay that's really important as an investor it's not about mathematics or physics those guys on Wall Street actually don't do that well I sat next to plenty of Traders and let me tell you like the best Trader has really just had a good mindset they came in hungry they came in willing to learn and you know the craziest thing is Jeff Bezos talks about this is some of the smartest people are actually able to change their mind really fast so let's say you're in a bad situation and you're in love with the company well you might have to change that position get out of it but anyways let's check this out okay Baba April 25th all right so let's look at April 25th and again if you're watching this in the future all of my teachings I try to make them Evergreen and available for you so even if you watch in the future you get a lot of value I try not to make too many things like in this very moment because to be honest all these YouTubers that are making like in the moment stock videos they're just pumping for more views and I don't really care about that I just want to make sure that I'm educating you to my highest ability but you know let's look at April what was it April 25th I believe yes so it's April 25th so I ended up buying calls on April 25th and yes that's because Alibaba keeps going up and down and I was pretty sure that it's going to go up down and then on the 25th yes it was a pretty good bottom right I mean at least I thought it was on this three-month chart it was yeah essentially was hitting a bottom so I ended up buying some call options here now what happened next was not that great because on April 25th I ended up buying call options and it pretty much did nothing I mean it went up a little bit then down and yeah I ended up losing money well I didn't lose money I was losing money on paper but I had a big belief that this stock would bounce back and it would do well so I told my Discord Community everyone was asking me are we going to close this position we have a big paper loss the big paper loss was about 1500 so that's pretty significant especially for folks with smaller portfolios so I felt really bad about this trade that I ended up buying call options and I felt really bad because because you know whenever I trade I make a trade my reputation's on the line I want to make sure that I am doing the best job possible because I mean it's not just my money everyone basically follows my trades so whenever I have a trade then everyone either makes money or loses money and my goal is to be really really safe and conservative because I have a lot of investors that are close to retirement you know they have 500k accounts or more and I mean I don't know about you and I'm pretty sure this applies to everyone but we don't want to lose our hard-earned money I mean making money is extremely difficult uh I mean I again I grew up with nothing and when I made like two thousand dollars I was super happy super blessed and going to Chipotle to me was like oh my God I get to actually go and eat out at a restaurant and I was like 21 22 at that point so I'm really appreciative of what I've built and I understand that you guys are probably in a similar boat you don't want to lose your money you basically need a plan to grow it consistently and secure your retirement even if you're not retiring yet you still need to get there at some point and I'm really happy that I'm part of your journey but you know check it out so Alibaba went from you know the 25th from 82-29 to essentially you know nowhere 82.95 right um I almost closed it here guys I literally almost closed it but you know it was 5 10 I said you know we're going to hold this until expiration I really have a feeling um you know based on what I've seen Baba do in the past I think that we can pull up and then we woke up next day on on the 11th it was a Thursday this actually last Thursday I said guys we're out of here we are out of here on May 11th we are done we are taking our 400 of profit this has been a tough what was it like a tough two weeks I mean I didn't lose that much money but this position was down probably about 50 percent and then in just one day we ended up having a gain so ended up getting out of this position for a 400 game,1.0,0.5
Invest with Henry,VLQxZxYDJ2E,2023-05-16T22:00:13Z,Margin Trading - Nobody Understands This.,Amazon,I actually have Chipotle and Amazon now this portfolio right here is not that huge I'm actually going to calculate how much margin I'm using I'm using a ridiculous amount of margin however this portfolio is actually doing really well so let's jump into the math of my portfolio right now and then after I do the math what we're going to do is we're actually going to go over the strategies the management of the strategies my thought my logic around it and all that good stuff okay so let's just start off so I'm going to actually calculate the math right in front of your eyes okay the first one is Amazon I have a hundred dollar put I have seven contracts okay so each put option is ten thousand dollars and if I have seven of these that's seventy thousand dollars now the next thing I'm doing is Chipotle I have two contracts of 1750. if you do the math there each of these is seventeen thousand five hundred so two of these would be thirty five thousand dollars so now when I add thirty five thousand to seventy we're already at a hundred thousand five hundred dollars so basically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna calculate this math right here you're gonna notice that my portfolio is not anywhere near the amount of puts that I'm selling okay I'm deciding to sell lots of puts on margin and the real secret there is because when I sell puts on margin it doesn't really affect me I'm not really paying any interest in fact if you notice my account I'm actually getting paid interest although I'm using a load of margin like an immense amount of margin I actually don't even know how much but I have done my risk management and I've actually calculated how much I'm using and I determined that was pretty safe and I didn't mind taking that amount of risk okay so so far we're at a hundred thousand five hundred next thing that I did was Triple Q so this is actually twenty seven thousand dollars per position I have eight of these so that's another two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars so when I add two hundred sixteen thousand plus a hundred thousand five hundred that is going to give us 360 thousand dollars as you can see it's adding up really quickly and again this portfolio is about half a million dollars so it's not a big portfolio I'm not even halfway through and as you can see this portfolio is already at 316 000 okay now if I go to my next position which is spy I have 400 shares and these 400 Shares are currently at four hundred and eleven dollars so that is another 164 thousand dollars so we're at roughly five hundred thousand dollars I'm gonna put it up on the screen right now the next position that I have is going to be the Spy 391 put and this one I'm going very aggressive and very hard with 30 contracts okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do 30 contracts times 391 which is my strike price times 100 which is actually 1.173 million dollars and again this portfolio is less than 500 000 okay so this position right here is 1.173 plus 500 and like twenty four thousand dollars or whatever is on the screen right now this is already pushing 1.7 million dollars now if I actually end up doing spy the 405 which is my next position and it has five contracts here that's roughly another 40 000 and then I have five of these so it's going to be another 200 000 so let's add 200 000 to this position and then actually this is a covered call so doesn't count we can skip that because this is a covered call on the 400 shares that I have and then last but not least I have an spy 390 put which is 39 000 and I have 10 of these so if I add another 390 000 my portfolio here is around two million dollars in potential and this is a really big Point okay because this is the huge misunderstanding yes I am leveraged up to well you know what right like people have all these quotes right I'm leveraged up to the blank blank right I want to be family friendly here but you know if you understand this that my portfolio is not that big and I have a huge risk here of two million dollars um is this risky well it is pretty risky I mean in my opinion it's sort of risky the reason why it's sort of risky is because some of these positions right here so let me go to Let's actually go to my largest position okay let's go to my one million dollar position let's actually open this up and I don't use TD Ameritrade a whole lot so what I'm going to have to do is I'm actually going to open this up on my Robin Hood so spy June 16 2023 okay so we're gonna go to spy I'm going to actually show you the Delta right here because when I do end up selling puts on margin I'm not stupid about it I'm being very very safe with it okay so if I go to sell put and then I go to June 16 which is you know if you're watching this in the future you can always apply this in the future I've been using margin for literally probably the past six or seven years I mean I've been trading for almost a decade but I don't think I was new to use margin so actually when I started using Robinhood I started using a lot of margin because yeah they're very easy to Grant you margin I think Robin Hood gold has it so again check out my link in the description I have a link to Robinhood you can actually get pretty easy approval I mean they are a third party so I can't help you but they have been giving really easy approval to anyone that uses my link and they also get like a few free stocks or something like that so anyways go check that out but I'm gonna go to June 16 which is about 33 days out again if you're watching this in the future doesn't really matter okay you can apply these same principles and same logic to your own portfolio Okay so June 16 let me go down to the current price okay actually no we're going down to 391 right because I have the 391. yes I have the 391 put for June 16. so let's open this bad boy up and boom yeah you'll notice that the Delta is .18 so let me explain something to you right so no one ever really goes down into the Greeks and whenever anyone talks about the Greeks people just lose attention click off the video and yeah it just doesn't work out because it's kind of technical but let me explain it to you as simple as possible okay so Delta is 0.18 now check it out I have 30 contracts right I have 30 contracts of this so 30 contracts doesn't actually mean that I have 30 contracts worth of exposure because a Delta is roughly 0.2 you can actually pretend that I only have six contracts worth of exposure now where am I getting six and you're probably thinking like how did you get six well check it out 0.2 okay that's a Delta times 30 is 6. 20 of 30 is 6. so essentially because my exposure here is only a Delta of 0.2 that means that my exposure is only like really 20 so 20 of 30 is six and that's not that much so I basically have six contracts instead of 30. now again 30 contracts is like an exposure of over a million dollars but six contracts is only an exposure of a little bit over two hundred thousand dollars right if I do 400 times 6 that's like 240 000 dollar so it's actually a little bit less than that since this is a 391 put now yes there is some gamma risk I mean if this stock ends up going down it's not a stock it's an ETF it's spy but if spy ends up going down yes my Delta will increase and that's going to increase my exposure but honestly not that much and the worst that can happen is well there is some really bad stuff that can happen of course the market can like tank but you know the worst that can happen most likely in like 99 of the time that the market could pull back a little bit okay you can pull back to let's say it's 410 right now I can pull back to 405 I'd end up winning I could pull down to 400 I would end up winning it can pull down to like 395 dollars and that would be a significant fall for spy it would be pretty unlikely I mean it could happen but it's pretty unlikely now if spy fell to 391 what would I do you know we always talk about management and closing strategies which is really really important how you manage a trade but if it went down to 391 look this is super unlikely I mean it could happen it's an 18 Delta but if it does happen what I can do is I can just roll lower so I can actually show you a rolling position right now because I think using margin and rolling really goes together I mean having a lot of advanced skills and option trading will help you manage trades so much better and just make you a whole lot more money so let me check it out right now everything is going really smooth my life is pretty good my Discord Community is freaking happy everyone is super happy I mean we're all having a good time and so far this year what am I up I think I'm up like yeah 13 which is pretty solid right I mean guys I don't promise you to become a millionaire overnight here I mean that's some other fake Guru with maybe like a Lamborghini not that there's anything wrong with having Lamborghini but that's another guy that's just flexing and telling you that he'll help you become a millionaire or follow my trades or blah blah blah right but I'm not promising any of that I'm just promising consistency I'm promising to teach you how to be a better Trader hopefully take this full time I mean I'm I currently moved out to Poland because I mean I do this full time my income's online so I don't have to be in the States you can have a very nice lifestyle in other countries by focusing on trading so that's exactly what I've been doing and yeah this year so far I'm up 13 now if my portfolio was smaller I would obviously be a little bit more risky I would probably do more spreads as you can see here I'm winning on an Apple spread I'm putting on an Airbnb spread I would probably do more spreads I would also do more iron Condors as you can see my iron Condors are doing fantastic every time I open up an iron Condor I am posting in a Discord Community which as always you can book a call for that you can book a free call in the description it's the first link it's always the first link you can go through some training and then book a call to see everything that I'm buying and selling but yeah if I had a smaller portfolio that's exactly what I would be doing I'd be focused on spreads I'd be focused on iron Condors I mean those strategies are obviously higher return but you know inherently when you have something that's high return it's also going to have a little bit more risk so I think you're out of your mind if you're going to use margin for like the riskier stuff for me the only thing that I use margin is by selling put options and maybe I mean maybe maybe covered calls so again looking at my portfolio I am mostly selling puts okay that's basic basically probably like 90 of my strategy for margin trading and sometimes I Do cover calls but thing is with covered calls you will be charged interest because you're holding the shares this stuff can get really nuanced so if you want a specific strategy again you can just shoot me an email and we can figure something out I don't usually do one-on-one coaching I am super busy and more money to me doesn't really matter but I do really want to help you guys and I really understand that helping you guys make more money is really awesome for your family for your future so and I am really passionate about this so yeah I am really willing to to help as much as I can and give back as much as possible because I really love this I mean trading options has really really changed my life I mean I've been traveling for like the past three years and it's all because of options and I don't really have any Financial issues that's because even something as simple as this right I don't have that much money but using margin I mean this is actually interesting I should have you know I didn't even look at this but just just check it out I mean how much gains I have and I'm recording this on a Sunday evening um it's actually morning in Europe but this is a Sunday evening so there's like no way that I'm probably shopping list or anything like that you know this is just literally old gains I don't have any losses and that's the beautiful thing about you know trading with me that's the beautiful thing about understanding the way I trade my strategies is yeah some people go for like big wins they go for like Heavy Hitters like they're trying to make twenty thirty thousand dollars a month with a small portfolio is that possible it is but you are taking excessive risk and whenever you're rushing for something and you're like desperate or needy it's actually like really bad behavior and it's not going to end up being like a long-term successful strategy and that just applies to lots of things in life right relationships Health there's no real like get fast or get results pill it's just about learning getting better honing your craft and I mean at this point option trading is really easy and it's really boring that's why I really enjoy coaching because option trading doesn't take me much time it's like a couple hours a week but as you can see here I mean it's just super consistent a thousand dollars I mean 268 is not that much on Chipotle but um Chipotle has shot up a lot and I ended up selling a really really safe out of the money put option I'm not just using margin and leverage in my other portfolio where it's like really safe and like really large account strategies this portfolio on Robinhood I'm also using margin I mean I have a whole bunch of positions way too many to count which I'm always posting of course but yeah it's a lot of positions accidentally clicked into Alibaba but this has actually been a really good stock for me I ended up making well not ended up I'm still making money on the stock itself and then I also have a covered call the really cool thing is I mean I show everything guys I don't have anything to hide I'm just going to go into my history you know people always show you their wins but they never share their losses um I actually think on Baba I only have wins obviously I have losses and other stuff but um I only have wins on Baba it's just been an amazing company Baba Neo I mean Palance here you guys know I've been talking about palantir forever so if you watch this channel I mean you're making money I I'm sure I've already made you several thousand dollars if you've been following my channel um religiously and you have the Bell notification on and you're

that's because Alibaba keeps going up and down and I was pretty sure that it's going to go up down and then on the 25th yes it was a pretty good bottom right I mean at least I thought it was on this three-month chart it was yeah essentially was hitting a bottom so I ended up buying some call options here now what happened next was not that great because on April 25th I ended up buying call options and it pretty much did nothing I mean it went up a little bit then down and yeah I ended up losing money well I didn't lose money I was losing money on paper but I had a big belief that this stock would bounce back and it would do well so I told my Discord Community everyone was asking me are we going to close this position we have a big paper loss the big paper loss was about 1500 so that's pretty significant especially for folks with smaller portfolios so I felt really bad about this trade that I ended up buying call options and I felt really bad because because you know whenever I trade I make a trade my reputation's on the line I want to make sure that I am doing the best job possible because I mean it's not just my money everyone basically follows my trades so whenever I have a trade then everyone either makes money or loses money and my goal is to be really really safe and conservative because I have a lot of investors that are close to retirement you know they have 500k accounts or more and I mean I don't know about you and I'm pretty sure this applies to everyone but we don't want to lose our hard-earned money I mean making money is extremely difficult uh I mean I again I grew up with nothing and when I made like two thousand dollars I was super happy super blessed and going to Chipotle to me was like oh my God I get to actually go and eat out at a restaurant and I was like 21 22 at that point so I'm really appreciative of what I've built and I understand that you guys are probably in a similar boat you don't want to lose your money you basically need a plan to grow it consistently and secure your retirement even if you're not retiring yet you still need to get there at some point and I'm really happy that I'm part of your journey but you know check it out so Alibaba went from you know the 25th from 82-29 to essentially you know nowhere 82.95 right um I almost closed it here guys I literally almost closed it but you know it was 5 10 I said you know we're going to hold this until expiration I really have a feeling um you know based on what I've seen Baba do in the past I think that we can pull up and then we woke up next day on on the 11th it was a Thursday this actually last Thursday I said guys we're out of here we are out of here on May 11th we are done we are taking our 400 of profit this has been a tough what was it like a tough two weeks I mean I didn't lose that much money but this position was down probably about 50 percent and then in just one day we ended up having a gain so ended up getting out of this position for a 400 game,1.0,0.9

I mean this stock really doesn't move and this is the exact stock that I like to use for you know selling strategies... that's what makes American Airlines such a good company for selling both puts and covered calls and as you can see here I'm not making a lot of money but I am consistently selling options on both sides on American Airlines...

Oakley one dollar put I ended up selling this which is a long-term put option it's kind of like a leap but it's like a sell put leap okay I ended up doing really well this is a dollar which means that it's only a hundred dollars worth of collateral... I ended up making 326 dollars I sold 14 contracts so uh 14 contracts times 100 is 1 400 and I'm up about 300 bucks so you know 1400 300 that is about one-fourth so let's just say let's just round down say I made 20 well that is really awesome because I ended up making 20 on a put option that I literally do nothing with I just sold it which is really far into the future but 20 per year that's actually not that bad of a return either,1.0,0.7

Invest with Henry,87p6eXHE-h0,2023-05-15T19:35:55Z,Buying Call Options | Call Options Explained For Passive Option Trading Income,Amazon,this is actually going to be very similar to the Amazon example because Amazon is currently at 110 so the call option I'm going to show you on Amazon is actually going to be basically the same but we're probably going to go out to 120 call option if you take a look at Amazon right now Amazon has been a stock that was well over a hundred forty dollars per share and recently it has had a major dip When I look at Amazon it's a clear bluish Trend to me because well we had like a triple bottom you see it was at 86 here and then again it was kind of like another 81.83 and then we have not seen that price and that price was back in the beginning of the year so about five months as I'm making this video we just saw that right now with actually Amazon if we end up buying like let's say 115 call option we can control 100 shares which is 11 500 for just about 745 dollars we're going to watch the Apple example and then get into the Amazon example because both of these stocks are phenomenal for buying call options we're going to watch apple and then we're going to get into Amazon which is a more recent example whereas this is a little bit older of an example so check it out so basically let's go back to this Amazon example okay so essentially what I want to do and I want to show you how to take profit as well because that's the most important thing if you don't take profit properly and just wait until expiration it could work but also you have Theta working against you so let me explain okay so if I expand this option right here you'll see like first of all the bid ask spread is pretty good it's pretty tight okay it's Amazon so I would expect it to be tight and close so say you're bullish on Amazon it ends up going up five percent in the short term well this option is going to benefit by 15 or 20 percent and in that scenario I would actually end up closing this position because I don't think there's a point of holding this too long since Theta will start to kick in and really eat away at your option so for Amazon at this very moment this is a current example Amazon is coming up which means that it could be a good time to buy a call option,1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,87p6eXHE-h0,2023-05-15T19:35:55Z,Buying Call Options | Call Options Explained For Passive Option Trading Income,Apple,we're actually going to pull up a real life example of Apple stock we're going to be looking at Apple call options that I'm going to show you exactly what a call option on apple looks like versus just owning outright shares of Apple by itself without having the call option so yeah what we're going to do is we're going to watch the Apple example and then get into the Amazon example because both of these stocks are phenomenal for buying call options we're going to watch apple and then we're going to get into Amazon which is a more recent example whereas this is a little bit older of an example so check it out I'm looking on my screen right now and basically we have an apple call option here as you can see it's a 120 strike and we can pay 207 dollars to buy basically the rights to 100 shares of the stock basically if you're going to buy 100 shares of Apple stock right now it's at 118.72 cents right now so if you're going to buy 100 shares you're going to have to take this amount right here 118 7 2 and because we're buying 100 shares we're going to put two decimal points over there we go 11 872 is what you will have to do to buy Apple stock right now 100 shares okay now with the call option we're going to be betting at 120 strike okay guys and this costs a cost right here 200 really interesting because I'm also picking the 120 strike and this is probably what I'm going to do with the Amazon example as well essentially I can draw you guys a graph right now all right so essentially we have apple right so let's say this is 118 okay 118 72 okay here's Apple stock it goes up and down right as the price here this is the price okay this is we've made zero dollars if Apple goes up 10 bucks to this area right here you earn 10 times 100 which is one thousand dollars okay you can earn a thousand dollars when Apple goes to this is going to be 128.72 okay that's Apple stock it's pretty simple right it goes up a dollar you make a hundred dollars because you have 100 shares now let's talk about the call option with the call option we talked about having a strike price of a hundred and twenty dollars so we need to go to at least 120 to start making money now we also have to pay 200 207 but let's just call it 200 okay with the call option you start out right here right away you're losing money because you have to pay a premium so you're paying 200 you start out at negative 200. notice that your maximum loss is negative two hundred dollars you cannot lose more than what you put into a call option okay so here we have a call option we we spent negative two hundred dollars and regardless of how low the stock goes you see a stock investor can go down all the way to negative 118 dollars times a hundred shares you can lose 11 Grand here or over 11 Grand with a call option you're stuck here on no matter how low you go you're always at negative 200 okay and your break even again guys it's the strike Price Plus the premium so the strike price was 120 okay and the premium was two bucks okay our break even is 122. so somewhere here okay one 22 called here is our break even price what happens is between 120 and 122 it starts to go up it starts to go towards Break Even boom we have broken even and now you have unlimited upside just like the stockholder and you're going up essentially one for one okay here you are so let's see what actually happens here is when a stock goes up ten dollars as a stock investor you earn a thousand dollars okay a thousand bucks as an option investor when it goes up 10 bucks okay this right here 128.72 we'll just call it 128. 128 minus 122 that is going to be six dollars guys so so six dollars you make okay I'm gonna draw it right here you make six dollars as an option investor and you make ten dollars as a stock investor okay so who made more money well the stock investor made 10 bucks and the option investor made six bucks but how much did the option investor invest and by the way since it's a hundred shares this is actually 600 and this is actually one thousand dollars okay this is a thousand bucks and that's 600 because again each option contract is worth 100 shares of stock so you know the stock investor made a grand but how much did he have to put in he had to put in eleven thousand dollars how much did the option investor have to put in he put in 200 bucks and got 600 bucks so you can triple your money as a call option buyer you can absolutely triple your money and even more it can go unlimited it can keep going but essentially I'm trying to paint you guys an example that buying calls you have a little bit of an initial Break Even price it has to go up by the amounts of Premium that you pay plus the strike price you can play around with the strike price that's beyond the scope of this video but essentially a call out you know what I will show you how to play around with the strike price in the case of an apple call option as you can see on my screen you can only lose 207 dollars when you buy calls your maximum loss is just a premium whereas if you own 100 shares of Apple stock at the current price of 119 you can lose 11 900 of course Apple isn't likely to go to Euro but it was 70 on April 17 2020 literally this year and that was just again it's an old example but the same really applies right now so if you're gonna hold a call option again you want to profit as fast as possible because time is working against you and then second of all you want to pick a stock that has good momentum so for Amazon at this very moment this is a current example Amazon is coming up which means that it could be a good time to buy a call option whereas this old example it's still very good because it's going to train you based on history and history is very important I never thought it was important but it is for making more money and that was just six months ago so you can lose thousands of dollars in fact three thousand nine hundred dollars to be exact if Apple falls back down to 70 per share as a stock investor as an option investor it's literally just two hundred dollars,1.0,0.7

I am up $1,000 on spy Spy is my number one ETF for running the wheel strategy because it is so Diversified if you check out what's inside this there's technology Financial Services utilities and a whole gamut of other sectors in fact every single sector. you'll also notice if I go to my portfolio QQQ and spy are very heavy in my portfolio because both of them are very Diversified ETFs they have a lot inside them",1.0,0.9

I ended up opening this up in my Discord Community because a student recommended that I take a look at financials and financials do seem to be actually having a very good support level. I actually want to show you Bank of America because if you look at the technical chart you will see exactly where support is, you're going to see exactly what my logic is for investing in Bank of America. I specifically want to show this stock because I think it's really good for a medium-sized portfolio specifically if you end up selling a put option like I did for 27. Bank of America, if you look at the stock right here, the current price of the stock is 27.69. You can see here that there was a very strong support as soon as this stock touched 26.97 we saw a balance. Again Bank of America went to 26.99, does this look like a pattern to you? For me I now see a double bottom. This double bottom means that two times the stock has tested this level and has balance which is a really strong sign there is a good support in place and that's exactly why I ended up selling a put option on Bank of America because I think under 27 per share that this is a no-brainer honestly I just think it's a no-brainer it's a good addition to your portfolio especially if you have twenty five thousand dollars or thereabouts. For me I ended up selling 27 because there is good support here. I think Bank of America can probably ride up to about 28 dollars maybe even 29 or 30. We can see that this stock is no stranger to the 30 level and in fact I mean this stock was at 36 dollars. If I go to the two-year chart this stock has been over forty dollars per share. So right now as you can see on the two-year chart this stock is really low, in fact it's at a two-year low which is instead of a 52-week low it is a hundred four week low which means that it's a very good value and that's actually why I ended up opening Bank of America. Selling puts like Bank of America is good.",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,iDjYHw7KSsE,2023-05-03T16:02:34Z,10 Minute Option Trading for Beginners,American Airlines,I have been running the wheel strategy on American Airlines for a long time now American Airlines is a very stable company I mean if I open this up on Yahoo finance or really any charting app I want to show you how consistent American Airlines is and this is exactly what I look for when I'm looking for a company that is a good candidate for selling puts for selling covered calls for running the wheel strategy as you can see American Airlines was a fairly expensive stock at around 17 that actually had a double Peak right here you can see that double peak one Peak was at 1708 and the other Peak was at 1706. that is a very good indicator by the way that the stock is overbought and it's very expensive now nonetheless I started investing in the company as it started to go down I mean I was investing in it before as well but I actually luckily avoided this whole big double top and actually we can even say it's a potential triple top because this is a 17 or almost 17 per share right here I avoid this and that's because I've been following the stock for a number of years now and I know exactly where American Airlines should be it should be around the 13 range okay it should be hovering around 12 to 14 okay as you can see when it goes down you can see it has a huge amount of support around 12 per share I mean triple bottom right here 12 or 1186 then right here it's slightly under 12. so as soon as it goes slightly under 12 it keeps bouncing higher and the same thing happened here you can see that it's 12 32 and it had a huge run up now I participated in the run-up a little bit but then I ended up getting at around 14 per share because for me the range that this stock should be is again between 12 to 14. so now if we go to the three month chart you can see that it's currently at 13.96 and that's why again I am running the wheel strategy I'm selling puts right around the 13 level I think this is a value play if I can get it for 13 that is an amazing price and then if I can do covered calls outside of the 14 range that's also a very good price point as you can see I'm selling 13 puts I'm basically saying I'm ready to buy I would love to buy this thing at 13. that's what selling a put is I'm saying I'm ready to purchase this company for 13 per share I'm committing my Capital I'm committing my money to purchase shares and at that price I would like to own this stock and that's why I call the sell put strategy a non-losing strategy because you get paid and the worst thing that can happen is you get to buy a company that you want to own that you like okay so I'm running the sell put on American Airlines and I'm also doing covered calls on American Airlines as well as you can see I'm also running different strategies like iron Condors so iron Condor is a little bit more advanced I have some videos in my playlist on iron Condors especially the small account playlist but iron Condors are a good tool to make a lot of income fairly quickly the risk can be a little bit higher but the return is enormous,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,Lg4sXF9yHGY,2023-04-27T21:00:13Z,Options Trading in 7 Minutes (How to Make $100 DAY As A Beginner),Apple,take apple as an example so if you were to buy 100 shares of the stock it would actually cost you fourteen thousand five hundred and sixty one dollars very expensive right that's why buying shares is not as attractive as buying call options and that's what is the beauty of option trading is that you get a lot of Leverage you can control 100 shares without having to Fork up all that Capital which makes this a very beautiful small account strategy if you have a small account buying call options can make you very wealthy very quickly it may not be the best strategy because it's not as consistent but if you're looking for the largest raw returns then this is going to be the video for you because you can do that by buying call options and specifically I recommend that if you want the largest return in the quickest amount of time that you will buy call options before earnings now going over this example right here on Apple okay if I expand this 145 call option you can see that the Delta is 0.54 so actually your chances of success here are a little bit higher than 50 percent which is much better than the one percent option when you buy out of the money or even if it's a 10 option that's not good the most successful Traders and the most successful experiences that I've had is going to be options that are in the money since they have a higher Delta than 50 percent your chances of ending in the money and actually making a profit is again going to be higher than 50 percent now the expiration date that I'm going for is December 16. but if you're watching this video in the future all you really have to know if you're buying a call option then it's better to do at least one month out if it does not have earnings and if it does have earnings then as long as you capture earnings you're going to be in good shape so let's go over this example of apple and then I'm going to show you a few different examples of how I would look at earnings and figure out if that company is going to beats or not so here's the mechanics say that I buy this 145 dollar call option now if I go ahead and buy it the total cost is going to be 870 dollars per contract as you can see here my maximum loss is 870 dollars that means the stock has to move a lot for me to actually break even the reason for that is although the strike price is 145 since the premium is eight dollars and seventy cents my actual Break Even is going to be 145 dollars plus eight dollars and seventy cents or roughly 153 dollars and 70 cents this is is why buying call options is a bullish strategy you want to make sure that the stock is going up because if it goes up you're going to profit however if it stands still you can lose a hundred percent of the premium that you pay or this 870 dollars and if the stock goes down of course you can still lose the 870 but the good news is about a call option is you cannot lose more than what you pay for the call option so one of the benefits is you have a limited risk profile of just 870 but you have an unlimited upside so if Apple goes up to 200 per share this option is going to be in the money by 55,1.0,0.6

Invest with Henry,E5FUVDUnOpU,2023-04-20T16:32:19Z,Long Iron Butterfly Option Strategy,Tesla,we know that Tesla just recently reported earnings and the earnings were not that good and luckily I don't have much of Tesla my portfolio right now because some either here nor there I'm making a lot of money on other stocks that's not Tesla but now that Tesla reporter earnings and they're pretty bearish I want to show you a strategy where you can just put up a couple hundred bucks well actually less than a hundred dollars and get a pretty decent return however I will also say the implied volatility is so high on Tesla that does make it a good candidate for the Iron Butterfly so there are some positives but there's also some negatives and that's just something that you have to be cognizant of let me show you this on a different stock so Tesla has high implied volatility,1.0,0.1
Invest with Henry,E5FUVDUnOpU,2023-04-20T16:32:19Z,Long Iron Butterfly Option Strategy,Apple,we can go to something like apple apple is going to have very tight bid ask spreads which is very good that means there's very little slippage cost okay I'm going to show you something slightly different so we're using calls to basically set up an Iron Butterfly but you can also use puts to set up an Iron Butterfly as well so what I can do is I can sell a put option so let's just go ahead and sell a 165 put option but I do want to go out further in terms of date let's go again and do eight days until expiration so I'm going to go ahead and sell the 165. now I'm going to be you know pretty tight actually let's go very tight so instead of going 500 you know we can go 250 and there's just pros and cons I'm gonna explain the pros and cons as soon as I set this up so if I do the 167 and a half which is only two and a half dollars higher okay and then I also go you know two and a half dollars lower to 162 and a half okay again I want to go into the custom order section right here I'm using Robinhood I've been with them for a long time they always give me special bonuses for my members so if you want to open an account I'll link that in the description but you already probably have Robin Hood so no worries you can use any broker it doesn't really matter so I'm gonna go to custom I'm going to go to sell so I'm going to change this one to two and that's because again I want to make sure that there's at least one cell for each buy so there's two buys and now two cells now you can actually see here that this is a very similar position not much has changed in fact the chart looks exactly the same but the return is actually amazing this is a really tight Iron Butterfly so the good news here is actually that it's only 39 so you can literally put up 39 to make 211 dollars this is again over a 5x return so if you want a five extra money in literally a week this is the best strategy is it safe well it's not as safe as doing out of the money spreads selling puts covered calls or basically any of the other strategies I talk about this is probably one of the riskiest strategies that I will discuss on YouTube but I do think that there is a place for this strategy especially if you have a lot of free time especially if you have a lot of free time to manage this position because because if the stock does go down in the short term you can end up making a really huge profit intraday so what I mean by that is if Apple goes down by just one percent this position is going to see a really huge gain because it's essentially banking off of reaching somewhere around this point so if you're bearish then you want to do this now if you're bullish you can actually just do the same strategy but you would want to change it up so I made the base at 165. wherever you think this will go to so say you think Apple will go to 170 you will have to adjust for that strike price and create a base at exactly the price that you think the stock will end that so it's kind of like a guessing game it's almost like a lottery and this is a buying strategy in some cases and this is a buying strategy so I typically wouldn't teach this on my channel but again I do think there's a place for this especially for small investors especially for investors that are a little bit riskier having tiny portfolios any of those type of things or just being honest some people want to have fun they want to put a small amount of money in and see if they can have a really big payoff and this is a strategy for it now I wouldn't use this strategy for more than like five percent of your portfolio heck I probably wouldn't even open more than one percent of your portfolio if you have over fifty thousand dollars you probably only want to throw in like a couple hundred bucks on the strategy but the good news is a couple hundred bucks can turn into a thousand dollars so again let's just pretend that you're bullish so what I'm going to do is I'm going to change this strategy right now so instead of this currently being bearish because you know obviously Apple's at 167 and the peak price here for making the most amount of profit would be 165. so this actually wouldn't even be that much of a decline Apple would only have to pull back like literally one percent and you can see a 5x return in a day so this isn't a complete stretch but again it's probably not super easy for it to end at exactly 165. but for this example as long as you're between 160 289 and then you're under 16711 you're going to see a profit and that's probably going to happen so in my opinion even if it doesn't go to a full profit of 211 dollars and say that you turn 39 into 78 which is just a double on your money that's fantastic right I mean the thing is you're probably not going to put up a lot of capital you might be a little bit crazy if you put up you know thousands of dollars because the likelihood isn't super high to reach your max profit but I will say if you just put 500 bucks on this there is a high likelihood that your 500 could turn into like 700 or 800 if you manage it correctly obviously you kind of have to watch it like a hawk so if Apple pulls back one percent you could end up seeing a return of 20 30 you know or 50 percent something like that and then I would just close out this position so I would probably never really hold this position until expiration as long as I see a return of like 50 to 100 I'm probably going to close out this position early now of course you can hold it until expiration especially if it's around its profit area so if Apple's at 165 and it's basically going sideways that's kind of a dream scenario and in that case I would hold this until expiration because at that point you have a high likelihood of achieving your maximum profit so this is clearly a bearish butterfly what I want to do is essentially show you how to have a bullish butterfly so all you really have to do is I'm going to reverse this position so I'm going to go ahead and buy back both of these and let's go ahead and sell again so let's say that you want your peak of the pyramid or your peak of the butterfly to be 170 okay or let's just say 172 and a half let's say that you think that apple is going to go to 172 and a half and that's you know a pretty bullish move in the next eight days and that's fine right it's based on your view so let's go ahead and sell a put option at 172 and a half now I'm just going to buy the 170 okay I'm also going to buy the 175 okay so going one below strike one above strike I'm actually going to play around I'm going to show you two above strikes and two below strike but let's just do this example okay so let's go to custom again I want to make sure that there's two cell for each buy okay there we go so this would be a very bullish butterfly so as you can see I'm risking about 55 dollars to make 195 so the return here is a little bit less it's only about a 4X return and apple would have to significantly go up okay so in my opinion this is not as attractive as the first example we were going over now what I do want to show you though is I want to get rid of this and I want to get rid of this and now I want to show you the difference of doing two strikes okay so I'm gonna have a 500 difference right now so instead of one seven I'm gonna pick 167 and a half instead of 175 I'm gonna pick 177 and a half okay so again I want to make sure that this custom order is correct there's two cells and two buys okay that is good now as we can see here I don't think it's actually working let me start this position from scratch just one more time so I'm going to go ahead and sell the 172 by the 167 and a half and then I'm going to buy the one 77 and a half and now again I'm gonna try doing this custom order alright took a second there but I got it to work so as you can see this is a very similar looking position right it looks the same Apple would have to rise and then you can make profit at your Peak point of 172 and a half but now the max loss is 187 and you're only making 313. now there can only be one reason why the max loss is so much higher and the maximum profit is so much lower and contrary to popular belief this is actually not a worse position every option trade is an even Money Trade meaning if you're risking a dollar to make a thousand you're probably only going to win a thousand one out of a thousand times here as you can see this looks much less attractive however not necessarily because Apple would have to go up a lot less for you to break even so now it would basically be a break even at 169 but before if I was doing a closer to the money trade like I was doing the 170 the break even would have been a lot higher the reason why this looks like a worse risk to reward ratio is because there's a higher chance of making profit and that's why you're getting charged a lot more money to have that higher chance to make profit to begin with,1.0,0.1

A company that's like you know say Tesla has amazing technical analysis and it's going upwards but the problem is if it's not worth what it's producing in cash flow then the technical analysis doesn't necessarily matter unless you're a short-term Trader which I am not I'm a long-term option investor I want to make consistent income and I guess I do sometimes look at the short-term picture in the medium term picture but I always use fundamentals because if a company is completely awful with fundamentals then maybe that's going to give me an idea to do some better strategies if it's really like a value stock but it's also growing fast then clearly I may actually do some buying strategies like you know call options it really just depends I'm going to teach you all of that and then once you learn everything you still need to diversify because even if you found the best stock and let's say you found Tesla in 2020 before the run-up you still don't necessarily want to put all of your eggs in one basket especially if you're an older man 30 40 50. I a whole lot of Tesla I was not following any safe risk management practices and I was not following a lot of rules that I'm going to discuss in this video and that I teach my clients at the moment I was just basically 100 Tesla and it was kind of dumb but at the same time I did a lot of research and I was very confident that Tesla's going to rise I mean I was very certain on it and I was willing to take a risk and I guess my risk paid off okay it was a little bit dumb but also I did my research and that's kind of the moment that was a season that I was in in my life I wanted to be more risky but even though I had a lot of Tesla and during 2020 we obviously had you know the pandemic and everything we had a huge crash in my portfolio must have lost a quarter million dollars in that same year I actually made all of it back it was incredibly easy because well the market recovered and as soon as it shifted I made so much money using options.,1.0,0.6

I'll be using American Airlines Alibaba Tesla spy triple Q I really do like the ETF steps and specifically I love using margin on ETFs because ETFs already have built-in diversification so you're going to learn a lot why ETFs are basically the best instrument to be using margin with. I still have another big position I know somewhere on spy right there okay so 15 contracts times about 4 400 is another six hundred thousand dollars. Let's go to spy as an example okay so trade spy options all right so check it out if I buy a call option say that I go out seven days okay a call option basically means that I get to own a hundred shares and bet that it's going to rise and I get to pay a fraction of the cost so for example if I bought 100 shares this would be 41 500 now most people don't have this laying around even if they're doing pretty well even if they have a successful business they're an older guy you know 50 60 and they have a million dollar portfolio they still might not have 41 000 just laying around so option buying is very attractive but you know the whole point is that it's already leveraged so right now I can buy this option for 231 dollars and I can essentially own a hundred shares which is forty thousand dollars worth okay so with a small amount of money I am controlling a large amount of shares now I can lose a whole 231 dollars here the entire amount that I pay for this option okay so using margin to buy options is silly because it's already leveraged why would you use more leverage to be using more leverage.,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,608AUW2tYLE,2023-04-19T21:47:37Z,Margin Trading Options Safely For Free Passive Income (Part 1),Robinhood,I use Robinhood there is a link in the description for opening up this brokerage you probably already have it and I don't really like Affiliates or anything like that but Robinhood did reach out and give me a really crazy deal where if you use my link that you get a couple of free stocks but the thing is the reason why I've actually stayed on Robinhood is they make it extremely easy to use margin okay I got approved a long time ago I think I've been on the platform since 2015 or 2016 something crazy like that and essentially I've been using margin without getting charged for it. Now you might be thinking that's crazy how do you use margin without getting charged for it it actually depends on the strategy that you're using some strategies will allow you to use margin without actually having to pay any margin interest because you're not actually having the stock and you're not actually having the shares in your account so certain option strategies will actually not even charge you which is why I've been saying I've been using margin for free essentially it's cost me nothing I use 500 000 and if I go to my account and I go to my Robinhood gold so I've been a member since 2021 before I was using TD Ameritrade so I have another TD Ameritrade account where I do some boring dividend investing but I also do use margin but you'll see right here that if I scroll down I'm paying five dollars a month but I have no interest absolutely none and when I count up my position which you will see right now 1.464 and 602 this looks like I have two million dollars and Robinhood is actually not showing the full amount of margin that I have the way you actually count that I'm going to do it a little bit manually right now but you'll notice that I have so much money in margin that it's ridiculous okay so here's the thing here's how you actually count because most brokerages won't actually allow you to know how much margin you're using it's actually very confusing and the reason for that is they're not on purpose trying to trick you but the thing is if you see right here it says 67 000 okay and if I go to American Airlines you still see 67 000 but if I go to trade American Airlines options it says 33 000.

Invest with Henry,608AUW2tYLE,2023-04-19T21:47:37Z,Margin Trading Options Safely For Free Passive Income (Part 1),Disney,Disney I literally opened up a Disney position today in my Discord because you know I got a question about it and Disney is not really profitable because the implied volatility is low but guess what because I'm selling a put option out of the money on a safe stock using margin it's free so I don't really care if I make 35 bucks on nine thousand dollars because the 9000 is free it doesn't cost me anything and the reason for that is because when I sell a put option it's an obligation in my account but it's actually not shares so I don't have to pay any interest because all I'm holding is a put option that I've sold it's an obligation but at this point in time it's not actually in my account it's just an IOU or a contract that says I will take your shares if those shares go down so yes I'm ready to buy them and I'm ready to buy them on margin and sure I will pay interest if I do get put the shares however that's where we're going to talk about rolling but first of all you you know going back to Disney it's very easy it's a no-brainer I'm selling something for 9 000 yes I'm only making 35 bucks but if I know my chances of making that 35 bucks is like literally 95 and even if I do get put I like this stock and I can start running the wheel strategy which I recently made a video about I'm going to link it in the description super important to know the wheel because I basically run the wheel using margin but if I get put not a big deal I'm gonna run the wheel strategy.,1.0,0.6

Invest with Henry,VWZtsduHSek,2023-04-17T16:35:24Z,Generate Safe Weekly Passive Income Selling Covered Calls For Beginners,Apple,let's use apple because I currently have apple as a covered call in my portfolio The reason why you would want to do covered calls on things like apple or Microsoft or Amazon is because I covered call strategy is a bullish strategy currently I have 1 200 shares of apple and as you can see I actually have a covered call position I just recently closed off a big winner in my Discord community so I just opened this up today if we go to my history you'll actually see that I have opened this up just three hours ago and I rolled okay previously I actually bought back a 150 call for 44. I previously sold that for a lot more so I made a really big profit but you know let's do step by step okay so let's take this example let's say that you have a hundred shares of Apple okay 142 dollars per share okay mine is actually 145 dollars average per share okay you're gonna go to trade Apple options and now whatever your average cost is if you buy it at this moment you can sell a covered call that just slightly out of the money if Apple went up to 150 or 160 well that would be fine because you're protected because you have shares I'm focusing on good growth stocks like apple Amazon Microsoft and all these other tech stocks but I'm using covered calls on top of them basically making my tech stock portfolio safer and generate income for me lately I've been doing a lot of covered calls on things like Apple and Google and that's because I see it being recommended here and it's been working out really well for me basically it recommends an expiration date and it recommends a strike price as well so let's check out this play right here on Apple 147 cell call for December 16th so again I'm going to go to Apple December 16th is going to be a very short expiration day that's going to be in just a few days again if you're watching this in the future short-term covered calls are still fantastic whether you go for one week two weeks or four weeks that's still fine the reason why you want to go a little bit shorter term is because options that are short term have a very high Theta now for me I have sold the 146 but the software was recommending 147 which is really close to what I would have done anyways so looking at the 147 strike there's a few things that I really like to look out for okay this is exactly how you're going to enter into the option position pretty perfectly okay so the way to actually do it as perfect as possible is a Delta of about 0.25 to 0.4 okay it really depends now why does it depend a 0.25 Delta is much better for volatile stocks since volatile stocks can move up and down a lot for example Apple Tesla you're going to want to go a little bit lower Delta and that's because a lower Delta is going to be further out of the money and the further outs of the money the option is well you have more upside but if a stock is not that volatile for example looking at Apple it's only 49 that's not high but it's also not low that's somewhere in between and that's why a 0.3 Delta is perfect because for a very volatile stock like Tesla you might want to go further out of Delta like 25 okay for a medium stock like apple about 30 is fine and then for a very low volatility stock like Coca-Cola you might even want to go as high as a 40 Delta and that's because the stock isn't really moving that much so you can go closer to the money but for Apple it's somewhere in between and that's why 30 Delta is fantastic,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,N5mxnWNXnik,2023-04-14T00:35:34Z,Wheel Strategy Options Trading For Beginners (5 EASY STEPS),SPY,I'm going to show you the position I have on spy QQQ and how to pick the right strike price of other stocks now let's go over an example in my portfolio of running the wheel strategy on spy QQQ and other positions that I'm looking to open up in the near future I really just want to talk about spy and triple Q so let's start off with spy this is a huge position for me it currently compromises about 84 of my portfolio so what I'm doing is I'm selling puts at 388 and the strike that I'm picking at 388 is pretty safe so if I click into this 388 put you're going to notice that my Delta is not that high in fact it's 0.19 so for me this is amazing I love this type of sweet spot where the Delta is between 0.15 0.2.25 what that means is every time I sell a put option I'm going to be winning like 80 85 percent of the time if I'm picking these type of Deltas so I do eventually want to get assigned again I don't mind owning these companies and these ETFs but in the meantime I am collecting a whole lot of income on my way of acquiring the shares now I just want to pinpoint my expiration days so I have a put credit spread which we can ignore for this video but then you will see that I have expirations for May 19 and may 19. now people always ask me do you prefer one week trading one month trading the fact of the matter is as long as it's one to six weeks out that's more than fine so I decided to go about six weeks out and I currently have a position and as you can see I am up 11 000 on spy Spy is my number one ETF for running the wheel strategy because it is so Diversified if you check out what's inside this there's technology Financial Services utilities and a whole gamut of other sectors in fact every single sector you'll also notice if I go to my portfolio QQQ and spy are very heavy in my portfolio because both of them are very Diversified ETFs they have a lot inside them,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,N5mxnWNXnik,2023-04-14T00:35:34Z,Wheel Strategy Options Trading For Beginners (5 EASY STEPS),Alibaba,I have this situation currently on Alibaba ticker symbol Baba so let's go over this screen share real fast alright so let's take a look at my portfolio right now and analyze my Alibaba position so I'm going to go into Baba on my search and then as you can see right here I do have a thousand shares of Alibaba and I have been running the wheel strategy for a very long time on Alibaba now and it's been incredibly profitable as you can see here on the stock itself I'm up 9710 and then on the options themselves I'm also up six thousand eight hundred and seventy dollars so two things I'm doing right now is basically I am actually doing covered calls and selling puts so essentially I have already ran the wheel strategy I've already gotten a sided 83 dollars per share and then I sold 89 covered calls that's fantastic because it's above my cost basis so my cost basis is 83 and then I have sold some 89 covered calls and I've collected a very pretty penny for that now although I have shares of Alibaba and I currently have a covered call position I am actually still selling put options as well so as you can see I have covered calls expire firing on April 21st but I'm also selling put options that are also expiring April 21st so I have currently sold the 87 put and the 80 put for me this is a very genius play on the wheel strategy this is sort of an addition to the real strategy and it's actually called a covered strangle the definition isn't so important the fact of the matter is I am running the wheel strategy and I got put but I'm still selling more put options so this is a very interesting case scenario where you do want to actually do this if you like the stock and you want more of it so for me I already have 6.42 of my money in Alibaba and I would not say that that is a little amount of money however I could move up all the way up to 10 percent also another thing to notice the reason why I sold put options and I'm still running the wheel strategy from its beginning despite having a lot of shares already is because I have sold the 89 covered call but that is actually currently in the money Alibaba is 92 dollars per share so I want more exposure into this company and therefore I'm happy to keep running the wheel strategy despite already kind of being in the wheel strategy and that's because I'm following my own rules I wouldn't mind owning more Alibaba shares I really would like to own up to 10 of my money in this company so for me I don't mind running the will strategy because I am fulfilling my rule number one which is I like the company Long Term now number two when I sell a put option the strike that I'm picking is still out of the money so although I would be in a big position if I were to get executed as you can tell Alibaba is currently at 92 dollars per share but I have sold an 80 put which is super out of the money and the 87 put which is just slightly out of the money although I may be put on the 87 put it is very very unlikely that I'm going to be put on the 80 put all right so now that we talked about Alibaba in my position on it let's talk about the number fourth thing that you have to do to run the wheel strategy success then you can see my Alibaba position so I have a whole bunch of Bob actually 87 foot 89 covered call 80 yard put and if you'll notice Alibaba yes is down seven percent however again my covered call right now is actually in the money and that's something that's really interesting this is actually something I learned at Goldman Sachs and this is something that Mark Cuban actually did when he got a four billion dollar compensation from Yahoo when he ended up selling his company he had a whole lot of stock and he was afraid obviously to hold four billion dollars worth of his stock so what he wanted to do was he wanted to get out of his stock but he couldn't because there's something called like a restriction period as soon as you sell a company you're not allowed to just dump your shares right away especially four billion dollars worth I mean that is a lot of money so instead what he actually did was one of his financial advisors and I'm not sure on the exact details there but he ended up selling covered calls but they were in the money similar to what I'm doing on Alibaba right now that's actually called a caller a caller is just a covered call but you are selling in the money covered calls so for example Alibaba is at 92 but I have sold 89 covered calls and that's in the money and that's why the premium is so juicy but today Alibaba fell a lot so literally my day's gain was five thousand three hundred dollars in one single day I made five grand and that's because I am really hedged now of course it's basically all of my total return at this point but that is amazing to see that the stock can fall seven percent meaning a lot of people lost a ton of money but my wheel strategy or my covered call here on the wheel strategy has fully protected me and I am very cushioned against the downside,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,iHTWAhFbLBs,2023-04-10T22:20:52Z,50X Poor Man's Covered Calls Strategy in Robinhood,Alibaba,for me to be honest any of the covered calls that I have right now take Baba for example this can be easily turned into a poor man's covered call you can see that I do have a covered call on Alibaba right now and I'm going to be giving you an example on palantir but right now Alibaba I have a whole lot of money in it and I'm actually up a lot I'm up twenty thousand dollars on Alibaba I'm going to look at bobbin Bob is actually a fantastic example I have already actually rolled Bob and I made really good money by Rolling it before you can actually see here I have a baba covered call roll and this is going to be very similar and I've done this many times for covered calls and and it's very identical to a poor man's cupboard call which I have also done many many times so what you're going to want to do for example is Baba is currently 103 dollars per share I have sold the 89 call so for me I can't make any more money if Baba goes up then I'm not making more money it's basically stalled and it's halted at 89 per share but I do want to profit as Baba Rises so say I'm bullish which I am bullish on Baba so say I want there to be more gains but I'm capped at 89 what do I do well this is actually where you can adjust the strike and this is where rolling comes into play you can roll the short-term call option because Baba has increased in value significantly this is actually a perfect example of how to roll and how to manage a poor man's covered call because it's the same thing Baba has increased in value a lot and this is basically the most dangerous position that you can be in with a poor man's covered call because you basically have to ask yourself how do I manage this position what do I do with this short call because the long call that you have is doing fantastic but the short call that you have sold is not in the best position it's actually in the money and it can be in the money by a lot so for me I am in the money by about 14 at the moment so if I go up to about 104 which would put me out of the money because it's currently 103 per share this is not going to be enough to compensate me in fact you can see here how I would be losing eight thousand one hundred fifty dollars now granted I would step up my basis or my cost basis on the stock from 89 all the way to 103. so I would be making pretty decent income here because I'd be rolling so high however I don't really want to pay a debit spread up front so what I'd rather do is I would actually rather still be in the money but I don't want to be at 89. so for example I can go from 89 to say 92 okay if I click 92 you'll see that the total debit is 1 000 which is still a cost but you can see I'm going from 89 to 92 I have 10 contracts that's 3 times 10 300 times 100 because each option is 100 shares so I'm basically making three thousand I am paying a thousand dollars yes I'm paying a debit but I'm stepping up my capital in the stock I can keep now 92 per share rather than eighty nine dollars per share so I'm getting three dollars extra I'm paying a thousand but I'm cleaning up or I'm clearing up the amounts of three thousand dollars so I'm paying one thousand to make three thousand that's a 3X return which is beautiful and if I can do that on a very consistent basis as the market goes up you are going to be making a lot of money so say that at expiration Baba actually falls down to 91 which would mean that this would be an out of the money option now because I have sold a 92 in that case I'll just let it expire for a full gain and I won't be upset that the stock fell because I'm still making really good premium by selling covered calls so for example although Baba could fall let's say by twelve dollars per share I've collected 13 so while all the stockholders have lost a lot of money because this is an in the money Poor Man's covered call I'm actually going off as a huge winner because I've still made money even after the stock ends up falling and that's the beauty of selling in the money covered calls.,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,iHTWAhFbLBs,2023-04-10T22:20:52Z,50X Poor Man's Covered Calls Strategy in Robinhood,Palantir,I'm going to be giving you an example on palantir So now we're going to take a look at palantir's options we want to purchase a leap call that will see price changes similar to the stock so look for a call option with a Delta of about 0.8 or more as a starting point when searching for an appropriate Delta check options that are at least 20 percent in the money I'll show you exactly what that means but for a particular volatile stock you may need to go even deeper in the money to find the Delta that you're looking for I'll show you why that is so important using palancer right now and I'll show you an example of weekly covered calls now balance your stock is at 7.80 check out palantir's technicals how long until you're restraining well above 20 for a significant period of time and then obviously the stock market has fallen down with tech stocks taking a really big beating especially the high volatile tech stocks because as interest rates rise these tech stocks are less attractive now palantir has sold off to levels where I think it just absolutely cheap on a long term basis under eight dollars per share is about one third of the price that it used to trade within now it's not likely that the stock is going to pull back up to 20 five dollars in a short swing right that's just not likely to happen but if balancer reports some good earnings this stock can be a 14 or 15 Dollar stock again so I expect that to take some time however this leap call option going for January 19 2024 gives us plenty of time for that to play out now if I click the five dollar option the Delta here is 0.82 which is perfect I'm looking for about a 0.8 Delta this is a 0.82 Delta meaning there's an 82 percent chance for this option to expire in the money and fun fact in poker if you have two Aces the chances of you winning is also 82 percent if you're playing one-on-one so this is basically a very high probability play very awesome and the break even on this leap call option is nine dollars and eight cents not too bad considering palantir can go up to 14 by expiration if it were to go up to 14 then the total profit would be about nine dollars and you're paying four dollars so you'll be able to a little bit more than double your money or turn four hundred dollars into nine hundred or four thousand dollars into nine thousand dollars now let me show you how to make this a lot better on yourself so if you do pay four hundred dollars that's fine however I'm going to show you how you can also make weekly income on this position Another thing that can happen is let's say that balancer goes up by one dollar in one month so what you will actually have is a profit and you can actually sell this call option or this leap option and just get rid of it for a profit and the exact amount of money that you're gonna make is actually that one dollar move times this point eight two Delta so this this option will go up by the amounts of the dollar times the Delta which is 82 cents now 82 cents is actually about a 20 return because 10 of 4 is 40 cents 20 is about 80 cents and if this stock were to go up by a dollar this option will go up 80 cents which is actually a 20 return so you can have a 20 return in one month or two months right you can have a very short term swing of 10 20 or even more than that if palantir recovers quickly that is a very smart strategy and I do like taking profit early whenever I see profits if it's a 10 20 return in a month then that's going to meet my hurdle for a rate of return my hurdle is typically five to six percent a month so if I'm making more than that I'm very happy and if I've made a significant amount more than that then I will cut the position take the profits and roll it in to another trade if balance your ends up above nine dollars and eight cents right here our break even points by January twenty twenty four or on this expiration date then you have made money so in the example of balance you're going up to 15 per share that is going to be a gain of ten dollars so you can have a 2.5 x return on the deep call option and along the way you can also collect some premium from selling covered calls so when the stock goes up by one dollar you're making 82 cents all right so now that you have seen an example I want to go back to Apple,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,iHTWAhFbLBs,2023-04-10T22:20:52Z,50X Poor Man's Covered Calls Strategy in Robinhood,Apple,so let's just pick Apple for example because apple is a great company to own but it's not necessarily cheap if you want to buy 100 shares of Apple it'd be sixteen thousand four hundred fifty four dollars as a time I'm making this video and instead what you can do is if I go to trade Apple options instead I can go out into the future so let's just go out into 2024 let's go to January 19 2024. so if I go to buy call option and then I just buy a call option that's in the money and I'll give you the best strikes in an example very soon but let's just go to one 140 for now if I end up buying this instead of having to basically pay the sixteen thousand dollars I only have to pay three thousand five hundred now that is a big big help because that's basically a one-fifth cost so instead of paying 15K you're paying 3K which is one-fifth twenty percent and that's amazing that's how you actually start off with the poor man's covered call so let's say that in the next two weeks Apple ends up going up and it increases in value which is actually a very good thing you can actually see here based on the chart if it increases in value that's very good you're going to be in this green zone making money so it's going to increase but right here at 167 and a half you're starting to get diminishing returns and actually it's going to go in the opposite direction because your short covered call right here is going to start losing money it's basically in the money so you may have to buy it back so for example we're going to go back to Apple we're going to pick the 145 call option this has a 77 Delta and notice that the Theta is .035 and that is actually not that much that's three dollars a day now three dollars a day is certainly not nothing but compared to 3175 dollars three dollars is a very small price to pay daily to own 100 shares of Apple now Apple would just have to move by three cents for you to keep breaking even on this option for it to cost you nothing so if Apple moves one percent which would be about 1.60 C4 this position would actually increase by about a dollar 64 multiplied by the Delta so Delta actually measures how much an option changes so if the stock changes a dollar this option is going to change by 77 cents which is actually a very big increase considering that you're only putting up again three thousand dollars and because you're putting up one-fifth of the price and you're getting 77 percent of the same movement so you're putting up just 20 percent but you're getting 77 in movement which means that you are leveraged and that is why people trade options to begin with that's also why I think the poor man's covered call is such a powerful strategy especially if you do your Technical and fundamental analysis correctly and for example if Apple goes up by five dollars this position is going to increase by about three and a half dollars but the short covered call may not increase in value at all because time Decay is working against it if your short call option is 30 days out and it takes roughly 30 days for the stock to go up by five percent that means that short call option is basically going to also Decay so you can make money on the leap that you buy and the covered call to choose sell which is the perfect scenario for a poor man's covered call apple has a decent volume I mean the open interest is thirteen thousand seven hundred fifty Seven now the volume is 30 but that's because I'm making this video on a weekend if you look at the open interest that is a very big indicator of the liquidity of the stock but apple right here is considered medium I mean 30 is very medium to me somewhere between 30 to 40 is perfectly fine,1.0,0.8

I currently have a NEO position right here at the $9 strike. Over the past one month, NEO has been as low as about $8.18. For that reason, I have been selling $9 puts and $8.5 puts because when I'm selling puts, although that does mean that I hope the stock won't go down, if it does go down, I am happy to purchase the shares. NEO is currently at $9 per share. So, let's say that I want to sell a put option at 8.5, which I currently have. Let's go through that example of how much money I could be making. So, I'm going to go to trade NEO option. So, let's just say you do want to own NEO. You can actually sell an inthe- money option like a 9 and a half or a nine. But, I do prefer to go out of the money. When you sell an out-of-the-money option, if the current stock price is nine and you're selling, say, $8 put, well, most likely NEO won't go down to eight.

All that really means is where Apple is likely to be traded based on this indicator. So after I use this indicator, you can see that Apple is near its low of the Bullinger band. You can see here that it's 46, which means to me that Apple is somewhere in the middle of its trading range. Now I see Apple had a lot of consolidation around the 119 level. So, I see there's a lot of support for Apple right at the 120 level. And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to click trade Apple options. Now, Apple is $128 per share.

SPY is a position that I have in my portfolio. In fact, I have a very large position on spy. If I click into spy right now, I'm going to show you that I have over a million and $100,000 in spy right now. And the reason why I like SPY so so much is because the options are amazing. Now, in this video, what I want to show you is even if you have a small account, let's say it's just a couple thousand, you can still sell put options on SPY. With this loophole, you can basically sell puts on SPY without needing to have all the collateral or capital to actually dump into SPY. So if I go to trade spy options, I'm going to show you this loophole. So essentially the thing that I mentioned that I like about spy is the liquid options. Let me tell you what expiration points I like for spy. I like selling put options a lot because they bring in premium and also because I'm kind of bullish on spy, especially because the market has been crashing. And again, SPY is an expensive stock. It's $374. So, let's go ahead and sell the 367 put option on spy and you're going to see the first problem that I come into and the problem that I'm going to solve for you in this video. Now, what I do want to point out for you um is that SPY actually has expiration days on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It's such a big ETF that so many people have in their portfolio and the options are just purely a dream. They are so nice because of multiple factors. Not only do they expire three times a week, so you can basically sell options or buy options on a very short amount of time. You can do it for the next day or you can do same day options, which by the way I also want to show you in this video. But the options are so abundant and they're expiring very often. Okay, the volume is massive. 21,000 volume for SPY, that's what I mean when I said liquid in the beginning of the video. For SPY, it's like a Toyota Corolla. There's always like a buyer. The share price for SPY is $374. What I personally do is if the stock goes down to say $363 per share, okay, right outside of my strike zone, I put a warning on this position. If you open up too much of this position right here on SPY, it would most likely work out well. But the one time it doesn't work out well, you could end up losing a lot of money.",1.0,0.9

There's information technology, there's healthcare, there's financials, there's consumer discretionary. So consumer discretionary stock, for example, is Starbucks. There are industrials. There's communication services, consumer staples, energy, utilities, real estate, and materials. You get the point. There's a whole lot going on in our economy. In fact, if I go to the S&P 500 right now and I click SPY, you will see that there's a whole breakdown of SPY in terms of what it's holding. So, as you can see, technology is a big component of the S&P 500. If I go to SPY right now, you will see that year to date, SPY is up 7.5%. So that is Q1. I have locked up Q1 by beating the S&P 500. And just so you know, over a 15-year period, the chances of beating the S&P 500 for fund managers, people with finance degrees, physics degrees, mathematics degrees, the smartest people, quote unquote, the smartest people in the world, right, that are the hungriest for making money, only about 10% of people can actually beat the S&P 500. So clearly, beating the market is a very big deal. So, for example, the S&P 500 here put up 7 12%. If I go to my portfolio, it is a lot less volatile. I am not seeing as big of a detraction when the market goes down, but I'm still getting a good return. In fact, I'm getting more return with less risk. So, my sharp ratio hands down is beating the S&P 500, which means that it's beating probably around 95% of Wall Street. But if you have over $100,000, you have to put your assets in buckets. So again, if I go back to S S&P 500 ETF, I'm going to tell you what the buckets should look like. I have a large amount of money in spy, $1.2 million in spy. So spy for me, it's like a big support in my portfolio. This ETF is diversified. It has 500 companies within it. I've been selling options making, you know, 3 to 4% a month for the past 3 months. So, I'm way higher than this S&P 500 return. But, as you can see, overall on the stock itself, I am down and I'm going to have to roll this covered call.

Okay, so if you have a lot of money, it is very silly for you and it's also very bad for option trading to go after these healthcare companies. So for example, like J&J is going to have very healthy um options. They're going to have a lot of option volume as you can see um in the one in the one-year chart. Johnson and Johnson's currently at 155 and it's it's very low. It's it's very low in fact. And if you look at the dividend yield, it's very good. So this is exactly the type of stock that I would just I would just buy and hold. and that's it.

So, what I would do, for example, is J&J. Okay, I'm going to go down 30 days out. I'm going to look for about a 1% return right here. This is perfect. So on J&J, I would expand this option. You know, the the volume isn't huge actually, which is is actually very shocking to me. I would think that Johnson and Johnson would have thousands of volume just like Apple.

So I'm in that exact scenario that I just talked about which is selling puts to get in and then when a stock goes down significantly right I don't really have a choice to sell 1550 at the time right so when I sold this 14 and a half call option let's [clears throat] just look at the exact day that I sold it I sold it on March 27th which was actually about a week ago and we go to uh American Airlines in the past one week the stock is up 5.59% so a pretty significant move um for a fairly stable company I mean if you look at the one-year chart This is a very stable company. So, you know, I sold a covered call and now I'm kind of dealing with the consequences because the stock is above the call option that I sold. So, what will I do? How will I manage this? Well, here's exactly how I'm going to manage it. So, as soon as Monday opens up, which is tomorrow, and I go on my live trading call, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to um roll this position, okay? Cuz I don't want to sell American at 1450. I want to keep the gravy train going and I want to sell it maybe for 15, 15. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to roll this position. And this is exactly how you want to manage, you know, a bigger portfolio. You want to do the wheel strategy for the majority of your money. And then if you ever get caught like this, like I just got caught right here. What you want to do is you still want to manage and adjust this position by rolling it up. So, this position is expiring on 46. What I'm going to do is I'm going to go to uh April 21st, which is, you know, not even 3 weeks away. And now I can sell the 15 1/2. Okay. I can sell the 15 for a profit. Actually, if I sell the 15, I will collect $16 here. Okay. So, I'm actually collecting $16 and moving from 14.5 to 15. And then guess what? When 421 comes around, if American Airlines is above 15, I can do this again. I can roll to 15 to 15 1/2. The next month, I can roll from 15 and 1/2 to 16. In the following month, I can roll from 16 to 16 1/2. I can continuously roll up in infinitely infinity times. As you can see in my portfolio right here, most of my positions are actually for a gain. As you can see in my portfolio, I have American Airlines, I have Amazon, I have Google.",0.95,0.4

I grew a lot of my portfolio because I did spreads on Tesla back when Tesla was growing like gang busters in late 2020, 2021. I was doing put credit spreads and I was collecting 10 15% a week. And at the time, even though this wasn't that long ago, I didn't really care because I knew that I'd be working for the rest of my life cuz I love working. I love coaching. And I knew that I'd be fine because I had a long time horizon. So I was willing to take higher risk. And that higher risk really paid off. It paid off big time because I was able to make 15% a week.
