Invest with Henry,V95XpR94NKg,2022-03-30T20:14:09Z,100X Your Money With These Cheap Option Trading Strategies,Robinhood,this isn't fully true because robin hood isn't accounting for the costs of filling this trade which i will discuss shortly. whether you're doing this on robinhood or a different brokerage i do recommend robinhood they do give you some free stocks i'm going to put that in the description but it doesn't matter which brokerage that you use it really doesn't as long as you're following what i'm doing step by step in your brokerage,0.9,0.3
Invest with Henry,V95XpR94NKg,2022-03-30T20:14:09Z,100X Your Money With These Cheap Option Trading Strategies,Tesla,All right now let's take a look at this tesla christmas tree now that i have opened up my account i'm up currently 261 thousand dollars on tesla but i want to show you this small account strategy using tesla now what we're going to do we're going to go to tesla options so that's the first step now the first step to opening up this position is to sell a call option now i'm going to pick a date somewhere in the future if you're watching this in the future it doesn't really matter because this strategy is going to work the same whether you're watching this in 2022 2023 or beyond okay so i'm gonna pick an option that's about one month from expiration roughly four to six weeks is fine because when a stock consolidates it typically moves sideways for about three to eight weeks somewhere in that range so four to six weeks is going to be a good time period for me to bet that tesla isn't going to have a whole lot of movement again this is tesla so it is harder to predict because tesla is a really volatile stock but again you can choose this strategy on a stock that you think is consolidating you can use technical indicators like rsi moving average or one of my favorites is bollinger bands so i'm going to click may 6 right now and for may 6 i'm going to sell the 1100 call option so step number one sell a call option now this call option that i'm selling is going to be the peak of my christmas tree it's going to be the very peak and if tesla stops right around 1100 that is where i'm going to see the biggest gains on this position but again i don't have to have this option expire what i can actually do is as my option approaches expiration say it's the end of april or even the beginning of may now the beginning of may would be really close to this options expiration but let's just say a couple weeks has passed and the stock is trading for around eleven hundred dollars that's when this option is going to see a lot of gains even though it's not even that close to expiration so step number one is you want to sell a call option and again this is going to be the peak of your christmas tree now i'm going to buy a call option now i'm going to buy a call option at 10.80 that's because i think tesla will stay above 1080 for the next couple of weeks and now what i can also do is i'm also going to protect this position by buying an 11 20. now you will see how this is going to end up playing out when i go over here and create a custom order but first of all pick a cell we pick the cell now we're buying a call option under the strike price so 1080 and now i'm going to buy a call option over the strike price at 11 20. so now i have completed this order the only thing that i need to do now is i need to go into this custom order section this is going to be really important because basically you need an equal amount of buys for each cell so you don't want a one-to-one ratio you want to click custom right here and because we have one buy and a second buy but we only have one cell this is not a balanced trade and as you can see it's going to be costing you a lot of money well i can imagine that many people do not want to pay 8 000 to open up a position so instead if you end up selling two of these the actual cost of this position is going to go down to just 52 dollars so this is going to change by the minute however as you will notice about 33 to 50 bucks and our total profit is 2 000 so this is an extremely powerful strategy because you're only risking a little bit of money for a very very huge gain in fact right now as it currently sits it's 13 into 2 000 it's pretty insane but of course if you do go fill this i do want to say one of the issues is because you're dealing with four different options right now this is going to be a little bit more expensive than 13 i would imagine this is going to be about a 50 to 100 spread and now as i'm talking here it has actually said the max loss is zero but again i think this is going to be about 50 to 100 if you're going to open up this trade so it's going to be about a 200 x opportunity so right now it's currently trading for about a hundred bucks so again 200 x opportunity is what you can get with this position now let's talk about managing this position this is pretty much the most important thing so this position currently expires on may 6. the way you want to play this is basically if tesla continues to trade within this range you're going to continue to have profit because you're paying very little money so even if tesla is going to be right here around 1080 you're going to see a decent profit if tesla goes beyond 1100 up to 110 you're still going to see a profit as long as tesla stays within this range right here in the next few days the next few weeks you're going to see a lot of profit and this position is going to move to a few hundred dollars worth of profit now you're not going to see a full 200x gain until you get closer into the may expiration at that point you can close this option for a potential thousand dollar gain or higher if tesla is still within this range especially if tesla's hovering right around one thousand one hundred dollars in this example however all you really need to happen is for tesla to stay within this range so the most important thing on running the strategy whether you're doing it on tesla or any other stock is to have a stock stay range bound now the way i would close this trade is i would set an expectation for hey i'm putting up a hundred dollars i want to leave this trade with 1 000 so that's probably what i would do however i would probably sell this stock at a 500 gain as well so if i see that the position is up five or six hundred dollars then i have five to six x my money at that point i typically like to sell and take a profit because the saying goes you never go broke taking a profit now for a lot of people it's really going to depend on how aggressive you are if your thesis continues to stay that i think this stock is going to trade within a certain range and it continues to stay right around the peak of this strategy then you can keep holding that position and keep gaining more money however if you feel there's a lot of volatility in the stock you have a big profit on your hands and you're scared to lose that profit i would just say don't get greedy take a 5 or 6x return you have seen how to place the trade but there's also a lot more factors you need to know to make money from this trade the trade profits as expiration day approaches if the price lands within a range near the sensor strike price the most important thing is you pick and forecast a target price you believe the stock will land on at some point in the trade because i don't hold this position until expiration it's only important the stock approaches the top of the profit chart at some point in the future but doesn't have to end there that's because when i open this trade my goal is to close a trade when the stock moves toward the strike that i sell in the example we sold 1100 strike so basically the stock really has to do nothing for a few days and the position will see a nice profit even if the stock moves up a bit then down that's still fine as the position will see daily profits if the stock stays within a tight range so this first strategy is really for when you see a stock consolidating and not having much movement this typically happens after earnings has come in and there isn't much more news expected on the stock i like using this strategy on blue chip stocks that have predictable charts. so now we're going to go back to tesla i want to show you a slight variation of the strategy and how you can actually bet on the stock doing something very specific if you get that right you can again see a five to two hundred x on your money so right here as you see as i'm even making this video tesla is moving closer to eleven hundred dollars per share so if i actually open up that first position that i was showing you guys i would already have a gain on my hands of about 10 because the stock is moving up towards the price that i believe it's going to be around but what i want to show you specifically is say as an investor you actually believe that tesla is going to go up to 1200 per share or you have a very specific view on a certain stock well what you can do is you don't have to sell a call option write the money you can actually sell a call option for the exact price that you think the stock will end at so let's say that we believe that tesla is going to end at 1 dollars per share that is going to happen by may 6th or actually let's say that it's going to happen at next earnings and let's say next earnings are sometime in june so let's say that june 17th will capture earnings so now what we're going to do is we're going to pick june 17th now we're going to again go to sell call option and say that you think the stock is going to end at 1 200 what you're going to do now is you're actually going to sell the 1 200 call option because that is going to be the top of your profit chart so selling the 1 200 i'm gonna go a little faster i'm gonna buy the 1150 and now i'm going to sell two strike prices above as well the 1250 and again one important thing is i need to go right here into the contract ratio click custom and i'm going to sell two call options to match each of the call options that i'm buying this strategy now costs 295 however it can bring in a total of 5 000 worth of profit or about 4 700 after you account for the money that you're paying so now the top of this strategy is actually going to end when tesla is 1 200 per share so if your target price is 1 200 you don't have to bet at the current level you can actually set up the strategy for anywhere that you wish and the way that you control this is by picking the strike price and selling the strike price that you believe the stock will end that on expiration or sometime in the near future so basically right here i sold twelve hundred again over the next few weeks if tesla goes up towards this price and it goes up right here that's actually going to be a very big profit it currently says one thousand dollars but if this happens in a short amount of time then this position can be up actually two or three thousand dollars and you don't even have to get into june 17th or wait for the option to expire you can always close this option for a profit as long as the stock is moving in the direction of the peak of your strategy strike price remember these are riskier trades you need to close before expiration when you see some profits don't get greedy on these trades because profit is profit.,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,V95XpR94NKg,2022-03-30T20:14:09Z,100X Your Money With These Cheap Option Trading Strategies,American Airlines,one of these stocks which is super cheap is aal or american airlines let me show you a quick example so you can see this very cheap option trading strategy in action all right so the next stock that i want to talk about is american airlines because this stock if you look at the chart it has been a pretty steady stock so over the past three months it's basically up 0.86 percent it has done absolutely nothing for three months if i look at the one year it has gone down about 21 however typically within a three-month tie period this stock really doesn't do too much so if you take a look it's been 22 on june 22nd and now if i go to about november which is five to six months this stock is still at 22 so i didn't do anything for five months now again if we take a look from about late november it's been about 19 and currently it's sitting about 18 so this stock really doesn't have a whole lot of movement it seems that investors are trading american airlines in a very tight narrow range so at any given one month or two month period this stock doesn't really do too much which is a fantastic candidate for the same strategy that i was just showing you however there are a few key differences with american airlines now the main key difference is that american airlines is an 18 stock and not a 1 000 stock that is actually an advantage in some regards and also a disadvantage in other regards let me go over an example so again i'm going to go for an option that's going to expire on may 6 because it's about five weeks away and i just mentioned a stock like american airlines isn't having that much movement in a single month so the first thing that i'm going to do again is i'm going to sell a call option i like to go for at the money call options so right now i'm going to sell the 18 strike price it is just slightly in the money with american airlines trading at 18.08 cents now what i'm going to do is i'm going to buy i'm going to buy the 17 call option and now i'm also going to buy the 19 call option so now you'll notice again that i have a total cost that is pretty significant it's 145 which is kind of a lot for a very cheap stock so what i'm doing now is i'm going to go to contract ratios so whether you're doing this on robinhood or a different brokerage i do recommend robinhood they do give you some free stocks i'm going to put that in the description but it doesn't matter which brokerage that you use it really doesn't as long as you're following what i'm doing step by step in your brokerage so click custom order or make a custom order where you're selling the equal amount of shares that you are buying or the equal amount of contracts so i'm going to sell two 18 contracts now the total cost is only 14 if i scroll down right here we can turn about 15 into 100 which is basically an 85 dollar profit this is over a 6x return this 6x return can happen by may 6 or by about one month from when you're watching this video and you open up a trade just like this however again i want to caution you that you're usually not going to see the full 6x because there's a few factors that play one of the factors is there's bid in ask spread costs that you have to account for and the second thing is that typically this stock is not going to end right at the very top right at 18 in this example you're typically going to have the stock end somewhere between this range but also you're typically or you actually should close the position before expiration because as expiration approaches this option position becomes very volatile however as long as the stock stays within this range in a few days past a couple weeks past this maximum loss of 15 dollars will start to go up because these options will start having a very high probability that they will end somewhere in the zone and because they're going to end somewhere in the zone you are going to start seeing a profit so you might turn 15 into 30 or 45 so you may get a 2 or 3x gain and at that point i would look into selling this position for a profit and getting rid of it early because with this type of strategy you really want to manage it you want to keep your eyes on the profits and if you see a 2 to 5x profit you really want to get out of the trade before it can go south on you,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,MCDXBRLBwvs,2022-03-23T17:51:34Z,Urgent: MUST BUYS,Tesla,i have stuck to my guns on many stocks like tesla although i did put a lot of my money into index funds and i shifted some risk... in this portfolio actually outperform the scaling with spreads challenge however the only reason i really did that was probably because i had a big position in tesla stock so i did have a one-time huge huge gain but still the results are the results i had a lot of tesla i did a lot of full credit spreads i ran a lot of different strategies and i had a really big return here that actually outperformed my smaller portfolio but going forward i do expect my smaller portfolio to outperform my main portfolio because i don't have as much tesla in my main portfolio so even if tesla were to go up i wouldn't have as much of a gain as i had before,1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,MCDXBRLBwvs,2022-03-23T17:51:34Z,Urgent: MUST BUYS,Hims,First one i'm going to start with is hims hymns is a stock that i have a lot of conviction in this stock has been really volatile for the most part however it has a very very strong support you can see a multi bottom right here at four dollars and 19 cents then we had a huge sell-off and again four dollars and 20 cents that's two times where it's around four dollars and twenty cents and then we did test the bottom we went below four dollars per share three dollars and ninety cents however you know i was really bullish on the stock i think they're in a lot of different spaces that are really good spaces that you know a lot of men need you know they're in erectile dysfunction they're in mental health they're in skin care they're in online therapy they do a whole host of different things and their business model is basically collecting consistent cash flow from their customers because a lot of these pills that they're pushing or online therapy or what have you are subscription services so they keep getting those cash flows the ceo went to university of pennsylvania i went to drexel university so upenn is right next door it's an ivy league college so i have a lot of conviction in the ceo also this company is in the telehealth space so i like telehealth as a sector in general because people don't want to go to the doctor anymore they want to do everything online it's much easier it's much faster and hims and hers has a lot of different services and subscriptions that have a very good price taking a look at hims it's currently at five dollars if i go to trade options there's a number of things that you can do here obviously you can buy call options because right now the recovery i can just see a lot of people making money off of buying call options since the momentum has just shifted i mean we were in a downward slope for a very long time... if hims has a blowout quarter we could go to potentially seven dollars per share you can get a pretty decent return maybe 50 or higher in the next three to six months again if you do want to be safer though you can go for something like a leap option you can go out for january 20 2023 if this stock has a significant recovery then you would actually double or even triple your money because if i go to the one year chart i mean this stock was trading for about fifteen dollars per share and currently it's trading for five dollars so you know in theory it's on a 67 discount from its very peak but hey you don't even need it to go up to 15 to make a good profit so anyways that's the first stock hymns,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,MCDXBRLBwvs,2022-03-23T17:51:34Z,Urgent: MUST BUYS,Alibaba,most of the stock sold off including baba i put 500 000 in baba i made that video i got some comments saying i was wrong i was wrong for like a week okay alibaba is like 114 stock right now yes there's a lot of volatility a lot of stocks that i'm mentioning to you guys have volatility because that's where the opportunities are especially if you're trading options volatility should be your friend,1.0,0.3
Invest with Henry,MCDXBRLBwvs,2022-03-23T17:51:34Z,Urgent: MUST BUYS,Disney,now i want to look at the rest of my um portfolio right here so you know we have other stocks in the metaverse that were related to the metaverse like disney,1.0,0.0

Invest with Henry,MCDXBRLBwvs,2022-03-23T17:51:34Z,Urgent: MUST BUYS,Google,some of these stocks are really expensive so maybe i wouldn't recommend google however when i think about it i would recommend google because they're going to have a stock split in the near future now so you know they're going to have a 20 to 1 stock split stock is going to go from 2 800 down to about a hundred and forty dollars give or take so this will be a good candidate for buying call options on for selling put options if you have you know fourteen thousand dollars in your portfolio that would be a good position to take on google,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,MCDXBRLBwvs,2022-03-23T17:51:34Z,Urgent: MUST BUYS,Meta Platforms,now facebook can be fantastic i love facebook because it's a blue chip stock i know they're investing in the metaverse i know that they have some problems with basically their cash flow last year they didn't really report good numbers and i know they're struggling in that regard and a lot of people are worried about facebook right now especially with tick tok becoming a bigger threat to basically all the social media out there because short form content is performing a lot better than long-form content people are spending more time on the tick tock app than you know instagram reels and snapchat and that's basically why you're seeing all these services go out there like youtube shorts because the market understands that you know there's a lot of opportunity here and if they don't get on this and they're going to have a problem if tick tock continues to grow so we're going to take a look at meta platforms right now it's sitting at 216 per share if i go to the three-month chart down 34 actually you guys will see right here that i made 595 dollars this was a short-term trade that i made I sold some puts told the discord community about it so we're up 595 dollars this is a bigger position... now facebook is a perfect candidate i did open this up before you guys can see right here that i did basically find the bottom of the stock that's why i alerted my group right away when i think that facebook could not move any lower and i was completely right right here but again i do want to share it with the youtube family as well the stock is up now a bit but i would still look into selling put credit spreads at a hundred ninety five dollars a hundred ninety dollar poke credit spread that could do really really well and again i did find the bottom right here so i alerted the group right around these levels and um i ended up being completely right i couldn't find any more reasons for metastock to move any lower i mean the stock had a major selloff from 323 down to 237 and then this slow painful move lower just continued for a while you know i was very patient but once i saw it under 200 once i saw a move at 195 dollars told the group right here hey we have to sell some put options it's a must and so far up 48 on this um put option but of course you know other people in my group have put credit spreads but anyways they put credit spread you would simply go to trade facebook options you would click sell you would click put... so facebook credit spread does look good to me it is a 32 total credit not bad at all especially for a couple hundred bucks worth of investment i mean literally anyone can go out there and make that position happen for themselves,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,MCDXBRLBwvs,2022-03-23T17:51:34Z,Urgent: MUST BUYS,Chipotle,taking a look right here i have cmg in my portfolio i love chipotle i love eating at chipotle the food is amazing i'm up 129 i'm basically playing this position right here i'm gonna go into it i think it's a really good position for other people to uh play and frankly i think this uh position should be up more it actually doesn't even make sense to me but i do realize that this option position expires in june so basically i bought a 1500 call option i sold a 15 20 call option so i'm basically playing a bull call spread i do have videos on that i'm going to link below as well but i'm doing a bull call spread i'm hoping that by june 17 this option position or the stock stays above 15 20. but the stock is currently at 15.58 so i was completely right about my prediction of what's gonna happen to chipotle however i'm only up twelve percent so this doesn't make a lot of sense for me i would think that i'm up a lot more because this option is so in the money but i do realize that you know in option trading you are playing with bid ask spreads so maybe chipotle is not as liquid that could be one reason and the second reason is there is a lot of time left on this option there's about three months left for the option to expire you know it's currently march it's end of march right now and this option is gonna expire in june so for me you know only being up 12 but being completely right in the stock i think there's a lot of opportunity here in chipotle bull call spreads,1.0,0.9

stock works as long as there's a few things that have to be in order in fact let me just show you an example so i'm going to type in pltr i'm going to open up pounds here technologies now i do want to analyze this stock because it's a popular one and it's all showed down a lot i mean it's down 31 in the past three months so i'm going to show you how to sell a put option to basically begin the wheel strategy so step number one in your brokerage account it doesn't matter which brokerage you're using go to trade options for the respective stock that you're picking now for me i like to sell weekly put options because there's a lot of premium and every single week you can basically collect income so you have a weekly income however i will also sometimes go out two weeks so in this example i'm gonna go out to april 8th this is two weeks out then i do want to make sure that i am selling a put option so make sure that that is what you're doing now sell put option i'm going for april 8th again if you're watching this in the future you can just do this at a future date now what i'm going to do is i'm going to sell a put option lower than the current share price so you'll notice right here that the current share price is 12.76 so say i want to buy this stock at 12 which is lower than what it's trading for right now what i'm going to do is i'm going to sell the put option i'm going to click right here now i can collect 45 so this is about a 4 return give or take okay so i'm betting on this position not to go down to twelve dollars and i'm collecting 45 dollars don't look at this max loss it is not correct because basically if you're planning to do the will strategy and you want to buy the stock this max loss does not matter because what can happen the worst case scenario is you end up owning the stock which is totally fine all right so that's step number one you collect income to get into the stock now i do want to expand this right here because i want to briefly cover the bid ask and some of the other details that i do look at now i do look at the volume i want to make sure the stock has at least 100 volume okay if it does not have 100 volume then you're dealing with a stock that is not very liquid and what i mean by that is not many people are trading the stock which is not a good thing because typically what will happen is you're not going to get a good price on the option that you're selling okay the other thing that you do want to look at is the bid and ask you want to make sure that it's tight and what i mean by tight is that it's close together okay if the bid is let's say 10 cents and the ask is a dollar in 10 cents that's not good because it's so far apart you're going to get a price somewhere in the middle say maybe 40 or 50 however here you have a very little slippage amount i mean very little amount that you have to pay in terms of the difference between the bid and ask spread so the bid ask spread and the volume are the one of the two most important things that i do look at now the other thing that i look at is high implied volatility you want to make sure the volatility is at least 40 because when it's 40 or higher that's a fantastic thing because you're going to be collecting a lot more premium and the more premium you collect the faster you can in theory get your price down of acquiring the stock to maybe fifty percent off or even a hundred percent off over time by selling these put options now let's say that you get put the stock this is where things are just as easy so if you already have 100 shares of the stock all you have to really do is have sell call options so now you can sell a call option now let's say that you got into the stock at 12 per share so your average cost is 12 however again if you recall we were collecting about 45 so your actual break even or your actual cost is only 11.55 so tell me now you can basically sell any of these strikes and be completely profitable you can sell the 12 you can sell the 12 and a half you can sell the 13. let's just say we're going to sell maybe the 13 and a half strike so even though the stock will be lower these options will have lower premium but the premium will still be there so actually let's go down to 13. so if the stock is trading for 11 and 50 cents let's say you're underwater by just five dollars that's totally fine because now you can just start selling call options for a premium and even though the stock went from 1279 to 11.55 which is a significant fall you're basically breaking even and now you can still collect income and start generating passive income from selling covered calls or selling call options this is how the mechanics of the wheel work you sell puts to get in and now you can sell let's say the 13 call option now you can start collecting maybe it won't be 71 but maybe it'll be 45 again so you're getting 45 to get in you're getting 45 to get out now you have 45 coming in on a very consistent basis on a small position of a thousand dollars i mean in a month that's going to be about 90 dollars that's about an eight to nine percent return on repeat eight percent return monthly is going to be about doubling your account every single year now even if you have a small account doubling your account is a really big deal now this is the power of the wheel strategy and what i love so much about it"",",,,

Invest with Henry,yRTUVGOQmwE,2022-03-19T17:01:19Z,Option Trading Greeks Explained Beginners | Before You Trade MUST KNOW!,"""excerpt"": ""i'm going to open up a stock it can be really any stock i'm going to open up let's say alibaba i've been a fan of alibaba in february doesn't matter if you're watching this in the future by the way it's the same thing that's the beauty of options they literally are the same thing over and over there's no difference in how to trade options so i'm gonna go to trade baba options. if alibaba moves up by one dollar this option will move up by 55 cents which is pretty crazy because a one dollar move in alibaba is going to be like something very small like one percent in the stock right the stock's only moving one percent however the option is moving 55 cents and because the option premium is 6.55 this is almost a 10 rise i mean it's probably like eight or nine percent so the stock can move one dollar which is less than one percent and this will move the option by 55 cents which will move the option by almost 10 so here is the beauty of option trading you get a lot of leverage you get a lot of power here because you don't have to buy 100 shares of alibaba at 106. you can buy this call option and even when alibaba moves up by one dollar you're going to be making about 55 cents on the dollar or about an 8 return which is a really high amount and this is also why i tell students you don't have to hold until expiration you do not need to hold this 107 dollar call option until expiration say within let's say one day or two days that this stock moves up by three dollars well if alibaba moves up by three dollars do the math tell me how much money that would be pause the video if you have to all right so hopefully you got your answer so about three dollars times point five five is going to be over a dollar and fifty cents a dollar and fifty cents it's going to be probably 1.65 cents or something like that but a dollar and 65 cents is literally a 25 move or thereabouts on the option premium so although the stock will move up by three dollars the option will move up by a dollar fifty and that translates into a lot of money because the premium is so small. let's say that alibaba moves up by one dollar well if it moves up by one dollar gamma is point zero two so just add point zero two to the delta so now the delta's gonna be 0.5 let's say that alibaba moves up by two dollars well two dollars times point zero two six six is going to be about point zero five okay you add point zero five the delta that's going to be point five two all this is saying is that if alibaba goes up by two dollars the new delta will be point five two if it goes up by three dollars the new delta will be point five four point five five it goes up by ten dollars well if it goes up by ten dollars then it will go up by 26 or 0.26 add 0.26 here and you're roughly going to get 0.73 so gamma is just added to delta it's always being added and if it's up by one dollar well you add one dollar times gamma to delta if it's up by three dollars you add three dollars times gamma plus delta that's just what the delta will be given the change also it works vice versa let's say that alibaba falls by one dollar well if it falls by one dollar then you can subtract .0266 or this gamma value from delta which is roughly going to be a delta of 0.45. so every single day alibaba stock needs to move up by about 33 cents for you not to get hurt by theta because theta is a decaying value whenever you buy options you're paying for something and that option is decaying as time moves on so theta continues to decay. what i do care about is let's say i sell a put option right here and then i'm looking at alibaba at 100. if the implied volatility like in this example is 63 that's a fantastic volatility 63 is a very high number which is why there's a lot of premium to selling put options on alibaba stock."",",,,

ticker symbol pltr much of palantir's business centers around one thing analytics its foundry software allows customers to harness multiple data streams and make well-informed business decisions with areas like supply chains or manufacturing this is a dream stock for someone that understands the booming industry of data analytics for a company generating 1.5 billion in revenue talenteer has relatively few customers it grew its user base from 139 in 2020 to 237 in 2021 marking a 71 increase this meant that the average customer spent was 6.3 million dollars with talent here during the year showcasing just how expensive the product is still there are multiple businesses that can afford the software especially if it means helping out the supply chain hiccups i have a lot of optimism for palantir and i want to show you the options that i'm looking to do on palutear stock all right i'm going to come back to my portfolio in just a little bit but let's look at pltr so palantir technologies this is a stock that i'm very blush on now this stock has sold off a tremendous amount back in the past three months it's down about 35 this used to be about a 20 stock i mean it was trading at 18.93 at the end of the year in december 23rd and now recently it has had a really big downtrend now we have had a bottom here at 10 and 43 cents and now the stock has actually started to trade sideways and has shown some signs of recovery so currently the stock is sitting at and 65 cents i'm going to trade palantir options now i'm going to show you two different things that i would do if you're watching this in the future you can always go out a couple weeks ahead i'm going to go out until april 1st so if you're watching this in april then you can go for may if you're watching this in may you can go out for june but basically my goal is to go out about two to four weeks and this is because i'm gonna collect a decent amount of premium this is still a good option because it has high theta and what i mean by theta is let's go to the first strategy first one is going to be selling put options so the first strategy let's say i want to sell the 11 put well theta is pretty good here i mean it's 0.02 which means that you're going to be making about two dollars per day which is not that at all it doesn't seem like a lot of money however if you do think about this this is an 11 strike so when you sell this put option two things are happening first of all you're obligated to buy the stock at 11 per share second of all think about it if you're selling at 11 per share and each option is worth 100 shares this is about a thousand dollar position i mean it's 1100 bucks you are collecting 41 so it's going to be less than 100 bucks now you're making two dollars a day so in a month you're making about 60 about 60 divided by 1 000 is going to be six percent per month i mean that's a lot just with a thousand dollars you can make an income of 60 per month or in a year you can make about 720 dollars which is not bad at all for just 1 000 so what i really like about pounds here is the implied volatility right here is 79 meaning implied volatility is really high i look for an implied volatility that is going to be around you know 40 or 45 or 50. that's a good volatility anything above that is a fantastic volatility and when you're selling options they're going to be expensive which is a good thing because when you're selling options you're collecting that income you're collecting that premium so when you're selling an 11 put option you're obligating yourself to buy pounds at 11 however the stock is currently trading for 11.65 so that is amazing because you're getting a lower price than the current price of 1165 you're actually getting paid 41 for it now this option is actually about two weeks out now if i were to go out one month for an option expiring let's say april 14th which is 30 days this premium is going to be even higher it's going to be dollars which again is about six percent it's actually going to be a little bit higher than six percent but i'm just gonna say six percent just to be conservative so a six percent return by selling the 11 dollar put option you can go out till april 14 or again you can go may or june the premium is going to be roughly the same whether you go out two four weeks or even longer than that you can see right here that the volume is very healthy it's 1377 with a very very large open interest this is a very good thing meaning that the options are very liquid there's a lot of volume there's a lot of volume here and there's a lot of open interest now you can also see that translate into the bid ask spread the bid here is 60 cents and the ask is 62 cents meaning that it's very tight the difference here is very small it's good to have a very small difference because that means that you're not losing much money when you're trading these options in fact this also means that you can basically go for weekly options if you so choose you can go for weekly options because you're not really losing much money here in the bid-ask spread now it's bad when the bid-ask spread is really big but here this is fantastic now let me discuss closing this position so when you're selling a put option you want to do it on a stock that you do not mind owning so for me i don't mind owning pounds here i would in fact love to own pallets here at 11 per share so when i'm selling a put option i don't even need to close this position because the worst thing that can happen is pounds your stock goes to 11 and i have to buy it for 11 i don't mind that so with this position i don't even have an exit plan because my exit plan is really my entry plan so either way i'm happy whether the stock goes down below 11 or stays above 11 because either way i get to collect this premium,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,LmRg8QC3Y3s,2022-03-18T14:30:07Z,3 Stock & Option Picks For Fast Money,Rivian,Next stock is rivien now riven is a stock that i have been bearish on you can see here that i made 950 and 870 on call credit spreads easily on rivian in the private discord the members and i took advantage of rivien many times betting that it would fall rivian asked for trouble when it recently increased prices of its evs dramatically setting inflationary pressures only to roll back part of that decision investors had very high hopes for rivien and i wanted to bet on the stock falling i'm going to show you another exact play that could end up printing money now the reason you will see my view continues to be bearish is prices of key raw materials for evs have shot up the extraordinary rise in the price of nickel has even forced ev leaders like tesla to increase prices of its model 3 and model y evs rivian is already buckling under the pressure of rising input costs and a shortage in the supply of key materials like semiconductor chips rivien had earlier revealed it produced 1015 and delivered 920 vehicles in 2021 against this production target of 1 200 units things didn't improve much through the first quarter here's what i think slow production could give those who pre-ordered rivien evs and are missed by the company's absurd price hike decision yet another reason to cancel their bookings as of march 8th rivien had received 83 000 pre-orders for the r1t and r1s also if you tally that with 71 000 pre-orders riven had already secured as of december 31 it does appear that the pacer pre-orders is slowing as well so let's look at my screen for how i would play rivian stock in options All right so let's discuss riven you can see right here that i have made 950 and seventy dollars i made both of these trades in the private discord now let's talk about rivian so rivien is a stock that i'm not that bullish on i think they have a lot of issues these two positions are basically going to expire tomorrow so in just one day so what i want to show you is i'm going to open up rivn in robin hood and i'm going to go to trade review options and i'm going to show you something called a call credit spread so a call credit spread does not require much premium i can go out for something like june 17 which is a significant time away i mean it's about four months out but that's totally fine because you're going to see that i'm going to be able to collect a lot of premium and the capital that i have to put up is not that much capital so check it out currently the stock is trading for forty dollars and fifty seven cents for it to go up to sixty dollars the stock would have to rise by about fifty percent just very unlikely from happening so what i'm going to do is i'm going to sell the 60 call option now selling this call option the next thing that i'm going to do is buy a call option above the 60 strike which is going to be the 65 strike now you will notice that my total credit is 79 if i scroll down right here you will see that i'm collecting 79 and i'm only risking 421 so the return on this trade is nearly 20 however there's a really high chance of this option or the spread to expire out of the money and for you just to collect the 79 that's because the rivian stock is very unlikely to go past 60 dollars per share by june 17. in fact if i expand this option you will see that the delta is 0.33 which means that you have about two out of three chance of this not happening and about one out of three chance of this happening however even if this does happen this delta is calculating for rivian to end at sixty dollars however if it ended at sixty dollars that still wouldn't really matter to you because as long as it doesn't go past about 65 you won't see your max loss as long as it stays below 60 you will see your maximum gain so i think this is a very intelligent position and i think it could work out really well i've done this many times in the private discord however i do want to say that because rivian is so cheap right now i mean i wouldn't call it cheap by valuation standpoint but the stock is cheap it's trading much less than it used to be there is a chance that it can go past 60 per share so i would be cautious with opening many of this position,1.0,-0.9

Invest with Henry,LmRg8QC3Y3s,2022-03-18T14:30:07Z,3 Stock & Option Picks For Fast Money,Coinbase,Next let's discuss coinbase one of the most exciting developments for coinbase is its nft platform although the company faces fierce competition from industry leaders like openc coinbase views the nft landscape as an opportunity bitcoin although bullish long term has not been performing well coinbase stock is down 36 year-to-date and it's hovering near its 52-week low there is little doubt that coinbase stock has been dragged down in the broader tech sell-off i have a mixed view on coinbase but i want to show you a strategy that makes money whether coinbase goes up or if coinbase goes down let's look at my screen All right the last stack that i want to talk about is coinbase so i do have a 250 gain here on coinbase stock now i want to show you a position that i think is really interesting but let me just quickly show you this is going to be called an iron condor so if i go to sell put option i'm going to go through this really fast because i do want you to watch a full video on it but if i go to sell put option and i go down to let's say 160 then i go buy a leg lower this is going to be the 157 dollar leg now if i go to sell call option and i sell a call option for 177 and a half and i buy the 180 you will see right here this is a short iron condor my total credit is a hundred and three dollars i am risking about 147 dollars but oh my goodness check it out this option is expiring in one day so in one day i can make a hundred dollars this is how you can make a hundred dollars per day you could do this over and over again even if you're watching this in the future say march or april or may you can just run this strategy every single day on coinbase because coinbase is pretty low however i don't see a fast recovery in the next day especially because the market is already up ten percent so trading iron condors is a fantastic strategy to make lots of income again your max loss is only 147 dollars but your max gain is 103 and this option expires in literally one day so this is a fantastic strategy for growing a small portfolio,1.0,0.2

Invest with Henry,KIP_r20uwGs,2022-03-14T20:10:02Z,Tesla Stock Split Next! Amazon And Alphabet Opportunity,Alphabet,everyone it's henry i just want to make you aware of an opportunity that can make you some money we have seen two popular fang stocks from the past few weeks announced stock splits first up was alphabet the parent company of internet search engine google and streaming platform youtube alphabet announced a 20 for one forward stock split that as of the closing bell on march 9th would bring its share price down to 133 that's great news for investors looking to sell covered calls puts or run the wheel strategy which i'll link for you in the description if you have 500 to invest and your online brokerage doesn't allow for fractional share investing you can't directly put your money to work in alphabet or amazon right now but after their respective splits take effect 500 would be enough to purchase a few shares of either company stock splits are also often indicative of a company that's performing very well think of it this way a publicly traded company's share price probably wouldn't be high enough to split if it wasn't executing well and out innovating its competition I think this is going to have a lasting impact on both amazon and alphabet where they are both going to see abnormally high returns over the next quarter or two that means there's an opportunity to make money over the next 90 to 180 days as a relative position to the market that also means leaps have become a lot cheaper on these names,1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,KIP_r20uwGs,2022-03-14T20:10:02Z,Tesla Stock Split Next! Amazon And Alphabet Opportunity,Amazon,this past week e-commerce giant amazon followed suit with a 20 for one forward stock split announcement of its own assuming it receives shareholder approval amazon's pricey share price will come down to around 135 but this will be amazon's very first stock split since september 1999. so based on this recent information i want to tell you the effect this will have on these two stocks over the next couple of months as an example amazon shares are set to fall from around twenty eight hundred dollars to one twentieth of their current share price to around 135 to 140 per share if you have 500 to invest and your online brokerage doesn't allow for fractional share investing you can't directly put your money to work in alphabet or amazon right now but after their respective splits take effect 500 would be enough to purchase a few shares of either company amazon wouldn't be over 2 800 if it weren't absolutely killing it in the e-commerce game I think this is going to have a lasting impact on both amazon and alphabet where they are both going to see abnormally high returns over the next quarter or two that means there's an opportunity to make money over the next 90 to 180 days as a relative position to the market that also means leaps have become a lot cheaper on these names,1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,KIP_r20uwGs,2022-03-14T20:10:02Z,Tesla Stock Split Next! Amazon And Alphabet Opportunity,Tesla,now with that being said i also want to discuss tesla and tesla stock for those of you who might not recall tesla was one of the first brand name stocks to see its valuation launch a lot higher after announcing a stock split tesla's five for one forward stock split announced in august 2020 saw the company shares trade higher by more than 60 and 20 days between the announcement and the enactment of the actual split one reason a stock split would make sense here is tesla's share price is more than double after the split and elon musk does not mind some financial engineering although some folks have the luxury of purchasing fractional shares other investors would be forced to save up 850 just to buy a single share of tesla tesla also has some of the most liquid options on the market however most people still cannot afford to do a covered call because it costs something like 85 000 to do so the company previously announced five for one stock split occurrence at shares sitting at around 1 374 that's well within sight given the range that tesla has been trading in this year however we have not seen the stock go past one thousand three hundred dollars it has been around eight hundred dollars to about twelve hundred dollars per share however over the next few quarters tesla is likely to have better than expected numbers is likely to continue to beat earnings and if deliveries are going well giga berlin giga austin are going to report some good news then i can see the stock moving higher i can in fact see the stock going up by about 50 which would bring the stock back to about 1200 to 1300 range which i believe can happen in the next quarter or two but stock splits are announced randomly when we least expect it and gains come very quickly it's likely that within the next quarter or two if earnings come in strong for tesla they may announce another stock split another reason for tesla to consider a stock split is that elon musk knows his audience even though institutional investors and insiders combined do hold more than 60 of the outstanding shares musk is well aware that tesla is a favorite holding of retail investors now the insane part is 60 are institutional shareholders however tesla has a massive market cap of almost 1 trillion hovering in that trillion dollar range so retail investors own a whole lot of shares in fact hundreds of billions of dollars worth of shares to keep them happy and buying tesla stock musk may be willing to encourage the company's board to approve another stock split which is a very big opportunity if you get into the stock before they make that type of announcement in the next 90 to 180 days but surely i believe that the stock is going to split over the year or two-year mark i can't predict the future but i do know that it is going to happen sooner or later given good results for tesla's earnings that's because the stock is going to go higher as earnings deliveries and revenue goes higher doing this would allow investors with less starting capital to take a position in tesla stock,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,i-xd8WDYv2A,2022-03-10T15:11:33Z,20X TINY Option Trading Strategies,Tesla,This trade is going to be on tesla stock the expiration date is going to be march 18th however if you're watching this in the future i'm just picking a date that's one or two weeks away. The first call option that i'm selling is going to be that peak it's going to be the peak of the christmas tree it's going to be the very top at which point i think tesla will end now tesla has been trading sideways i've also taken a look at the options and there's a lot of volume at the 850 strike in fact there's 7 211 contracts traded just the last trading day so 850 seems to be a very popular point now if i open up 855 you can see that the volume is not so high now this is just one thing that i look at but it is a very important factor and it's one of the reasons i determined that tesla has a high chance to be around 850 so what i'm going to do is i'm going to sell 850 call option. my recommendation is if tesla stock over the next few days let's say or whatever stock you're using this strategy on over the next few days let's say the stock continues to move sideways somewhere a little bit down somewhere a little bit up but over the next couple of days it ends up going a little bit closer to 850. what can happen is the stock can end up being around 850 before expiration let's just say three or four days before expiration on a tuesday the stock is somewhere around this range still what's going to happen is because there's a higher chance or there's a higher probability that this option will expire in this range somewhere that there is going to be a profit so the profit could be you know 600 700 you know it could be all the way up to 947 dollars so let's say that you're right here at about 600 or 599 dollars what you should do is you should take profit off of the table so you don't have to go for that full 20 or 30 x if you're doing this on a few different stocks you can just go for a 5 to 10 x and you can also close out the position days before expiration now that's also going to be beneficial because there's still going to be some time decay in the option there's still going to be some theta or some time value and because of that a few days before expiration even if the stock is say at 830 and it's not in your range what can actually end up happening is you will not lose the 53 you may only lose 10 or 20 dollars however investing 10 or 20 dollars to make 900 potential is obviously a crazy return like 30x or even higher than that so this is the first position that i would recommend you run on stocks that you believe are going to be in a certain range now for a christmas tree you can bet on the stock ending at any price that you wish the most important anchor is actually the option that you sell so let me just show you a little bit of variation here say that you think the stock is going to end at eight hundred and thirty dollars what you would do in this case scenario is you would sell the 830 dollar call option now you will see that your max profit actually happens at tesla's price of eight hundred thirty dollars now the stock is currently at eight forty three so with this strategy basically very similar to the christmas tree i just showed you however now you can bet on the stock falling just a little bit so now if the stock falls just a little bit you're actually making money so this is a slightly bearish strategy now and what i love about christmas tree is not only is it very profitable where you can 20 or 30 extra money but it's also very flexible you can pick so many different strike prices based on what your view of the stock is because of course i'm not a financial advisor and i don't know what's going to happen but if you have a strong sense of where a stock may end you do want to run this strategy right here.,1.0,0.3

Invest with Henry,i-xd8WDYv2A,2022-03-10T15:11:33Z,20X TINY Option Trading Strategies,Amazon,now the next strategy that i want to show you is going to be on amazon this strategy is going to be called the call credit spread now if you take a look right here i've actually currently made 612 dollars if i scroll down i just open this position on march 7th it's currently march 9th so it's only been two days i've already made 612 dollars or 81 on my money here on this position i've only really risked a few hundred dollars this is a very small position what this position is doing i'm going to go into a lot of detail here is i'm selling the 2900 call option and then i'm buying the 2910 call option now i did this to hedge my portfolio because i do have shares of amazon in another portfolio and for that i wanted to make sure that i'm hedging my risk i want to make sure that if the market continues to go down i can actually make money so this is an amazing strategy if there is volatility in the market and we're having a few red days this is going to be fantastic to take advantage of those red days where you can make hundreds of dollars like for me six hundred dollars in two days or 246 dollars in one day because the stock ended up going down let me show you what this is going to look like even if amazon stock goes up okay you're going to go to options you're going to be in expiration dates you know i'm going to go out until let's say march 18th i'm going to go for next week again if you're watching this in the future you pick any date that you wish i do love to open options that are one week or two weeks out that is because i do love selling options selling options is very profitable that's how i'm able to beat the market that's how my students are able to beat the market and when you're selling options it's good when theta is high when time decay is high when these options are decaying faster and that typically happens when an option only has a week or two until expiration so let me show you a trade right now on amazon it's going to be a very similar trade it's going to be a call credit spread what i'm looking for right now is i'm looking for a chance of profit that is attractive okay so for me a chance of profit of maybe 83 is very attractive that means 83 of the time i'm going to be successful on this trade chance of profit is 83 and the percentage change here is 0.41 which means that this option is decaying a lot i mean it just lost 41 percent of its value in one day the volume isn't super high but the implied volatility is decent i like to look for implied volatility that is at least 40 and for a stock like amazon to have this amount of implied volatility this is very good this is a very good sign that it is going to be a profitable candidate to sell options on whatever strategy that you're running but i'm doing the call credit spread here so i'm going to click sell this call option at 28.80 and to open up a call credit spread you sell one call option and then you protect yourself and open up a proper call credit spread by buying another option so i can go for the 28.85 if i want a 500 spread or if i want a 1 000 spread i can go up to 28.90 what i'm going to do is i'm just going to go up to 28.85 now that's because a 500 spread is going to be in the wheelbarrow for many small portfolios all you need is 500 bucks right here and in fact i'm going to tell you why you need less than 500 so the total credit is 98 here you're collecting 98 now this spread right here is 500 but because you're collecting 98 your max loss is only going to be 402 instead of 500 this trade right here actually if you take the max profit of ninety eight dollars divided by four hundred and two dollars it's basically a hundred divided by four hundred which is a twenty five percent return in just one week now obviously if you were just to do this in one month you're going to have a hundred percent return and in one year if you were able to do this every single week week in a week out successfully you would have at least a 12 x on your money and of course much higher than that because you're also compounding your portfolio every success that you have right your portfolio is becoming larger with every successful trade that brings in some additional capital again use these three strategies right here to your advantage to grow a small portfolio fast and two very important links in the description also do watch out for the scammers pretending to be me but i do read your comments see you back here very soon.,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,BWXa7Erm8Ys,2022-03-02T14:49:33Z,Top Stocks to Buy March 2022,Google,the third stock i have i want you to really listen to it's expensive but i'm recommending you do a poor man's covered call on it it's google or alphabet the poor man's covered call is a video i want you to watch that i'm going to link in the description it's perfect on google because that stock has a lot of upside but it's not cheap for the small portfolio investor i'm going to show you an example very shortly alphabet is down about 13 from its recent all-time highs in spite of a blowout recent earnings report in the fourth quarter alphabet's revenue surged 32 accelerating over the 23 growth seen in the fourth quarter of 2020. not only that but looking under the hood the drivers of that outperformance could very well last into 2022 and beyond what really stuck out in the recent report was that the core google search engine alphabet's largest business and cash cow is accelerating despite its massive size up 35.7 last quarter that's remarkable for a business of that size which brought in 43.3 billion in revenue just last quarter alone in fact it's faster than search was growing before the pandemic when combining search youtube google ad networks and other google services and hardware alphabets google services bought in 26 billion in operating income last quarter for a business that grew revenue and profits in the mid 30 range this year the price to earnings multiple looks really cheap with the stock trading at cheap valuations just based on the core search and other ad services alone investors are also getting one of the three major cloud infrastructure companies essentially for free last quarter the google cloud platform saw revenue growth 45 to 5.5 billion dollars and 19.2 billion dollars for the full year alphabet also repurchased over 50 billion dollars worth of stock last year up 62 from the prior year and that accounts for about three percent of its total market cap indicating it is getting more serious about shareholder returns with that being said let's jump into my screen and look at a quick poor man's covered call on google alright so currently the stock is trading for just under two thousand seven hundred dollars i'm going to go to trade google options now what i'm going to do to establish this poor man's covered call is i'm going to go to the expiration date a poor man's cover call requires you to buy one leap option and then sell covered call options on that leap option acting as shares but instead of paying the price of buying 100 shares which would be 270 thousand dollars you can do it way cheaper so let's go out to march 17 2023 now i'm going to buy an in the money call option this is not going to be cheap however it's going to be way cheaper than buying the stock out right and also you can use this strategy on other stocks if you wish now what i'm going to do is i'm going to look at the 2200 strike right here it has a 0.76 delta a poor man's covered call should ideally have you know roughly 0.75 delta all the way up to 0.95 delta i'm cool with the delta being a little bit lower closer to that 0.75 range so 0.76 is perfect and the implied volatility is pretty good right here at 36 it's not super high which means that you're not gonna be paying too much money in terms of premium on buying this leap call option now i'm going to buy this leaf call option right here maximum loss is 66 000 which is a lot of money however it's way better than 270 000 and again you can run this strategy on stocks like pounds here which i talk about on my channel and i'm going to do a video on pretty soon so i'm going to go to sell call option now i'm going to sell a call option that is closer to expiration say march 18th which is just 18 days away now you will see right here that if i sell a covered call right here at the 2700 strike it's worth 77 so right here i'm collecting 77 which is over 10 of what i'm paying so instead of 66 000 i'm literally collecting thousand dollars which is over ten percent in three weeks if you want to learn more about the poor man's covert call and running it on stocks that are way cheaper check out this video right here on the poor man's cover call on how i make two thousand dollars a month running it,1.0,0.85

Invest with Henry,ZkdOVsWbxz8,2022-02-24T15:50:57Z,3 Small Account Option Trading Strategies,Snowflake,let's jump into the first stock the first stock that i have is snowflake now you will see right here that i have made 62 on this option position i bet a thousand dollars and i so far have a total return of 107 now this option has decayed 62 so i have about 40 percent more for a dk or about 63 more dollars now 63 more dollars is going to be a total premium of 170 and that is going to be over 20 on this position now the first position that i want to discuss is going to be called a call credit spread so i have a call credit spread right now on snowflake i'm going to show you why i decided to open up this position on snowflake i want to show you the technical chart a few different indicators that i use are the moving average and the bollinger band so when i opened up this position snowflake was trading for around 300 now i saw this double peak right here i had a feeling that this stock was going to continue pulling down now this happened in the past week and that's the reason i didn't close this position although i was up significantly on it because when i actually opened up the position i opened it up in january now the stock continued to decline i continued to profit and although i didn't exit the position which i should have here it went up i still didn't lose any money and then it has now come down so the strike prices that i actually picked are 345 and 355. so if you notice right here when i ended up selling this it actually didn't matter to me that the stock was moving back up towards 300 per share because my strike prices are so far from the money so for snowflake i sold 345 and 355 and that's basically because the bollinger band top this little indicator right here was basically showing me this stock was not likely to move past 350. now i did this analysis back in january so it was a little bit different and also if i go to bolinger band and i take off the standard deviation to five it should not be five that was just me looking at an earnings event if i actually put it to two you will see right here that back in january the high was around 350. so that's why i sold 350. i like the bollinger band do all the action for me this is literally one of my very favorite indicators and whenever i click the bollinger band i always do a period of 20 days and the standard deviation is typically two however if the stock has earnings i will typically go to three four or if the stock is very very crazy i will do five something like tesla right before earnings i may do five to pick some my entry and exit points however picking two is standard practice for me so i made a lot of money on selling call credit spreads on snowflake and let me show you what that looks like right now if i were to open up a new position now to enter this position i'm going to first talk about how to enter it and then i'm going to mention how i would exit this position because as everyone knows and so many of my students ask me how do i get rid of a position when should i take profit when should i actually get out you know if i'm at a loss do i close this position well those are all very important questions but first of all let's talk about entering into this position so snowflake is currently sitting at 255 dollars the top of the bollinger band is saying 318 so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to snowflake options which i'm at right now and the first strategy that i'm discussing is a call credit spread you're going to see exactly what it looks like and why i am opening it so first of all real simple a call credit spread is selling one call option for example i may look to sell the 265 let me again check the top of the bollinger band it's 318. so i'm going to pick an expiration date first sorry about that strike goes next the first important thing is expiration date i'm going to go for march 18th now you can go for weekly options you can also go for options every two weeks but lately i have really enjoyed selling options that are one month out that one month gives me a lot of flexibility to not have to open positions so often and also one month premium is pretty good however you know obviously one week premium can be better however it's a lot more work and i have so many things that i'm doing so going one month out march 18th is perfect for me i'm gonna collect a lot of premium right here i'm gonna show you how you can make so much money doing this top of the bollinger band was about three hundred dollars so i'm gonna scroll up i'm gonna go to three hundred dollars now this is an out of the money option if i sell this it's a short call position now you won't be able to just sell a short call position the reason is because if you sell a short call you're exposing yourself to unlimited risk now that's not a good thing because well unlimited risk is very dangerous so instead what i'm going to do is you know this total credit right here will go down however i won't have this unlimited risk here okay my max loss will not be unlimited to create a proper call credit spread what i'm going to do now is i sold the 300 strike price that is a strike price that i believe snowflake will not reach i believe this stock is in bearish territory now i'm going to buy a call option i'm going to go ahead and buy the 305 dollar call option so i'm going to purchase this now what happens is this actually closes off my risk so my max loss is only 385 dollars rather than being unlimited because i'm buying this 305 call option it's actually protecting me so if snowflake goes to a thousand dollars that's totally fine this 300 call option doesn't give me unlimited risk because i'm buying this 305 dollar call option to protect myself now if you'll notice my max profit is 110 my max loss is 390 now some people might say hey your max profit's pretty low your max loss is pretty high why would you do this well i kind of gave this example to one of my students before so the reason for this is because most of the time you're going to end up having this profit even if you come out with this profit say 10 times then you're going to collect a thousand dollars and then if you lose one time out of 10 then you're going to lose 405 so in that case you win nine times nine times a hundred is nine hundred dollars then you lose four hundred dollars once well the difference is actually five hundred dollars so you're still doubling your money you're making five hundred dollars and if you do this in a given year then you're going to make a little bit more than 100 on your money or a little bit more than doubling your money within that year or in other words 10 a month is pretty achievable and in this scenario right here you're actually going to be collecting 25 so this is actually a 25 return in one month now i'm actually going to place this trade but before i place this trade i want to talk about the second strategy because what's going to happen is the second strategy is a little bit different from the first one but the third strategy actually combines the first and the second strategy so for a second right now i'm going to teach you something called the put credit spread the put credit spread is a very similar strategy to the call credit spread now the only difference is instead of selling one call option and buying another call option a put credit spread means that you're going to be selling one put option and then buying another put option here we will go back to doing some technical analysis you'll notice here that snowflake is falling down the top of the bollinger band is 318 dollars however the bottom of the bollinger band looks like it's 240 dollars i'm going to look a little bit closer and yes confirmed it is 240 and 21 cents now snowflake is going down i don't know what's going to happen next it's in a little bit of a bearish trend right here but i expect it to be a pretty good value at 240 dollars however let's say that you're bearish or let's just say that you want to play it extra safe what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back to bollinger band and this is when i would increase the steering deviation so increasing the standard deviation from two to three will now increase the bollinger band so you'll notice right now that if i go to maybe five days it says 251 if i go to three months it says being blocked which is a pain in the rear end let's go to six months still being blocked it is probably right around 200 200 and finally i can see it 220. so to be extra safe you can go down to 220. so now let me show you how this works i'm going to scroll down i'm going to use the same expiration date this is really important make sure you're taking notes expiration date has to be the same for the second position for the third position to work okay so the expiration date will still be march 18th and of course i'm just showing you how to make money you can do this on a different stock you can pick any stock that you wish and if you're watching this in the future then you can just pick a different expiration date for the future whenever you're watching this so if you're watching this in october you can absolutely pick december or november so again scrolling down i want to pick the 240 strike the reason why i'm picking 240 is because again here on the bollinger band i determined that it's 220 which means that i just caught myself it's not 240 i need to go down to 220 right here 220 and that's because the bottom of the bollinger band is 220 and 43 cents so that is a safe point that is where the stock would be at a significant discount that's also statistically speaking where the bollinger band says that the stock is not likely to trade okay so back to 220 i'm going to sell this put option okay let me just expand this real quick and show you what i'm looking at cloud volatility is very high so i'm very glad that i'm trading snowflake the higher the volatility the better for selling strategies that's what i'm always doing in my discord community i'm always looking for consistent income so someone even with a five thousand dollar portfolio can start making 500 dollars per month now i do chase this implied volatility but i also want to make sure that the volume is healthy 56 volume is not that high however it's also not that low 56 is fine the delta is 0.24 which means that this out of the money option only has a 24 chance of actually occurring which means that three-fourths of the time you're going to end up winning on selling this put option also taking a look at theta data is pretty high it's 0.43 which means that you're going to be making about 43 per day when you sell this option but what's really important is that we're not actually gonna just sell this option alone what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to create a spread so i have sold a put option now what i need to do to protect myself and to make this a small account trade because if you just sell a 220 dollar put option that requires 22 000 but this video is for small accounts it's for someone that might have 5 000 or less so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to buy a put option i'm going to protect this 220 dollar put option with a 215 put option that way i am not required to put up all the capital or all the collateral for 22 instead i'm only going to have to put up about 500 because the difference between 220 and 215 is 500 so let me go ahead and buy this 215 put option now you will see that this chart looks very different and in fact this chart now looks very exciting let me explain to you what is going on so first of all i have sold a put option at 220 and i bought one at 215. now the total credit has actually gone up it has increased it has gone higher because i have sold both the puts and the calls i'm now selling puts and calls and i'm just betting on volatility what that means is if the stock stays within this range i'm going to end up making a really big profit from 220 all the way up to 300 this 80 space right here which is a lot right it's a huge space and the current stock is sitting at 253 and 71 cents as long as the stock stays within the space i'm actually going to make 250 and i'm only betting 250 so i'm actually going to make a 50 return right here in one month so before i said i was going to make 10 a month now i'm showing you a 50 a month strategy which i'm going way above and beyond of what i said okay so 250 is what you're going to collect your max loss is 250. now the stock has to stay within this range and i believe the stock is very likely to stay within this range so i'm actually going to end up placing this trade which i typically don't do because the market is closed but today the market's open so i'm going to place this trade i'm going to show you that this is the type of trade that i would make now third strategy actually i don't really need to show you the third strategy because the third strategy is called an iron condor now an iron condor is a combination of call credit spreads which i just showed you and put credit spreads which i just showed you so i'm going to click continue i'm going to open one of these bad boys up going to put one contract here now you will notice that the bid asks spread is pretty wide that's not good and the reason why it's so wide and one of the weaknesses of an iron condor is because you're playing with four different options right you're playing with a call another call a foot and another put you have four legs it's called legs you have four different legs now all of them have different bid ask spreads and that is the reason why this is so wide it's really wide 140 and 350. typically that's not good however the profit on this trade is very nice i'm gonna put in 245 here i'm gonna review this i'm gonna submit it and see if i get filled now if i do not get filled i will go a little bit lower i will go down to 240 worth of collateral now you do have to do this with iron condors the reason again is because you're dealing with so many different legs and when you're dealing with different legs it gets a little bit more difficult to fill your position so i'm going to try to fill this at 240 i'm going to give it a second if that does not work i will have to play with this trade and i will go down to you know potentially 225 dollars i'm going to put 2.3 right now see if this gets filled and at a certain point if you don't want to go any lower then you do not have to go any lower okay so i'm not getting filled on this position right now like i said i will go as low as 225 dollars but if i don't get put at 225 what you can do is you can just find a stock that is more liquid so something like apple you'll have a much greater chance and i just got filled for 227,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,vLdacp05Nwk,2022-02-21T23:02:45Z,Cheap Palantir Options After The HUGE Pullback,Palantir,pounds here q4 had amazing results but the stock tanked anyway i'm going to explain why and what to do next q4 financials on the earnings call numbers are impressive and yet the stock tanked and that's because palantir reported adjusted quarterly profit of two cents per share that compared to a consensus estimate of four cents but you know let's ignore that the company went from 750 million to 1.5 billion in the past two years i'm being sarcastic because the market doesn't understand pounds here just like they didn't understand tesla for my subscribers that are long-term investors i find this situation a buying opportunity but on the company's earnings call ceo alex carp pointed to 2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents that palantir has on its balance sheet plus no debt as an example of how it is built for bad times not only does it have plenty of cash on its books but the company also generated 333.9 million in cash from its day-to-day operating activities over the past 12 months that's why i literally don't care what earnings calls are for pounds here because at this stage it's only about the top line and having enough cash to survive the bad times you have to go back to about november 2020 for the last time that palutear stock was trading much lower than where it is today and since then the business has grown acquired more customers and furthered its position in in the analytics mega trend the company reaffirmed its annual revenue growth target of at least 30 until 2025 today this suggests that things are still going according to plan for the business i also believe pltr stock pulled back because of the general market friday the entire stock market took a beating and i mean everything was read to me this also looks like the macro economic environment dragging down quality companies i say palantir is a quality company in fact in the software slash tech sector i think that palantir is more like a waste management type of company it's essentially an essential service rather than a high-flyer stock like the unicorns with no cash flow at all palantir is a long-term investment that will likely beat inflation also for the last three days arc sold 18 million shares of pound to your stock all right let's take a look at palantir stock currently it's sitting at 10 and 92 cents and i mean this stock is down 49.44 over the last three months and in the past year it's down almost 60 percent yikes i mean this stock was trading at 26 in fact 27 last year now the stock is sitting at a 52 week low at 10 and 92 cents i'm going to click pound to your options i'm going to show you a few different strategies that i would be running today the first and most simplest and this is really good because palantir is only 10.92 cents which is a covered call because a covered call requires you to buy 100 shares this is actually not that expensive because if you buy 100 shares of pounds here at 1092 that's a thousand ninety two dollars should balance your clothes above 11 by february 25th however because palantir has sold off so much it could bounce back up and you could see a profit now let's say that you're really on pallenter which i am if i'm looking at pounds here i think it's already really cheap say you're like hey counter is a good stock but i do not want to buy it for 10 bucks i want to buy it for like you know seven dollars fine sell the seven dollar put or let's say you're really bearish you're like hey i'm only buying pounds here what it's 50 off i like that walmart deals okay i want 50 off so if you want 50 off of 11 i mean that's roughly 5.50 so you can pick the five dollar strike or the six dollar strike to get exactly what you want so what i would do is i would sell the nine dollar put the nine dollar put is going for 75 cents 75 divided by 900 because you're only committing 900 here is an 8.3 return i already know that however because you're also collecting 75 you don't have to put up 900 you're only putting up 900 minus 75 so this is an 825 dollar trade and you're collecting nine percent in three months.,1.0,0.65

Invest with Henry,S6vOlf6EFgU,2022-02-17T15:11:15Z,"3 Option Picks to 4X Fast (SHOP,  PLTR, FB)",Shopify,shopify just reported earnings and they're down 17. specifically what i want to look at first is shopify. shopify is down 17. they had earnings and the reason why they're down is most likely because they had bad earnings. now this is a really good opportunity to use options. so let's go to good old shopify. shopify down about 17. now this stock was trading at over a thousand dollars not too long ago literally in the beginning of the year it was over a thousand dollars and then you can see right here that it's been trending right around 850. um we've had some decent support here at 800 however we've broken down below support because well because earnings weren't so good and if i scroll down here you can see here that they missed earnings. earnings were estimated to be 58 but shopify came in at 136. now i'm just looking at this as a technical trade because this stock is down i see a lot of opportunity in selling a put credit spread. so let's open up trade shopify options and i'm going to take a look at a few specific strike prices and i'm going to tell you why i'm picking these strike prices as well. so first of all a put credit spread is just betting that a stock will not fall further and because shopify is already down so low i mean it's certainly down way below its moving average it's definitely below its bollinger band and this stock is actually at a 52-week low so i can expect the stock to maybe recover once they get in some good traction some good momentum again in the next quarter they may recover back up to a thousand dollars per share but for now you know looking at this stock it looks majorly sold off. step number one sell put option. so i'm gonna go to march 18th this is a one month option. now because shopify is already at a 52 week low you can technically just sell you know 730 725 area for the strike price however as you'll notice here the premium is massive it's really really huge so i'm actually going to be a lot safer even though this stock is at a 52-week low this doesn't mean that you want to be risky you still have to keep in mind that when you open up a position you want to have proper risk management you don't want to just go into a position that has a high chance of losing so i want to make sure that my chance of profit is still above 70 so 75 is pretty good that means you know three-fourths of the time i'm gonna be winning here. now taking a look this is the 650 strike price if i expand this option you will see that the bid ask spread is a little bit wide which isn't ideal however the implied volatility is very good even after earnings which is you know pretty rare because if you will notice after earnings there's something called an iv crush there's a lot of implied volatility expected before a stock reports earnings however after it reports earnings usually the implied volatility will dramatically go down which is called an iv crush and that's because the catalyst or the event that option traders and the market was expecting has already happened so there's not much more that can happen however with shopify you'll see that the implied volatility is still really big so this is something that you know is going to be a good or attractive option to trade because well you guys already know i prefer selling options i go for weekly income or monthly income i'm going for income strategies and the higher the implied volatility the more money you will collect off of selling options the delta right here 24 this is good so i'm gonna open up a sell put option right here at the 650 strike price. now to open up a proper put credit spread because you know this will cost a lot of money right here i'm going to protect myself and buy a put option i'm gonna go one leg lower at 6 45 and click this button right here now you will notice that the total credit is a dollar 40. so i'm going to click 140 now my risk taken here is 500 however and the reason why it's 500 by the way is because 650 minus 645 is 500. however because i'm collecting 140 my true max loss is only 360. so my actual return here is really high it's over 30 percent so this is a very attractive put credit spread to open because you're collecting 140 which as a percentage is right around 30 it might even be 33 which is a fantastic return in one month obviously if you just do this for three months in a row you can have a hundred percent return all right now the next thing i want to show you is going to be a call debit spread. for this strategy you are going to be bullish so say that shopify has pulled back significantly and i just showed you the first strategy is selling put credit spreads but now let's say that you're bullish immediately like you're bullsh right now you believe that shopify is going to rise you know for sure up to like 800 maybe to ten so what you will want to do in this scenario is you're going to want to buy a call option. now you don't want to just buy a call option because it's going to be extremely expensive so if i go down and purchase the 750 this is going to cost a total of seven hundred and eighty five dollars super expensive and not many people should or want to spend that amount of money on just one call option especially if you have a smaller portfolio because five thousand dollars is basically going to be a very huge chunk of a small portfolio so instead you know because so many people have small portfolios and they're looking to aggressively grow them instead a bull call spread is going to be way better for a small portfolio looking to 2x or 3x their money so check this out you want to do sell call option now you can go up one leg up or in fact i can go up two leg ups because it's going to be very simple very easy math because this is a thousand dollar bull call spread now if i go sell this now you will notice that the total cost is 250 and the total reward is 7.50 now in fact you can turn 250 into 1 000 because the total gain here is 1 000 however you're only putting up 250. so 250 dollars can turn into 1 000 in one month so you can 4x your money if shopify goes up to 760 and there's a 72 chance of this occurring it's not even that far out of the money currently the stock is trading for about 729 now if the stock just moves up 30 bucks it's going to be at 760 and you're going to be able to for extra money all right so this is called a bull call spread now if you'll notice here you're going to lose on this trade if shopify stays below your break-even price of 752.85 now the reason why it's 752.85 in that 750 is because you're spending 285 dollars roughly to open up this position that's why your break even is 750 you know the first strike right here plus the premium that you pay so this is a fantastic strategy for any small portfolio looking to have aggressive growth obviously a 4x return now it's currently less than a 4x return now it's pretty much a 5x return you know it does vary that is because of the bid ask spread. so i'm going to get this video out as soon as possible for you guys you know to take action if you want to or of course just take these strategies and use it on something else.,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,S6vOlf6EFgU,2022-02-17T15:11:15Z,"3 Option Picks to 4X Fast (SHOP,  PLTR, FB)",Facebook,i also want to look at facebook. i'm going to open up facebook first. so facebook or meta platforms which they changed their name to this stock has become really cheap and in fact this stock has made really no sense because over the past year it's sold off so heavily that it's again at a 52-week low just like shopify. so basically a similar strategy will be very good on facebook. i'm going to show you a put credit spread. now i'm also going to pick which strikes to do this put credit spread on that is pretty much the most important thing because you want to pick the correct strikes far too many students make mistakes by selling a put credit spread and going way too close to the money that is a big error. i'm gonna go one week out i'm gonna make this a little bit different than shopify i'm gonna show you what a one week option is going to look like or a one week put credit spread so we're gonna go sell put. now i'm gonna go down i'm gonna go down to where my chance of profit is going to be much higher so right here if you'll notice the chance of profit is 83 and facebook is going to have a strike price of 200 here the break even is actually 198. so this is significantly cheap i mean facebook was a 350 stock under 300 i liked it under 200 i mean get out of here just way too cheap so this is going to be a very good bet sell put option at the 200 strike price. now i'm going to click buy for the small portfolios by the way you can buy the 197 and a half that means you're going to put up about 250 worth of risk on the table however if you have a little bit bigger portfolio say 5 000 then you know there's no worries with opening up a 195 strike because it's still not going to be that much money in comparison to your portfolio i mean you're going to be risking 440 dollars right here which you know it's still less than 10 of a 5 000 portfolio. now the total credit here is about 59 so you know 10 of you know 500 bucks is 50. so this is actually over a 10 return in one week so you know if you can collect 10 return in one week that's 40 a month which is going to be astronomically high on a yearly basis. now obviously you can't win 100 of trades some of these trades will go against you but the whole name of the game is to put the odds in your favor is to make sure that you have the highest chance of success possible so this put credit spread right here i'm looking at 200 put and then 195 put for a total credit spread of 60 roughly 60 in total credit so this is something that i would be looking to open for next week well currently but this would expire for next week. now i do also want to show you a call a debit spread on facebook this is going to be another strategy that i'm looking at because you know technically facebook can have a huge recovery short term especially because the market continues to sell off but you know we will see a recovery at some point even in the most bearish market out there you're still going to see many short-term bounces. so going out to february 25th which is just one week away just slightly over one week i'm going to look to buy an at the money call option a 215. now again this is not that expensive but still it's 610 but instead of paying 610 dollars to open up a call debit spread or a bull call spread they're both the same thing we're going to go ahead and sell the 220 call option right here now the total cost is only 230 and the opportunity for gain is about 500 bucks 220 minus 215 500 bucks so this is over a 2x return so you can 2x your money in one week on facebook bull call spreads.,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,S6vOlf6EFgU,2022-02-17T15:11:15Z,"3 Option Picks to 4X Fast (SHOP,  PLTR, FB)",Palantir,what i really want to look at is probably going to be palantir. the last thing that i do want to look at is going to be palantir. palantir has gone to some really cheap levels for palantir because the stock is so cheap you know i wouldn't necessarily do a bull call spread i might not also want to do put credit spreads instead what i might want to do is i might just want to go and sell some put options. now the reason to sell some put options is because well because palantir is really cheap. if you look at the 13 strike they do have earnings so the 13 strike it has crazy premium i mean 68 this is insane. now i wouldn't do poke ride spread because they are a little bit more risky especially when a stock has earnings and because palantir has some earnings coming up i would go down and maybe sell the 12 dollar put option collect 37 which is going to be 3 in 2 days or even you can go out to february 25th you can sell the 12 put option and this is going to have 48 which is a 4 return so there's a lot of passive income to be made with selling put options.,1.0,0.6

Invest with Henry,nZkU7XjwQVE,2022-02-14T18:14:34Z,20X Your Money With These Cheap Option Trading Strategies,Tesla,this strategy is really betting that tesla is going to continue trading sideways We know tesla was a 1200 stock and 1100 stock it's had a whole lot of volatility but right now i can see the stock staying in a certain position I think it's going to continue consolidating and going sideways until we see some big news occur so of course you don't have to use tesla i'm just showing you an example i'm not a financial advisor and i completely don't know which stock is going to do what so just make sure you're going to use the strategy more or less on a stock that you think is going to stand still so i think tesla's going to stand still so i'm going to sell the 860 call option now what i want to do is i'm going to buy a call option i'm going to do two different call options you're going to see later right here i'm going to simply customize and well you'll see so buy call option i'm going to buy the 830 call option okay you can go for 850 you can go for 840. i'm deciding to go for 830 and this is going to be some easy math as you will see on this profit loss chart right here in just a second so i'm buying the 830 now i'm going to scroll up and buy the 890. so now that i have sold 860 about 830 and 890 there's only one problem the problem is i'm paying a whole lot of money and what i want to actually do is i want to have two cells and two buys for each selling call option i also want to have a contrasting order for a buy call option so i'm going to go right here instead of a normal ratio instead of a one to one ratio i'm actually going to set a custom unique ratio and i want to make sure that the ratio of buys and sells is the same therefore i'm going to put two for the cells now you will see that the total cost has gone down significantly in fact it's only 238 dollars now if i scroll down here the max loss is 238 dollars but the max profit is 2 762 so right here you can more than 10x your money now what i want to explain to you and the reason why i picked 830 and 890 is because i believe tesla will stay between 8 30 and 8 90. i could have went a lot shorter and in fact the return could be even higher if you go shorter but i want a good mix i want a good balance of risk and return so i picked 830 and 890 because this is 30 one way up or one way down so the break even here is 8.32 as long as tesla stays above 832 you're going to see some profit depending on where tesla ends you can see right here the expected profit will vary between maybe zero dollars at eight thirty two thirty eight all the way up to the peak which is two thousand seven hundred sixty two dollars now i will say this specific strategy means that tesla has to stay or basically be right around eight hundred sixty dollars however i am also betting that tesla will be around these areas and even right around here as you can see right at the bottom of the end around 836 dollars you're still doubling your money the expected profit here is like 387 dollars and obviously it continues to move higher as you get to the middle or the peak profit points of two thousand seven hundred and sixty two dollars now on the opposite side you also will be making profits as long as tesla stays below eight hundred eighty seven dollars in 62 cents now your only loss points are right here if tesla really decides to fall a lot or if the stock shoots up again this strategy is best for a stock that is going to basically trend sideways,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,nZkU7XjwQVE,2022-02-14T18:14:34Z,20X Your Money With These Cheap Option Trading Strategies,Palantir,now for the second strategy that i want to show you i'm actually going to be picking palantir stock and i want to go over some technical analysis so specifically palantir stock has been trending lower over the past month This stock was a very expensive stock around over 20 and even 30 dollars per share in the past six months and one year however in the past month we've seen a steady decline day over day every single day with this stock just going to rock bottom around 12 and 28 cents however what has happened since january 27th is this stock is now consolidating so i see an opportunity here because well palantir went up then it went down then it went up and now it's going down so i can see it staying range bound in this area between 12 and a half dollars and maybe 13 and a half dollars I think right around this point over the next few days next few weeks this stock is not going to have a whole lot of action unless we see some really good quarterly earnings again i'm just picking a short term play if you're watching this in the future make sure that you find a stock that is having a similar behavior and use this strategy which i'm about to show you so let me show you what i'm going to do so i'm going to go to sell put option okay i'm going to sell and at the money puts a 13 put this is at the money put because the current stock price is 13.9 cents so i'm going to sell the 13 put now i'm going to do something pretty similar to what i did with tesla except here we're using put options but now i'm going to buy a put option so i've soldered 13 now i'm going to buy the 14 and i'm also going to go one lower and buy the 12. but again the only issue here is there's two buys in one cell so the total cost is somewhat expensive i mean it's not that expensive compared to tesla but i want to show you how to get this cost lower so i'm going to go here going to click custom set a unique ratio and again for each buy order i want to have an equivalent sell order so i'm going to put in two cells right here and now you'll notice that the total cost has gone down to thirteen dollars pretty bare bones nothing okay now the thirteen dollars or actually fourteen dollars can be turned into eighty six dollars so this is a super cheap strategy for a small portfolio looking to learn more advanced option strategies or even simple option strategies you can play around with different stocks i'm using pounds here but again obviously i don't have the answers to what stock is going to do what maybe warren buffett does i certainly don't so i would encourage you to play around with a few different stocks obviously my recommendation is to go for cheaper stocks maybe like pounds here,1.0,0.6

Invest with Henry,nZkU7XjwQVE,2022-02-14T18:14:34Z,20X Your Money With These Cheap Option Trading Strategies,Boeing,all right so the last and third final strategy that i want to show you is going to be on boeing boeing is really interesting boeing has a very consistent pattern So when i go to three months boeing has been traded as high as 233 dollars and obviously it's gone down as low as 189 dollars but check this out the stock was trading for 233 dollars then we had a dramatic fall lower than a quick rise and it took some you know some decent volume you can see right here that there were a lot of people buying in it reached 211 and then it fell again so it's zigzagging this is a very clear pattern the v-shape recovery but then couldn't sustain the momentum went back down and then now we see a w pattern basically right here w and then boom long w long momentum higher and then again it went down and for the fourth or fifth time it's up so this is a very clear pattern for me that you know investors are not really sure on boeing stock boeing stock does not have a whole lot of news or momentum in it although it does look like it's bouncing up and down a lot i think this is actually the perfect stock to run an iron condor strategy so i'm going to show you how to profit off of this stock even though it has a lot of volatility selling both sides selling the puts and the calls and making money on both sides as long as boeing stays range bound within this area now again a quick primer right here this yellow area is actually called a bollinger band okay so the bollinger band right here if you check it out i put 20 day period i put two standard deviations now this bollinger band is telling me where boeing stock is likely to trade within now two standard deviations captures about 95 of the time of where the stock should be trading at given statistics okay we don't have to get too technical here but basically 95 of the time boeing is going to stay within this range right here now you can also see the moving average and the bollinger band are both right around 200 so i'm going to be looking to make a play on boeing for around 205 210 dollars where the current stock price is in bet that we're not going to see it rise beyond maybe 228 and the bottom of the bollinger band which is about 190 now let me show you what this is going to look like so i have boeing right here open i'm going to go for february 18th which is about five days this is a very short-term strategy so i promised i would teach you guys a little bit of everything in this video so i want to give you a short-term trade but of course this is only a few days out so if you're watching this in the future what you can do if it's say february 18th you can go for march 4th if you're in march you can go for march 18th if you are in june obviously in june there will be more options but right now you're only seeing monthly options again i'm gonna go back to february 18th that's fine with me and february 18th in fact what i'm going to do is because the bollinger band right here was taking into account 20 periods i'm actually going to change it to five periods and now when i change it to five periods you will see that the range has considerably tightened up now the bottom of the bollinger band is about 209 and the top is 220. but what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to be a little bit safer so although this is pretty safe as is i'm going to change standard deviation from two to three now instead of 95 this is capturing 99 so this is a very safe trade to now run the iron condor strategy so to begin this strategy i'm going to sell put option now the bottom of the bollinger band was about 206 so i will go down to about 205 so i'm going to sell 205. now to open up a proper iron condor when you sell a put option you want to protect yourself and buy a put option as well and you want to go one leg lower so we're going to go from 205 to 202 and a half now you will see that i've opened up a put credit spread and i'm collecting a total credit of 56. so i'm collecting 56 and i'm risking 194. however remember that i mentioned the bottom of the bollinger band is 205 so this is a very safe trade over the next five days but it gets better in fact it gets a lot better and it feels almost like a cheat code because when you open up an iron condor because when you open up an iron condor i've opened up a poke card spread and i'm collecting 56 worth of premium but now i'm going to open up a call credit spread and in fact the beauty of this and why i think it's a cheat code is that i'm going to be collecting more premium i'm going to collect some more money however my max loss is going to go lower and that's because only one side of the iron condor can happen either the put can happen or the call can happen the stock cannot end both lower than the puts and higher than the calls and for that reason your broker is not going to charge you more collateral for opening up this second leg of the call side of the iron condor in fact your max profit will go up and your max loss will go down so again let's take a look at the top of the bollinger band it's about 222 dollars so i'm gonna go right around 220 dollars i think that's a safe point so i'm going to sell the 220 call option and now to protect myself i'm going to buy the 222.5 call option so purchase that right here and now you'll notice that my max profit has gone up significantly in fact by about 50 it was about 56 now it's 117 and my max loss has gone down now this position right here i'm essentially able to take a 50 premium and collect 50 on the collateral that i'm risking so as long as boeing stays between about 205 dollars and 220 dollars you will see the full profit now within this range dollars and 83 cents up to 205 dollars you're gonna be making a varied amount of money depending on where boeing ends and of course if it falls below 203.83 you can see a loss you can see a loss of hundred and thirty three dollars now for you to see that loss boeing really has to go beyond these ranges three standard deviations and show a really big fall or a really big rise for you to lose any money now i believe 95 or even 97 of the time you're going to be within this range right here and you're going to collect a lot of money sometimes you will lose 100 of your premium however in my experience i've been doing this for nine years i've collected way more premium than i have lost given any particular loss,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,K7qOmgl__Ik,2022-02-11T14:11:02Z,HUGE Palantir PLTR Price Prediction,Palantir,greetings true believers welcome back to the channel we have to talk about pounds here because the stock has slid to some ridiculously cheap levels the ceo went to my high school so if anyone can predict this stock it's gonna be me just kidding joking i'm only bringing in the facts for this video if you appreciate me jumping straight into the video you can gently and kindly smash that like button it's free and it helps out the youtube algorithm so more people understand why i believe pounds here is undervalued palantir has been public for over one year twelve months ago the stock was over thirty dollars per share the business isn't profitable yet posting a 512 million dollar net loss over the trailing 12 months however this is primarily due to large share based compensation packages paid to attract and retain employees the business itself is generating positive free cash flow with 320 million reported for the first three quarters of 2021. that's a massive year-over-year change from negative 285 million in the prior year period palantir sales process includes little profit and often losses when establishing a relationship with a customer it begins making money later on once customers rely more heavily on palantir software for their operations so its book of business should become increasingly profitable as it matures that's literally how i feel about palantir stock they aren't crushing it in numbers currently because they're developing the business and building relationships it only takes one or two out of the ten of these seven foot high school prodigies to make millions once they get drafted to play in the nba balance your success is very similar it's a long tail event what i mean by that is that it will take time but once wall street sees that they're delivering big profits and growing relationships they're going to bid up the stock fast palantir is a popular name amongst retail investors who own most of its shares compared to just 35 ownership by institutions and hedge funds the big guys have all of the money though hedge funds and institutions once they see profitability which is only in a matter of a few earnings quarters will regret not buying the stock under 20 dollars per share palantir stock has continued to slide early in february's trading the company's share price is down roughly 10 in the month so far and it's likely that meta platform's shocking fourth quarter results and guidance was a major catalyst in this pullback palantir is set to release its own fourth quarter results before the market opens on february 17th and the release is likely to be a big one for investors with its last update palantir got it for sales growth of roughly 30 year-over-year in q4 418 million dollars in revenue and non-gaap operating margin of 22 for the full year the company expects sales to increase 40 year-over-year to reach 1.53 billion dollars and it also anticipates adjusted free cash flow of more than 400 million dollars unlike netflix and meta which has very high expectations and sell off if anything comes short palantir has the opposite it's been selling off so much and the expectations are low that's a recipe for success and why i believe short term this stock can swing to 20 dollars per share again palantir also extended its partnership with ferrari to bring data-driven performance decisions to race operations i see palantir only winning and maintaining contracts eventually the big guys will want to get in what is likely happening is wall street sees too much risk wall street is notorious for being very short-term minded they always put pressure on a company to report great earnings regardless of where the company is in its growth cycle but an early stage high growth company like pounds here should be able to lose money as long as they're building a strong long-term foundation the stock market ran hot in early 2021 pushing a lot of companies to silly valuations palantir was no exception its price to sales ratio routinely went above 30 and occasionally beyond 40. super rich valuations set a high bar for a stock often leading to sharp corrections on things like a less than perfect earnings report that makes sense and when palantir fell to the low 20s per share i believe it was justified however now things just don't make any sense for palantir there's just no room for error and no margin of safety from shareholders but if you ignore the short-term volatility you are likely to get paid for the risk the stock has now fallen more than 60 percent from its 52-week high presenting a much more reasonable entry point for long-term investors the stocks price to sales ratio is below 20 its lowest since the initial weeks following its market debut in ipo now investors have the opportunity to buy the stock at a valuation that could allow its growth and share price to rise together over the coming years palantir should be a rewarding investment if management can hit that 30 growth target expand its public and private sector reach and continue moving towards profitability this coming earnings are going to be very interesting and have a significant influence on the stock whether the stock rises is hard to say because any term prediction is pretty much a coin flip but i'm very confident long term each earnings that comes out it will only grow the share price further because paluture is increasing revenues it's increasing cash flows and the profitability factor will continue to move higher it's only a matter of time until we see huge profitability come in and wall street have that little fire in their belly getting excited about this stock again and that's what's going to push this stock higher and bigger valuations fast now there's no saying when that can happen but when it does i can expect this stock to go up 30 40 and even 50 in a single quarter given good earnings whether it happens this quarter the following quarter or in 2022 that's going to be a key factor i'm going to look at for palantir stock along with any big news events of them creating relationships with other partners management is very smart and knows exactly what they're doing how are you planning on playing palantir earnings let me know in the comments section and check out my option playlist if you're bullish you may want to buy some call options,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,4Yg3i0AGJbE,2022-02-10T14:11:30Z,MASSIVE NIO STOCK PRICE PREDICTION UPDATE WITH TESLA,NIO,"hey guys welcome back to the channel today i want to discuss neo's price prediction that i have for 2022. we are going to discuss where i see it going where analysts see it going because it's near rock bottom lows and i have a strong conviction that these levels are not sustainable so i believe there's a lot of opportunity to be had for the wise investors. We will talk about some key ratios news and financials for both Neo and Tesla. Credit Suisse analyst Bin Wang said Neo was his top pick in China's auto sector and offered a price target of 83 dollars per share that's a 4x from Neo's current levels. The RSI for Neo was 35 when it bottomed out January 28th it has very strong support at the 20 level. Now Neo is showing good signs of recovery the RSI is 40 so still below the 50 level where I like to build positions. I'm feeling very good about Neo I'm starting to add it again and build a long term position that being said you can see the stock still has a lot of volatility. I made a video on Neo options a couple of days ago to summarize I'm a fan of buying the stock and selling 28 call options to generate some premium. I'm going out two weeks to sell the 28 strike now I'm also selling puts at the 20 level since that's a strong support for Neo selling at the 20 level means I can buy up shares of a good growth name and get paid some big bucks for it if I get put to stock I'm going to run the wheel strategy. Aside from Neo facing some political issues which nobody can predict it's a clear buy case for me. Neo is successfully growing its manufacturing output despite global supply chain challenges across the industry its 24,439 vehicle deliveries in the third quarter of 2021 were an all-time high and a 100% year-over-year increase. It also launched its Battery as a Service offering in 2020 and lets customers buy an EV for a lower upfront price and it lets them subscribe to receive upgradable and rapidly swappable batteries consistent high growth recurring revenue and deliveries all look very stable from my standpoint. It's currently selling two SUV models, the ES8 and the ES6, as well as the sedan, the EC6. As of the end of October it had deliveries total of 145,703 units. This gives it the most extensive production track record among competitors like Rivian and Lucid as they're just getting started in production. It's hard for me to see Neo get beaten down any further from a valuation perspective. Price to sales is under seven, price to book is under 10 and operating cash flow is 2.5 billion and expect it to continue growing fast. My average on Neo was 18 per share after all the additions that I made I took some profits at the mid 30s and still have some shares now that are right below the current price I'm going to keep holding the stock and running the three core option strategies that I mentioned like covered calls, short puts and the wheel strategy. I'm gonna share my screen in just a second and show you some more of the things that I'm looking at with Neo. All right so the first thing that I want to look at is Neo. Neo's currently sitting at 25.98. This stock has done a whole lot of recovering since late January, so in January 28th this stock was basically a 20 stock. Now Neo is really heading up to the upside. I really like the momentum that we're building right now because for a few days in a row, February 3rd all the way up until the 9th which is today, this stock has had pretty much every single day of an uptrend so I expect Neo to continue moving higher. I think that we're going to see potentially high 28 per share or maybe even in the low 30s. Now that being said, I think the best three strategies as I mentioned before is going to be selling put options, doing covered calls and running the wheel strategy. And the wheel strategy is basically a subset of selling puts and covered calls. Taking a look at the option chain I would probably go down to maybe February 18th if you want to go one week out, however lately I've been doing monthly options because they're a lot easier for me to track especially with all the coaching that I've been doing in the discord so selling a put option right here I'm going to go down and look at the 22 and a half strike price and that's because I think Neo at around 20 per share was stupid cheap, I mean ridiculously cheap, I don't think it belongs there. Now currently Neo's sitting above 25 per share so I think even selling 25 puts could be a really good idea and in fact if you sell the 25 put this premium right here of a dollar and 97 cents it's basically two dollars which is basically about eight percent returns in a little bit over one month so in about a month you can make eight percent returns which means that you would make about 96 or basically a hundred percent per year if you were running the wheel strategy on Neo. Now of course that does mean that every single month you're going to be successful, however on a short-term trade here and even a long-term perspective selling the 25 strike you collect 8 premium and if you get into Neo stock at 25 per share I think that's a great entry price for the long-term investor. Now for the second strategy that I'm looking at is selling covered calls so all I'm going to do is I'm going to click sell call option now what I would be looking at is probably the 30 strike. Now the 30 strike is really advantageous because the current share of Neo is 26 now which means that if you buy 100 shares which is 2,600 now you've built in some room for upside you built in the opportunity for Neo stock to go from twenty six dollars to thirty dollars where you can make four hundred dollars on the stock appreciating. Now you also get paid a premium of a dollar and nine cents which is a four percent return however the four hundred dollars is more than a ten percent return so there's a lot of good strategies here with Neo especially because Neo is pulling back up whether you want to sell a put option at 25 or a covered call at 30 you can actually do both you can sell puts and wait to get put to stock and then start selling covered calls that would be called the wheel strategy I'm gonna have a video for you in the description or you can also just simultaneously sell a put option at 25 and buy shares of the stock and sell a 30 covered call which means that you're gonna have 200 shares basically of exposure one was selling puts and then another 100 shares was selling covered calls this would actually be called a covered straddle and this is one of the strategies that I would absolutely use if you want to build a good position in a stock. The reason for that is say Neo goes up it never goes below 25 per share well what's going to happen is you can make money on selling the 25 put option then you can also make money on the stock rising and make money on the covered calls you're gonna be making money three ways now if you don't do a covered call and you just sell puts that's still really good you can collect a lot of premium however you might miss some of the upside if Neo stock ends up taking off to 30 per share.",1.0,0.8

We will talk about some key ratios news and financials for both Neo and Tesla. But I do want to talk about Tesla, I have a very similar view on Tesla and here's some highlights on why it's going to the moon which is 2,000 per share in the next 12 to 36 months. Tesla's deliveries are skyrocketing, Q4 earnings huge. Wall Street totally confused on Tesla's true advantage, financial media clueless. Huge EV opportunity and to top it all off you have a free call option on robo taxis which is not priced into Tesla stock. Robo taxis are worth potentially 13.3 trillion dollars according to Ark Invest. Now I don't listen to Kathy Wood on everything because I like to do my own research when it comes to Tesla since she was so early in calling the stocks run up I do give her some more weight when she buys or sells Tesla stock. I really like to look at it because it tells me when Kathy is buying or selling and I do believe in Kathy when it comes to Tesla stock because she was so early on. Now the largest holding across all of Ark Invest ETFs is Tesla and it's one of the few things that worked out really well for Kathy Wood last year the stock rose 50 last year a sharp contrast to most of her top holdings that suffered painful double-digit percentage slides in 2021. With Tesla recently pulling back Kathy finally started buying again after Tesla posted blowout financial results two weeks ago. As you can see RK started adding some shares of Tesla. You can see RK has 8.59% of their portfolio in Tesla so Kathy still has some room to buy until she reaches the 10% threshold in Ark Invest mandate but obviously I'm just bullish on the stock and I can see it rising a lot. Let me briefly show you my position in Tesla and some options that I have opened as well as something on Neo. What I really want to show you guys is this position right here, this put credit spread on Tesla. I'm selling the 790 780 put credit spread on Tesla and in fact I have another put credit spread that I'm selling this one is expiring March 18th and this one is expiring September 16th. So I'm a big fan of Tesla, you don't have to have a lot of capital to trade Tesla. What you can do is you can sell put credit spreads if you want to learn more about po credit spreads you can watch this video right here on the screen right now.",1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,X-evc2C7puQ,2022-02-02T15:00:14Z,How to Pick Options,Tesla,now let's go into a stock i'll pick tesla right now i have a big tesla position and i'm running a whole lot of different option strategies right now i'm currently up thirty five thousand eight hundred dollars on five different strategies on a whole lot of collateral but i'm just gonna click trade tesla options and i'm going to show you the difference that high implied volatility makes on a stock like tesla versus others and who knows maybe later in this video i'm going to find stocks that are better than tesla because i'm not married to tesla right i just want to make you guys as much money as possible and show you all the possibilities so i'm certain i'm going to show you some options that are going to be better than this one i'm going to look at right now but if i open up the 920 you will see that a few different factors that i look at is this implied volatility right here tell you a little bit more about in just a second and implied volatility actually impacts vega so vega measures how sensitive the option is to implied volatility essentially it tells you how much the option is going to inflate given more volatility now with this tesla example i want to show you how much money you can collect even if you're not running tesla i'm going to show you a small account trading strategy as well i'm going to go through the whole gambit of things that you can do given high implied volatility and how that's going to help you so first of all 79 implied volatility and vega is 0.34 now what i'm going to do is take this 25 right here and divide it by 920 dollars the reason why i'm doing this is i want to see how much premium you can collect if you were selling a covered call option for basically at the money for the strike price i've changed this to sell call option and the amount of premium that i'm collecting in just three days is 2.7 so 2.7 in a single week is going to be over 10 in a month and obviously that's going to be over a hundred percent in a year so selling strategies are fantastic but now that's a selling strategy on tesla can i find a stock that has better options than tesla and what does this look like for safer stocks tesla was around 76 coke is around 20 in fact it's below 20 right now so one fourth of tesla whereas for tesla it's probably in the thousands in fact i actually found an option that is better than tesla based on implied volatility currently nvidia is at 70 which means it's near tesla-like volatility even better than the tesla trade is because of high implied volatility.,1.0,0.6

Invest with Henry,JVZhStumNmI,2022-01-31T22:38:53Z,Top Options to Buy This Week Stock Market Correction,Neo,given the rapid pace at which sales of electric vehicles are rising and neo stock falling i'm starting to get bullish on two different strategies one is selling puts and the other is selling covered calls i wouldn't shy away from putting my money on an ev stock during a market sell-off because we've seen time and again a fast u or v-shaped recovery specifically there are three reasons why i like neo first neo is a bet on the world's largest ev market china where demand for new energy vehicles is rising fast neo is also making an effort to establish a footprint outside china which is my second reason to be bullish on the stock for example neo plans to expand its presence to 25 countries and regions by 2025 with immediate plans including entry into more european markets after having already launched its vehicles in norway last year i caught neo at four dollars per share and again at 19 dollars per share i had to sell off the stock at mid 30s but seeing neo basically at 20 bucks i think it's a steal last but most important neo's gearing up to start deliveries of two models this year it's flagship sedan et7 and it's much awaited mid-size sedan the et5 there is much more going at neo including a potential secondary listing in the hong kong stock exchange or perhaps even singapore as rumors are floating right now now let's jump into my screen and look at different option strategies that i would run all right so let's take a look at neo stock it's almost up eight percent this morning and that doesn't surprise me because again i believe this stock is trading for a huge discount this is not due to neo's business this is mainly due to china fears this is where i think it really makes sense to start adding to a new position because neo just looks really undervalued it looks like neo is already starting a u-shaped recovery now if you notice the rsi the rsi is also currently sitting at 33. neo is currently trading for 22 i believe in the next week next two weeks the neo is going to recover around the 25 level if not go back up to 27 given the market performance pretty well this strategy is very good for investors that believe a stock is going to rise and they already hold neo however for this first strategy you need to own 100 shares of neo whether you already own it or you're planning to buy it and ride the stock higher this is where you can use a covered call so let's say you have just bought 100 shares of neo at 22 and 48 cents the implied volatility currently for neo is 105 which is something that i have not seen for a very long time the option delta right here is 0.48 which means there's a 48 chance of neo reaching 23 per share if neo stock ends up rising which it currently is up to almost nine percent on the day as i'm talking i'm losing money but that's okay because i'm doing this for all the subscribers so whether you choose the 23 strike or the 25 strike a covered call is a great strategy to run on neo stock or any stock because obviously i'm not a financial advisor you want to pick a stock that's going up that way you can benefit from the rise in the stock itself as well as collecting premium from the option now selling put option does require a lot of premium because you do need 100 shares of collateral however i can show you what a put credit spread looks like now simply set a put credit spread is a really good strategy because it requires very little capital to invest in a stock and see pretty good premium come from it so again let's say that we're bullish on neo which i am personally now if neo stock remains above about 22 you're going to make the entire premium that you're collecting which is the 30 now your break even price is 21.71 which is actually very nice because it's significantly lower than the current price of neo stock,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,JVZhStumNmI,2022-01-31T22:38:53Z,Top Options to Buy This Week Stock Market Correction,Palantir,next stock that has great options to buy and multiple strategies i'm looking at is palantir the six month performance of palantir is ugly the stock is trading for 50 off its price six months ago the company had a market valuation of 50 billion now the market cap is 25 billion main reason palantir is likely to rise is their competitive advantage in the market palantir stands out by analyzing and proposing possible artificial intelligence driven decision scenarios based on data gathered from diverse sources it started in the government realm where its gotham software has helped both the u.s military and law enforcement agencies maintain peace and order it later added the foundry segment to bring this technology to the commercial sector it has become the fastest growing part of the company as the customer count grew 46 quarter over quarter in the third quarter the revenue growth is also something i'm paying close attention to which is going to influence the option strategies i'm going to show you palantir seems to have far exceeded that growth rate for the first three quarters of 2021 the company reported revenue of just over 1.1 billion dollars this amounts to a 44 increase compared with the first nine months in 2020. palantir predicts 40 revenue growth for the end of fiscal year 2021 while analysts believe that this will slow to around 30 in 2022 nonetheless revenue growth should remain strong as both government and companies seek to help solving problems with data and i believe that palantir is trading for a huge discount so let's take a look at option strategies together all right so the next technical chart that i want to look at before we look at the options is palantir's technical chart now recently palantir has had really good support at the 18 19 level but with their recent market correction now it's trading for 13 and a half dollars this stock actually bottomed at around 12 dollars per share which is pretty insane because it's about half of where the stock was trading at about six months ago or even about four months ago now the stock is also showing a u-shaped recovery i mean this may be a v-shaped recovery i'm not sure yet i think that palantir has about twenty percent upside or roughly going to be about fifteen dollars per share and let me show you how i would be playing this stock using options however for pounds here the stock is only 13 per share so selling a put option at 13 per share is only going to require you 1 300 in capital to collect 35 this week what selling a put option does is it gives you the opportunity to buy pounds your stock at 13 now only two things can happen if palantir ends up below 13 dollars you have to buy a pallent here for 13 which shouldn't be a problem because that is going to be a value price for the stock again you don't have to use pounds here i'm just telling you how i'm thinking and how i use options to get into stocks for a lot less price another strategy is simply going to be a covered call again however it is pretty interesting on pounds here what makes pouncer really interesting the stock is very very cheap so it's not hard for you to buy 100 shares of this stock and then sell a covered call option whether that's at the money again it could be 13 and a half this week which should be a very fast gain that's going to be roughly seven or eight percent return i'm doing the math in my head however you can see that that's a very big return in a very short amount of time,1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,XV2gL7aTSAA,2022-01-26T14:35:35Z,Best Stocks To Buy In February,Tesla,i'm mainly preparing for tesla earnings i believe it's time to be very safe in the market however i don't really want to deleverage my position in tesla because i believe they're going to report a good queue for earnings now this video isn't about tesla it's about the best stocks to buy in february. very reasonable considering nvidia is growing fast like a tesla while tesla trades at a 300 p e valuation. Last stock i believe has tremendous potential in february is tesla now next couple of days tesla is reporting earnings for q4 this is historically one of the best quarters for tesla and tesla currently sits around 850 per share and i'm completely terrified because i have so many shares however when i look at the general market everything is selling off bitcoin is around 33 000 there's literally no place to hide so i can't feel bad about my tesla position when i think about the long-term trajectory of where tesla is headed it doesn't make any sense for me to sell my shares even though i'm losing six figures in one single day now with tesla i'm paying close attention to earnings and i'm looking for this stock to outperform in february my price target for tesla this year is about 1300 per share in my base case scenario therefore there's nearly forty percent upside and i'm going to continue holding tesla along with all the other stocks that i mentioned in this video.,1.0,0.7
Invest with Henry,XV2gL7aTSAA,2022-01-26T14:35:35Z,Best Stocks To Buy In February,Nvidia,graphic chip specialist nvidia is now trading for a huge discount to last year's levels i did sell call credit spreads when it was 330 per share and at those levels it was clearly overvalued now nvidia has gone down by more than 100 i mean look at the stocks technical pattern right now it is in a complete bare territory however at some points you do want to put some money to work and catch a falling knife because it's not going to be falling down to zero the stock has had some really high volatility so selling options on it like puts to get in is a great idea growth investors with a higher appetite for risk can consider using the pullback in nvidia to buy more shares if you don't have enough collateral of course you can also sell put credit spreads at the 200 and 195 level or even lower as nvidia continues to pull back i believe nvidia growth is here to stay for a few simple reasons analysts expect nvidia's earnings to have a compounded annual growth rate of 40 for the next five years although there is pain in the market right now there is no lie in the business's growth the growth is not surprising because nvidia dominates two lucrative markets video gaming in data center gpus and is making notable moves in self-driving cars and the metaverse as a huge eevee investor nvidia is selling the shovels to the gold miners each vehicle needs gpus year-to-date nvidia is down 20 and the p e ratio is now under 75. very reasonable considering nvidia is growing fast like a tesla while tesla trades at a 300 p e valuation i believe semiconductors are the new oil every secular tailwind you can think of involving disruptive innovation requires semiconductors in fact the list goes on data centers cloud computing virtual reality autonomous driving electric vehicles gaming esports ecommerce the metaverse artificial intelligence big data every single place that's going to have growth in the future needs semiconductors and nvidia is a key component of these growing industries so as nvidia continues to sell off i'm continuing to look into buying shares.,1.0,0.8
Invest with Henry,XV2gL7aTSAA,2022-01-26T14:35:35Z,Best Stocks To Buy In February,Amazon,now the second stock is amazon i'm betting big on e-commerce nobody goes to the mall anymore everybody does their shopping online most people are familiar with amazon because of its leading online marketplace according to emarketer amazon is expected to have brought in 41.4 percent of all online spending in the us last year that's more than 34 percentage points higher than the next closest competitor however online retail sales generally yield razor thin margins to counteract this amazon has a genius idea and they turn its annual prime membership into a big profit center members receive a number of perks including free two-day shipping and access to amazon's fast content library in return the company gets high margin subscription revenue that helps increase margins and allows them to undercut brick and mortar retailers on price it also doesn't hurt that prime members spend more with amazon and stay within its product and service ecosystem even if the market is shaky amazon is an easy long-term bet the stock is currently trading for under 2 900 and currently i see it as a value play the cloud segment of their business is also likely to continue growing and taking off this is a high margin business and i believe it's going to start reflecting more and more each quarter of earnings i believe amazon could be a 5 000 or 10 000 stock this decade of course i don't know what will happen tomorrow but i expect good performance in february specifically because they have earnings for the first quarter of 2022 analysts are currently modeling for amazon's revenue to increase about 12 percent year over year to 121 billion dollars and eps to fall 33 to 10 and 50 cents i'm paying close attention to amazon because they beat five out of the six of the last earnings numbers and i expect a high chance of that repeating.,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,XV2gL7aTSAA,2022-01-26T14:35:35Z,Best Stocks To Buy In February,Meta,The third stock is also a tech stock now i'm not condoning buying the tech stock dip because i think a lot of stocks may continue dipping however i'm paying close attention to the tech stocks that have good fundamentals meta is what i'm looking at even though meta officially changed its name from facebook in late october there is no question whether the lion's share of revenue for the company still originates in advertising based on the company's third quarter operating results 2.9 billion monthly active users visited facebook in q3 with another 670 million unique users heading to instagram and whatsapp each month combined we're talking about 3.58 billion people or more than half of the world's adult population interacting with a meta owned asset each month and the number of mobile users is only skyrocketing there's simply no platform around that allows advertisers to reach so many eyeballs which is why meta enjoys such incredible ad pricing power as i've previously noted meta hasn't come close to fully monetizing its core assets yet even though it likely generated more than 100 billion in ad revenue last year nearly all of this came from facebook and instagram assuming facebook eventually pulls monetization levers on whatsapp and facebook messenger it'll be able to drive additional sales and profits to an already fast growing business the closer meta stock gets to 300 per share the more excited i get to purchase shares and currently with the monday sell-off meta is actually under 300 per share i expect the stock to see a lot of growth as soon as the market recovers in 2022 all eyes seem to be on the metaverse the next iteration of the internet design to allow users to interact in 3d virtual environments facebook is aiming to be a leader in virtual reality with its oakless devices and it invested 10 billion last year in metaverse related products and services with Microsoft recently buying activision blizzard for 69 billion it's clear big tech is very focused on the metaverse also it's not often that you can find a company that's near a 1 trillion market cap that's continuing to grow by approximately 20 on annual basis and it's valued at roughly 20 times earnings for this year meta looks like an absolute bargain going into february and i think it's a good hedge in a risky portfolio.,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,D9S9oisnoZ4,2022-01-25T22:37:28Z,3X Your MONEY With Small Account Strategy,Tesla,The first thing that i do want to look at is probably tesla that sticks out the most to me however i'm probably going to look at apple potentially robinhood that's three different stocks trying to find stocks that i think will have big moves obviously verizon is not going to have a big move microsoft would be a fourth play now maybe looking at a fifth play you know potentially visa mastercard but we'll take it from there let's start off with tesla all right so i'm going to pull up tesla right now i have a whole lot of shares of tesla obviously i'm a big bull in the stock i felt very queasy yesterday when it went down below 900 but i said that would be a great buying point i made a two minute video if you want to check it out it'll be in the description but essentially tesla below 900 per share to me feels like a steal also tesla has earnings in one day now what i'm going to do is click trade tesla options right now and we're going to open up an iron condor the benefit of an iron condor is you can actually make money if a stock goes up or down so either way if a stock has a big move which basically due to implied volatility right now due to the market having a lot of volatility this could be a good strategy because tesla is either going to go back to the thousands or it's likely to go below 900 but it's unlikely to stay the same now adding on top of market volatility and uncertainty right now tesla also has earnings so historically when a stock reports earnings the stock has a greater than average move either to the upside or to the downside depending if the earnings are positive or negative so i'm going to show you guys what i'm going to do right now tesla's around 913 dollars per share and i said we're either gonna go past thousand dollars per share or we're gonna go below eight hundred fifty dollars per share i'm hoping that we go up to the upside however you never know in this type of market what i'm going to do is i'm going to scroll up and i'm going to buy a call option now the reason why i'm buying this call option is because again i expect tesla to either go above a thousand or below 850 so a good strike price might be something like the 945 what i'm going to do is actually open up the iron condor if it doesn't look good to me if the risk reward doesn't look good then i can always adjust these strike prices so i'm going to start off by buying the 945 and then i'm going to click sell call option so now i bought one call option to open up an iron condor i'm basically protecting myself here by buying a call option selling a call option okay and then the same thing will happen for buying a put option selling a put option so i bought the 945 call option now i'm going to sell the 955 call option and significantly reduce the cost right here so the cost is not going to be 34 that's a crazy amount right that's three thousand four hundred dollars instead i'm going to sell the 955 call option right now and you can see that the total cost right here is very very low i mean very affordable 380 dollars per share now my break even price here is going to be about 948 however again i'm not sure if it's going to go up or down there's really no way of predicting so what i'm doing is i'm going to now buy put options and i said that this stock could be below 850 per share again i'm a bull in this stock but i'm just showing an example not a financial advisor just giving you the education and the tools that you can use go out there and make money for yourself on this stock or other stocks for yourself given your perspective so now i'm going to open up and go buy a put at the 865 level i'm just picking arbitrary strike prices and now i actually just realized not going to open up the 865 because very very important you need the difference in strike prices to be 10. here i picked a difference of 10 which is 1 thousand dollars and if i pick the 865 well i actually can't make a one thousand dollar spread so instead i'm going to pick the 860. caught myself right there okay this is a big mistake that some people make they open up uneven iron condors and things get really confusing just keep it simple if you've opened up a thousand dollar call credit spread now you can open up a thousand dollar put credit spread again combining a call credit spread a quick credit spread that's what an iron condor is in this case since we're actually buying an iron condor we're actually buying debit call spreads and debit put spread so what that means is i'm just buying the closer to the money strike price so this is 8.50 i'm going to buy the 850 put okay so buying the 850 put now again i'm going to sell to protect myself to actually open up a spread otherwise if i just sell this 850 put you can see on the chart right here this is really nothing this is not an iron condor yet to create the iron condor now i have to sell this 840 put to create the iron condor now you will see right here that we have gains on both sides if tesla falls to the downside we have a gain and if tesla rises to the upside we also have a gain now this strategy right here has a max loss of 668 dollars for a max profit of around 300 so the total return here is about 50 because the total amount of money that you can make is a thousand dollars you're risking 667 dollars essentially half of 667 is about 333 dollars and then of course 333 dollars plus 667 is 1 000 so you can make a 50 return on this iron condor in one week however you need tesla to fall below 843 which again i said is possible if they report really bad earnings or what i think will happen if tesla reports really good earnings and it ends up rising beyond 951 dollars per share then you're going to realize a profit so i think it'll be around this area right here however if you're unsure i'm showing you this strategy because you can make money on both sides whether a stock falls or whether a stock goes up now i do want to show you guys other examples not just on tesla let's move over and go to robin hood so i'm going to look up hood on robinhood pretty funny this stock is either going to blow up or blow up one way or another it's either going to rise or fall the reason for that is if i go to maybe like the one month chart this stock is down 30 so this stock has gapped down a whole lot we have seen a whole lot of selling pressure however it's not going to take much if they report a good earnings number for this stock to rise potentially past 15 per share or if the stock reports some bad numbers then i think the stock can be below 10 dollars per share again they are reporting earnings tomorrow one day is left and there's a whole lot of people that are actually asking questions this is pretty interesting because i think for tesla there was 4 000 questions asked and for robinhood there's 2 100 questions asked so let's go to trade robinhood options and i'm going to do the same thing again i'm going to go ahead and buy a call option now i'm going to go much closer to the money thing is with robinhood is this stock is a cheap stock so this is going to be a good play for people with small portfolios because it's not going to require much money for you to see a benefit or for you to actually take a position in the iron condor so what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to buy an at the money call option i'm going to buy the 13 call option and then i'm going to go a little bit quicker and sell the 14 call option right here now you guys know the next step is to buy a put option i'm going to buy a put option at the 13 strike which is again an at the money option i'm really betting that robin hood is going to have a move from the 13 level from the current level right here this is a little bit different than tesla for tesla i went a little bit out of the money because tesla has a lot of volatility it's also a much larger stock so we can move a whole lot more however for robinhood it's a 13 stock and the strike prices are very thin they're very close together they're only 50 apart whereas with tesla they were 500 apart so for robinhood i can go much closer to the money because these strike prices are not changing very much so i bought the 13 strike put right here now i'm going to sell the put for the 12 level again i'm going 100 out of the money because that's what i did for the call side i want to do the same for the put side now you can see that the total cost is 88 however we can only make 12 dollars per share that's because our break evens are so close robin hood only has to pull up above about 14 dollars per share to see a full profit and below about 12 dollars per share to see a full profit now this position will start to see profit below 12 dollars and 12 cents and above 13.87 now the risk reward here isn't fantastic so i want to show you an alternative because you know you're only making 12 and risking 88 and for some people they're like wait a second that doesn't really make any sense i think robin hood is going to move a whole lot more and i want my reward to be much larger compared to my risk and i do agree with that because 12 divided by 88 is about 15 whereas the tesla iron condor had about 50 so something's up here we're going to have to change the strike prices so i'm going to go a little bit farther out of the money go for buying the 14 and a half call option now i'm going to sell a call option at 15. i want to show you guys what it looks like to make a 50 spread or essentially a 50 iron condor so buying the 14 and a half call option i'm going to now sell the 15 call option go to buy put i'm going to buy the 12 but now what i notice here is i can't really do that now the reason why i can't really do that because robinhood no longer has 0.5 differences on the downside the only thing i can really do here is buy a 12 and a half foot option and then sell a 12 put option now you'll notice that my total cost is 34 but my max profit is 16 this iron condor now is about a 50 return it's actually slightly higher than 50 percent very similar to tesla however what you will notice here with this iron condor is we are much closer to the downside this would be the middle point for robin hood however it's much closer to the downside so this is a slightly bearish strategy however it's still betting on huge volatility for robinhood either falling a lot or rising a lot and given robin hood's negative momentum i do believe that the stock has a higher chance of falling so i am a fan of this iron condor right here now the next stock that i want to look at is going to be apple so apple has had a lot of high momentum going upwards but obviously apple has sold off a lot during this market corrections let's open up apple apple is one of the best options to trade for any strategy out there now the reason for that is because apple's options have so much volume a good amount of volume means that your bid ask spreads are going to be very tight they're going to be awesome for traders because you don't have a very high cost of trading even though robinhood is a free platform every time you do trade options there is some implicit cost due to bid ask spread however it's very low with apple because apple has some of the highest volume in the entire stock market now apple has sold off a lot but it was a hundred and seventy nine and even a hundred eighty dollar stock if i zoom out to the one year i do want to point out this stock was also trading for 143 there's a whole lot of things that can happen to apple given this market and given earnings i'm going to go ahead and again buy a call option for something close to the money such as the 165 level now i'm going to sell the 170 level and again i'm going to go buy put option it's the third time i'm doing this so you guys should start getting the gist here and again i said that apple was down to about 143 not too long ago so i'm going to go ahead and buy the 150 dollar put option now i'm going to sell the 145. things get a little bit funky because these strikes are starting to move by one dollar however it's pretty easy i'm just going to go down to the 145 level and end up selling this put option right here now my total cost is 172 however i can actually make 327 right here this option position right here can actually give you a 3x on your money because you're risking 175 dollars right here but you have a potential reward of about 500 that's about a 3x return and as you can see you need apple to go up to 166 dollars per share or you need to go below 148 dollars per share to start seeing a gain on this iron condor position now the last stock that i'm going to look at is microsoft microsoft is very interesting because it had a lot of stability and even though the market is correcting this stock is staying pretty stable i mean it was up ten percent now it's down seven percent so that is about a 17 move in about a month so this stock still has very high implied volatility which means it's going to be a good candidate for an iron condor again now what i'm going to do is i'm going to pick something close to the money i believe that microsoft isn't going to move as much as something like apple or tesla however i still think there is money to be made especially if you go close to the money so 290 i'm going to sell the 295 now i'm going to buy a put option i'm going to go down to about 280 and now i'm going to close off this trade by selling the 275. taking a look here our total cost is 383 per share and our max profit is 117 dollars what you will notice here is that our risk is pretty high and our reward is fairly low the reason for that is because i went so close to the money if you want to expand the amount of profit that you can make and reduce the amount of loss then what you want to do is go farther out of the money so picking something like the 270 265 or on the call side maybe even want to go up as high as 300 so instead of 290 295 you can go 300 305. your max profit will be much higher your max loss will be much lower however keep into consideration that the reason why the max profit is higher than the max loss is lower is because you need the stock to move a lot more for you to break even with this trade right here you only need microsoft to go to 293 dollars however if you go higher then you're going to need microsoft to go up to 300 maybe 302 on the call side and lower than 275 on the downside you're going to need it to go down to 270 to 65. as you can see the bigger that you make your profit the more the stock has to move because option traders understand that they're giving up some risk for reward and vice versa so if you want a bigger reward they want the buyer of the iron condor to take on more risk whether that's a max loss risk or whether that's an implied volatility risk so something that we're not seeing here is implied volatility or the potential move that the stock has to make for you to break even on your iron condor so the further you go out of the money the more you need the stock to move and the less likely that is to happen if you guys want to see all the trades that i'm making live and how i'm outperforming the market protecting my portfolio and hedging my portfolio while this market continues to be

Invest with Henry,D9S9oisnoZ4,2022-01-25T22:37:28Z,3X Your MONEY With Small Account Strategy,Robinhood,now i do want to show you guys other examples not just on tesla let's move over and go to robin hood so i'm going to look up hood on robinhood pretty funny this stock is either going to blow up or blow up one way or another it's either going to rise or fall the reason for that is if i go to maybe like the one month chart this stock is down 30 so this stock has gapped down a whole lot we have seen a whole lot of selling pressure however it's not going to take much if they report a good earnings number for this stock to rise potentially past 15 per share or if the stock reports some bad numbers then i think the stock can be below 10 dollars per share again they are reporting earnings tomorrow one day is left and there's a whole lot of people that are actually asking questions this is pretty interesting because i think for tesla there was 4 000 questions asked and for robinhood there's 2 100 questions asked so let's go to trade robinhood options and i'm going to do the same thing again i'm going to go ahead and buy a call option now i'm going to go much closer to the money thing is with robinhood is this stock is a cheap stock so this is going to be a good play for people with small portfolios because it's not going to require much money for you to see a benefit or for you to actually take a position in the iron condor so what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to buy an at the money call option i'm going to buy the 13 call option and then i'm going to go a little bit quicker and sell the 14 call option right here now you guys know the next step is to buy a put option i'm going to buy a put option at the 13 strike which is again an at the money option i'm really betting that robin hood is going to have a move from the 13 level from the current level right here this is a little bit different than tesla for tesla i went a little bit out of the money because tesla has a lot of volatility it's also a much larger stock so we can move a whole lot more however for robinhood it's a 13 stock and the strike prices are very thin they're very close together they're only 50 apart whereas with tesla they were 500 apart so for robinhood i can go much closer to the money because these strike prices are not changing very much so i bought the 13 strike put right here now i'm going to sell the put for the 12 level again i'm going 100 out of the money because that's what i did for the call side i want to do the same for the put side now you can see that the total cost is 88 however we can only make 12 dollars per share that's because our break evens are so close robin hood only has to pull up above about 14 dollars per share to see a full profit and below about 12 dollars per share to see a full profit now this position will start to see profit below 12 dollars and 12 cents and above 13.87 now the risk reward here isn't fantastic so i want to show you an alternative because you know you're only making 12 and risking 88 and for some people they're like wait a second that doesn't really make any sense i think robin hood is going to move a whole lot more and i want my reward to be much larger compared to my risk and i do agree with that because 12 divided by 88 is about 15 whereas the tesla iron condor had about 50 so something's up here we're going to have to change the strike prices so i'm going to go a little bit farther out of the money go for buying the 14 and a half call option now i'm going to sell a call option at 15. i want to show you guys what it looks like to make a 50 spread or essentially a 50 iron condor so buying the 14 and a half call option i'm going to now sell the 15 call option go to buy put i'm going to buy the 12 but now what i notice here is i can't really do that now the reason why i can't really do that because robinhood no longer has 0.5 differences on the downside the only thing i can really do here is buy a 12 and a half foot option and then sell a 12 put option now you'll notice that my total cost is 34 but my max profit is 16 this iron condor now is about a 50 return it's actually slightly higher than 50 percent very similar to tesla however what you will notice here with this iron condor is we are much closer to the downside this would be the middle point for robin hood however it's much closer to the downside so this is a slightly bearish strategy however it's still betting on huge volatility for robinhood either falling a lot or rising a lot and given robin hood's negative momentum i do believe that the stock has a higher chance of falling so i am a fan of this iron condor right here now the next stock that i want to look at is going to be apple,1.0,0.2
Invest with Henry,D9S9oisnoZ4,2022-01-25T22:37:28Z,3X Your MONEY With Small Account Strategy,Apple,now the next stock that i want to look at is going to be apple so apple has had a lot of high momentum going upwards but obviously apple has sold off a lot during this market corrections let's open up apple apple is one of the best options to trade for any strategy out there now the reason for that is because apple's options have so much volume a good amount of volume means that your bid ask spreads are going to be very tight they're going to be awesome for traders because you don't have a very high cost of trading even though robinhood is a free platform every time you do trade options there is some implicit cost due to bid ask spread however it's very low with apple because apple has some of the highest volume in the entire stock market now apple has sold off a lot but it was a hundred and seventy nine and even a hundred eighty dollar stock if i zoom out to the one year i do want to point out this stock was also trading for 143 there's a whole lot of things that can happen to apple given this market and given earnings i'm going to go ahead and again buy a call option for something close to the money such as the 165 level now i'm going to sell the 170 level and again i'm going to go buy put option it's the third time i'm doing this so you guys should start getting the gist here and again i said that apple was down to about 143 not too long ago so i'm going to go ahead and buy the 150 dollar put option now i'm going to sell the 145. things get a little bit funky because these strikes are starting to move by one dollar however it's pretty easy i'm just going to go down to the 145 level and end up selling this put option right here now my total cost is 172 however i can actually make 327 right here this option position right here can actually give you a 3x on your money because you're risking 175 dollars right here but you have a potential reward of about 500 that's about a 3x return and as you can see you need apple to go up to 166 dollars per share or you need to go below 148 dollars per share to start seeing a gain on this iron condor position now the last stock that i'm going to look at is microsoft,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,ToYRdZtK8Ik,2022-01-20T22:02:45Z,3X Tesla Option Trade I Made with Bull Call Spreads,Tesla,i just opened some bull call spreads on tesla before earnings that come in around a 2.8 x return just shy of 3x for 2022. here's an image of this trade i'm going to run you through the entire trade in just a second i'm risking 36 dollars to make one hundred thousand dollars i bought the 1050 call option and sold the 1150 call option for a bull call spread or some call it a debit call spread the trade expires on january 20 2023 my plan is to show you a few different strikes and payoffs so you can have options to bet on tesla no pun intended i'm going to discuss why i went out that far my expectations for tesla's stock price why i picked this option specifically and more so make sure you stick through this video so first of all tesla was under one thousand dollars being heavily invested in tesla i sort of pissed my pants i've told my discord students who've been killing it that i'm taking a risk on this bull call spread because i want to continue to kill it it's almost getting stupid because i'm breaking my own risk management rules with adding more and more tesla but i almost feel silly not owning a lot of tesla because i believe opportunities like this come around once every few years at most where the play just seems obvious so anyways i'm not a financial advisor i don't know what's going to happen but i want to show you this play in detail and discuss similar plays that you can make and remember i can always coach you and show you all my buy and sell signals and you can do that by booking a call by submitting an application in the first link in the description my one month performance is 4.5 which is very typical for me versus the s p 500 being flat so i aim for about 50 returns per year all right let's not waste any time let's get stupid rich and go through an example all right so you guys can see i have a number of different positions here i'm running spreads on nvidia up a hundred percent another hundred percent two thousand dollar gain pounds here i'm looking to enter pretty soon arriving hundred percent ravine another hundred percent this was a big play that i made very happy with the results two thousand dollars here so far i'm selling covered calls here this tesla credit spread made eleven thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars now i scrolled down and i picked the tesla bull call spread that i wanna show you guys so far i'm up a modest twenty dollars i mean basically this is flat now it's 70 or 100 it doesn't really matter because this position is expiring in january of 2023 there's a very long time until expiration here first of all one of the things that i wanted to look into was the technical analysis of tesla now tesla is one of the best stocks to run technical analysis on because this stock obviously does not trade based on fundamentals so many bears out there have been saying how tesla has a really high p e ratio well that doesn't really matter to me and honestly you shouldn't even look at p e ratios for super high growth stocks you should look at price to sales ratio or you should run a discounted cash flow model but let me just save you the time let me show you what I'm looking at so I'm looking at a few different indicators one of them is the moving average I simply want to see where tesla is moving in relation to its history so right here for the past 50 days of trading tesla is right around this thousand and fifty dollar level so that makes sense to me the stock should be over a thousand dollars i believe it's going to stay over a thousand dollars per share and that's why i kind of started to panic yesterday when the stock went below 1 000 per share i really wanted to start hedging my portfolio at this point but i also realized that you have to take risk if you want big rewards obviously i'm not going anywhere it would be completely stupid for me to jump ship even if the stock goes down to 800 i'm holding for the long term i have zero plans of selling but i'm not going to lie i do get a little bit queasy when it goes under a thousand dollars but i remind myself that is my reptilian brain that's just my human emotion but when i look at the bigger story i think that this stock is going to be about a thirteen hundred dollar stock at the end of 2022 and that's where a lot of my analysis is coming in for buying that bull call spread if you take a look at the stock right now it's one thousand dollars but if you take a look at the six month chart i honestly think that we're going to reach this peak again and actually surpass this peak because look tesla has four quarters of earnings before january 2023. so it's going to see at least four quarters and i believe that it's going to have at least two blowout quarters out of four if not three blowout quarters because i've looked into the history and for the past four quarters tesla has beat four quarters in a row by 14 so i expect tesla to continue doing that because that is what the pattern is wall street isn't properly estimating tesla's earnings and they keep undershooting for what tesla's actual capabilities are so my belief is that we're going to at least touch the peak of 1229 but i think that we're gonna go past that peak to about thirteen hundred dollars per share because that's where the bollinger band right here is and this makes a lot of sense to me i believe tesla deserves this price based on berlin and austin opening factory soon i think the production numbers are going to increase i think their margins are going to increase and overall i have a high conviction in the stock so now going back into my position i decided to pick the 1050 in the 1150 call option for the bull call spread i do want to open up the option chain because i want to show you a list of different options that you can pick and why i went for the 1050 1150 strikes alright so check it out what you want to do when you're buying a bull call spread first of all simply said a bull call spread is betting on a stock rising if i was going to buy a 1050 call option right here well you might say well why would i sell my upside why would i sell the 1150 well the reason why you would want to do that is because when you buy the 1050 call option this is going to cost you 245 dollars per share or 24 590 now i know a lot of people do not have that money a lot of people are just beginning their trading career they're learning about options and they're not trying to dump twenty four thousand five hundred dollars into one trade not to mention there's also reasons why this trade wouldn't even be good aside from the huge cost so first of all the huge cost i'm going to show you how to reduce that cost significantly and i mean by like 80 or 90 percent but second of all this isn't even the best trade because check it out if you buy the thousand fifty call option you're paying a pretty big premium now your break even price is 12.95 and i just said in my bare case scenario that tesla will retouch its highs around twelve hundred and twenty nine dollars per share but the break even here is twelve hundred and ninety five dollars so if you straight up just buy a call option not only is it stupid expensive at five hundred ninety dollars but also you need the stock price to go past 12.95 and i just mentioned that i do believe it can happen however i'm much more confident that 12 29 can happen rather than 12.95 so i'd rather have more margin for safety and i'm going to show you why selling the 1150 actually gives you more margin of safety and allows you to have a higher return so now what i'm going to do i'm going to click sell call option now i'm going to sell the 1150 and once i click this my total cost right here we'll go from 245 and it will be subsidized i'm literally going to collect the premium of this 1150 strike now when i click this you can see right here that the option that i opened up is still worth 36 now instead of paying 24 590 you only need to pay 3 600 which is a significant decrease and way more affordable for the average and typical investor who's learning option trading now the good news is actually your break even price has also gone down significantly i mean before we're looking at 12.95 now robinhood by the way super easy platform if you want a few free stocks i have a special link in the description where you're going to get a few free stocks that have a high chance of being valuable so you might pick an apple or an nvidia i actually had a friend who signed up and got one share of nvidia so yeah check out the link in the description it's literally free money so right here our break even is actually 1085 now the reason for that is that to break even on a bowl call spread you just need to add the strike price of a thousand fifty dollars plus the amount that you're paying which was thirty six dollars so 36 plus 10.50 is 10.86 so rather than needing the stock to go all the way to 1296 you can actually 2.8x your money with a stock only going to 1086 to start seeing money now you will see your full profit of 2.8x at 11.50 but in between you can see right here how you will start to make money you'll start to see some really good profits for example two thousand dollars three thousand dollars and you'll actually roughly double your money around eleven twenty three dollars per share now scrolling down right here your maximum loss is what you're paying for the option so roughly three thousand six hundred dollars but your max profit is 6400 or in other words you can also take the difference 1150 minus 1050 which is 100 so you can turn 36 into 100 but obviously your minimum bet size is going to be 3 600 but still turning three thousand six hundred dollars into ten thousand dollars is a huge gain i mean you would significantly outperform the market and all you really need tesla to do is rise above 1085 per share which is only 50 from the current strike price so for me this is a no-brainer trade i could be wrong but if i literally had to bet my entire net worth on this trade i would do it because i don't see any better opportunities in the market now obviously don't bet your entire net worth practice risk management i put 36 000 into this trade which doesn't seem like a lot in comparison to my portfolio however it is a lot because i already have 1.4 million dollars worth of collateral on tesla because i've sold so many tesla puts at 1 000 per share,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,g0zybWQj5Gc,2022-01-19T15:24:16Z,5X Your Money with Palantir Undervalued Option Trades,Palantir,i really want to discuss the true value of pounds here where it's headed and look at the options together there's an opportunity in the options market on paluter that has a good return and is safer than the stock yes i said safer i'll prove it shortly let's analyze palantir's fundamentals first and then look at the options now there was some quack on the internet who called palantir a five dollar stock i'm going to completely refute that argument palantir along with the broader disruptive tech sector has taken a beating lately but the fundamentals in the market don't really make much sense let me explain palantir stock has still delivered market crushing returns since its ipo beating the s p 500 the nasdaq and arc invest flagship etf rk the stock has had bad performance lately and all of a sudden all the bears just want to jump in and you can see that the stock is continuing to sell off i'm going to do the complete opposite and show you why i'm a contrarian on palantir and why i expect to make a lot more money than the bears out there i think things are about to get wild in a good way and i have three reasons why i believe palantir is a good long-term stock and i'm going to show you the specific options a couple different option strategies that are easy money for pounds here number one international expansion u.s commercial revenue surged by a hundred and three percent year over year in q3 the international business is struggling to grow meaningfully despite accounting for about 50 percent of the company's revenue this is placing a heavy drag on the company's headline numbers which is making wall street feel this tingly feeling in their stomach and making them all upset in the short term alex carp recently made a special happy new year video addressing the nation of japan and one of its main clients in the country in a likely effort to win more business from the country alex carp is really thinking about the international market now management has also mentioned the international commercial revenue is accelerating essentially palantir has a call option on the international market as growth continues abroad second reason you need to know is palantir is so popular on social media and that's because the smart people get that it has a wide moat when trying to win contracts with government agencies it is absolutely essential that you have key relationships in place where decisions are made and budget funds are allocated it is also essential that you have a reputation for successful execution i'm not worried about palantir's stock price as long as they continue building relationships palantir has already been doing business with the us government for nearly two decades and has built up significant credibility for its ability to deliver trustworthy and effective products consistently now the third and last thing the total addressable market for palantir is already estimated to be at least 120 billion dollars the company is estimated to generate only 1.5 billion in revenue in 2021. now guys doing the math we have almost a 100 x opportunity of course if palantir took over the whole market but even if it took over 10 that's a 12 billion dollar revenue figure analysts expect palantir to reach about 2 billion in 2022 the size of the opportunity is most important in picking a long-term going stock that's what i'm looking at that's what wall street told me that's what my experience and background on goldman sachs and a couple different hedge funds has taught me but honestly you don't have to be a genius to realize that right i'm looking at talent here as the latter even if they execute half effort they should win in the decade because the opportunity is huge now the biggest risk for shares of balance here as i see it is continual selling pressure that is a result of profound misunderstanding related to how the firm's business model works in practice but this wouldn't be the company's fault it's more so uneducated investors and the fearful uncertain ones as well as hedge funds that want just quick money and they're not ready to be patient with that being said let's share my screen i'm going to look at the technical chart real quick and then i'm going to go over into the option chain now taking a look at pounds here i mean this stock was over 22 dollars per share right around 23 dollars per share in the middle of november and since then it has only gone down i mean one leg down a second level of selling then continue just to drop and drop and drop more to the current level of 15 per share but at this level i feel like things are just too cheap to ignore the rsi is 26. yes if you look at the bollinger band the bollinger band has expanded because palantir is doing unprecedented things i mean this stock has fallen to levels that even if i clicked the two-year chart i mean palantir wasn't at this level since back in november of 2020. so basically you're getting a huge discount for the past 13 months now another thing that you'll notice here when i zoom out to the two years the bollinger band is showing that palantir can fall to around 12 per share but the upside is 35 because it's currently way under the moving average it's very low on the rsi so in my opinion the risk reward makes absolutely no sense if you're a bull this is the time to get in on this stock i mean obviously i'm not a financial advisor this isn't financial advice you shouldn't follow exactly what i'm saying but when i take a look at things my intuition is usually right again the market can be crazy so my intuition could be wrong but you know let me show you guys some option trades that i'm going to be opening up on palantir all right so here's the options i'm going to take a look at a few different things well first of all let's just go out into an expiration date that's going out for next week so january 28th going to expand the options and just take a look at you know what the statistics are the greeks the volatility the volume the open interest so looking at the volume 1700 that's a nice healthy amount that means so many people are trading palantir on a regular basis and open interest is currently 1083. so what that actually tells me is a lot of people are starting to get in on valencia right now the open interest is a thousand but today 1 700 contracts were traded for the 16 call that means a lot of people are actually becoming very bullish because the volume is so high for the call option in relation to its history there's a few ways to take advantage of this the first way to take advantage of this if you're a long-term bull for me i'm a long-term bullet pounder just like i am for neo for tesla and many other stocks that i have in my portfolio palantir is another position that i want to add into i think it makes a lot of sense over the next decade so looking at cell put option i'm taking a look at the 15 strike now going out for february 18th which is about 30 days from today the implied volatility is actually 71. it's even higher the volume is very healthy the delta is high i'm not going to lie i like to go for deltas around 30 maybe 25 that is the sweet spot 25 to 35. this is a 43 delta it's very close to the money however look at the premium the premium is 115 what this means is for the 15 strike i'm obligating myself if i sell this put option to buy palantir at 15 but because of the huge premium my break even price would actually only be 13.84 that's because i'm collecting 116 on the premium for selling the 15 put now if i take a look right here the bottom of the bolinger band is literally 12.18 so buying the stock at around 13.85 would be a very good deal if i view pounds here as a 20 25 and 30 stock in the next 12 24 and 36 months i'm looking for palantir to potentially double to about 30 over the next three years so that's strategy number one selling a put option at the 15 strike you buy 100 shares of pounds here cost you 1 500 and then sell monthly covered call options at the 16 strike collecting 90 a month,1.0,0.9

Invest with Henry,BIv8zCwprAI,2022-01-12T16:21:32Z,5X Your Money With This Small Account Options Strategies,Bed Bath & Beyond,this trade on bbbyy triple b y bed bath and beyond this trade is going to have the potential to turn three dollars into 50 very small account trade someone with 20 dollars in their pocket could make obviously you want to manage the risk on the trade i'm going to show you but i think that you can do this on a number of different stocks let's take a look at the technical analysis first and why i'm choosing bed bath and beyond so taking a look at the technical chart right here i'm going to the six month chart and if you guys notice here this stock has pulled back tremendously and it has bottomed out in this period from october 5th all the way until the end of october so during this entire month this stock has stood still essentially right at 14 per share and then bed bath and beyond rose up to 23 followed by a pattern of a decline again and if you notice right here we're sitting right at the bottom of the bollinger band but this stock has honestly not had much movement for the past month and 10 days since december 1st this stock has been trending lower it has gone down to 13 dollars per share but it has done so in a very predictable way and currently 13 per share is this hollow point right here where the stock had a complete bottom out and did absolutely nothing so i have a big feeling that bed bath and beyond can have this similar pattern right now and repeat this same process so the strategy that i'm going to show you you don't have to do it on bed bath and beyond although i'm going to do an example on it you can do this on any stock that looks like it has a predictable pattern where it had a previous stall the stock might have went up it might have went down and then it continues to stall and consolidate going sideways strategy i'm going to show you really takes advantage of any stock that is not moving that much so keeping in mind the current stock price is 13 per share this is going to be very important for picking the strike price that we're going to sell an option so i'm gonna go to trade bed bath and beyond options and currently it's january 10th i'm going to go one month out you can do this strategy going one week out you can go for two weeks out or up to one month like i'm going to do right now it really just depends on the different option that you're looking at however 30 days is a very good time period for me but oftentimes i do see students being very successful with going much shorter so the first thing that you want to do to open up this position is you want to click sell call option now the call option the first one that we're going to sell this is going to be your max profit strike so for example going back to bed bath and beyond i am looking at the stock and it's currently sitting at 13 per share sure we have had a big downtrend but i believe this stock is basically going to just start trading sideways i mean literally just sideways between maybe 12.75 up to maybe 13.25 i think we're going to have a very tight range of trading therefore i'm going to pick the 13 strike because that's the current price of bed bath and beyond because the stock is currently at you know 1298 i'm going to go ahead sell this 13 call option,1.0,0.4
Invest with Henry,BIv8zCwprAI,2022-01-12T16:21:32Z,5X Your Money With This Small Account Options Strategies,Amazon,it's the same strategy but it's a complete anomaly when i take a look at amazon stock so taking a look at amazon i think amazon's another stock that does trade a lot sideways so i took a look at the same trade on amazon and things really didn't make sense it almost seems like you can make unlimited profit let me show you what i mean by that if you do sell call option i'm going to sell the 3240 strike right here i'm gonna sell this call option and again same process i'm going to buy the strike below and i'm also going to scroll up and buy the strike above so buying the 32 30 and buying the 3250 while selling the 30 to 40. the only thing that you need to do now is go back to the drop down arrow go to custom set a unique ratio and again we're going to sell equal amounts of call options as we're buying call options so i'm going to end up selling two call options and you know buying two call options as well now if you'll notice this this is pretty crazy guys take a look at the chart there is no red area it's just green literally your max profit is a thousand eight dollars and you don't actually have any max loss so this position right here is something called arbitrage it's where you have a free lunch so this right here is called arbitrage it's where you actually get paid for finding an opportunity this right here is showing a max profit of one thousand eight dollars however the max loss is non-existent because you're actually collecting a credit of eight dollars and if amazon ends up being right at 3 hundred and forty dollars you'll end up actually making a thousand dollars now of course you can make amounts in between if amazon ends up losing a little bit lower or a little bit higher you can make something between eight dollars and a thousand and eight dollars now quickly why i wanted to show you this trade because it's very interesting but i also know a lot of people are gonna say wait wait a second why doesn't everyone just do this if this literally has no risk and only upside then wouldn't everyone just take this position themselves well actually something that is not being calculated but i think is a really good lesson and you guys should look into doing these trades on different types of stocks is that robinhood isn't really accounting for the bid ask spread so the bid ask spread here is very very wide so when you actually end up trying to open this trade most likely you are not going to be able to collect eight dollars in fact you may even have to pay a little bit of money it just depends on the bid ask spread because it's so wide you may not get filled for the eight dollar credit in fact most likely you're going to be charged a little bit of money however it's not bad to look at these trades because some of these trades could actually be very close to a zero cost however it's unlikely to happen because option market makers and other traders are aware of arbitrage opportunity and they're usually not commonly found in the market but it's super interesting because i do bet that you can find positions that are like two or three dollars but give you even more reward than the 50 that i just showed you on triple b why,1.0,0.3
Invest with Henry,BIv8zCwprAI,2022-01-12T16:21:32Z,5X Your Money With This Small Account Options Strategies,Chipotle,now taking a look at the chipotle chart i think we're in a very interesting position for this company because specifically there's a lot of inflation going on right now restaurant stocks are not doing too well and many of them are selling off for example over the past six months chipotle has been very predictable and has had very consistent trading volume i mean this stock has basically stayed right around 1800 per share you can see right here that the moving average has sustained since october right around 1800 before it started falling down to 1722. this stock has only recently pulled back below its moving average quite significantly so for me i believe this is a buying opportunity despite them raising their prices i mean last time i visited home in philadelphia in the us i was obsessed with chipotle i pretty much went every single day and i love the food i think so many other people feel the same way and that this stock has sold off but i don't think it's warranted so what i believe with the second strategy that i'm gonna show you is that chipotle has a significant potential to pull back up to about seventeen hundred dollars per share now this might not seem a lot however with options in the bull call spread you can potentially 2x 3x or even more using this strategy on a stock that doesn't even have that much volatility that's the beauty of it especially with something like chipotle we're going to take a look at the options right now i'm going to show you what i mean so what i'm going to do because i do need some time for my thesis to play out i do want to go out about 60 days from today's expiration so i'm gonna pick march 18th of course if you're watching this in the future just pick a 60-day option on the stock that you think that this is going to be a good strategy on now for chipotle it was a 1700 stock at the end of the year and in just 10 days it has pulled down about a hundred dollars so given three months this is ample time this is more than enough time for the stock to recover back to 1700 in fact it can happen way faster but just to be safe i am going to still pick the march 18th date however i can probably pick the february 18th date as well but we're just gonna go for march just to be super safe now chipotle is currently trading for 1 525 so with the bull call spread what you want to do is you want to buy a call option that is at the money or near the money if you're very bullish on a stock so what that's going to look like i'm going to purchase the 1530 strike right here and if you'll notice buying this call option is super expensive i mean ridiculously expensive and not everyone wants to go ahead and spend at 9 730 so what the bulk haul spread does is greatly decrease the total cost that you have to put up for the trade and it also still has a lot of benefits so i'm going to click sell call option and now i'm going to sell a call option that is a little bit more out of the money so i bought the 1530 i can sell the 1535 the 1540 that's going to be a thousand dollar spread however i want to make a 2 000 spread however because i think this stock can be 1700 i want to go a lot higher and in fact just to be even more conservative i'm only going to sell the 1600 call so now that i have clicked sell the 1600 call what you guys will notice right now is i've opened up a call debit spread or a bull call spread both of them are the same thing all right so if you'll notice right here the total cost has gone down to only 33 rather than the 97 so you basically have a discount of two thirds off the price rather than paying nearly ten thousand dollars the total cost is only three thousand three hundred and your total reward is going to be seven thousand dollars here however what i actually want to do to make the math even easier because i'm opening up a 15 30 call option i want to sell this 16 30 call option so the math is even easier so here you can see that the total spread here is going to be ten 10 000 however your total cost is only going to be 4 475 dollars so this position right here can turn 4 475 into 10 000 or slightly more than a 2x return in just a couple of months,1.0,0.8

Invest with Henry,BIv8zCwprAI,2022-01-12T16:21:32Z,5X Your Money With This Small Account Options Strategies,Alibaba,the stock that i want to analyze is alibaba ticker symbol b-a-b-a the reason why i'm looking at alibaba is because this stock was a 200 stock however a lot of stuff happened in china people are scared of the stock right now people have sold off i don't necessarily recommend holding a lot of shares you're going to be tying up a lot of capital so instead i want to recommend a poor man's covered call on a stock that you don't want to invest a lot of capital into but you want to have exposure into so alibaba has seen a huge sell-off however the stock didn't really go below 107 dollars per share and currently i think there's a very strong support at around 110 this stock is currently trading for 128 dollars and 30 cents and i think a poor man's covered call is an interesting strategy to at least consider on baba or another stock that has had a tremendous sell-off but is too risky for you to dump a lot of capital into so taking a look at the baba option chain what i'm going to do because a poor man's covered call instead of buying shares you're buying a leap option so i'm going to go out for january 20 2023 and now i'm going to buy a leap option that is near the money now textbook delta for a leap option when you're doing a poor man's covered call is going to be about a 0.9 or a 0.8 delta however something that i do is i go a little bit riskier so i usually go for about a point eight delta or sometimes even a .75 delta because i believe it's just as good i mean no other person really shows data or the actual trade over many many years and that research is really hard and expensive to get your hands on it's usually big institutions however if i was going to make a bet honestly a 0.8 delta is going to perform just as well or even better in terms of return than a 0.9 delta so what i'm going to do right now on this trade is i'm going to go ahead and buy the 90 strike option for 4983 so rather than buying straight up shares which will cost you twelve thousand dollars you get more than a fifty percent discount now what i'm going to do is i'm going to click sell call option and with a poor man's covered call you can sell weekly options you can sell monthly options you can now treat this as a covered call position without having to have 100 shares of the stock so now you can go ahead and sell the 140 call option right here and now you can start collecting monthly income the poor man's covered call is a fantastic strategy to have in your portfolio but there is a lot of nuances and things that you have to know,1.0,0.2
Invest with Henry,2UENOFch8NQ,2022-01-09T16:43:01Z,I Bought $1.3 Million in Tesla Options,Tesla,well how's it going investor fam 2022 a year of volatility inflation rising rates hopefully still tons of gains and uncle henry is buying 1.3 million dollars worth of tesla options i'll get to that in just a second i've got an interesting stance on tesla and i'm bullish despite elon musk selling a lot of shares check this out shares in his company worth about a billion dollars calls his broker yeah on a selling spree since uh early november partly to pay his looming tax bills on his stock option speaking of those options he exercised another 1.6 million at a strike price of six dollars and 24 cents elon sold 15.7 million shares of tesla while buying exercising 22.9 million more shares ending up with more than 7 million more shares than he has started with so why is everyone panicking for everyone panicking the big picture is looking better than ever but they just don't realize it which is really weird elon only sold due to taxes i expect 1.9 million to 2 million deliveries just this year so when we go over technical analysis you're going to understand what my fundamental analysis outlook for tesla is they increase production capacity by almost 70 000 this quarter that should increase the first quarter as well since production at berlin and austin will come online in the first quarter which would put them at a run rate of about 400 000 cars per quarter 400 000 vehicles times four quarters is 1.6 million without considering austin berlin and shanghai's continued ramp up after the first quarter so i'm super bullish on tesla and want to show you how i'm playing it with options and why i have such a big position in the stock in fact my optimism is high even though the stock has recently seen a huge rise on the first day of 2022 trading year and remains above 1 000 despite a recent pullback after that first trading day so is tesla a buy well let's look at the facts tesla model 3 was uk's second most popular new car in 2021. elon musk says tesla will raise price of full self-driving driver assistance to twelve thousand dollars that's a huge sign of confidence tesla reported blockbuster fourth quarter delivery volumes of three hundred eight thousand six hundred vehicles surpassing bull case consensus estimate of 290 000 vehicles lastly even in my bare case scenario i ran a valuation model and i'm targeting 1 300 per share at worst so with that being said let's jump into my screen and take a look under the hood all right guys so currently i already have a large position on tesla i currently have 520 shares it currently compromised 100 my portfolio however that's incorrect for some reason robin hood is saying it's 100 my portfolio despite you know obviously that not being the full amount to my portfolio if you're a regular viewer of the channel i'm up a really good amount my average cost is under 600 even after i've been buying tesla above 800 900 and even a thousand dollars per share because i've been in this position very early on and i had a lot of conviction on this play since basically the end of 2019. now scrolling down i want to show you my five different option strategies and as you will notice here the current cash collateral is 1.29 million dollars so very heavy into tesla i'm gonna go over more on the technical analysis in just a second on why i have so much conviction in this play but essentially a couple of strategies that i'm running i mean the main current strategy that is taking most of this cash collateral is going to be these 12 puts that i sold at 1 000 now i do have a put credit spread i'm gonna have a put credit spread video link for you guys in the description put credit spreads are fantastic in fact i'm gonna quickly show you this position right here i'm up 11 690 this was a position i only had to put 18 000 into made eleven thousand dollars on that eighteen thousand dollars so about a sixty three percent return in the past six months i did have this trade in the discord so you know if you wanna follow along with my trades then make sure to check out the discord link in the description now i'm specifically going to focus on this 1 000 put option so what i'm doing here is i'm selling put options and i'm looking for an optimal entry into the stock why buy a stock for the current price where you can literally get paid to buy a stock for a lower price guys selling put options is literally a cheat code there are basically two reasons to sell put option contracts to generate income or to acquire shares of a stock at a discount to the current market price being paid to ensure someone else's stock so you're being paid to insure someone else's stock because if you're selling it but well who the heck is buying that put well the person or the hedge fund or the mutual fund or whoever it may be is buying a put option to hedge their portfolio they may have a large tesla position so they're buying put options for protection however you're there selling it and getting stupid rich you're being paid to insure someone else's stock when you're selling a put option and you're also being paid for offering to buy someone else's stock for lower than the current market value so while they're panicking and they're afraid hey tesla might fall you're there with the kahunas you're there ready to purchase that stock i really like the insurance analogy because the insurance industry is super profitable now selling puts is basically like selling insurance someone is buying insurance to secure tesla stock at 1 000 per share so if tesla goes down to 900 they're securing themselves that they're gonna get at least one thousand dollars however we here on the channel are bulls on tesla right or even if you're not a bull you can run this strategy on anything else but essentially when you sell a put option pick a strike where you'd be happy to purchase the stock so at the very worst you purchase a stock that you want to buy anyways and at best nothing happens you just get paid to sell a put and the stock doesn't even go down to your strike price and actually guys i don't know if you know this but selling puts is a secret way that warren buffett got rich and he did that with geico warren buffett got very rich with the geico money he pulled in through premiums just like i'm about to teach you when i open up my history shortly you're going to see how much premium you can collect off of tesla or even another stock like say palantir or neo or any other stock that you wish now quickly i'm going to run through the technical analysis because you need to understand why i picked the 1000 dollar strike level because picking a strike is very important when you're selling put options you don't want to sell a put option on a strike that's just too close to the money and then you end up buying a stock for a price that you don't want you need to determine the strike price that you want and you need to use technical analysis to do that now taking a look at the tesla stock chart okay i have a couple different indicators here in fact i'm going to talk about three different ones their first one is moving average now obviously tesla is a huge momentum stock i mean this thing was around 700 just in september now in the past three months it went from seven hundred fifty dollars to over one thousand dollars now at these levels at the twelve hundred dollar level i actually ended up selling covered calls and i got out of my position at around eleven hundred dollars looking back that ended up being a really good decision although it was some taxes i didn't fully do it on purpose because that covered call got executed on a friday it ended up being a really good decision and i was pretty spot on with exiting tesla at a good price however looking at the market i'm still really bullish on tesla i don't really have a better opportunity for a stock that i want to invest in so i'm looking to get back into tesla however in the past couple of days tesla was trading over 1 100 per share and i felt a little dumb buying it for higher than i sold it for so rather than doing that i ended up selling put options as you guys know and i had to pick a strike price so here's how i determined what strike price to sell the puts for tesla and this is very duplicatable you can copy this similar strategy on how i use technical analysis on tesla and you can apply it to any stock that you wish looking at tesla we had a very big spike up here i mean we basically touched 1200 per share as a close on january 3rd however i wasn't convinced i didn't want to buy it because right here as you guys can see the bollinger band top by the way this is a bollinger band it tells you where a stock is likely to trade within this is an indicator that i use all the time for trading options linger bands are fantastic for understanding when to potentially exit a stock or when to potentially get into a stock for example right here we were getting really close to the bottom of the bollinger band and these levels right here all proved that they were pretty good levels and right here since we were at the top of the bollinger band we also kind of had an idea that tesla was becoming pretty expensive for that time in early november so currently taking a look at the bollinger band we're sitting right in between which means that it's not currently a good time to buy or sell tesla it's right around where it should be for the present moment it's currently trading for roughly fair value in the short term on the technical chart now this doesn't mean that tesla's not going to grow into the future because obviously i think the stock can be a two thousand dollar stock in the next couple of years and also my bare case scenario is one thousand three hundred dollars by the end of 2022 so about a 25 to 30 return potential still for tesla which is an amazing return but taking a look at the bollinger band we're right in the middle so i don't expect a huge move higher nor do i expect tesla to move a lot lower now the other indicator i was discussing is the moving average so if i scroll in and actually zoom into that three-month chart you're going to see that currently the moving average is about 1073 dollars now tesla is currently sitting at 1026 and it currently has gone lower than the moving average so for me this is a bearish sign in the short term however in the long term this is fantastic because what most people paid and this is what moving average really is it tells you where the stock has traded for the past you know i put 50 days you can put 30 60 or 90 days so on average in the past 50 days you're getting a better price than everyone else paid in the past 50 days for my current screen so i'm pretty excited about that because i'm getting a better value than other investors everything is fairly relative so tesla is under the moving average of 1073 and it's right at the bollinger band now the third metric that i do look at is the rsi for the rsi i want to see a stock that is not overheated so for example this is another reason why i sold tesla stock it was overheating it was basically too hot it was on fire it was above 80 rsi back in late october slash early november so for me it was a clear sign to get out of the stock because it has become too hot for its own good i mean where else can the stock go when the rsi is above 80. i mean yes tesla can go up to 90 rsi but i don't want to play the game of buying an expensive stock and hoping that it gets more expensive and again i'm pretty much the biggest bull ever on tesla but still i recognize in the short term when a stock is approaching a potential peak so because the rsi is currently sitting at 47 i'm more than happy to start jumping into tesla again because i believe for a number of reasons that it's fairly valued and in the long term it's obviously at a huge discount so for me i decided to go for something really easy and a really nice round number of one thousand dollars per share this is also about a ten percent discount from where i sold tesla at one thousand one hundred dollars per share as well as collecting premium of the previous covered call i sold now i sold the 1 000 put option i want to jump back into my screen because i want to tell you guys exactly how much i collected on selling this 1 000 put now something that you guys are going to notice here is that i'm down currently 45 540 on this position however i don't view this as a loss because i'm looking to purchase shares of tesla i don't care if the option position says that i'm down 45 540 because this would only be true if i was just looking at the put option as a standalone position if i was looking just to sell a put and then close a put for a profit then yes this would be a loss however that's not what i do when i sell puts when i sell puts again when i sell puts i'm looking to get into a stock for a lower price and get paid some handsome i mean super handsome premium ford i'm gonna show you how much i collected total on this position so as you guys see my current tesla break even price is actually going to be 961. now why i sold the 1000 puts well the reason why this says 961 is although i sold the 1 000 put i've collected about 39 per contract which means that my actual break-even price accounting for the premium that i have collected is 961 dollars now taking a look at my history this is what i did on january 3rd yes i slightly traded tesla when it was at its peak nearly back at hundred dollars per share i ended up selling puts however check out how advantageous it is to sell puts although i sold puts on a pretty bad day on january first the first trading day of the year when tesla was about twelve hundred dollars per share and now it currently sits at one thousand and twenty seven dollars per share it's literally pulled back about fifteen percent okay literally a fifteen percent pullback and i'm still not in the money which means that tesla's currently still above my strike price tesla's sitting at one thousand twenty seven dollars but i have to purchase tesla at one thousand dollars per share so even though i picked a bad time to sell puts i still got paid a lot of money and i'm currently still sitting very pretty although it says i'm down money i'm actually not down money for two reasons one i'm ready to buy the stock and two i'm actually still out of the money so technically in the next few weeks as we approach february 18th if tesla just stands still if it just doesn't move at all then this option will actually gain 91 920 it will completely decay due to theta as long as it stays out of the money so now going over into the premiums i ended up collecting 39 500 off selling 10 contracts and then i actually added two more contracts for six thousand eight hundred and eighty dollars so combining six thousand eight hundred eighty and thirty nine and a half i made roughly seven thousand dollars just for doing a one and a half month option or basically over six weeks i'm collecting forty seven thousand dollars which is roughly eight thousand dollars a week now obviously you don't need a large portfolio to do this i do have a large portfolio but you can duplicate the same strategy and make consistent weekly income by selling puts on a number of different stocks selling puts is one of my favorite strategies and this is what i do all the time every single week in my private discord community so if you're interested make sure you check out the link in the description and also if you want to master selling puts check out this video right

Invest with Henry,wN-lKG8Y7A8,2022-01-04T23:39:42Z,Top 3 Metaverse Stock Options to Buy LEAP Options 🤯,Meta,First one is meta this one is interesting because it sits under one trillion dollar evaluation the stocks 52-week high was 384 dollars per share that's a 12 discount from its peak with options because they naturally have leverage baked in that could be 24 to 36 returns on a safe stock i believe more money will pour into the fang stocks and big technology companies but also i'm just straight up feeling bullish on meta i'll give you a brief analysis and jump into exact options that i would pick with metas price to earnings ratio of 24 you think that the market largely expects the tech company's earnings to grow slowly in the coming years but this is really far from the truth and reality on average analysts expect meta's earnings per share to grow at an average annualized rate of more than 21 over the next five years quarterly revenue year over year increased by 35 percent management guided for fourth quarter revenue to grow as much as 21 to year over while the midpoint of the social network specialist fourth quarter revenue guidance calls for 17 top line growth management's revenue guidance has historically proven to be very conservative so the 21 growth modeled at the high end the management range will likely be closer to the actual results not only should meta's revenue and earnings grow nicely in 2022 and beyond but the company also has significant momentum in its user base total unique daily active users across the company's apps total 2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2021 up 11 year over year with such an engaged user base you can bet your socks i mean you can bet your cash that facebook is hard at work finding so many ways to monetize this large activity and the increase in activity including improving advertising products and enabling more ecommerce features now let's jump into my screen and take a look at what short and long term options i'm looking at for meta all right so before we take a look at the options i want to show you the technical analysis this is very important in terms of picking the correct strike prices so looking at meta this stock was trading at around 375 dollars back on september the second now the stock did have a bit of a breakdown in terms of its fundamentals and it's basically double bottomed at 312 dollars per share and then again around three hundred and six dollars per share so we have tremendous support at around three hundred and ten dollars per share and currently the stock is consolidating around 338 dollars per share but it's only going to take one good earnings release for this stock to pop back up higher and i believe that this stock can break through this bollinger band right here back to around 360 dollars per share and potentially even 377 dollars per share in two quarters and of course before 2023 this stock can obviously even go up to a potential 400 per share however we're just going to assume that this stock is going to reach 370 per share and we're gonna see how we can make money off that and what strike and date to pick so also i mentioned that 310 is the support level that is the reason why on december 2nd i ended up selling a 310 put in the discord community for 3175 dollars and then i closed the trade for 565 dollars making two and a half thousand dollars in about three weeks time in the private discord it's just an example i wanted to show you because i love sharing my receipts with you if you do want to check out the discord community it's always the first link in the description for the application all right so now i have opened up the options again we're shooting for around 370 as the peak price for facebook by the end of 2023 or really i should say meta still getting used to that however a 340 strike is still going to be profitable if facebook can go above 384.78 and in the case that it goes to 400 you can make 15 per share on an investment of 44 or essentially that's going to be about a 33 return so although the stock is only going to move 14 you're going to make about 33 on this option that's because 400 minus three hundred forty dollars is going to be about sixty dollars in total money that you can make however you're paying forty four dollars so 60 divided by 44. so if i'm doing the math in my head correctly it's going to be between 33 to 36 that's a 2.5 x on your money now something i do want to say although this is a leap video i do want to show you quickly what a bull call spread is because looking at facebook stock i think this is a really good opportunity for a bull call spread what you want to do if you want to open up a bull call spread which takes even less premium than a leap option is you want to buy a call option that is right outside of the money which for this is going to be the 335 call and then i'm going to sell a call option right above the strike that i'm picking so i'm buying the 335 all i'm hoping for is that this stock goes per share and then i'm going to close off and sell the 340 dollar strike right here and my total cost will only be 295 now my total return here is going to be the difference in strikes which is going to be five dollars or 500 so i'm risking 243 to make 257 so basically you can double your money here you can 2x your money as long as facebook stock goes beyond or even ends at 340 by january 20 2023 so basically you have your 2x strategy plan right there for facebook using bull call spreads or you have about a 35 return using leap options hope you didn't mind i taught you something extra let's continue on with the video,1.0,0.9
Invest with Henry,wN-lKG8Y7A8,2022-01-04T23:39:42Z,Top 3 Metaverse Stock Options to Buy LEAP Options 🤯,Nvidia,the second metaverse stock i have that will make you stupid rich in 2022 and i mean i seriously feel this way given this stock's history it's a surefire leap is nvidia again i'm not a financial advisor i'm just an ex goldman sachs bro with the finance degree but looking at the history it looks like a momentum roller coaster that's just going up and it's never plans to really go down nvidia is up one thousand percent over five years i remember the stock in the mid teens when i was in college and presenting nvidia as an investment idea during my hedge fund interviews the growth in nvidia has surpassed anything that i imagined and is supported by a few major growth trends including the metaverse nvidia's graphic processing units or gpus are the undisputed industry standard for generating life like images in video games giving it a huge leg up in the metaverse because the metaverse is going to need graphics even if the metaverse takes years to materialize nvidia continues to grow like gangbusters during the first nine months of 2021 nvidia's revenue climbed 65 year-over-year driving its earnings per share up by 132 nvidia generated revenue of roughly 16.7 billion dollars last year but that's not even much compared to its total addressable market or tam which management estimates will top 250 billion dollars by 2023 essentially this year so given nvidia could deliver 65 returns top line let's take a look at some options in 2022 or even early 2023 to create an actual leap option for us to make some money all right so we're gonna take a look at nvidia stock and specifically again i have picked a very good time to look at nvidia stock because currently it's down 4.78 on the day it's been hovering at the 300 per share mark for a very very long time now this is a huge momentum play so taking a look at the one-year chart makes less sense because obviously the stock has traded for well below 200 per share so what i'm going to do is click the three month chart and take a look specifically what has happened for the last 90 days now if you'll notice the moving average right here is around 296 dollars per share and nvidia has just crossed below the moving average now it's also in the middle of the bollinger band so this is a company that i think has tremendous support especially around these levels now i do believe due to potential really good growth and potential good earnings that this stock can reach back above 333 dollars per share and potentially even around these levels of 350 dollars per share so that's around the strike in the level that i'm going to look at for the january 2023 call options now the stock is down a lot it's down almost five percent now which means it's a really good time to run this strategy now in my private group again i did sell a lot of different spreads for example we have made two thousand four hundred dollars selling call credit spreads back when nvidia was peaking now nvidia has sold off a lot so i have changed my mind and rather than selling call credit spreads i am more bullish on the company and i'm going to look into buying some leap options so again we're going to pick the january 20 2023 leap option this is going to give us one full year to hold the stock which will give you four straight quarters of earnings which is fantastic given that nvidia has high growth and has a lot of potential to move so again i believe that the stock can peak past 350 dollars per share but of course the stock can also go to 400 per share but let's just take a good center point of roughly 370 dollars per share given 370 dollars per share all of these options right here are going to be attractive because they're at the money options and they all have a break-even price of less than 370 dollars per share for example an at the money option for this 285 dollar strike right now has a break-even price of 340 or in other words if nvidia stock were to go to 370 dollars per share this option right here would have a total gain of 85 given the premium of 55 is going to be a 55 return that means nvidia actually has more premium than the facebook example i had with leap options however i also want to go through a bull call example with you as well to take a look at exactly how much money you can make using a bull call spread so again what i'm going to do is i'm going to buy the 285 dollar call option and now i'm going to sell the next leg up however the next leg up is going to be a 250 spread i tend to like to stick to 500 spreads because it's more scalable for my larger portfolio however if you have a smaller portfolio a 250 spread is just fine as well but i'm going to pick the 290 dollar call option to sell now you'll see that the total cost is two dollars but the total return is going to be five dollars so we have a potential to two and a half times our money depending on the cost right here so you have seen that the cost just jumped to 245 in fact now it's 177. so it really depends on the price that you pay however this opportunity right here is actually presenting roughly 250 return on your money so this is a 2.5 x potential position,1.0,0.95
Invest with Henry,wN-lKG8Y7A8,2022-01-04T23:39:42Z,Top 3 Metaverse Stock Options to Buy LEAP Options 🤯,Unity Software,the third stock that i have is unity software now unity is a very interesting name and it's a very interesting stock that i'm going to show you some options on while it may not be a household name the unity software is well known among the gaming and developer communities it has a market cap of 40 billion dollars this company has potential to be worth 100 billion in the next couple of years in 2022 though i believe it can see a 30 pop in its stock price at the very least that makes call options very attractive on this company the company provided a set of software tools that help developers create run and monetize interactive real-time 2d and 3d content for mobile phones tablets ccs and consoles as well as ar and vr devices these tools will create the real-time graphics underlying the metaverse but unity software doesn't need the metaverse to be successful as evidenced by its third quarter results but the metaverse exposure is icing on the cake whether the metaverse takes a year or a decade to spring to life unity software is prospering either way and it's set up in a really good position the company generated revenue of 286 million dollars up 43 year over year at the same time unity delivered a loss per share of 41 cents cutting its loss by more than half not only did the company beat expectations but it raised its full year outlook unity is now expecting revenue of about 1.08 billion dollars up roughly 40 at the midpoint of its guidance so you already know we have to take a look at the options and look at specific calls that we can buy to make some money now unity software is another stock that has a tremendous pullback today it's down eight percent on the day and in the past three months this stock is actually sitting pretty flat now unity software has a lot of volatility it also has a lot of potential as a smaller company with higher implied volatility this stock has the potential to really rise to the moon unlike nvidia and meta which also have opportunity to rise in the moon unity software has more opportunity since it's a smaller company and it's easier for a small company to rise fast in terms of market cap so i believe the price for unity in a good case scenario in 2022 can be two hundred and fifty dollars per share so now we're gonna go to trade unity options i'm gonna go to january 20 2023 just like i did for facebook and nvidia now taking a look at the options they look very very attractive unity has fantastic options and very good implied volatility in fact looking at the implied volatility it's about 55 for context one of the highest implied volatility stocks tesla has just over 60 implied volatility so unity is competing with tesla like implied volatility which means that the premiums are really high now that's not necessarily a good thing if you're an option buyer however it doesn't really matter because unity stock has so much potential that it more than counts for the higher implied volatility and higher premiums that you're going to be paying so for unity something that i'm actually going to recommend is going a little bit farther out of the money now this is a little bit riskier because you do need the stock to rise a lot more for example 33 just to break even however you have so much more upside and so much less capital that you have to put up front for example here only two thousand dollars to control one hundred shares of unity which would cost you twelve thousand seven hundred dollars now in this example the break even price is a hundred seventy dollars per share if unity were to even go to two hundred dollars per share you would have a fifty dollar gain on a twenty dollar investment or a two and a half times return again similar to nvidia now if unity stock were to go to two hundred and fifty dollars per share you would have a total gain of 100 on a 20 investment or essentially you can five extra money so unity presents one of the best opportunities but also it does have more risk than the other two stocks that i mentioned if you do want to follow along with my trades make sure that you sign up for the first application link below i'm super excited for 2022 make sure you don't stop watching the channel because i have so many more free videos that you can watch by clicking the playlist or watching this video right here,1.0,0.85
