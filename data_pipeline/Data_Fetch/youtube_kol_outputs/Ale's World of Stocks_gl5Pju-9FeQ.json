    "excerpt": "this month I'm going with what was actually my newest addition into my own portfolio recently and that is a Reit known as vich properties SEC symbol Vici which by the way it also W our poll on Discord so I added it to our community portfolio as well but yeah this one to me looks very solid long term and there's really three primary reasons why I like this stock so much number one the strength of the business because not only is this an absolute leader in real estate but it's in a specific area of real estate that I just feel is more strongly insulated from an evolving market and that's in high quality gaming and Entertainment Properties where V's portfolio currently holds much of the Vegas Strip including MGM Grand the Venetian manderlay Bay Caesar's Palace and more as well as other giant properties across 26 states around the country the reason why this matters is because while while other types of real estate are much more I would say vulnerable to Rising disruption like brick andmar retail with e-commerce or offices with remote work well I just don't see that same type of vulnerability with gaming and entertainment those are still largely in person markets I mean you go to any local casino or entertainment event you're going to see that their business is very much booming these days and it's really why V's funds from operations continue to rise which easily covers their dividend payout as well you can see that right here and even during the height of the pandemic in 2020 mind you there was a period that the Vegas Strip was even largely closed down and yet vichi was one of the few REITs to actually still bring in 100% of their rent during the entire time which shows you just how high quality their properties really are and yet reason number two the stock price is actually not anything crazy High I mean you would think that with that kind of performance the stock would have skyrocketed but in fact it's only up less than 40% in the past 5 years less than 80% since iping back in 2018 considering the high dividend I'd actually expect the stock price to be much higher than this which is reason number three the mouthwatering dividend yield that is well above 5% by the way they've increased that dividend too every year since they started paying it and considering how well covered it is it'll likely grow larger still over time too my guess so for why the stock hasn't shot up too much over the years is partly due to Rising interest rates making bonds more attractive but now that we're entering a lowering rate environment I actually think dividend stocks will become more important over time so I plan to load up on them while I still can and vichi definitely be playing a role there for me in my portfolio",

    "excerpt": "all right moving on to stock number two this will be the medium risk option for this one I'm going with what is another Bigtime favorite dividend stock of mine that I think is Trad at a dirt cheap price and that is the Telecom giant Verizon ticker symbol VZ which admittedly does have some major flaws and issues to be aware of the biggest of which is clearly the massive debt that they've accumulated during the investment and buildout of their 5G and fiber networks in recent years at over $126 billion dollar of debt last quarter alone now that debt has been slowly improving over time and it's also an issue that really 18 TNT and even T-Mobile are also facing as well what basically makes up like the triopoly of the American Telecom Market but it's still a massive amount of debt that we're talking about here that will need to be serviced over time making it a major drag on their financials and thus adding just a lot of bloat and even some risk to Verizon stock but beyond that the picture does actually start to look better for Verizon first of all this is a cash generating machine here that should be able to service that debt with the billions that they generate every year in fact just breaking the numbers down a little we can see that so far this year the first three quarters of 2024 they brought in $26.5 billion in cash flow from operations now you subtract 12 billion from that for Capital expenditures and you're left with 14.5 billion in free cash flow of which you deduct another 8.4 billion in dividends paid and you're still left with over $6 billion for servicing debt so in my opinion it would appear at least that the dividend is relatively safe here and that's a huge bonus because compared to the others Verizon's yield is much higher at about 65% it's a very attractive yield even just across the entire market now the other two reasons why I like the stock here well the valuation is also cheaper than their peers by forward p ratio and over 30% cheaper than the sector median 2 it's very attractive while overall Verizon is the one that actually has the larger stronger business in my opinion doing more in sales and consistently beating everyone else on network quality something that they've achieved for over three decades in a row which is kind of mind-blowing plus you even have some new moves recently like acquiring Frontier Communications to increase their fiber Network and strengthen their overall business even further by the way fiber is still a huge deal for current and expanding internet usage so it's not something to be uh sleeping on here many times even in in Wireless the cell towers are actually connected with fiber 2 but again the biggest concern here Remains the massive debt which is why it can be really I would say so kind of difficult to Value Verizon stock sometimes because it really is a bit of a wild card it kind of fits perfectly into that middle medium risk option of a stock because I see two possible scenarios for Verizon going forward just in my opinion the bullish scenario is that interest rates keep falling making their debt more manageable and the dividend more attractive compared to to bonds so investor money starts pouring in raising the stock price and lowering the yield for new investors but of course because I entered the stock early on my yield would actually stay high and that's kind of the bull scenario where I I not only have a really good dividend but I also get a raising a rising stock price over time but then the bare case is also very possible here because in that scenario well the debt just keeps Weighing on the company which gets even worse after the frontier acquisition if that doesn't doesn't provide enough synergies or growth to make up for it and if the economy happens to get worse or we even hit a recession well Verizon could easily decide to cut that dividend in order to save themselves as much money as possible during difficult times which would likely cause investors to flee the stock again personally I believe more in the former scenario so that's why I'm buying the stock right now myself but like I said it does carry some possible risk too that investors should be aware of if you're even considering in the stock",

    "excerpt": "all right now as risky as you might think that Verizon is well it's not even the highest risk option that I chose for this month I I I went a little heavier on the risk side this month admittedly but uh yeah that honor is going to go to a stock that I don't even own myself and it's one that I I've actually rarely ever talked about on the channel but at these lower levels it's just getting super interesting the more that it crashes so I feel like I kind of had to choose it talk about it and that stock is Boeing ticker symbol BA the Aerospace and defense giant now back in the day this was easily considered low risk no way that you would have thought it to be a risky type of stock it was one of the best performing companies in the world and the stock price reflected that rising to nearly $500 a share however today the price has fallen all the way down to just around 150 bucks losing well over half of its entire value and essentially trading for just about the same price it did an entire decade ago now there's two primary reasons for this one reason reason that I feel really no longer matters and the other reason I think is much more important now starting with the former reason uh that would be the pandemic where most of the world shut down causing air travel to come to a screeching halt as you can see on this chart here where Airlines were even at risk of going out of business before the government stepped in to bail them out with taxpayer money by the way some of that even went to helping Boeing as well because of course during that time their business was heavily struggling and affected by all of this however that's no longer the case here today in terms of travel demand which you can see on this chart here has already recovered back up to a record high and is only expected to grow larger long term so the whole pandemic period that's not an issue that I'm concerned about anymore moving forward when looking at boing stock the the other issue though the one that I actually do think is important that everyone should be paying attention to makes a stock high risk is in the numerous quality control issues that boing has faced in recent years some which has even tragically been fatal to uh to a lot of people and it's something that boen has been having to deal with ever since not just PR wise but also in the form of lawsuits and even product delays plus you even have a labor dispute more recently now making things even worse now moving forward I personally think that much of this will improve for boing uh over time which is why I think the stock is looking attractive here but at the moment the sum of all these negative Parts actually caused Boeing to lose a ton of money on the bottom line which you can see on this chart here showing their free cash flow excuse me um struggling while their debt continues to grow larger now on the more kind of bullish side of things there are some future catalysts to look forward to that should help boing turn things around over time which Wall Street seems to believe in as they project cash flows to actually turn positive once again with lowering their debt in the coming years uh as well and when looking at those what those positives could be well for one they do have a new CEO that is actually pretty well respected and seems to be committed to Turning boing around as a company but more importantly Bo's market share while having lost admittedly ground to Airbus in recent years it is still extremely large for them this is pretty much a global duopoly that we're talking about here with Airbus and Boeing Airbus really doing better internationally especially in Europe while Boeing uh I believe still is like number one in America so they do a lot better domestically too but either way those two companies it's essentially a duopoly here there's not a whole lot of other companies that could even rival them there is comac coming out of China they're trying to enter more International markets but that's a Chinese state-run company which you know it could do better over time but in terms of like I don't know consumers trusting a Chinese built plane feeling like that's safer than boing even with all the issues that Boe has had it's a little hard for me to believe that consumers would trust a a you know planes being built in China but I don't know that may be just kind of my bias opinion who knows it's something to kind of keep an eye on longer term but either way though uh like I said at least at the moment Boeing is still very dominant here and they also have a record backlog to also look forward to in the future currently sitting at over 6,000 orders and potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars and so when I look at Boeing I just really see like a struggling stock right now for very good reason mind you and I haven't even purchased this one myself but a big part of me does feel like this is more of a timing issue for Boeing stock than anything else where maybe given enough time you know a recovery I could see a recovery taking place for what is still a market leader a very dominant player in aviation and one that also even has a big presence in defense too that gives their business a little more diversity as well so you know I just think as a highrisk option acknowledging that knowing the risk involved well Boeing is probably one of the best high-risk options out there in the market if you're looking for a little bit riskier more speculative kind of play it looks pretty attractive the more that it falls",
