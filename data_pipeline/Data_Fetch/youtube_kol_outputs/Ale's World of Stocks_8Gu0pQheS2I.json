All right how about for stock number seven though I bring you back to a fan favorite here that most of you probably like you probably even own it in your portfolio that's right we're going with Nvidia tier s nvda basically the leader of the AI Revolution at this point or at least the most hyped one for it for sure but you know what I'm actually going to include stocks number eight and number nine here as well because I actually think all three of the big American chip developers are going through a large dip that is worth picking up and it really just depends on what characteristic you would prioritize among them the most that would really determine which one is the most attractive here but that of of course includes Nvidia AMD and Intel now when looking at their prices Nvidia lost almost a fifth of its value in the past month AMD lost almost a quarter of its value during the same time and Intel well Intel lost over 40% and is now trading at the lowest prices of the past decade after losing more than 70% of its value from the top and so what I think it will really come down to here differentiating between the three I think with Nvidia you get the number one market share Dom leader in Ai and discreet gpus with close to 100% of the data center GPU Market which is by the way also up five times last year in sales and they have about 88% of desktop GPU market share as well and despite being one of the most highly valued companies in the world now by market cap well their profit growth is so incredibly high that the recent dip left their valuation significantly lower than both their 5-year average on most metrics while also their peeg ratio is even cheaper than the sector too if you can believe it so with that dip and with the growth expected from AI long term I think Nvidia is a buy Here For Those reasons",
