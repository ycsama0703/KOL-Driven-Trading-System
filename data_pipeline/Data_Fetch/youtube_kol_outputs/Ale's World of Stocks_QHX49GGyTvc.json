    "company": "Chevron",
    "excerpt": "for stock number one for example well I'm going to go with Chevron in the energy sector because this is really at the heart of Trump's campaign where he frequently says drill baby drill in reference to increasing the production of oil and gas to lower the price of energy for all Americans... it's even alleged that he held a meeting in maral Lago with Executives from some of the biggest oil companies including Chevron but also Exxon and more where it's also alleged that he said he could save the industry over a hundred billion plus... and when it comes to oil stocks well my favorite just happens to be Chevron the second largest producer in America who's actually seen a fairly flat stock price in recent history only Rising by less than 25% over the past decade while also being down about 20% from the top leaving behind one of the most attractive dividends in the Market at close to a 45% yield with also 36 years in a row of consecutive increases which could be part of the reason why the current price is lower than even the lowest analyst price Targets on Yahoo finance meaning they all expect it to rise in the coming years to bring that yield back down a bit we'll have to see if that indeed happens oil and really energy stocks in general tend to be very cyclical as you can see in their financials with a correction right now coming off of record highs but I just think that there's a reason to be optimistic for their future not just from a trump presidency helping Big Oil but also from their gigantic investments into Renewables as well which we all expect to play a major role in the future of energy and as such Chevron has spent many billions of dollars on numerous Investments like in their acquisition of renewable energy group The majority stake they took in the world's largest hydrogen storage plant their investments into bio Bend one of the largest carbon storage projects in the country and many more examples just like this helping them tap into future growth markets that could be worth trillions of dollars over the long term and so I just see Chevron as this massive oil company that can continue to rake in profits from that part of their business while also using them to invest in future growth initiatives like those in Renewables and so at a p ratio of only around 11 I just think it's a stock that can outperform longterm given the right conditions",

    "company": "Tesla",
    "excerpt": "All right now for stock number two uh well this one might actually shock you a little bit based off of everything that I just said cuz I'm actually going to go with Tesla I know didn't I just say that Trump would get rid of the EV mandates and push for more oil and gas wouldn't that actually hurt Tesla well there's a couple reasons why I actually think a trump presidency could help Tesla by a lot and here's why first of all it's no secret that Elon Musk has fallen out of favor with Democrats not only did he acquire Twitter to stop censorship that was primarily coming from the left but he also criticized Democrats many times on the platform himself before eventually just flat out endorsing Trump for president to calling this the most important election of our lifetime and because of this Elon went from really being a hero to the left because of climate change and pushing for electric vehicles and other things like that to now essentially being considered a villain so much so that when Biden and Kamala held an EV Summit they didn't even invite Tesla despite them being the number one seller of EVs and that was even before musk ever endorsed Trump so it seems like the breakup here between musk and Democrats has been probably coming for a while now and you even have Trump more recently praising Elon Musk now and saying that he would even consider putting him in the administration in the cabinet in some position um if musk has the time for it which is uh pretty wild but anyway all of this to say that musk and Trump are a lot closer now than ever before and I have to imagine that in a trump president there will be many benefits coming to Tesla because of it probably the biggest of those being not just tax incentives which is a huge part of the Trump campaign but also maintaining and expanding on Chinese tariffs particularly on Chinese electric vehicles which musk has said for a while now is the single biggest threat to American automakers like Tesla In fact he was quoted in saying that Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world and they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established adding frankly I think if there are no trade barriers established they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world well what do you know it just so happens that Trump is now considering an even higher tariff on certain Chinese Goods this time for as much as 60% that's huge obviously we don't know how far he would actually go with all of that but it's just a clear message that he is taking China very seriously which again is Tesla's biggest threat on top of this I think it's also worth noting that Tesla is about to hold their Robo taxi event next week which is getting a lot of hype right now time will tell how they actually perform there but I'm hoping for some really good Technologies and Innovation to help them push even further into autonomous driving while they continue to also work on robotics Ai and other things that oh by the way tend to get heavily regulated well something that Trump is very well known for is cutting red tape so if that also helps Tesla get Robo taxis out on the road and robots into factories and even people's homes well it could be huge for them too and so with the stock currently trading about 40% down from the top I just think the combination of tariffs tax incentives and deregulation could actually help Tesla perform much better in the coming years cuz even if Trump allows ice vehicles to continue selling with cheap gas well we all know that the future of of the automotive industry is still likely going to be electric so I don't think it's uh really as big of a deal as people make it out to be if we're looking out over the longer term",

    "excerpt": "however there's actually a different stock that I think has much more future potential and that is Palantir Technologies ticker symbol PLT R because while they may not be a straightforward weapons maker they are far and ahead one of the best at using artificial intelligence and overall data management and Analysis to support the military and the government at large which I actually think may be the most important aspect of defense for the future and yeah this is exactly what they specialize in in fact they've basically been ranked number one worldwide in AI data science and machine learning by drner Forester and even the IDC and every time I do an update on Palantir it feels like they've been awarded yet another gigantic contract with the military like we've seen in the past with the US Army for example for their first ever AI defined vehicles that use deep sensing targeting and Mission command both on and off the battlefield as well as just last quarter we saw that they signed yet another half a billion dollar contract to scale Ai and machine learning across the entire US Department of Defense not to mention all the work they do in combating human trafficking too and other spatial analysis that would very likely be utilized by a trump government that focuses on you know the nation's border and stuff like that but the great thing about Palantir is that it's not just Reliance on the government for its success in fact they have a large and growing business on the commercial side of things too using AI to help businesses run more effectively and efficiently where they're seing explosive growth with their Us customer count soaring by over 80% last guys mind you this is during what is a pretty weak economy here where many businesses have been actively preparing for a recession and business optimism is also at more than a decade low yet they're still willing to hire Palantir because of how effective they are which by the way boosting the economy is also something that Trump claims is a top priority for him through lower taxes and other pro- eony type of policies that could potentially make it easier for these companies to continue hiring Palantir for longer as well either way though I think demand will remain high will remain high regardless and it's why really we see their sales and profits continue to sore every year unfortunately the stock has already risen to a record high but with how on fire they are it kind of feels like really only a recession could probably drag this one down at which point I would just use that as an opportunity to buy even more of the stock than I already have",
