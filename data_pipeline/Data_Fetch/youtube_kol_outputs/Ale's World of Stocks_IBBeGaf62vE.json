    "excerpt": "so as a lot of you probably know paler stock is currently down more than 20% from its highs this year in large part because of disappointing earnings that spooked investors and even though it is currently still up more than double its IPO price from 2020 I actually think that paler stock is a pretty good pickup on this dip right here especially for anyone that is not yet in the stock and was looking for an entry point this could be a great option. The earnings weren't even that bad in fact I actually thought that they were pretty good with sales not only Rising by over 20% in the quarter but more importantly profits actually soared by hundreds of percents on practically every metric available and yet the stock actually declined because of what investors felt was really not strong enough guidance. For a while there paler was actually getting criticized for a substantial slowdown in growth notably through the second half of 2022 going into 2023 but since then quarterly Revenue growth has re accelerated again in each of the past three quarters reaching back up to over 20% and even more importantly their margins have showed Incredible strength despite the weak macroeconomy with their operating margin getting stronger in each of the past six quarters in a row. In the case of paler and AI software specialist they not only hit this Mark consistently but the past three quarters have even soared well above that too reaching 57% in the last quarter alone and that's very impressive. Paler is no longer a cash burning kind of Spec stock but rather one that has turned a gap net income profit in each of the past six quarters in a row reaching a record high this latest one and that should easily continue going forward as well. During this horrible environment for paler they actually grew their commercial customer count by nearly 70% year-over-year. Paler is at the forefront of this movement with their AI power data management and analytics platforms that help both government and Commercial entities run better safer smarter and more efficiently. Paler specializes in all of those areas: cyber security, legal uncertainty, geopolitical instability, AI, new technologies, financial and economic risks, supply chain and health risks. Paler has their infos SEC Division and their mission statement involves stopping terrorism, developing new medicines, gaining an edge in Global Financial markets, and combating trafficking. Paler wouldn't be constantly getting awarded new contracts with the military if they weren't one of the best at these things. Last quarter for example they were awarded a new contract with the US Army worth $178 million for their new Titan Next Generation deep sensing platform. Commercial grew by 27% worldwide and a whopping 40% in the US last quarter. A big reason for that is their new AI boot camp program where they go to companies and they train their employees on how to use AI within the paler ecosystem to improve their operations which has seen huge results. Last quarter alone paler completed another 660 new boot camps with around 1,000 organizations having already gone through it. The AI boot camp is just such a great marketing strategy. I actually think that the valuation isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Revenue growth is still hovering above 20% a year which I do feel is pretty strong but even stronger than that is their profit growth hovering above 80% expected over the next 5 years and as such their PEG ratio of 1.6 I think that's pretty fair. This is a company that I feel is much better than most of their peers in terms of growth and performance and future potential. Their addressable Market alone should be worth north of trillions in the future yet right now they're only doing a couple billion in sales so I feel that there is plenty of room to keep growing there. While I agree that the stock is certainly not cheap I do still feel that it is worth picking up some of the stock on any dips like the one that we're currently seeing right now because when you factor in everything else into the complete picture the whole thing actually turns out to be pretty reasonable in my opinion. As for me I of course own it in my personal portfolio and I also have some of it in our community portfolio as well and it's a stock that I love for the future and I know that I will continue to add to it on future dips too.",
