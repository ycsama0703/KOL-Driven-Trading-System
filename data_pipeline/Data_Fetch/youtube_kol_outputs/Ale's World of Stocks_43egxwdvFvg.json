    "excerpt": "Ali could you uh do a video on Intel with everyone watching Nvidia do you think Intel is a sleeper stock to consider picking up it looks very cheap to me and I can't believe how low it's gone over the years a lot of people have been asking me similar things about Intel stock recently especially you know over the past year where Nvidia stock has of course skyrocketed even becoming the most valued company in the entire world and yet a big rival in Intel has only continue to fall heavily when it comes to processor chip developers Intel and Nvidia have always been kind of the two big dogs especially for CPUs and gpus respectively with Intel of course being more dominant in CPUs and also apus which combines like a CPU and a GPU together in recent years we've also seen some crossover start to take place with Intel now developing some high performance gpus as well I also own a much smaller uh kind of tiny piece of Intel as well Intel on the other hand has been a completely different story as they've actually seen uh negative performance over the past decade down over 35% in the past 5 years as well they're also down over 12% in in the past one year and then also down over 36% so far year to date so just horrible performance by comparison Which Intel by comparison well we don't find them until all the way down to the number 114 spot at $130 billion worth of market cap which is still pretty larger but I mean you make some comparisons here you could take like 25 intels and put them together and it would still not be worth as much as just one Nvidia alone that's pretty crazy I mean I remember back in the day it was a complete opposite with Intel being many times larger than Nvidia what did Nvidia get so right that Intel got so wrong However Intel on the other hand the old king of processors has in my opinion been much more complacent just kind of holding on to their leadership in CPUs what are central processing units which uh don't get me wrong those are still hugely important and are not going anywhere they're kind of like the brains of your computer but they're just not at the same level of gpus when it comes to Ai and other like high performance or machine learning kind of capabilities the demand for AI and for nvidia's chips in particular uh to power that AI has really skyrocketed while Intel has just kind of remained what they've always been which is a still very solid chips company but nowhere near the standout kind of rising star that Nvidia has become here's a chart showing the two companies Revenue growth over the years and you can see just how dramatic of a difference it's been with Nvidia growing from less than 20 billion in 2020 to over 60 billion last year while Intel has crashed from you know close to 80 billion to now even less than Nvidia at 54 billion Nvidia is projected to grow to nearly 3 times the size of Intel but most important of all is how this growth has translated to a gigantic lead on the bottom line too while Intel has instead fallen from over 20 billion in profit to just less than two billion last year nvidia's EPS is still expected to more than double while Intel's is crawling to almost a flat pace and yet I actually think that Intel stock is still a buy right now If I was forced to rate Intel as a buy a hold or a sell I would give it a buy rating now that's not because I think that it'll become the next Nvidia my answer to that specific question is no I don't think Intel will be able to catch up to nvidia's lead at this point for the things that they particularly excel at my argument would be that it doesn't have to reach that point in order to still be a good stock worth investing in it just needs to uh capitalize on a few different things and I'm just going to give you three primary uh reasons why I feel that Intel stock is a buy at these levels and number one is because the stock is just already so heavily beaten down at this point that I feel it leaves little downside risk but plenty of upside potential again I'm not saying that it'll ever soar like in but even if it can get back to anywhere close to like its former highs I mean that would still be substantial gains of probably over 100% And at a peeg ratio of only 0.5 that looks Dirt Cheap to me for what is the former king of processors that still holds around 2thirds of the x86 CPU market share now the question is can Intel actually recover well that's reason number too because I think it actually can because first of all much of Intel's damage was self-inflicted see unlike Nvidia and AMD who outsourc their chip manufacturing Intel actually builds the chips themselves and while there can be some advantages to that the past few years were a bit of a disadvantage as they suffered from multiple delays incompetence a lack of innovation and even Supply constraints that rival Taiwan semiconductor I just feel handled much better which ultimately benefited Intel's biggest rival in AMD and ultimately helped them steal a ton of market share from Intel but again I feel that these are issues that Intel can correct over time which I also feel that because there is so much demand for high performance chips I think Intel will get plenty of opportunities to win customers over again and I don't see that demand ever going away in the future now keep in mind Intel themselves have now been building discrete gpus with their next Generation battle mage series uh expected to come in the next year and while that's been a bumpy ride so far that I don't expect to ever get close to eonian Nvidia I just think that they need to launch these alternative options for the growing Market since Rising demand should help them gain traction over time speaking about how much demand there is in AI chips well keep in mind that America is extremely reliant on Taiwan semiconductor which is of course located in Taiwan right next to China and one of America's biggest fears is that China may try to take them over in the future which regardless of whether or not that turns out to be true there's still no doubt that America would love to shift some of their Reliance on chips over to domestic suppliers like Intel and because of that we've seen huge subsidies take place to help Intel build and expand their factories here Nationwide which I also feel adds a bit to their longevity and overall demand and even a bit of security too to you know this area and the market that they're uh competing in anyway in conclusion what I'm trying to say is that uh you know if you ask me can they be the next Nvidia no I I don't think they can be the next Nvidia will they even get close to Nvidia no I don't think so either but is Intel a bit of a sleeper chip stock that is down a lot right now with substantial turnaround potential yeah I think so I feel that you know for me buying in at small amounts here at these levels just in case it does happen to accomplish the the things I wanted to and it does happen to to recover and take off well I just think it's worth it I think in the future it should trade higher than where it is today do you own own Nvidia Intel do you even own AMD what what are your thoughts on these companies on their stocks right now at current levels do you think Intel is uh too low you think it'll sink lower",
