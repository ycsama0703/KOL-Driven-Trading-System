    "excerpt": "so Tesla just reported earnings this week and in today's video we got to break it down to see what exactly happened here because despite what many feel was a horrendous report the stock actually Rose by double digits now leading up to the report the media was like usual going very hard on Tesla here's a few headlines right here uh New York Times Elon Musk would wouldn't be the first car company founder to flame out Forbes Tesla Shares are officially down 40% this year and could fall further Barons Tesla has an Elon Musk problem the stock could fall another 30% quartz Elon Musk won't stop tweeting now Tesla is paying the price CNN Elon Musk could hurt your portfolio Fox longtime Tesla shareholder calls Elon Musk the most delusional CEO ever and I think this one really sums it up best here from The Verge it says Tesla is in its flop era the company's sales are falling the stock is dropping and even even the most Ardent supporters are stressed about where it's all heading so yeah obviously no love here for Tesla going into this earnings reported and maybe for good reason right I mean I do think that they are putting way too much blame on Elon when in reality it's just a horrible environment for Tesla right now with high inflation and high interest rates really hurting demand for higher priced EVs and all the meanwhile competition is also heating up as well but as we all really expected q1 earnings did come in just about as bad as uh anyone would have really thought and yet the stock actually went up now right now this is on the very next day of earnings here the stock is up over 10% and so here's a few updated headlines Tesla earnings plunge even more than forecast Tesla's profit fell 55% adding to concerns about its strategy Tesla misses profit and revenue estimates but shares rally so what the heck happened here well uh it all really has to do with them announcing that they are going to be building their cheaper Mass Market Vehicles much earlier than what was previously planned for in late 2025 but before we dive into that let me just give you a quick summary of really how bad these earnings actually were now Revenue fell 9% year-over-year versus a 5% drop expected by analyst EPS fell 47% versus 40% expected vehicle production and deliveries fell 2% and 9% respectively Auto gross margin came in at 18.5% versus 18.9% in the previous quarter and 21.1% the year before an operating cash flow guys it saw a 90% crash as well which is very very very bad that's profits there coming in from their operations so yeah really just about as bad as it could get here and of course this also comes after some even deeper price cuts to their vehicles that were already putting you know pressure on those margins as it is and that's really due to all of the poor macro conditions especially in China really where the Chinese model 3 had dropped all the way down in price to just about $32,000 while other rivals in the country continue to lower their prices as well and what analysts are saying is a goal for them to really take the crown from Tesla in the country that's coming in the face of really a wave of Industry consolidation that is expected to take place here in the coming months and years uh and that's also in just what analysts are referring to as the most competitive Domestic Auto Market that they've seen in recent history so it's just very very tough in China I mean take xiaomi for example even this Smartphone maker is now developing EVS in the country too and their most recent su7 model is set to undercut Tesla by thousands of dollars on price with also a claim that it'll even have better range than the model 3 and beat it on more than 90% of specifications Al although it should be noted that the vehicle will sell for a loss at least to start but because their car factory will have all of its key steps fully automated and be able to produce a car every 76 seconds well there is a chance here that it may scale up fast enough with little to no labor in in China for this automated Factory well it might get to a point where it actually becomes profitable because of that and that's really the problem with all of these Chinese Rivals here is that uh labor is just so cheap there and these companies are not afraid to uh really like autonomization that's very scary especially for me as a shareholder that's probably my biggest concern is all of that that Rising threat coming from these Chinese um automakers uh still with all of these concerns in mind there is actually a lot here to be optimistic about even from the earnings report and it doesn't just have to do with the announcement of the cheaper cars coming sooner than expected although that is certainly helping the stock at the moment and basically what came out of the earnings report here is that they've now updated their future lineup to accelerate the launch of those newer models ahead of the previous timeline of the second half of 2025 which in typical Elon Musk fashion uh during the earnings call he he pushed it to even as early as late this year which I I personally doubt that that's going to happen but you know it kind of just shows how aggressively uh they feel that they really need to push this advancement into the into their cheaper models and keep in mind a robo taxi day is also already coming in August 2 too so I think you know when they announce the robo taxi they reveal that and then as soon as they can start making those the earlier the better I I think is kind of their strategy anyway this is all really a huge deal here because as you guys recall the nextg platform is supposed to have around half the cost so we're talking about some very affordable uh EVS here especially compared to what's out there in the market that you know usually cost a a lot more but uh some prices that have even been thrown around for these cheaper Teslas could be as low as $225,000 a car which would I think sell like absolute freaking hot cakes at those levels but anyway uh they go on to say here that they'll actually be using both the nextg platform and the current one too so that they can maximize production which I don't really have a huge problem with now it is going to be a little bit of a trade-off here cuz it might eat into their margins a little bit more than we would have wanted to see but at the same time the trade-off here is that it's also going to help them scale up a lot larger and much faster which is just as important in my opinion to fend off a lot of this Rising competition but they also go on to mention here that uh they say it'll enable them to have a capacity of close to 3 million Vehicles which is more than 50% growth over last year's capacity so that's huge and they specifically point out the robo taxi here as well so I might as well just jump into all the other Pros that I saw in this report here that the media is probably not going to cover too much if at all with with some of these other ones that I'll dive deeper into but anyway just let's just kind of go from the top here so for one uh it was still a profitable quarter for them despite the horrible conditions and to me that signals some pretty good stability there I think they can easily stay afloat while continuing to invest in new technologies even in this like horrible macro environment for them which Speaking of of those investments into new technologies well their AI training compute more than doubled in the quarter which is huge for the robo taxi and I'll get more into that in just a second but they also had record breing energy storage deployment which I'll also touch on more in just a second and the Cyber Tru is also scaling up definitely not the most important thing there but uh it's nice to see that regardless again though I think investments into Ai and the robo taxi are going to be crucial for them going forward and here they said quote while many are pulling back on their Investments Tesla is actually investing in future growth including their AI infrastructure and production capacity the supercharger and service networks and on also of course new products with $2.8 billion spent on Capital expenditures in the first quarter also saying that not only is the future electric but it's also autonomous and they believe that scaled autonomy is only possible with data from millions of vehicles and an immense AI training cluster which they continue to expand on both and have even lowered their prices on those services so that it can get into more people's hands and help build up that neural network much larger over time and yeah that's something that I strongly agree with myself it's why Tesla is just so far ahead of all the competition because they have all of these vehicles out on the road already collecting so much data for them having also just recently crossed over a billion miles of full self driving data being collected and that's really big too in fact one point that Elon has said in the past and uh he reiterated during the earnings call is that they can also license out this technology to other companies which Elon said that they they are already in conversations with a major automaker and will likely sign a licensing deal this year that's also huge and just as important their AI training capacity has also skyrocketed over the past year as well so why is all of this so important well just look at their non-automotive gross profit it's seen a huge Spike over over the past year too and this is only the beginning guys this is what really differentiates Tesla from everyone else they're not just an auto company but they're a tech company which I think this image here really sums it up perfectly showing their work in not just EVS but also AI autonomous driving Robo taxi robotics Logistics insurance and of course energy too in fact energy saw a giant Spike this past year as well and services even grew by 25% in the quarter thank thanks in large part to opening up their charging Network to more rival automakers so licensing out a lot of stuff providing services to for for other companies as well all of this is going to be high margin for them and that's why they say here too while we continue to execute on Innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations over time we expect our Hardware related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI and software and fleet-based profits you other words higher software like margins especially from a robotaxi business which I got to say they showed off some images here of how it'll integrate into the Tesla app and it does look pretty cool I think overall Tesla has a massive opportunity here of using their giant lead in autonomous driving to really jump into the ride haing market and probably steal a ton of market share from other companies like uber and lift for example they could maybe do that like almost overnight thanks to them just being autonomous it's going to not only add to the whole kind of wow factor I think a lot of people are just going to want to try it because it's going to be so fun ordering you know an autonomous Robo taxis so they're going to be super interested and again Tesla is ahead of all the competition there so that's going to really help them steal market share like very fast and on top of that the prices could also be very competitive obviously we don't have any idea what they're going to be right now but in the future you know they could actually be very competitive because there is no driver that they have to pay for too so that can help with prices as well in fact during the earnings call uh Elon reiterated again that there will not only be a fleet of Robo taxis that Tesla owns themselves but even a bunch of purchased cars that owners will be able to rent out with Tesla taking a commission thus making this a sort of like combination of both Uber and Airbnb for the end user and also of course for Tesla so I just think there's a ton of different ways there that Tesla can leverage these Investments and Tech Technologies to improve their sales and their margins over time I mean Elon even went as far as to say that their fleet has so much combined computing power that it could run AI inference uh when the vehicles are not in use drawing comparisons to Amazon's web services it's pretty crazy we know how profitable that is obviously anyway uh look building and selling EVS in general is still going to be the biggest part of their business right now no one is denying that but even there I actually think that there's still some longterm optimism for that part of their business as well like for their part really Tesla says that they are currently in between two major growth waves the first began with the global expansion of the model 3 and wi platform and the next will be more heavily focused on autonomous driving and the introduction of new products which I do agree with and even right now I mean as much as the price reductions are hurting margins I think they're making the vehicles way more attractive I mean you can lease a new Tesla for less than $300 now and imagine when the cheaper one comes out if you can lease that for who knows maybe $200 I mean that would be super tempting I think to a lot of people and by the way Eevee adoption is still incredibly low right now so with Tesla's getting cheaper all the time I think they're going to get into more people's hands as adoption gradually goes up and that'll help all of their service businesses even more it'll help them all get bigger over time so it's kind of the long game here and uh by the way I haven't even met mentioned the robot or the semi those could also be huge growth drivers for Tesla as well with the bot for example during the earnings call Elon said that it's already doing Simple Factory tasks in their lab and will be used in Tesla's own Factory by the end of this year with external sales starting by the end of next year too so remember I mentioned that xiaomi is going to have like an automated Factory and that's what's going to help them with cost well you know uh as unfortunate as it is you know I don't like the idea of not having human workers but it's kind of the reality of the situation I think a lot of factories are going to start going more automated over time and Tesla with the Tesla bot is going to not only benefit themselves but it's also something that they can sell to other companies too and I think that brings in a lot of potential in fact Elon uh mentioned again he said that it'll be more valuable than everything else combined he said this again during the earnings call I believe and uh he said that that's because there is no limit to the size of the economy for a sentient humanoid robot that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request also saying that Tesla is best positioned of any humanoid robot maker to be able to reach volume production with efficient inference on the robot itself and that no other company even comes close to them but my personal favorite is uh probably the the one that I consider kind of the biggest sleeper of all that people are just not pay enough attention to it's the semi which they're barely starting to scale up right now but longterm I think it has giant potential cuz legistics alone is a multi-trillion dollar market and tell me something guys if Tesla is going all in on autonomy and Robo taxi service do you really think that they're not going to make some announcement in the future too about launching a new Logistics platform that heavily can integrate you know the semi and all of the work into autonomous driving and building out all of these large networks there's so much po potential there and it makes perfect sense to not just have the hardware not just the semi trucks themselves but also to start building out some kind of platform too if you're doing it for robotaxis you can do it for Logistics as well and there's tons there's giant amounts of money in logistics so um I think that's a giant opportunity for them as well and there's other things too that I have I'm not even uh able to go so deep into with just a short video here but the whole point of all of this is that there is a lot to be looking forward to but kind of the the short-term problem is that this is more of a long-term story that we're talking about here so in my opinion Tesla's stock is really built as more of a stock for long-term minded investors because in the short term I really think that the Bears and the shorts and everyone that kind of hates Tesla and has that kind of mindset I think they're firmly in control of Tesla's stock right now and I think they're going to keep a tight grip on it for a while that that means that it's going to be a very volatile stock I honestly I wouldn't even be surprised if it gets dragged down even lower even even though it's already lost more than half its value but again longterm there is some more optimis optimism to be had there I will admit to you guys though as of late more recently I have been feeling less optimistic than I have been in the past about Tesla stock I think we probably all are all of us Tesla shareholders we we can all see all all of the issues and all the concerns and the rising competition and everything that's going on in the micro economy and we can all feel a little bit of concern for Tesla's stock um so for me personally just kind of sharing with you guys if you want to know how I feel what I'm doing myself if you want to know any of that well I do have my position built out already in Tesla stock so I don't personally plan on buying any more at the moment it's kind of more of a wait and see approach because there's just so many like pros and cons mixed into it and there's other stocks that I personally feel more comfortable more confident in that I would rather be buying at this moment when things are already kind of crazy out there so it's not the safest stock out there but it is a stock that that I still want to hold on to longterm and like I said I do still have a large position and it's a big chunk of my portfolio but uh it's just one that I'm just kind of holding to see what happens longer term and I'm trying not to get too overwhelmed by all the short-term noise and the volatility that I think is going to still continue for some time but that's just my opinion guys you can let me know how you feel about all of this down below and if you're investing in Tesla maybe you're shorting it I I got nothing against anyone doing whatever they want to do but share your opinions I'd love to hear them anyway thanks again for stopping by my friends I hope that you enjoyed the video I hope that you're all doing well and I wish you the best of luck out there in the market but I will catch you in the next video all right take care everybody bye-bye",
