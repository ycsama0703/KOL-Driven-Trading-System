    "excerpt": "I mean something like Nvidia Rising by over 20,000 % in the past 5 years or Amazon or Google or Tesla or any number of amazing performing stocks that Rise by gigantic amounts it's entirely different when all you do is trade in and out of stocks making tiny profits wherever you can which again over 90% of people can't even do that successfully but hey maybe you're that special person that can break the trend after all it's what all the trading gurus tell you online right look at some of these videos here that even reference some of the same lost percentages that we're talking about here's a couple different channels saying the same thing 97% of Traders lose money but here's how you can win here's a few others why 95% of people lose money trading but how you can stop losing money again because you're so special right 95% of Traders making this one simple mistake no big deal guys just fix that one mistake and you'll be good 90% of Traders lose got to watch this now and these guys actually reverse the statistics here saying 9 97% success rate probably trying to hack the algorithm or something but they say discover the day trading strategy that achieved 97% gains 97% win rate trading strategy see guys it's the opposite you'll actually win almost a 100% of the time 97% win rate super simple strategy it's so simple guys you just got to follow their special strategies and by the way these are some of the least scammy ones out there there's so many that will say things like become a millionaire trading or sign up for my course and become rich or do this one simple trick or hack to make money and many more exists out there just like that but guys if it really was that easy do you really think all of these people would be wasting their time trying to sell you a product it's how pyramid schemes work right you sell down to the poor people that don't know any better promising them that they'll become rich by doing something that you don't even do yourself you just sell the magic formula but if it really was so effective you know these people would be spending all of their time doing doing it themselves and before someone else says uh well they're rich so it must have worked for them no they're rich because they sold you a product not because they're doing it themselves not because they're having so much amazing success trading stocks shortterm day trading technical analysis whatever else is out there and look once I see all of their financial records and their tax returns then maybe I'll start to believe them that they became Rich by constantly trading in and out of stocks but until then they're just going to be scam artists to me in my view and it's really no different than how a casino operates the owners don't make their money gambling on the casino floor with the rest of us they make their money from us gambling our money and guess what happens to us in the casino the majority of the time you walk into a casino you're going to be walking out with less money than you walked in and in my opinion short-term stock trading and stock gambling is kind of similar now again that's not to say that it never works and just like a casino sometimes people do get lucky and win and some people are also better than others right of course you have your slot machines where it's just pure luck but you also have the poker tables where if you sit down there you're going to find some players that are much better than others and have much higher success rate and more experience and all that kind of stuff and I think stock trading can be similar there some people have really mastered technical analysis and use a full array of tools and charts like moving averages and volume for Trends RSI to identify Trend reversals other oscillators like the Ballinger bands for volatility lots of different things that are available for traders to increase their odds of success as much as possible but in general long-term investing is always going to be much safer and more reliable and I know much of this will be anecdotal but I'm a stock market YouTuber myself I spend every single day in the world of stocks and in my entire life I can tell you that I have not once not once have I ever met a successful shortterm Trader I'm sure they're out there I'm sure that they exist somewhere and I've had many friends and acquaintances and even members tell me that they were having so much success with it that they wanted to do it fulltime and maybe even quit their jobs but guess what not a single one of those people at least that I've come across is a full-time Trader today they sure as heck are not rich and when I check back with them and ask how it's going and ask if they were able to leave their jobs and do a fulltime well pretty much all of them have either told me straight up or at least hinted towards the fact that they ended up losing most if not all of their gains and they no longer really do it and the ones that do still do it they do it mostly for fun it's probably safer than most other methods of gambling it's kind of similar to gambling in sports you know most people lose money but some are better than others and they might do relatively okay but it's not a job replacement it's probably not going to help them save a ton of money or build some kind of substantial wealth long term in any kind of reliable way it's mostly just another form of gambling at least in my opinion which again I'm not saying that you'll never win and certainly the more technical analysis and advanced tools that you use I think you can improve your odds substantially but even then I mean you're still mostly just following a bunch of trends that are only right until they're not like I've had so many people call me an idiot in the past for buying stocks like Amazon or Nvidia because they were so sure that it had a resistance at a certain level or I see the talking heads on CNBC all the time you know they say this stock has support at this level this stock has resistance at this level D if I had a nickel for every time that I heard them say no way this stock will sink you know below this support level and the stock just goes right through it or they'll say no way this stock will get past this resistance level and it just goes right through it or even the opposite right like they say this trend shows that it'll keep going down and yet the stock just completely reverses cores and they were just way off and I'm just watching them I'm thinking like dude you guys are so full of it you're literally just gambling you don't care what the valuation is you don't care what the fundamentals are if it's a good company who the competitors are what's the addressable Market uh what the long-term potential is you don't care about any of that you're just looking at a flock of birds flying in the sky and you're gambling on when they're going to change direction but stocks are volatile guys they go up and down a lot in the short term I've never been able to time the market myself and again I'm someone who lives in the stock world every single day and even I can't do it successfully but when you look at the market longer term it tends to gradually go up and as long as you're doing the hard work to pick good companies at reasonable prices you're probably going to have success I mean shoot you could really just buy the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ and use compound investing long-term you'll probably make a ton of money just from that investment alone but in the shorter term anything can and does happen and it's what really makes it so much harder to predict and it's why it's so difficult and why so many people lose money on it you have to constantly watch the news you have to analyze the charts you have to look at all the price action watch the volume and good luck having a full-time job by the way on top of all of that where your only trading windows are during Peak working hours and even then you're having to make a huge amount of Trades by the way just to better your odds of winning which means you get hit with extra fees because you trade way more than the long-term investors you get taxed way more than them too by the way and they also long-term investors also get the benefit of using other methods like IAS to reduce your taxes even further but you don't have access to any of that so you have to be even more profitable than them because you have all of these fees and taxes eating away at your profits and that's what just makes it the whole thing so much harder and it's why it's estimated that like 75% of uh day Traders quit within the first two years and you know it's no surprise why it's very difficult and look even then let's assume that you're that special one or two% of people that is actually you know really good at predicting short-term price movements you're like a fortune teller you can somehow time the market everyone says you can't time the market everyone everyone says that right right it's impossible to time the market okay let's say you're special you can actually time the market you're really good at it well even then you're now having to compete with some of the best most advanced algorithms and robots and supercomputers in the world that are owned by the ultra wealthy and the giant hedge funds that are what actually moves the market in all these different directions every day and you likely don't have access to any of those things that they have so the level that you have to be just so amazingly good at this to make it really worth your valuable time is just so damn High when you could have been doing something else like building up a business or working your way up in a career while also investing longterm on great stocks and great dividends that are proven to absolutely build wealth over time all the richest people do it they all invest They Don't Really gamble that's usually how they lose their their wealth and their money right it's when they get addicted to gambling every sports star you know Hollywood actor lottery winner uh how do so many of those people lose their wealth it's not by making good Investments it's usually by gambling and spending their money carelessly it's the lack of investing actually that usually ends up bankrupting them so uh look these are all just kind of off the top of my head feelings and opinions I'm not saying that I'm right I respect all of your different views and you should absolutely do what is best for you but I'm just saying that for me I sleep so much better at night guys just investing longterm into a well Diversified portfolio of great companies Great dividend stocks too and I enjoy seeing my wealth rise over the years rather than gambling it hoping that I get Super Lucky and don't actually lose all of my savings but you know anyway those are just my thoughts guys I would love to hear your thoughts down below let me know if you agree or disagree with anything I said hey All Views are welcome on this channel I'd love to hear your opinions and we can have a fun discussion but uh anyway thanks again for stopping by I hope you enjoyed the video for whatever it's worth maybe you got some value out of it maybe you got some entertainment I just hope you enjoyed it but I will catch you in the next one my friends I hope you're all doing well with whatever you do in the stock market I will catch you in the next one all right take care everybody bye-bye",

do this one simple trick or hack to make money and many more exists out there just like that but guys if it really was that easy do you really think all of these people would be wasting their time trying to sell you a product it's how pyramid schemes work right you sell down to the poor people that don't know any better promising them that they'll become rich by doing something that you don't even do yourself you just sell the magic formula but if it really was so effective you know these people would be spending all of their time doing doing it themselves and before someone else says uh well they're rich so it must have worked for them no they're rich because they sold you a product not because they're doing it themselves not because they're having so much amazing success trading stocks shortterm day trading technical analysis whatever else is out there and look once I see all of their financial records and their tax returns then maybe I'll start to believe them that they became Rich by constantly trading in and out of stocks but until then they're just going to be scam artists to me in my view and it's really no different than how a casino operates the owners don't make their money gambling on the casino floor with the rest of us they make their money from us gambling our money and guess what happens to us in the casino the majority of the time you walk into a casino you're going to be walking out with less money than you walked in and in my opinion short-term stock trading and stock gambling is kind of similar now again that's not to say that it never works and just like a casino sometimes people do get lucky and win and some people are also better than others right of course you have your slot machines where it's just pure luck but you also have the poker tables where if you sit down there you're going to find some players that are much better than others and have much higher success rate and more experience and all that kind of stuff and I think stock trading can be similar there some people have really mastered technical analysis and use a full array of tools and charts like moving averages and volume for Trends RSI to identify Trend reversals other oscillators like the Ballinger bands for volatility lots of different things that are available for traders to increase their odds of success as much as possible but in general long-term investing is always going to be much safer and more reliable and I know much of this will be anecdotal but I'm a stock market YouTuber myself I spend every single day in the world of stocks and in my entire life I can tell you that I have not once not once have I ever met a successful shortterm Trader I'm sure they're out there I'm sure that they exist somewhere and I've had many friends and acquaintances and even members tell me that they were having so much success with it that they wanted to do it fulltime and maybe even quit their jobs but guess what not a single one of those people at least that I've come across is a full-time Trader today they sure as heck are not rich and when I check back with them and ask how it's going and ask if they were able to leave their jobs and do a fulltime well pretty much all of them have either told me straight up or at least hinted towards the fact that they ended up losing most if not all of their gains and they no longer really do it and the ones that do still do it they do it mostly for fun it's probably safer than most other methods of gambling it's kind of similar to gambling in sports you know most people lose money but some are better than others and they might do relatively okay but it's not a job replacement it's probably not going to help them save a ton of money or build some kind of substantial wealth long term in any kind of reliable way it's mostly just another form of gambling at least in my opinion which again I'm not saying that you'll never win and certainly the more technical analysis and advanced tools that you use I think you can improve your odds substantially but even then I mean you're still mostly just following a bunch of trends that are only right until they're not like I've had so many people call me an idiot in the past for buying stocks like Amazon or Nvidia because they were so sure that it had a resistance at a certain level or I see the talking heads on CNBC all the time you know they say this stock has support at this level this stock has resistance at this level D if I had a nickel for every time that I heard them say no way this stock will sink you know below this support level and the stock just goes right through it or they'll say no way this stock will get past this resistance level and it just goes right through it or even the opposite right like they say this trend shows that it'll keep going down and yet the stock just completely reverses cores and they were just way off and I'm just watching them I'm thinking like dude you guys are so full of it you're literally just gambling you don't care what the valuation is you don't care what the fundamentals are if it's a good company who the competitors are what's the addressable Market uh what the long-term potential is you don't care about any of that you're just looking at a flock of birds flying in the sky and you're gambling on when they're going to change direction but stocks are volatile guys they go up and down a lot in the short term I've never been able to time the market myself and again I'm someone who lives in the stock world every single day and even I can't do it successfully but when you look at the market longer term it tends to gradually go up and as long as you're doing the hard work to pick good companies at reasonable prices you're probably going to have success I mean shoot you could really just buy the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ and use compound investing long-term you'll probably make a ton of money just from that investment alone but in the shorter term anything can and does happen and it's what really makes it so much harder to predict and it's why it's so difficult and why so many people lose money on it you have to constantly watch the news you have to analyze the charts you have to look at all the price action watch the volume and good luck having a full-time job by the way on top of all of that where your only trading windows are during Peak working hours and even then you're having to make a huge amount of Trades by the way just to better your odds of winning which means you get hit with extra fees because you trade way more than the long-term investors you get taxed way more than them too by the way and they also long-term investors also get the benefit of using other methods like IAS to reduce your taxes even further but you don't have access to any of that so you have to be even more profitable than them because you have all of these fees and taxes eating away at your profits and that's what just makes it the whole thing so much harder and it's why it's estimated that like 75% of uh day Traders quit within the first two years and you know it's no surprise why it's very difficult and look even then let's assume that you're that special one or two% of people that is actually you know really good at predicting short-term price movements you're like a fortune teller you can somehow time the market everyone says you can't time the market everyone everyone says that right right it's impossible to time the market okay let's say you're special you can actually time the market you're really good at it well even then you're now having to compete with some of the best most advanced algorithms and robots and supercomputers in the world that are owned by the ultra wealthy and the giant hedge funds that are what actually moves the market in all these different directions every day and you likely don't have access to any of those things that they have so the level that you have to be just so amazingly good at this to make it really worth your valuable time is just so damn High when you could have been doing something else like building up a business or working your way up in a career while also investing longterm on great stocks and great dividends that are proven to absolutely build wealth over time all the richest people do it they all invest They Don't Really gamble that's usually how they lose their their wealth and their money right it's when they get addicted to gambling every sports star you know Hollywood actor lottery winner uh how do so many of those people lose their wealth it's not by making good Investments it's usually by gambling and spending their money carelessly it's the lack of investing actually that usually ends up bankrupting them so uh look these are all just kind of off the top of my head feelings and opinions I'm not saying that I'm right I respect all of your different views and you should absolutely do what is best for you but I'm just saying that for me I sleep so much better at night guys just investing longterm into a well Diversified portfolio of great companies Great dividend stocks too and I enjoy seeing my wealth rise over the years rather than gambling it hoping that I get Super Lucky and don't actually lose all of my savings but you know anyway those are just my thoughts guys I would love to hear your thoughts down below let me know if you agree or disagree with anything I said hey All Views are welcome on this channel I'd love to hear your opinions and we can have a fun discussion but uh anyway thanks again for stopping by I hope you
