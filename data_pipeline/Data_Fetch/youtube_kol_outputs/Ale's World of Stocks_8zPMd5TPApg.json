I asked which brand new stock should we add and the clear winner was meta at a whopping 43% so I added that to the portfolio. I'd probably want to replace that with something a little safer like meta maybe metronic those are very close there and could easily kind of jump into the top five if I had a little more of those. seeing some of my favorites like Microsoft exr meta and more down in negative territory you know as a as a long-term minded investor that gets me really excited I love to go in and buy more of those on the dips while they're down and build up larger position so I'm pretty excited about that. then also want to add more to some other stocks like I said metronic meta exr could be great stocks to bump up into the top five",
