    "excerpt": "okay so uh let's start here with a couple of Telecom Giants first we have Verizon who reported on Monday they had a bit of a mix showing with subscribers growing but revenues falling short of analyst expectations while profits continue to be under pressure from really all the Investments that they've made recently into 5G and fiber internet EPS also came in just barely under estimates while net income also declined slightly by 1% as it wasn't really helped by uh the less than 1% growth that they saw in revenues either so pretty much flat performance there for Verizon but you know you're not really going to be investing in a stock like Verizon right now for getting any kind of growth uh if you own it like myself by the way then you're really buying it for that cheap valuation and the dominant business that will hopefully stay profitable enough to pay their mouthwatering dividend while also paying back some of of their ginormous debt that they carry just like AT&amp;T from all of those uh Investments that they've made into their infrastructure building that out and all that kind of stuff which by the way thankfully well it still seems to be an investment thesis here that is holding up as free cash flow managed to grow by another half a billion dollars in the six months ended which covers the dividend by about $3 billion leaving some cash left over to pay down debt as their Capital expenditures continue to fall after uh so many Investments have already been made so now we're kind of seeing the recovery phase where you're starting to bring down some of those Investments and having some of that money be able to go into your free cash flow so you can pay the dividend and also pay down some of that enormous debt well the quarter also saw plenty of growth in customer counts at least on the consumer side of things but business was uh a bit of the opposite story there it actually declined a little uh probably given the weak macroeconomy as businesses are really starting to tighten down their budgets so that's probably why you're seeing some weakness there from Verizon on the business side of things which is normally um kind of a strong area for them because they have such high quality that businesses tend to pay they're willing to pay a premium price for Verizon but you know when conditions are just doing so poorly macro macro wise well you're going to still uh you know take some damage there too but overall uh fiber and uh broadband and wireless well those continue to do pretty well and yet because of the very slight Miss on analyst estimates well the stock actually fell about 5% for the week leaving it still down 34% from the top and I one of the lowest prices really of the past decade personally I've been a buyer at these levels and especially below that because uh the valuation is just dirt cheap at this point it's around 30 to 50% lower than the sector despite them being you know market leader while the dividend is Skyhigh at over a 6.7% yield so that's what I like about ryzen of course though one of Verizon's biggest Rivals along with T-Mobile is AT&amp;T who also reported this week and they to had a bit of a mixed bag beating on EPS by over 10% as well as subscriber estimates on the back of relatively strong demand for even their higher price plans however like Verizon they also saw growth in most areas except for business where they actually had almost a 10% decline in sales and yeah that's pretty bad so you can see business uh again businesses pulling back they're probably going to be pulling back from uh maybe not as much in Verizon because Verizon at least has the higher quality but uh they're probably going to be pulling back a little bit heavier into some of their Rivals too and that's kind of what we saw here anyway this also led to total revenue falling slightly it was slightly negative for the quarter while EPS profit profits fell about 10% too on an adjusted basis like Verizon though free cash flow actually increased up to 4.6 billion in total now on the back of lower Capital Investments which does easily cover their dividends now of less than half that amount so again pulling back Investments that's how you're going to be able to grow your free cash flow if you're these type of companies that you're not finding sales growth but if you can spend a little less you'll be able to have enough cash left over to you know pay dividend and pay down debts and while the business segment is struggling because again of macro issues well the other segments actually did pretty well for AT&amp;T particularly in fiber internet where they've now seen over 200,000 net ads for 18 consecutive quarters and that's pretty good and that really seemed to be enough to lift up the stock right after reporting although it was still about flat for the week given the decline that they had right before that just right before that and uh that was probably triggered by the way from ryzen's report cuz they reported a little earlier uh anyway as for me I don't really consider AT&amp;T to be a bad alternative to Verizon stock but just kind of a weaker one that doesn't really attract me as much as they two are riddled with massive debt north of $130 billion and while the stock is also down huge from the top leaving a cheap valuation well the dividend is about 1 percentage point less than Verizon cuz AT&amp;T actually cut their dividend a while back while their quality of service I would also argue you is not nearly as good as Verizon's either who continues to win more Awards than AT&amp;T and any other rival year after year and I do feel that that gives Verizon a key Advantage there like I mentioned earlier since we're essentially talking about a market here that isn't going to be growing by very much but rather it's more so about who can just kind of remain dominant and so I think that that's where the the higher quality of service is going to really benefit a player like Verizon a dominant one who can uh also it'll also help them keep some pricing power over the competition that's very important it's going to be even more important going forward and so that's why I like ryzen just a little bit more",

    "company": "Tesla",
    "excerpt": "all right moving on though we had a few automobile stocks report we had Tesla GM and Ford all report this week so let's take a look at how they did one by one well starting with Tesla of course one of the most popular stocks in the market right just in general and like most of the market though this quarter they two had mixed results we've been seeing that a lot from a lot of companies this quarter but uh mostly leaning to the negative side of things it's been not not too impressive of a quarter in my opinion I've seen a lot of companies kind of disappoint anyway revenues they did beat estimates but they only grew by measly 2% which is of course horrible performance for what is a very highly valued growth stock like Tesla you want high growth not just almost flat performance right but that kind of just shows how tough this environment really is right now which is also hurting their profitability that's been a major headline when it comes to to Tesla as EPS missed by over 16% and their gross margin continues to Trend downward now Tesla did try to do some damage control for this noting in the report just how challenging this macro environment is right now given our sustained High interest rates which despite that they still managed to make lots of progress in certain areas like for example energy I mean energy is a huge highlight right now it's probably the most impressive figure that I've seen as it doubled guys it energy doubled in size in the quarter and when it is combined with other services from Tesla the two the those two segments now make up about a quarter of their entire business with the rest of it being Automobiles of course and that that's a great sign because vehicle sales actually fell by 7% in the quarter so this really helped their total revenue growth stay positive because of those other parts of of Tesla's business and that's why I always say Tesla for Tesla to be successful longterm it's got to evolve it's got to be this more of a tech company can't just be an automobile company they've got to have these other pieces that help it out and of course a lot of those pieces are more long-term though we'll talk about that in just a second here too but let's just dig back into this report a little bit so on top of that free cash flow it returned to Positive Growth that's a good sign especially heading into the second half of the year which is usually stronger for Tesla but then they also noted again record energy deployment plus also that the cyber truck is now ramping up in production it actually became the bestselling EV truck despite only recently launching that's a pretty big deal there it's beating rivan it's beating the Ford F-150 Lightning I mean I remember when everybody was saying that those would be Tesla Killers well Tesla just launched the Cyber Tru uh I mean we're barely seeing it out on the road it's barely ramping up in production and it's already the bestselling EV truck so that's that's another positive sign kind of show it's like okay what is rivian doing what is so special about them they're not they can't even beat the cybertruck that's not very impressive in my opinion anyway don't mean to be a hater on that but just kind of sharing my opinion on that anyway uh they also noted that the Optimus robot which of course musk has said in the past could be the biggest part of their business longterm well it began performing tasks autonomously in one of their factories that's another great sign there because that could really help uh improve their margins we talked about how their margins are struggling right now a lot of the headlines surrounding Tesla is all around profitability and margins if you can start having your robots perform a lot of your tasks autonomously that's going to really help you out with your margins cuz you don't have to pay a robot anything right to to do those things anyway during the earnings call by the way U musk also tried to give some optimism on both the robot as well as the upcoming Robo taxi and cheaper Mass Market Vehicles saying that the bot will ramp up tasks for them in factories next year and could start selling to other businesses by 2026 while the robo taxi event has been been delayed to October 10th so that he can quote add a couple of things to it so of course we had previous plans for that but that's just kind of how Elon Musk operates he always overpromises in terms of delivery dates those always tend to get pushed back so it's just kind of is what it is but hopefully whenever they do fully launch they they perform well right that's kind of the idea as for the cheaper Vehicles well uh Tesla also said quote plans for new vehicles including more AFF aable models remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025 these vehicles will utilize aspects of the Next Generation platform as well as prospects of our current platforms and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup so that's really where I think if you're investing in Tesla you're not really investing in them for that maybe traditional EV story anymore in fact vehicle sales for them have been relatively flat in recent quarters and I do think that uh I would say put it this way while I do think that those will return to higher growth over time as EV adoption ramps up and the macro environment becomes more favorable but right now interest rates are just way too high it's way too expensive to buy EVs and we've been seeing that with a lot of companies pulling back EV Investments we'll talk about that in just a second a little bit with GM and Ford but I think that will recover recover over time but really if you're investing in Tesla you're investing for all these other things that they're trying to do do the bot the energy the cheaper upcoming vehicles that could be um produced on well that will be produced on their NextGen platform that should be more cost effective for them and then also of course autonomy and the robo taxi service that's where you really start to bring in software like margins that could really help them um perform much better longterm and I think that's what you really want to be looking forward to if you if you are an investor in Tesla which you know not everyone is I I do own Tesla stock myself but that's kind of what we're looking forward to as shareholders um and also by the way just they continue to do more work in AI actually we have some updates on this too in the quarter because during the earnings call uh they asked Elon Musk if he would consider in for Tesla to be investing in his private AI company that actually built grock that's a generative AI platform from from Elon Musk you've probably heard of it and musk actually typical musk fashion he just ran a poll on X and he asked people if they would want Tesla to invest $5 billion into his AI uh company they they voted yes and so he said that he would talk to the board about investing uh $5 billion into this company so that's uh something else that is kind of going on in the headlines right now too obviously people have mixed feelings on that some people think that it shouldn't be happening it's like Elon Musk is using Tesla to invest in his own company but other people like the fact that there could be some more integration between Ai and Tesla and it might help them so anyway but that that's just another update that we have from this uh recent earnings this week now uh looking at the stock here in the meantime of course times are still going to be looking very rough right now and because of what we saw in the reports the stock actually fell over 11% this week leaving it now down over 40% from its highs personally I already did all of my buying and test stock so I'm not buying anymore at this time I bought in at much lower levels um that's for my larger private portfolio I do of course have a public Community portfolio where you guys vote for things and have more insight and uh oversight over it and for that portfolio you guys did actually vote to add Tesla stock to that portfolio so we did do some buying of Tesla this year but in my person again in my personal portfolio I'm not really touching I'm just kind of holding the rest of my test position long term for what they can do hopefully in the future not so much what they're doing right now right now times are tough but for what they can hopefully do in the future",

    "company": "GM",
    "excerpt": "now on the other hand of that GM stock on the flip side GM which Again full disclosure I do own it but they just seem to be performing much better with this quarter beating analyst estimates on both the top and bottom line while also putting up much higher growth than Ford with more than a 7% rise in sales a 14% rise in net income and a whopping 37% rise in adjusted ebbit too so kind of like the complete opposite there in terms of profit growth and yet despite also r raising their guidance for the year Wall Street actually sold down the stock by over 10% this week leaving it also down about a quarter of its value from the top this is mostly because of some struggles that they're seeing in China it's been hurting them for a while now their their China business has not been doing very well and so they're now having to make some restructuring deals to adjust to that and on top of this they're also scaling back a little on EVs and autonomy just like Ford and a lot of other autom ERS out there that are struggling to grow with EVS because of the challenging macro environment they're just not seeing adoption take off large enough again that will very likely almost certainly change longer term but in the current moment these companies are just much more profitable with ice Vehicles than they are with EVS so it's kind of just a short-term adjustment which you know for what it is I I I agree that Tesla just continues to go all in on EES I agree with that but at the same time it's not the worst thing in in the world for a company like GM if they can also Lean On Ice Vehicles during weak periods of EV sales which is currently where it's at right now but longer term again that is going to change so you do need to go all in on EVS but it's you know just a little bit slightly different strategy than Tesla's and I don't know I I think both are kind of fine anyway these uh issues I think could hopefully be resolved longer term and overall when looking at GM stock I just can't ignore the fact that it is so incredibly cheap I mean you're talking about a forward PE ratio and peeg ratio of less than five and one respectively which by the way is even cheaper than Ford despite what I feel is much better performance I mean they do much better sales I think their business business is much better Diversified I like their models more personal opinion that's subjective but I do and they seem to be performing much better I mean GM in fact last year was number one in America in uh basically every category they were number one in all Auto Sales even beating out Toyota and they even beat Ford on trucks and SUVs which have you know we always hear about Ford their trucks being the bestselling trucks well no you know GM actually beat them and because of these reasons because of that better diversification the better performance yet the stock price being down and even cheaper than Ford you know I just think the stock is a decent pickup at these prices so I kind of like GM but that's just my opinion I know a lot of people hate GM stock by the way I get lots of comments telling me that GM stock is a horrible stock I happen to like it we just have to disagree on that one but anyway uh the last stock that I'll just quickly mention here we had the internet Tech Giant Google who uh of course one of my favorite stocks it's been one of my favorite for for the past couple years it's been really my number one favorite and they two reported this week and you can kind of guess how that went they too have had a poor performing week with the stock falling almost 8% we've been seeing this with a lot of companies so far in this quarter but in this particular case this was despite the fact that I actually thought Google had an outstanding earnings report as they not only beat on both the top and bottom line which they tend to do every quarter by the way it's pretty uh astonishing that uh they can continue to beat estimates because you got to figure estimates are probably going up and up and up because they're always beating so keep raising it raising raising it and they just keep beating them it's kind of crazy and it just shows how well-run they are but even more impressive than that is how they're still growing at a double digit rate despite their already massive gigantic size with sales Rising about 14% And net income profits soaring by close to 30% that's incredible for their size so why then did the stock fall well the only area that they actually missed analyst expectations on was in YouTube ad Revenue which Wall Street hated to see uh by the way other parts of the business are doing amazingly well search and Cloud put up record numbers and even YouTube was still positive growth in the quarter despite horrible macro conditions where advertising from companies is scaling way back because of the environment but yet you know Google is still putting up growth so I think they did really well but Wall Street just didn't care and they sold down the stock regardless Now granted I will give you the stock was already very high to begin with this is a company here a stock that is valued north of $2 trillion so you're basically just going to have to be putting up incredible perfect numbers every quarter if you want to keep the stock elevated this High I think that's kind of what we're seeing here but I still think that it was a bit of an overreaction uh for the quarter in terms of really good performance the stock actually going down doesn't make a whole lot of sense and uh by the way it was also revealed if you want to talk about YouTube's performance it was revealed recently that YouTube is why watched more than any other streaming platform in America even on televisions how crazy is that even on the big screen on the couch at home YouTube still surpasses Netflix and Disney and HBO and everything else in watch time in America that's insane that's crazy to think about anyway Google still my favorite stock in the market and uh I think it's pretty much always a buy if the time Horizon is long term but yeah that'll just about do it for this week's update I hope you enjoyed it uh let me know your thoughts Down Below in the comment section I'll probably do another update if uh you guys want it I'll probably do another update next Saturday too but for now uh I will catch you in the next video all right thanks for all your support everyone hope you're all doing well I'll catch you in the next one take care everybody bye-bye",
