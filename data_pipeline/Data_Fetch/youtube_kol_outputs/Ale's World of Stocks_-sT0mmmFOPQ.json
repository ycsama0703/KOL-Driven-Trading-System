    "excerpt": "this month I decided to introduce a new stock that I've actually never talked about before on the channel and that is the biotech giant astrazenica ticker symbol AZN who I feel really doesn't get talked about so uh as I should say as often as other big names in the pharmaceutical space simply because the stock hasn't fallen by nearly as much as its peers which gives the perception that the stock is expensive at these levels trading near an all-time high while many of its peers have actually Fallen by huge amounts especially in the case of Ken view Bristol Myers squib and fizer who are each down over 30% 40% and even 50% from their highs and thus carry some really cheap valuations with huge dividend yields but here's the thing guys first of all it's not like Astro zenica has really skyrocketed by some gigantic amount they're only up really around 100% in the past 10 years which I know is really good performance but it's not some crazy gigantic amount that automatically makes them too expensive to be a good investment in fact we've seen tons of other stocks soar by hundreds and even thousands of percents during that same time so for it double in 10 years yeah that's just kind of regular performance for what is already very solid company which by the way you also get what you pay for here cuz in the case of Astro zenica well I feel like they're the best performing player in the space right now I mean just in the past few years alone their sales have nearly doubled in size while their free cash flow has also tripled too that's huge for such an already large and wellestablished pharmaceutical giant to still be putting up that kind of growth and the crazy thing is that that growth isn't even dissipating with sales expected to still Climb by another 133% plus this year with about the same growth on the bottom line expected per year over the next 5 years too and that's because their future looks brighter than ever really thanks to all the Investments that they've made in various Acquisitions as well as in-house development with one of the largest pipelines of treatments at over 180 different projects spending across oncology cardiovascular respiratory and Immunology of which 20 are expected to launch by 2030 which management also claims will propel them to as much as $80 billion in Revenue by that year that's close to double what they're doing right now and even beyond that there's huge growth opportunity still in areas like Gene editing weight management and more that they're already investing in heavily right now so again you just don't see this type of growth in such an already large and dominant and established pharmaceutical job like this and yet the valuation is actually still pretty good with a forward p ratio of less than 19 for context the healthcare average is like around 20 and their peeg ratio of less than one is also considered a great value just on its own as well plus you even get a solid dividend yielding about 2.5% to top it all off which keep in mind that while astroica hasn't uh grown that dividend every year they've at least paid it for decades with the trajectory pretty much always moving upward so it's very likely to continue getting larger too again though I just really feel like this is a stock here that gets overlooked for the wrong reasons and if you're a long-term minded investor looking for a quality biotech that will very likely continue to see both the stock and the dividend grow larger over time well I think this is one here that is worth a closer look I don't own it myself yet because I've really been chasing the higher dividend yields of uh some of its peers and their cheaper valuations that seen their stock stock prices Fallen did yelds have risen I've been kind of chasing those myself but I might have to pick this one up too uh here soon as I just feel like they are much lower risk compared to those others that I've been buying but uh yeah I kind of like the tradeoff here I think this one is a solid pick",

    "excerpt": "if you do want a higher dividend yielding stock with a dirt cheap valuation then stock number two our medium risk option is definitely worth considering and for that stock well we're actually going to go right back to that list that we just looked at and we're going to stick here with another biotech this month and usually I go with fizer in this scenario but I've talked about them so much lately that I want to uh switch things up here and uh tell you why I think that Bristol Meyers squib ticker symbol BM is just as good of a choice here and here's why just look at some of these figures guys from the top Bristol has now lost about half their entire value and is trading lower today than just about any other time in over a decade the result of which is that it's left a giant dividend yield now of close to 6% I think the only time that it was higher than that was during the Great Recession and by the way they've paid that dividend too every year for over 90 years in a row that's nine Decades of dividend payments but then uh you know if all that sounds so great why then is the stock falling right now well it all has to do with current issues that are really disappointing investors at the moment and that's where all the risk comes in because if you're looking for a great performing biotech right now well this isn't like Astro zenica that is obviously on fire Bristol on the other hand is in much more of I would say like a turnaround phase where you're going to have to wait a bit for their longer term prospects to start contributing to their growth again CU at the moment Bristol is facing really one of the steepest patent protection cliffs in the industry with several key drugs either having already lost protection or expected to Lose It by 2020 eight like in the case of their bestselling blood thinner and cancer medications elquist and opdivo uh respectively which by the way make up the number two and number four spots of the top 10 drugs to lose patents protection over the next 5 years according to Pro Clinical Research and as a result of some other ongoing issues too while sales for the company have actually steadily decreased in recent years which isn't a good sign with even this year also expected to see over a 90% reduction to their profits by EPS however this is where really all the bad news mostly ends for me as an investor cuz well first of all that loss in EPS is mostly due to onetime charges from their $14 billion acquisition in karuna uh Pharmaceuticals which when accounted for their PE ratio it appears to be extremely high at over 70 right now but when you look beyond that well their EPS is actually expected to recover in the following year which drops their p ratio to less than six that is dirt cheap guys and even more so when you look at their price to free cash flow which sits below seven guys that's much less than the majority of their peers in fact that's a similar valuation to many tobacco companies which have always been considered some of the cheapest stocks in the entire market and so when you add that with the dividend and the fact that Bristol has now acquired multiple different companies to build out their future pipeline including just some very recent ones again in karuna but also Mora Therapeutics and also rais bio all three of which by the way have experimental Therapies in late stage clinical trials that could become Blockbuster drugs generating over a billion dollars in annual revenue each with also their already existing growth portfolio of 12 younger drugs they're starting to see momentum having increas their sales by 11% last quarter year-over-year well all of these positive signs together I feel leaves me with a really wellestablished lead in this space that is currently down because of a short-term kind of transitionary period that does add some risk to it why I chose it as a medium risk option but longer term uh I also feel that it does give me a lot of turnaround potential that I just think is worth taking a Chance on So I've been buying the stock myself for that really cheap valuation and the big dividend",

    "excerpt": "with all of that said though we are now down to the third and final stock this is the highest risk option of the bunch and this month I'm going with probably my top two favorite International stock in the entire world and that is by do ticker symbol biu I probably choose Alibaba as my number one favorite but BYU is a close second and most recently I just can't believe how cheap their stock has become having now lost well over 70% of its entire value from the top leaving it also trading for one of the absolute lowest prices that we've seen in over a decade and look there's a lot of reasons that we could point to for this namely Tech crackdowns in China Rising competition in Ai and Tech and just an overall slowdown in the country's economy that is making things even more challenging for BYU with sales only growing Now by a mid to low single digit rate but I just think that at these levels we're now talking about an incredible value here in the stock that we would really only ever get from probably a Chinese player like this cuz obviously you're not going to get something like Google for anywhere close to by's price not even in the same like universe it really only can come from a Chinese stock like this with that inherent risk um that Chinese stocks carry uh because they are Chinese stocks that have a lot of I don't have time to get into all the issues that they have but you know they have VI structures you have little rights as a shareholder there's a lot of things that could potentially go wrong with a Chinese company that is publicly traded and um you could be left with very little uh protection there as a foreign investor but I just feel that in exchange for that risk again categorize it as a highrisk option but in exchange for that I just see I just think there's so much future potential here that makes it kind of worth it now just to give you like a few examples of what I'm talking about here in terms of what makes SP do so special well they're not only already a leader in China of search with by far the most market share uh also digital advertising with the fourth most market share cloud with the number one most Cloud AI market share and even autonomous driving with the first launched Robo taxi service in the country but most important of all they are genuinely a leader of AI in the entire world guys with more AI patents than any other company out there and so when we think about the future of AI and how companies want to use it to dominate business we know that it's one of the biggest areas of investment right now maybe the biggest and we know that countries and militaries want to dominate AI for what it means to just their own kind of competition and dominance in the world but also their economies for defense purposes for civil infrastructure the way they want to run everything more efficiently and profitably and so if you're a weaker player well AI can kind of help you grow to the next level if you're an already established leader AI can help you maintain your dominance there's so many reasons why I think so much of the world is going to rely just so heavily on AI and it's become very obvious at this point and because of that I just can't Envision a scenario where by becomes any less relevant uh as a world leader in this space where they hold so many patents and so much technology ol and even all the data that they have access to and that they will continue to collect over time and uh when I look at that entire picture there's just no way in heck that I think it should ever be trading at one of the lowest prices here in you know decades with the valuation now also close to 40% cheaper than the sector on PE and Peg ratios that's mind-blowingly low for a world leader like this in Ai and it's also more than 50 to 60% cheaper than their own 5-year averages too guys there's similar Tech Giants that trade for literally trillions of dollars in market cap in large part because they're not Chinese which I grant you is a big deal again for byd and why I consider them highrisk but for by to only be worth around 30 billion by comparison I mean damn they did over 130 billion in sales and over 20 billion in net income Profit just last year alone so how in the world can they be trading this low it is truly mind-boggling to me but again it mostly has to do with them being a Chinese stock and yeah that's a risk that will pretty much always be there but I just don't Envision that being as maybe as big of a threat as most others believe I could be wrong for sure but look you know the US and China I don't think are ever going to go to war at least not anytime soon and even if they do you know the world probably ending at that point I think we'd have bigger concerns than just this one little stock but I also think that it's in China's best interest for their own AI leader to be a global player with exposure to foreign markets and foreign investments so I don't think it'll ever be Dlisted or shut down either it's just my opinion can I could be wrong and there is certainly a lot more Nuance here that uh you know we'd probably have to dive into as opposed to this just being a short YouTube video just giving you my quick thoughts on a beaten down stock here that I think has a lot of potential but look that's why I chose it as the high risk option I grant you that it's you know not great for everyone it's only a very small position of mine it's around 1 to 2% of my portfolio I keep it very low for a reason but at these prices I do think that it is a stock worth uh betting on because I just don't think we'd ever get a stock like this at these prices if if it weren't you know if it didn't have those other issues but uh the potential there is tremendous for everything that BYU does",
