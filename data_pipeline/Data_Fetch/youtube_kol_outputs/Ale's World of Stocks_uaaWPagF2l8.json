I know like Tesla is one of our smaller ones there's other ones too so there's definitely some stocks that we can add more exposure to. when it comes to like the future of the automotive industry and technology and electric vehicles and autonomous driving I prefer Tesla so I just always kind of invested in Tesla instead of Ford.
