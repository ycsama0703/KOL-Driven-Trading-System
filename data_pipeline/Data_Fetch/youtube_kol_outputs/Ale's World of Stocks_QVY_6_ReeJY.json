    "excerpt": "hey what's up everyone so as you know Tesla's Robo taxi event is coming up very soon later this week on Thursday and it's expected to have major implications on Tesla's business and the stock so in today's video I want to do a quick Roundup for you guys of what's being expected and any leaks or predictions that we have so far from analyst including potentially new models being unveiled more progress on the Tesla robot and May maybe even a collaboration with McDonald's we'll get into all of that and more so let's go ahead and jump straight into it all right so before we get into any rumors what can we realistically expect so far well there's a couple things that we already know first of all we know that the event was delayed about 2 months so that musk could make what he called quote an important design change to the robo taxi and to have quote extra time to allow them to show off a few other things okay so that's kind of the first hint right there that this event will not just be about the robo taxi but there will actually be in fact other products and services announced now again this should include the robo taxi which Elon has referred to in the past as a cyber cab so there is some speculation going around that it could potentially have some similar design qualities to the Cyber truck however I don't think that's very likely myself most analysts and the media largely expect it to look very similar to a smaller Sedan like the model 3 have that type of design and that's kind of what I'm leaning towards myself too however we'll come back to that in just a second when we talk about another potential model we'll get into that in just a second now on top of this there may be estimates on the potential size of a robo taxi market and how Tesla can tap into it what they're planning for that maybe give us a timeline for when they would finally achieve that unsupervised full self-driving what kind of impact their AI driven revenues will have on their business going forward and perhaps show off their growing work in robotics too with of course the Tesla bot and everything else that they do now this may not sound too exciting at first glance we'll get into the more juicy stuff here in just a second but you know some analysts are actually not expecting a whole lot from this event Bank of America for for example said that ever since the delays they've actually been tempering their expectations in terms of when Robo taxi Fleet actually launches and the event they feel will be more logistical really than anything else as they help investors understand their current capabilities with autonomous driving how the fleet would operate and give any updates on regulatory approval around the world so more kind of the boring type of stuff kind of the logistical stuff maybe more so for invest ERS than something to get like really excited about right but you know this of course is the big question when it comes to Tesla and and the robo taxi right is uh you know we still don't live in a world where Robo taxis are freely out there commonly available to most people there's still a ton of Regulation and red tape that Tesla will have to overcome in order to be able to have you know this Robo taxi service out there in the market which by the way I recently mentioned in another video uh just a recent one that I actually think one of the ways is that Elon Musk May benefit from his closer now relationship to Donald Trump after of course endorsing him is that if Trump were to win I think Trump would likely return you know try to return the favor to musk and help Tesla get over some of those regulatory hurdles that they have Trump is of course pretty well known for wanting deregulation and stuff like that so you know now they're kind of Buddy Buddies know I'm sure musk is uh being the businessman that he is is probably going to ask Trump for help if he has the opportunity to right I mean it just makes sense but that is of course all speculation on my part I'm just kind of guessing here anyway I do think that you know a lot of this stuff does make sense but I personally am actually a little more hyped than that because I do think that there is a reason why this event was delayed and I feel that it was so that they could do something a bit more attention grabbing in Elon Musk and Tesla type fashion so that they could unveil maybe a few more things and get people excited and you know obviously try to drive up that stock price right so with that in mind let's go ahead and talk about now all the rumors and kind of speculation going around about what could possibly also be unveiled at this event well for sure the biggest prediction making the rounds right now comes from Jean moner this is a wellknown analyst from Deep waterer management who is also a longtime Tesla boy he's invested in Tesla and he made some very interesting predictions for this event in fact he predicts that Tesla will unveil three brand new vehicle types at the event now he does say that Tesla will be light on details here like usual right every time that they announce something new it's very exciting but you know you don't get into all the all the nitty-gritty all the details for it until later on it doesn't end up becoming a reality many times for years when Tesla first announces a product but yeah that's what he's saying here that it's going to be light on details but in all he expects to see a robo taxi as well as a $25,000 EV what we've been referring to as the model 2 for years now and also a robo van which is super interesting now starting with the $25,000 car first this actually does make some sense to me because you know moner thinks that it will just be a strip down version of the model 3 which as we covered before the Robo taxi is also likely to have a lot of similarities to a model 3 so the way I see it if you're Tesla and you're going to develop a new vehicle a robo taxi specifically for autonomous driving keep in mind you're a business so you want to maximize efficiencies and margins and profitability and you want to be able to scale up as quickly as possible too for as little cost as possible well what's the easiest you know kind of simplest way of doing that of course you're going to take something that you already have that you're experienced with that you know how to build and and produce Mass produce and you're just going to try to tweak it modify it a little bit to fit those specific needs by the way Tesla has always really done this if you think about it apart from the cybertruck most Tesla vehicles look very similar I mean let's be real guys the average person out there you see a Tesla you know flying by you the average person that doesn't own one uh they're probably going to be guessing what kind of model that is I mean if you just ask what what model is that it's like H you know model 3 Model y model X model S I don't you know like they look very similar the designs are very similar so yeah it does make sense here uh to do the same thing with the model 2 have it be similar to a model 3 a strip down version cheaper one easier to manufacture maybe less Parts less components less you know Technologies less performance but just make it easier to to produce so that you could sell it for a lower uh price now I guess the only kind of caveat to that would be that mus did call it a a cyber Cab in the past but uh like I said I don't think that he really meant it to be very similar to a cyber truck I mean we'll see I could be wrong but you know musk has said kind of outlandish things in the past and you know ended up changing course so I feel like this is just going to be kind of that strip down version simple model 2 simple Robo taxi that you can produce Mass produce and maybe like I said remove some components people are saying that the robo taxi may not have a steering wheel may not have pedals maybe something just for autonomous driving and nothing else so that is a possibility too and then if you uh you know if you want those things if you actually want a steering wheel if you want the pedals you want all all that extra stuff stuff you could get a model two or even a model 3 if you want to go a little bit higher in price but yeah maybe you could get a model two maybe um you can add on full self-driving and you could still add your vehicle to the robo taxi Fleet right so that's probably what's going to happen if you want to just go straight for a robo taxi you can get the robo taxi that is just you know just for that purpose alone that's going to be something that more so I think Tesla would be using themselves and then you know for consumers you get a model 2 it can do everything you get it with the full self-driving same thing for model 3 Model S whatever else and you could add it to the robo taxi Fleet all of that just kind of makes sense to me for for a kind of a business model anyway Monster uh also expects the model 2 to start production late next year towards the end of 2025 which is just a bit later than what Elon predicted last quarter and yeah that does make sense here because elon's timelines do tend to be pretty much always off so you know you kind of want to push that out a little bit further than what musk usually is expecting right either way though I think both models the model 2 and the robo taxi are going to be very crucial upcoming launches for Tesla and it's for sure why the stock is as expensive as it is right now with pretty much all valuation metrics just being extremely high for them you can see that right here and the stock of course has fallen over 40% from the top more recently but it's still up over 1,000% in the past 5 years so growth will be very crucial for them going forward especially you know because deliveries have been essentially plateauing over the past year or so right around that kind of four to 500,000 quarterly Mark so you're just not seeing that high growth from Tesla that you have in the past this I think is that next leg up for them this is what this is that next growth driver that I think they're going to really be pushing for and I think that's why the stock is valued so high so this is very important this is an important event guys if you're a Tesla investor uh yeah a lot is I think is going to is going to ride on this event now having said that you bring a cheaper Mass Market vehicle somewhere around that $25,000 Mark I think that's really big for them and for their business and for growth because all of a sudden you're no longer that very limited uh luxury vehicle type of competitor now you're starting to steal market share from Toyota Camry and Corollas Honda Accords and Civics that's a giant market to tap into guys and then of course Robo taxis that's kind of like the cherry on top obviously that's maybe further a further way out because of all the regulations and all that kind of stuff but if you're quick to Market on that at least one of the first early movers that's another brand new market all on its own all on its own too so there's the cheaper cars to tap into that's already a giant established Market to tap into and then you have Robo taxis creating a brand new market too so those are two gigantic growth drivers that I think could give Tesla that explosive growth that the stock you know needs at that valuation of course there's other things too though Tesla has always uh argued that they're not just a Vehicles company they're an AI company a robotics company they do energy battery storage even Logistics now with the semi you know coming up they're going to do more stuff with that so there's many things that they're trying to do now to justify that high valuation I think we could see some new developments there too at this event especially the Tesla bot maybe they showed off doing more factory work I think that's really going to be the biggest selling point for the Tesla bot cuz consumers I think that's a little bit further off again regulations and then just like you know regular people I think you're just going to be slow to want a a a weird you know kind of creepy robot in their house so I think the bigger Market to start off with is going to be Factory office work doing those mundane tasks that nobody wants to do and you put in a Tesla bought there automate things bring costs lower and I think that could actually be huge you know in an economy where people businesses are trying to lower costs as much as possible especially lately with inflation and everything else that's been going on okay now moving on to the next juicy part here this is something that I think a lot of people have kind of just forgot about but mooner brings it up here that Third vehicle that he mentions being a Tesla van now what the heck is this there's there's no way that Tesla is just going to come out and Ann announce a van right at this event like that that would be shocking right well look surprisingly I actually think that it's very possible that they show one off and here's why first of all we actually heard about a Tesla van both a long time ago and even as recently as this year in fact I remember hearing about it all the way back in like 2019 when musk put out his master plan part two where he specifically pointed to heavyduty trucks and a quote high passenger density Urban transport sounds an awful lot like some kind of van right well just a short while after revealing the cybertruck musk took to Twitter again to say quote it probably makes sense to build a van off the pickup truck chassis and there's even more evidence just like this that Elon has often thought about making a Tesla van in fact back in their investor dat of last year musk showed this slide here that contains two new Vehicles covered up with a sheet over them right next to the Cyber Tru well clearly one of those is probably the robo taxi vehicle or or like the model 2 while the other is I would say just as clearly in that taller shape of a traditional van or some type of larger transport vehicle and it doesn't even stop there guys earlier this year that's right this exact year it was reported back around I think it was like March that Tesla was in talks with the Italian government to potentially build a new Factory there to make electric trucks and vans so clearly this is something that has very much so been in the works at least just in the maybe conceptual or kind of Developmental phase of it but if they happen to come out at this event and show off not just a robo taxi sedan but also a robotaxi van of some sort what a pretty good bet that the media is going to run wild with that and even Wall Street will probably start to factor that into their analysis too because a Van's just going to be more efficient right could fit more people do more rides so it's going to be good for business after all the robo taxi Market itself should be worth trillions of dollars long term and so tackling that with two different vehicle types plus you also have the release of the cheaper Mass Market you know model to with an added option perhaps for full self-driving at an added cost that people can also add to that Fleet and make a little extra money on the side maybe even you know what if Tesla ends up subsidizing some of that what if they tell people okay you buy the Tesla Model 2 maybe you add it to the fleet for let's say a certain required amount of time every month and we'll pay for the self-driving features that could be you know potentially something that they end up offering in the future too if they need it if they need more Vehicles out on the road maybe they don't but if they need it they could subsidize it that way too uh because it what does it cost them it doesn't cost them anything to let people use f full self-driving it's just going to make them money right all of this is going to be super high margin for Tesla this is all services this is software so that's another route that they could take and these could be big game changers for them and so you know I think any type of like surprises like that we know can go a long way with a stock like Tesla that does tend to get so overhyped uh you know whenever they have events like this right so anyway I'll just finish this little segment here with something that Dan Ives wrote about the upcoming event this is another analyst here this is a major bull for Tesla he's from wed Bush and he said quote we believe the robo Taxi day will be a seminal and historical day for musk and Tesla and it marks a new chapter of growth around autonomous full self-driving and AI uh future at Tesla we continue to believe Tesla is the most undervalued AI name in the market and we expect musk and Company to unveil some game-changing autonomous technology at this event adding that Tesla is more than just an EV vendor and that it's push into Ai and Robotics will be a key turning point for them in the future as they value their Ai and full self-driving capabilities at a trillion dollars alone for Tesla over the coming years and that this event will be a watershed moment for them to kick off this era of AI at Tesla thus he maintained his outperform rating with a $300 price Target on the stock so yeah guys those are some very bullish sentiments there it's going to be uh I would say it's going to suck a lot if um Tesla comes out and disappoints like what if they just come out what if they just like show a concept of a robo taxi and that's it like no Hardware no demos nothing it's all just like the same stuff that we've already known that would suck it would probably tank the stock a bit and uh you know I'm of course not hoping for that because I own Tesla stock myself so I'm hoping that it will be this really cool fun event and we get some surprises but you know all we can really do is wait and see at this point but uh yeah there's a lot of hype going into this event it's a very crucial event and yeah it's going to suck if they don't show off some cool stuff but it I think it'll also be really good if they do so we'll see we'll see what happens anyway um oh you know I almost forgot uh by the way those two covered up vehicles that I showed you earlier in this video um did do you guys know what musk actually said about those it was pretty interesting so he said that this was way back when when he when he unveiled it not that it was like a year ago or something but when he unveiled these he said um obviously we've got some new products that we're working on under the covers I think these are going to be pretty special I think people at first may think oh it's not going to be that amazing but just wait it will be so that's pretty interesting too that that's again in reference to the the two cars that were covered up with a sheet one being probably the cheaper Robo taxi type of car and then the other one is probably the van so he's saying it's going to be something special he's saying just wait you'll see could they be unveiled you know could there be talked about more this event we'll we'll we'll have to see hopefully hopefully we'll get some stuff all right very last piece of speculation here there was some new rumors about a possible partnership with McDonald's because apparently McDonald's posted on X a picture of a meal in a McDonald's bag and it had the robo taxis event date of 1010 on it and in the receipt it said not a Big Mac which seemed to be in reference to when Elon Musk made the flamethrower with his boring company and called it not a flamethrower and then Elon even replied to this tweet uh with a laughing face so everyone kind of ran with it they thought maybe are we about to get some type of announcement here of a partnership where Tesla robotaxis are going to be delivering McDonald's food what what does this mean well uh sorry to burst the bubble guys but if you look at that tweet it said chat is about to pop off 1010 which kind of made it made it seem like they might be referring to some type of streaming event because of the chat whatever and then yeah sure enough it was later revealed that some famous streamer is actually going to do some type of collaboration with McDonald's I guess on that day which is kind of weird that it's happens to me on that day so uh yeah that appears to be all it is I mean we'll have to wait and see but it it looks like it's not going to be anything important it looks like it's just McDonald's with some type of streamer and it just happens to be on that day maybe they chose that day to try to get some attention who knows but anyway that was that um oh by the way uh you know in the future uh deals like that between um Tesla and McDonald's or something else those could actually be huge for them in the future too because you know if you think about it like in California for example wages for fast food restaurants are are really high so a lot of these restaurant companies they've been laying off a ton of workers like McDonald's laid off tons of people in California and one of the things that McDonald's has been doing is they've been trying to make their rest restaurants uh more autonomous and not have to have as many workers right well you know if Tesla's Robo taxi service all of a sudden can start delivering food too and some of that process can be automated yeah that could help cut down on cost too and it could be another potential growth driver for Tesla so keep an eye on that too keep an eye on you know McDonald's too and what they might be doing with that but anyway that's obviously more longterm all of this stuff is very longterm at this point because because again I still think like the biggest hurdle is going to be regulatory approval all that kind of stuff until we really see autonomous cars just driving on their own out on the road you know I think it's going to be a little while but like I said I think having that friendship with the president maybe it gets you there a little faster I don't know I'm just kind of speculating but anyway uh let me know what you guys think uh I'll let you know if anything changes if I hear of any big news coming up for the event and maybe I'll do an update video after the event let me know if you guys would want to see that and I can kind of run through everything that was announced I don't know let me know if you'd want to see that but uh thanks again for stopping by my friends thank you for all your support let me know down in the comment section how you feel about all of this let me know how you feel about Tesla and the stock and uh yeah I'll catch you in the next video guys hope you enjoyed it all right I'll see you guys later take care bye-bye",
