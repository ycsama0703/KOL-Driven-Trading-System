    "excerpt": "Altria ticker symbol m Mo which it's States dividend yield over 8% sector Consumer Staples specifically to and then for why it's a good choice it says Altria consistently offers one of the highest dividend yields in the market supported by its resilience cash flow from the to sector while the to Industry faces regulatory headwinds Altria has invested in Alternatives like eci's and can it's strong dividend history and focus on returning Capital to shareholders makes it a reliable uh high yield option. Altria I've always really thought of as the type of stock that we all kind of know is a good value it's a very logical stock to buy for any income and value oriented investors out there with a dirt cheap PE ratio that is over 40% lower than the sector median while the dividend also yields over 8% with more than five Decades of consecutive growth those two things alone the valuation and the dividend are among the most attractive in the entire Market. however it's a to company that many people just kind of you know don't really feel too comfortable investing in which even I myself kind of struggle with that conundrum like you know on one hand the logical part of my brain tells me that stocks are just stocks and people can make their own individual decisions on what they consume and if I boycott this stock well then where do I draw the line should I also boycott you know car companies because of all the car accidents out there or junk food companies like Coca-Cola PepsiCo McDonald's when you know one the probably like the biggest cause of death in America is heart disease and I'm pretty sure I could really find like a moral reason to not invest in literally any company in the entire world because of how often you know companies care about more more about profits than they do about the health of their customers and yet I still can't bring myself to buy this stock and I can't really give you any kind of logical reason for it other than just kind of the purely emotional part of me just refuses to buy a smoking related company or even like a you know maybe like a weapons manufacturer things that I know just can cause a lot of death and destruction and uh you know I admit that that makes me 100% a hypocrite because I also own PepsiCo stock I Own auto companies Pharmaceuticals and more all of which have done you know Shady things in the past but uh you know just kind of trying to put my personal bias aside for a minute here because I still have to do my job I have to make this video for you guys so when looking at Altria well as GPT mentioned they have at least tried diversifying into other offerings too for growth which of course they Market that as much as possible with the first thing you see when clicking on their website is how they offer more smokeless products than ever before. They also invested in anheiser Bush which you know Al perhaps tends to be a little less stigmatized and even Kronos group for exposure into the can Market as well they also spent nearly $3 billion to acquire enjoy which is a maker of VAP products who also had a big win recently back in June being the first flavored VAP products to get FDA approval however these moves have yet to really kind of move the needle much on the top line in fact sales not only declined in both of the last 2 years but are also expected to slightly drop in the next 2 years as well assuming that that does end up happening well it would technically be four consecutive years of Revenue declines for the company however those are very tiny drops and considering how strongly profitable they are with that cheap valuation and the mouthwatering dividend I can absolutely understand why anyone would be buying the stock right here and I'm going to rank them around the middle at number three because of it until I see what else is on this list. all right now while I may not be buying all Tria stock myself at least not at the moment. because Altria also has a bigger yield well I'm actually going to put this one even behind them too. Altria number three.",

    "excerpt": "V Properties secret symbol VI which GPT had this to say about it vich properties is a re with a portfolio of highquality entertainment and gaming properties and including casinos like Caesar's Palace uh the long-term inflation protected leases ensure stable cash flows V's high yield and growth potential through Acquisitions make it an appealing choice in the real estate sector especially as the gaming industry rebounds and yeah what I particularly like about this pick here is that it's in a market that I don't ever see going away by the way we know I just talked about how I'm kind of a hypocrite cuz you know the emotional part of me can't invest in a company like Altria but I also like vich properties and they're in the gaming kind of you know casinos and gambling type of area but at least I admit that I'm a hypocrite right so hopefully that counts for something but I don't want to go too deep into that but uh yeah like I said I do actually like vich properties as a stock um and again the reason why is because the market is does actually seem very resilient to me it's not like retail for example where you could argue that maybe the rise of e-commerce is going to put a lot of breaken mortar retail stores out of business and thus hurt the rats that lease to them Office Buildings would also be a great example of this you know they're more vulnerable to the economy and to the rise in remote working Trends we've seen big swings in that of course during the pandemic both in the economy and in the rise of remote work you know really hurting th those companies well vichi on the other hand well they actually collected 100% of their rent during the height of the pandemic even when the Las Vegas Strip was shut down which really shows just how much more resilient they are with high quality tenants especially in areas of entertainment and gaming properties like casinos for example I mean have you ever gone to a casino they they typically don't struggle they're usually packed a lot of people there and they make a ton of money and I also don't think they're ever going to disappear anytime soon because you know people obviously enjoy gambling and going somewhere for entertainment and all that kind of stuff so that's a very resilient Market in my opinion which in the case of well they lease their land and properties to Giant players like those in Vegas including MGM Grand the Venetian manday Bay Caesar's Palace and more as well as even more giant properties across 26 states in the country the results being that their funds from operations have been rising while the dividend payout ratio remains well covered speaking of which that dividend currently yields over 5% which should become even more attractive over time as the FED rates continue to drop the stock itself has been a decent enough performer over the years but isn't up any kind of crazy amount and I still think it's a buy right here in fact I might even pick this one up myself very soon too I'm glad GPT reminded me of it cuz I was actually looking at them a little while back and uh yeah this reminded me that I actually do want to buy this stock so I'm going to rank it pretty high here I'll put it at number two for now uh cuz like I said I am a hypocrite I would actually buy vichi instead of uh alria anyway. I'm going to keep vichi actually at the top. leaving us with my final rankings here of vich at number one.",

    "excerpt": "well this one is actually a stock that I own myself and that is Merc ticker symbol MRK with a dividend yield close to 3% within the health care sector specifically Pharmaceuticals with GPT saying MC offers a lower dividend yield compared to others on the list but is one of the most stable pharmaceutical companies globally it's cancer drug K truda and robust drug pipeline provide long-term growth opportunities merc's consistent dividend growth and strong fundamentals make it a conservative but solid pick in the health care sector and yeah that's exactly the reason why I'm invested in them too when it comes to Pharmaceuticals mark is really one of the largest out there last year for example they were only behind fiser ABY and J&amp;J their K truda drug was the best selling in the world their financials have been steadily growing for years they're solidly profitable they had a little correction last year and it was really due to onetime charges though but both sales and profits are rising back up to record highs again with double digigit EPS growth and even though the stock has risen along with them a recent dip has actually left the valuation much cheaper than the sector on virtually any metric you look at with also a still pretty attractive dividend of close to 3% with also some decent enough growth metrics on it too there are concerns of pan protections uh expiring like is the case with many you know Pharmaceuticals out there but MC is doing literally everything they can and and should to invest in new growth opportunities with Rising R&amp;D spend every year last year by the way was the largest in the entire world for pharmaceuticals and a large part of which was in New Deals in Japan for key cancer treatments and they have a growing pipeline of drugs and treatments with lots of future potential too so I agree with the pick here the only thing that I'll say though is that fizer and Bristol Meers are a little more attractive to me at the moment because of their bigger dividend yields and because of that I'm going to keep vichi actually at the top and squeeze MC in between them and Altria at number two.
