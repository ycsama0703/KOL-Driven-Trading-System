    "excerpt": "purchase number one was actually a stock that I think is pretty reliable longterm and that is a MD ticker symbol AMD which Kathy picked up over 7,000 new shares of at over a million do worth of stock and yeah I actually really like this pickup here in fact I used to be heavily invested in AMD myself back in the day but after a skyrocketed in price I ended up selling those shares for a huge profit and I ended up focusing more heavily ever since on investing in Nvidia instead But after those movements more recently AMD has actually Fallen back down a little bit in price losing a quarter of its value from the top which kind of shockingly I mean I you know I would bet that most of you might not even know this but amd's valuation as of right now currently sits about 40% lower than the sector Median on a PEG ratio basis which is incredible AMD has really always been kind of a more highly valued growth stock but what's happening here is that uh they really grew a lot during the pandemic years where their financial skyrocketed but coming off of that there was a small pull back there like a correction and that caused the stock to fall now I know that their regular pees are a lot higher at the moment but that's because those use current financials whereas with AMD you really have to look out further into the future for for the recovery taking place where for example sales are expected to soar Again by a double digit rate this year and another close to 30% next year too while their EPS profits are also expected to rise by over 30% per year over the next 5 years which is why that valuation is so cheap on that PEG ratio basis and you know it's really easy to understand why AMD would have high expectations for the future because I I'll put it this way what I always liked about AMD is that for example Nvidia always focused on dominating gpus while Intel focused on dominating CPUs and of course with the rise of AI well gpus ended up having you know much more success and thus helping Nvidia but what I always liked about AMD is that they kind of play this cheaper alternative option or role you know to both sides of of those markets and to this day they remain well Diversified across CPUs gpus apus even AI accelerators which are a new type of Chip and all of that really um helps them diversify across many different segments and markets consumer computers business computers high performance you know graphical design AI the data center and even gaming a lot of people don't know this but AMD actually is used by both Xbox and Playstation so they're big in gaming too and so coming off of the pandemic correction as that alternative option to the other Giants I just feel it leaves AMD with a very kind of lucrative spot to capitalize on because these markets will be worth trillions of dollars long term and customers will look for multiple options it's not just going to be Nvidia yet Wall Street is kind of pricing them as if it is that way but I don't believe that I think there's so much more room for AMD to compete in and to grow and we're already seeing that recovery take place with them with last quarter seing sales rebound margins rebound and even their profits by EPs and net income Rose by 700 and 800% respectively and when you look at their most important segment of all the data center that houses all of their work in AI will sales more than doubled while operating income soared by over 400% to now generating the most most profits of all for them so I do believe that AMD is on the right track for long-term success and even though I already own tons of Nvidia stock and even a little bit of Intel stock too I'm actually thinking about buying back into AMD soon here as well I might do it I don't know it's looking tempting but uh yeah I think there's multiple room for I think there's room for multiple players I should say out there and AMD stock does look attractive at the moment so I agree with K Cathy's pickup here and I'm going to rank it pretty high at number to for now until I see what else is on this list.",

    "company": "Blade Air Mobility",
    "excerpt": "moving on to the next purchase this one is for sure a much more speculative higher risk pickup here and that is blade air Mobility ticker symbol bde which Kathy purchased over 400,000 shares of in October valued at about $1.5 million now the reason that I say that this one is very speculative is because it's essentially a penny stock here it's only worth about $3 at the moment after falling dram atically from their 2021 IPO I think around that time it was like over $10 a share so that's like three times higher than where it sits today now that may present a good buying opportunity and Kathy certainly seems to think so here as it's down but I'm a little more hesitant on this one myself if you've never heard of them blade is kind of like an air taxi type of service where they partner with aircraft operators to then provide short trips to paying customers usually in the form of helicopters for example the largest part of their business right now at around 60% of sales is in helping hospitals speed up the delivery of vital organs for transplants however the more widely known part of their business although it's smaller at the remaining 40% is in providing short range air travel to regular consumers especially quick trips from densely populated cities over to airports for example where the customers can then catch their longer range flights it's of course just a time-saving kind of specific service that customers are willing to pay a premium price for for example a quick helicopter ride between Manhattan and the JFK Airport takes less than 5 minutes for them but it's going to cost you about $200 per person now I don't disagree that that's a cool service in itself I mean they even have lounges at airports with great reviews the helicopter rides seem to be fun and even Scenic and they even have a pickup car service too to take you to the helicopter but I just think it's more of a nich kind of Market here for people with perhaps I would say disposable income that can afford it or especially people on vacation or for business travel where maybe the company might even pay for it and sure that might be a large enough market for them to have relative success in but again I just feel that that's a little bit Limited in scope I can see it being a popular option in really densely populated cities but not a whole lot anywhere else and the average person I just feel would rather save the money and just maybe use a Uber or use their own car or have a friend drive them to the airport stuff like that so I'm just not sure that this is really a giant enough market to be investing heavily into because when you look at their financials sales did rise a lot these past couple years but losses have been heavily in the red and they're upcoming Revenue growth of only around 10% expected in the next 2 years just isn't enough to really Overlook that in my opinion now I do think it's relatively fairly valued as a speculative kind of futur looking stock with a PS ratio of about one that's roughly what I would expect for a stock like this but even then I just think that there's much more interesting speculative stocks out there that I'd rather be gambling on so it's going to be a pass for me and I'll give it the number four ranking for now.",

    "company": "Tesla",
    "excerpt": "now moving on to purchase number three though we actually have a stock that I am heavily invested in myself and that is Tesla ticker symbol TSLA which Kathy picked up another 13,000 shares of this October at almost $3 million worth and yeah no surprise here right I mean we all know that Kathy has been one of the biggest Tesla Bulls throughout history and even recently to this day she still has one of the most bullish price Targets on the stock in fact Arc actually just updated their price targets for Tesla back in June giving Tesla a base price of $2600 per share by 2029 that's over a 1,000% increase from where it trades today day and even in the bare case scenario they expect it to rise to $2,000 that's an 800% increase and in the bull case they think it could even break north of $3,000 per share which would be over a 1300% increase that's pretty wild now for its part Tesla stock has actually been struggling a lot recently losing uh about close to half its value from the top and while they are working on very Innovative Technologies some of which were shown off at the recent robo taxi event the fact is that these initiatives are still likely to be at least a couple years out before reaching you know public roads if that but uh yeah when talking about Tesla it is going to be a little hard to convey the bullish Viewpoint to the average person out there because it really is that very long-term uh minded type of company with you know Robotics and Ai and Robo taxis and and a robo van and battery storage all of these types of markets can be worth you know trillions in the future and likely will be but they're markets that are still I feel a long ways out until we reach those levels until they mature until they develop and so at the moment I just feel that Tesla stock is going to be probably a little more so in control by the Bears and the Bulls at least in it has been in the past and I feel that that's going to cause some volatility and make this stock a little riskier than usual especially at the current valuation that is hundreds of percents more expensive than the sector cuz you have to remember guys even with the recent dip the stock is technically still up by well over a th% just in the past 5 years alone so it's climbed a lot now don't get me wrong I do love the growth that Tesla has had in recent years which is why the stock has risen by so much and there's of course a reason why it's still a top five holding of mine because of how much I believe in their future potential but at the moment I'm just saying we have to be honest about the difficult kind of Correctional period that Tesla is in right now where sales are almost flat this year and it's going to take a better I feel macroeconomy with less inflation lower interest rates and some of their future markets actually materializing and taking shape for that growth to shoot up you know back up once again at least in my opinion so for that reason I'm going to rank them at number three for now despite this being a stock that I own myself just because it really is more of a long-term stock that I think most investors and Traders wouldn't have the patience for or maybe the stomach for that volatility of it all.",

    "company": "Amazon",
    "excerpt": "this will bring us now to the final two purchases of the list these were the largest of the bunch here and coming in at number four what's actually my Far and Away favorite of the entire list and that is Amazon ticker symbol amzn which Kathy picked up close to 300,000 more shares of worth over $14 million and yeah I love this pickup here I'm obviously not going to be you know super excited about Amazon's current price trading right near a record high but when it comes to Amazon I'm always willing to pay that premium price tag for what is in my opinion one of the most crucial dominant and just heavily relied on businesses in the world both right now and for the future particularly with e-commerce and cloud computing where they completely dominate both markets and those are two of really the most important markets in the entire world for the future as well but even in the other stuff that they do too that they do so well there's still so much more future potential and growth for them to tap into like for example in digital advertising that used to really be a duopoly just with Google and meta controlling the market but now you see Amazon closing in and turning that into much more of a triopoly while still growing their sales for the segment at over 20% a 20% clip there and that's just one example but really every part of Amazon's business continues to be on fire and that's why they do over half a trillion dollars in sales and yet are still somehow managing to grow at a double digit rate despite that enormous size it's really incredible and because they never cared about profits in the past well there's still huge room for expansion on the bottom line too which is why I actually think that the stock price should be even higher than where it already is if you're thinking long term over the past year for example their free cash flow skyrocketed by nearly 600% and yet Amazon's market cap is still still well over a trillion dollar less than both apple and Nvidia something that doesn't really make a lot of sense to me considering that I would much rather own Amazon stock over either of those other two and so I know it's hard to look at Amazon as kind of a slept on stock when their products are used by so many people and the company is so well known but I actually do think there is a little bit of a slepton kind of nature to the stock when you consider their profit potential longterm and because of that I'm easily giving them the number one ranking here on this list.",

    "company": "10x Genomics",
    "excerpt": "that'll leave us now though with the fifth and final purchase where we finally have a biotech in 10x genomics ticker symbol txg which I say finally because we all know how much Kathy loves her biotech stocks with this one in particular being another 1.2 million shares added uh in October valued at over $18 million now when it comes to 10x this is of course a genomic research type of Biotech that primarily sells analyzer devices and other related services for laboratory use where these systems are capable of quickly analyzing thousands of different data points related to cells so that they can be better understood and then the data is used for various applications within biomedicine for example their cell immune profiling system can analyze how tea cells respond to various infections which was even used during the pandemic for analyzing the pepperoni and finding treatments for it it's all very impressive work which is why their tools are already being used by every single one of the top 100 research institutions in the world with more Publications filed than much of their competition As such it's very likely that their products and services will remain in high demand well into the future however at the moment despite surging sales their profits have actually been pretty horrible for years which even looking ahead analysts only expect a single digit rise in sales this year before rebounding to just barely a double digit growth rate the year after but even after seeing the stock crash by over 90% coming off the pandemic their price of sales ratio of almost three is still a bit too high for my liking especially with the weaker growth I can understand why Kathy is buying it though after the huge drop but because this is a business that I feel I would have to research very heavily and stay constantly up to date on I just think it's too much of a speculative option for me at the moment when I'd rather gamble on something that I can at least understand a little bit better I do think the market that they operate in though is at least more exciting I would say than blade airs so I'm going to push blade down one spot so that I can fit 10x just above them at number four.",
