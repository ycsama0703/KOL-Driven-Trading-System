    "excerpt": "I can't think of a better way to kick things off then with my own largest investment in Microsoft ticker symbol msft which I know it may not immediately grab your attention for their work in cyber security but the fact of the matter is that overall Microsoft will be one of the most important players in that market well into the future as they not only facilitate through their Windows operating system that powers more computers than any other OS in the world and Azure which is the second largest cloud platform in the world uh both of which will be used to run cyber security on or through but all the meanwhile Microsoft has also been you know kind of somewhat quietly building up their own cyber security tools and services even integrating their co-pilot generative AI across Enterprise business and personal use at various price points for cyber security for example Microsoft Defender sells for $3 a month per employee for business while the upgraded $22 offering bundles together much of their other apps and services like office co-pilot and more it just makes the whole package more attractive there's even multicloud security where Azure offers DDOS protection information app and data protection and even confidential ledgers as well as Defender for the internet of things as well all of these offerings are a direct result of a recent 20 billion investment that Microsoft threw at cyber security which is already showing great returns for them as their cyber security division has now turned into a$2 billion annual revenue driver for the company in terms of total market share well guys Gardner estimates that Microsoft already commands the seventh largest market share in the in the entire space there how crazy is that nobody ever even talks about it when they mention Microsoft anyway the stock price itself has never really been cheap as it usually breaks new record highs in most years but for that price I do feel that you get unbel believable performance in return that you know I think is worth investing in long term I mean how many other companies can you think of that do over 200 billion in sales over 70 billion in pure net income profit and that is still managing to somehow grow at a double digit rate Microsoft is like no other and even when it comes to cyber security it's just another great stock worth considering",

    "excerpt": "Moving on to cyber security stock number two though well if I'm looking for a more Pure Play option in that market then I would look no further than Pao networks ticker symbol pnw as they're actually the market leader and the only one to reach about a double digigit percent but it's not just size and Leadership that Paulo carries it's also amazing momentum for that size which is highlighted in Canal's uh Global cyber security leadership Matrix where Paulo dominates both categories the reason for that is largely due to their investments in Ai and machine learning that are now automating the process of detecting online threats much faster and more efficiently than a human counterpart ever could while also fueling their unique multi-platform strategy consisting of Prisma cortex strata and units that together gives customers more choice and simplicity over their own platform security needs as a result While most other cyber security companies are either bleeding money struggling for growth or carry insanely expensive valuations Paulo as a as the market leader has actually shown improvements on all three fronts going from negative net income to now positive last year Revenue growth in the double digits despite what has been one of the worst macro economies we've ever seen an evaluation that while I grant you is still pretty expensive it at least carries a reasonable peeg ratio that is only slightly higher than the sector and actually a little bit cheaper than their own 5year average as well again that's because they just now started turning a profit which should translate to very high growth on the bottom line over the coming years and that's exactly what PEG ratio so uh shows now I did already choose Paulo Alto in my 2023 AI stocks to buy video and since then the stock has more than doubled in price which I admit does make it a little more risky kind of scary to buy at these higher levels but if you're looking for something a lot cheaper then I would actually go with stock number three instead speaking of which those Holdings also include some of my favorite names in the space including crowd strike at number one as well as OCTA 4et and Paulo Alto all within the top 15",

    "excerpt": "and that is Cisco ticker symbol CSCO who you know being a much older company than their peers especially you know in cyber security it was founded in the early 1980s well it's probably the one on this list that has the hardest business to kind of grow however it makes up for that with size value stability reputation leadership and of course the profits that come along with all of that being the third largest market share leader who sits near the bottom of the Matrix on momentum but almost leads the entire pack on leadership and while most cyber security companies actually lose a lot of money on the bottom line well Cisco consistently generates over 10 billion dollars in net income profit year after year that's because Cisco's computer networking business really helped establish today's internet that everyone loves to use with also many of their routers and switches connecting most computers around the world however Topline growth has not been anything to brag about but they have at least invested into New Growth initiatives to address that particularly pushing heavier into software including a recent acquisition of Splunk which was their largest acquisition in history who I've actually included in other stocks to buy videos before the acquisition was even announced I used to praise them a lot but now that Cisco owns them well I just think that it makes the entire package even more attractive as Splunk is an AI and cyber security software specialist in their own right specifically in threat prevention before it even happens which Cisco CEO noted in the acquisition saying that it now makes them one of the largest software companies in the world as they both power and protect the AI Revolution solution adding that the merger will help prevent cyber security threats and limit downtime for customers across the digital physical and AI powered worlds and that quote to truly reap the benefits of AI organizations need the infrastructure to power it the data to develop it a security platform to protect it and an observability platform to Monitor and manage manage it all in real time which the acquisition will now help them provide as it helps transform the company from Simply threat detection and response to now threat prediction and prevention longterm I think it'll boost Cisco's software as a service business model too which should help Drive greater profitability and steady income over time and make the stock just that much more attractive and yet despite all those positives the stock has actually lost about a quarter of its value from the top leaving one of the cheapest valuations you'll ever find in the cyber security space Not only trading for a PE ratio that is 45% cheaper than the second but it's also significantly lower than pretty much every single pier in the space I don't own Cisco stock myself but I'm actually thinking about buying it very soon especially since it also yields an attractive dividend above 3% with a low payout ratio and a double- digit growth rate there's not much to complain about when it comes to Cisco and I think you'll see it in my portfolio too very soon",

    "excerpt": "One stock that I do already own though and that I've been extremely happy with over the past year well that is stock number four and that is is paler technology secret symbol pltr who like Microsoft it may not immediately catch your attention as a cyber security specialist however cyber security is really at the core of everything that paler does as a data management specialist that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to serve not just other companies but even government entities including military defense and intelligence agencies where data security needs to be an extremely top priority it probably more so there than anywhere else and so paler has leveraged their expertise in data management to bring all of a client's data together into their unified platform where they then use AI to rapidly analyze the massive amounts of data and comb through it all using algorithms and machine learning to detect any threats or anomalies before creating cluster charts and heat maps of anything that looks suspicious which it can then take further action on and by noticing that commercial institutions tend to face a shared set of cyber threats paler also created a cyber mesh platform that secures all the information shared between peers something that they've built up using similar models within the defense and intelligence communities for automatic redaction of sensitive data whenever any suspicious activity or outside access is is detected there's also even their evm platform Enterprise vulnerability management that provides Network Defenders with paler AI for discovering understanding and remediating cyber vulnerabilities and look there's tons of other examples just like this that I could run through but my point is that paler is already a trusted name in the space consistently being ranked number one in areas of AI data science and machine learning while also being awarded giant contracts with the government and the military and defense and because of it I think commercial Enterprises will also trust paler much more than maybe other competitors to securely handle all of their precious data too you know guys it's often said that data is the new Gold Rush of the current age and well you got to keep that data safe while using it and that's exactly what paler is known for in fact their information security division sums it up best here stating given the critical work performed on our platforms information security is our lifeblood with three core objectives to make paler safer to make our customers safer and to make the world safer adding that our customers rely on paler to power their most critical work and we're dedicated to building platforms that they can trust well we continue to see the results of all this with last quarter alone scen a 40% rise in US commercial Revenue a nearly 70% rise in customer count and over 130 New Deals closed which was almost double the amount year-over-year meanwhile profitability continues to rise with six quarters in a row now of positive Gap net income resulting in a PEG ratio that is actually 25% cheaper than the sector if you can believe it and that's because their net income is only just starting to grow and it will become much larger over time in the future and while the stock has has already climbed a lot over the past year it's at least dipped about 15% this past week leaving a nice little dip here to jump in for anyone not yet in the stock",
