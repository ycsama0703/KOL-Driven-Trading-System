viewer comments too but first I'd like to just mention today's video sponsor mint mobile guys I would only ever recommend a service that I genuinely believe is worth using and when it comes to Mint mobile this is such a no-brainer that I can't believe it's not used by literally everyone at this point see mint offers premium Wireless for only $15 a month including highspeed data and unlimited talk and text on the nation's largest 5G Network and switching has never been easier as you can literally keep using the same phone and number you already have and just switch over using eim or have mint ship you a physical SIM card for free all from the comfort of your own home guys big Wireless wants you to believe that it's hard to switch providers and they do this in order to keep you locked in and paying for ridiculously overpriced plans when the truth is that there's actually a much better option out there for a fraction of the cost with mintmobile I literally get the same speed service and quality except now I have more money in my pocket which I get to use for investing in stock so what are you waiting for it'd be insane not to switch and save all of that money yourself too go to try mintmobile.com Allis world to get a special discount when you sign up the link is down in the description and thanks again to mintmobile for sponsoring this video and for providing truly affordable Wireless plans at a time when let's be honest inflation and interest rates continue to we on consumers so it's time to get smart save money and switch to mmobile all right jumping back into the community portfolio here let's take a look at how all the Holdings are doing so far and how much I'm either up or down on each of those stocks and what I plan to do here in August moving forward to so here's all the Holdings on our Sofi account I have to use a video screenshot for this now because it's just too many stocks to show at once but as always I made some custom charts for you here to better visualize the data and I'm also going to start posting these on Discord too in case you want to take a closer look yourself but here's a pie chart of everything we own I'm super happy of course with Google Amazon metronic Microsoft and meta making up the top five Holdings and close to half of the entire portfolio cuz those are easily five of my absolute favorite stocks in the market I want to be heavily invested in those I do think just kind of looking at the portfolio here it is pretty Tech heavy but it's also because I just love Tech in general and that's where I see the most long-term potential in however I do also want to try to spread it out a bit among other sectors which I believe I have done with some other stocks here especially some of my favorite dividend stocks like metronic Verizon fizer Bristol Myers and Extra Space Storage pretty good siiz position in those and those are of course spread across Healthcare Telecom and even real estate so I think that's a good sign as well another thing I noticed here is that uh two of my Chinese my two Chinese stocks only two I own here is Alibaba and baou Alibaba is a little bit smaller than do here and I think that should actually be the other way around because I like alib Baba a little more so I may have to add a little more Baba in the future to kind of balance that out but then I also think that Cisco verisign and maybe even Tyson Foods could be a little bigger too those seem to be pretty small in the portfolio and I especially really like Cisco I got to buy more of that one cuz it's got a dirt cheap valuation an awesome dividend I like it at these levels in terms of how much I'm either up or down on each of these positions though well the chart is also getting a a little big here too so I'm actually going to start separating these two into their own respective charts so starting with the winners first we have NEX era energy paler and Tesla all up close to 30% which is fantastic then in the teens we have Tyson exr Chase and Google all performing extremely well too although I do want to buy more Google anyway because uh the recent dip uh this past couple weeks I think is just making it even more attractive and even though Google is my largest stock in this portfolio that's just how much I like Google I would love to have even more of that stock but then also down in the single digits is where we might have some even better buying opportunities here especially in meta can't believe how low that well I can believe it but it is pretty low uh meta Verizon and metronic I think

see mint offers premium Wireless for only $15 a month including highspeed data and unlimited talk and text on the nation's largest 5G Network and switching has never been easier as you can literally keep using the same phone and number you already have and just switch over using eim or have mint ship you a physical SIM card for free all from the comfort of your own home guys big Wireless wants you to believe that it's hard to switch providers and they do this in order to keep you locked in and paying for ridiculously overpriced plans when the truth is that there's actually a much better option out there for a fraction of the cost with mintmobile I literally get the same speed service and quality except now I have more money in my pocket which I get to use for investing in stock so what are you waiting for it'd be insane not to switch and save all of that money yourself too go to try mintmobile.com Allis world to get a special discount when you sign up the link is down in the description and thanks again to mintmobile for sponsoring this video and for providing truly affordable Wireless plans at a time when let's be honest inflation and interest rates continue to we on consumers so it's time to get smart save money and switch to mmobile all right jumping back into the community portfolio here let's take a look at how all the Holdings are doing so far and how much I'm either up or down on each of those stocks and what I plan to do here in August moving forward to so here's all the Holdings on our Sofi account I have to use a video screenshot for this now because it's just too many stocks to show at once but as always I made some custom charts for you here to better visualize the data and I'm also going to start posting these on Discord too in case you want to take a closer look yourself but here's a pie chart of everything we own I'm super happy of course with Google Amazon metronic Microsoft and meta making up the top five Holdings and close to half of the entire portfolio cuz those are easily five of my absolute favorite stocks in the market I want to be heavily invested in those I do think just kind of looking at the portfolio here it is pretty Tech heavy but it's also because I just love Tech in general and that's where I see the most long-term potential in however I do also want to try to spread it out a bit among other sectors which I believe I have done with some other stocks here especially some of my favorite dividend stocks like metronic Verizon fizer Bristol Myers and Extra Space Storage pretty good siiz position in those and those are of course spread across Healthcare Telecom and even real estate so I think that's a good sign as well another thing I noticed here is that uh two of my Chinese my two Chinese stocks only two I own here is Alibaba and baou Alibaba is a little bit smaller than do here and I think that should actually be the other way around because I like alib Baba a little more so I may have to add a little more Baba in the future to kind of balance that out but then I also think that Cisco verisign and maybe even Tyson Foods could be a little bigger too those seem to be pretty small in the portfolio and I especially really like Cisco I got to buy more of that one cuz it's got a dirt cheap valuation an awesome dividend I like it at these levels in terms of how much I'm either up or down on each of these positions though well the chart is also getting a a little big here too so I'm actually going to start separating these two into their own respective charts so starting with the winners first we have NEX era energy paler and Tesla all up close to 30% which is fantastic then in the teens we have Tyson exr Chase and Google all performing extremely well too although I do want to buy more Google anyway because uh the recent dip uh this past couple weeks I think is just making it even more attractive and even though Google is my largest stock in this portfolio that's just how much I like Google I would love to have even more of that stock\", \"confidence\": 1.0, \"sentiment\": 1.0}, {\"company\": \"Amazon\", \"excerpt\": \"in total though July was actually the second most active month of the year for us as I spent $105 on stocks which is even more than the $100 I typically deposit and with that money I spent $15 each on Disney metronic Google and Verizon

these positions here in the community portfolio uh to me just kind of signals that they are an automatic buy I got to buy more of these uh I want to have as big positions as I can get in them they're negative want to be buying more at these levels and really any stock on this list here I feel like I can't go wrong just adding more of either I like all these stocks of course though I will be running some more polls this month too to see if there's any other new stocks that you guys would like to see added to the portfolio as well but just to finish up here I deposited another fresh $100 for the month of August which raised the account up to $1,139 while also raising our cash ratio up to above 30% again too which I love to see I think we've got plenty of ammunition here to have a great rest of the month in August and pick up some great stocks as they fall on the current market dip okay with all of that out of the way though it's time now to answer some of your guys' comments and questions so let's do about five or six comments today and uh see what we find here so we've got uh this first one here from Mass manic media who says I think how you are diversifying and spreading out over several stocks is the exactly right way to do a public step-by-step portfolio this is the perfect way to show how anyone can do this it is possible and you are showing your work well thank you very much for saying that I think that uh this com here was probably a bit of a response to another comment that I received in in last month's video we talked about last month it was a much more critical comment that we had received from someone else that was uh critical of how Diversified this portfolio is that person really wanted the portfolio to be um smaller in terms of how many stocks we own they only wanted a few stocks to be in the portfolio in total and my response to that was that you know this is a public portfolio so I do want it to be a relatively safer one and by spreading out across many different stocks we can kind of lower the risk a little bit because if any particular stock crashes it won't have too much of an impact on the rest of it with that said though I still do go of course much heavier on my favorite ones and only you know five stocks really make up close to half of the entire portfolio in our top five Holdings so I'm doing it in a way here where I can kind of benefit from both strategies going in heavy on stocks that we love but also diversifying and owning many different stocks to help lower the the risk too plus keep in mind I want you guys to have a lot of influence over this portfolio too so if we own a lot of different stocks it's because we're also picking up various stocks that you guys want to see added to the portfolio too that you might own yourself and you want to see it reflected here as well so it's just a bit of a balancing act and I appreciate the nice comment especially this one from Mass manic media um showing their support here and in terms of what we're trying to do here and really understanding that it is a balancing act and we're trying to just uh move forward with the portfolio with a couple different strategies here but just keeping it relatively safe and fun and all that anyway moving on to the next comment we have art is true who says nice vid I have PayPal as a weight around my ankles in high water for a few years I try to cost average it down oh well here we go again I'm not only an investor in PayPal I'm a 20 year 20 plus year user of their service so yeah PayPal has been a bit of a disaster story this past year I believe we uh actually picked it up for the first time in the community portfolio last month you guys can correct me if I'm wrong about that but uh believe we relatively recently picked up PayPal and it was because they want a poll survey and you guys wanted to see it added to the portfolio of course PayPal stock has crashed a lot but we were able to get it after the crash so we're fortunate in that sense I do feel for this person who has unfortunately seen their stock crash but hey that's why again you know I try to have a long-term mindset and I try to diversify my Holdings I'm sure this person does too um but yeah if you can kind of diversify if your portfolio a bit then that way even if one stock happens to perform very badly you still have others that can perform well longterm and that's why I try to stick to that strategy uh moving on though we have Tony D who says uh question why do you need so many stocks in a portfolio isn't better to focus on about 8 to 10 stocks and continue to build on them occasionally adding a screaming buy well I would say no I like the formula that we're using here like I mentioned before and I think it'll work out great long term there's nothing wrong with owning a lot of stocks most will be good but some might struggle however if you only own a few stocks and you go super heavy into them you better hope that they're all perfect or else just a couple bad apples could spoil the lot but that's why I try to diversify a bit own several different many different stocks and uh I just think that's a safer strategy overall uh next up though we have Leonardo uh cpro by the way Le Leonardo is my father's name and also one of my brother's names so happy to see that name there but uh he says hello all Chinese uh companies are too risky for me but if I have to choose one I would go with 10 cent uh are you sure about Baba and by well I love 10-cent stock too by the way I own it in my personal portfolio but not in this public one I do feel that Alibaba by and T tensent are all extremely strong companies that would be screaming buys if it weren't for them being Chinese because of all the inherent risk that those carry with them but if they were American I'd be buying those stocks left and right and I think a lot of other people would too I think people just you know rightfully so just kind of hold back because of all the risk from owning a Chinese stock you just have very little um shareholder rights as a foreign investor in them\", \"confidence\": 1.0, \"sentiment\": 0.5},

have PayPal as a weight around my ankles in high water for a few years I try to cost average it down oh well here we go again I'm not only an investor in PayPal I'm a 20 year 20 plus year user of their service so yeah PayPal has been a bit of a disaster story this past year I believe we uh actually picked it up for the first time in the community portfolio last month you guys can correct me if I'm wrong about that but uh believe we relatively recently picked up PayPal and it was because they want a poll survey and you guys wanted to see it added to the portfolio of course PayPal stock has crashed a lot but we were able to get it after the crash so we're fortunate in that sense I do feel for this person who has unfortunately seen their stock crash but hey that's why again you know I try to have a long-term mindset and I try to diversify my Holdings I'm sure this person does too\", \"confidence\": 1.0, \"sentiment\": -0.3}, {\"company\": \"Tencent\", \"excerpt\": \"he says hello all
