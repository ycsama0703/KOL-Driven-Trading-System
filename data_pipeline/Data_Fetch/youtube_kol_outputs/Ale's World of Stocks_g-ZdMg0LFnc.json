    "excerpt": "for the first one well I'm going to go with I got to go really 100% with the dividend stock that I've been buying the most of recently myself and that is a Reit known as vich properties ticker symbol VI I which I can explain my case for very Simply Now reason number one the business is fantastic for being a re it's probably as good of a real estate business that you could really hope for because they own close to 100 properties in North America with their biggest tenant being gaming and entertainment clients including most of the top casino resorts in Vegas like Caesars MGM and more Now these are massive gambling and casino businesses that are just about as sticky as you can get to they're pretty resilient to recessions they generally sign multi-decade contracts with the REITs and because of their massive size along with strict gambling regul what's extremely hard for any of them to really relocate and thus it gives vichi not only a wide Moes but also some of the highest occupancy and rent collection rates in the world in fact during the 2020 pandemic when much of the Vegas Strip was even closed down W vichi was one of the few rats out there to still bring in 100% of the rent during the entire time the entire pandemic Now reason number two interest rates are coming down that's going to make it really where these big dividend paying rats like vichi become more valuable to investors because sinking rates will make it cheaper for the company to acquire more real estate and expand thus helping them grow while also making their High dividend yields more attractive to income seeking investors because of other assets offering really lower rates and yields by comparison and yet reason number three a recent dip has actually left the stock down about 177% from the top leaving behind a mouthwatering dividend yield of close to 6% now I'm absolutely loving the stock at these levels and I continue to be a buyer myself for the long term",

    "excerpt": "moving on here to the second lowrisk option well this one I think I can make just about as easy of a case 4 to and that is the medical devices giant metronic MDT another stock that I love here I've also been a heavy buyer of this one these past couple years really ever since the pandemic crash that sent the stock falling around 40 % the theory being that you know kind of during that time around you know those couple years because so many people were staying home and avoiding medical procedures along with the deteriorating economy over time Skyhigh inflation interest rates all that kind of stuff well metronic would have a really hard time selling all of their medical products and services to hospitals that are already struggling which there is obviously some truth to that as their sales and profits dipped a couple times during these recent years however longer term this is is not really a valid reason in my opinion to avoid what is literally the world leader in medical devices as the pandemic has already dissipated with interest rates now coming down to help recover the economy and people are largely getting back to having all of their regular procedures uh you know all that kind of stuff done again with hospitals back up and running to their typically normal rates and as such so to or metronics financials recovering once again yet the stock price continues to trade Dirt Cheap regardless at about 30% cheaper than the sector on a fordp basis with the dividend rising to about a three and a half perc yield with nearly five Decades of consecutive growth they'll even be considered a dividend King soon and so I just think that this is not a stock to treat lightly on any dips it's a world leader has been around for like over I think it's like three and uh it's like over three4 of a century I mean they've been around for a long time they've got an incredibly strong track record of success and they even have some future growth opportunities to get excited about too like in medical robotics so I love the stock right here and I continue to be a heavy buyer myself",

    "excerpt": "all right guys it's time now though to switch over to the two medium risk options and for the first of those you know I'd actually say that it's pretty low risk overall I kind of just had to bump it down here for for the space and the categorizing but you'll see what I mean here I'm going with what is actually my second favorite overall re at the moment only behind vichi that is Extra Space Storage ticker symbol exr who may not have quite as strong numbers as vich I think a lot of people would you know maybe argue a little bit back and forth as to which one is a little stronger or maybe a little lower risk but regardless in my view I think exr is just about as close as you can get to the quality of vichi for being another reach in terms of also having an incredibly strong business that has at least some protection from a recession and interest rates and inflation and also with just the general rise in online trends like e-commerce and remote work those are really two things guys that generally devastate REITs who hold properties in areas of retail and business because those tenants tend to transition over time to digital options instead leaving these REITs with large properties that they struggle to rent out and may even have to sell off in the future however that's not the case for exr who is actually the largest owner of self storage units in the in America across more than 40 different states with also still a ton of room for Acquisitions and expans given the rise in demand which you can see on this chart here for storage units again it's in large part because of actually the rising e-commerce remote work and similar trends that people in businesses will turn to self storage facilities to keep a lot of their equipment and other assets but also just people in general even in times of economic hardship they may downgrade their house or apartment just put a lot of their stuff in storage facilities instead maybe take on roommates and all that kind of stuff anyway I just don't ever really see the demand the point being I don't see the demand for storage facilities ever going away at all I think it's going to rise actually and that's resulted in really strong occupancy rates above 90% with equally strong financials year after year for the company which is also why self storage reats in particular typically outperform virtually all other types of RS in the market and I just think exr is the best one in terms of size or portfolio how well it's run and even their balance sheet but yet because of rising interest rates in recent years the stock has actually lost over a third of its value from the top raising the dividend yield up to over 4.4% which is also among the highest levels it's ever been so right here I just think it's way too attractive to ignore I'll continue to be a buyer myself into the New Year",

    "company": "Verizon",
    "excerpt": "all right guys this next one though does actually raise the risk a little bit more here medium option number two I'm going with the Telecom giant Verizon ticker symbol VZ and look here where really the bulk of the risk comes from is in their low growth because of how well established the giant Telecom Market already is the limitations of how much you can still grow there which is a bit of a hard pill to swallow for investors when the company has had to make such large investments into spent so heavily into you know fiber and 5G technologies that has ballooned their debt levels to really scary Heights all of that is true for Verizon but it's also the reason why I think that we're left now with really an incredibly cheap value and high yielding dividend stock with a price with the price Falling by over a third of its value from the top to now one of the absolute lowest prices of the past decade which lowered the valuation to around 30 to 50% cheaper than the sector while also raising the dividend yield up to almost 7% That's among the highest that it's ever been so you could say that it's almost like buying or being able to buy Verizon stock at around the same type of valuation and dividend l levels as it really was like all the way back in the Great Recession which is kind of incredible and yet what's happened since then during that time well Verizon has actually grown into basically the largest Telecom provider in America with by far the highest quality of Service Awards nobody even comes close they've won like over 30 JD Power Awards in a row again nobody even remotely close to that and they generate more sales than the other two biggest players in AT&T and T-Mobile yet they have a cheaper valuation them a bigger dividend while still generating plenty of cash flow to help pay down their debts over time I calculated like over $6 billion doll just in the first three quarters of the past year even after subtracting for dividend so while it is a stock to be cautious of and I certainly don't want to be Overexposed to it I also think that it's just too attractive at these levels to not be buying more in the coming year",

    "excerpt": "all right it's time now that to finish up guys with the two High risk options this will be interesting to look at for the first of those I'm actually going to go with a stock here that you know just a while ago I would have never thought of this one as high risk and that's because this is the largest pharmaceutical company in the entire world in fiser Tiger symbol PF who's now seen their stock price lose over half of its entire value from the top and even fall by double digits over the past 10 years to now the lowest prices of the past decade and that right there is why I consider it high risk because no matter how much I say that this is an incredibly cheap Value stock with an incredible dividend the market just continues to sell it off regardless which I've argued likely has to do with a couple things really the deteriorating sales of the vshot moving past the pandemic and now also a trump presidency with Kennedy leading the HHS that some worry could pose problems to Giant pharmaceutical companies like fizer but to those two points number one I don't think that they need the pandemic shot anymore because they already made a fortune off of it and have so far spent like over $70 billion from it to acquire several other large biotech companies to fuel future growth and for Point number two I actually think the Kennedy appointment will focus more on getting cleaner ingredients into people's diets rather than completely collapsing the giant pharmaceutical industry that you know let's be honest is not likely to ever go away because of how large and Powerful it is but in the meantime this is you know the largest biotech that we have out here I know it's a controversial one some people like them some people hate them but from a stock investment perspective alone they now trade around 50% cheaper than the sector with also a dividend yield at one of the highest levels we've ever seen of it of more than 6 and a half% so for as much as it keeps falling I can't help but be a buyer at these levels",

    "excerpt": "Finally I'll just throw one more stock at you guys that'll be Tyson Foods sticker symbol TSN and this is a stock that surprisingly doesn't get talked about very much I actually don't think I've ever really seen anyone else bring it up but I I do think that it's one worth considering especially as the world leader in meat and poultry a massive Market that I don't ever see going away with some of the really biggest brands in the space and even if you think that future growth will be more so in like I don't know plant-based alternatives for example well they also offer that too as well as venturing into other growth opportunities in frozen air fried and other quickly prepared meals that I think will keep rising in Demand with really how busy people's Lifestyles have become these days however the risk really comes in from just their overall exposure to the macroeconomy which has been decimated in recent years with crazy high inflation Rising input cost with high interest rates to combat it all of which temporarily has hurt Tyson's profitability but I just think that those are issues that always kind of tend to come and go while Tyson's business has mostly been resilient and is likely here to stay at least that's what I would argue which is why any any time that the stock has traded within this $50 range that it's currently in right now well those ultimately prove to be B you know really big buying opportunities and I expect this one to be no different I could be wrong of course but with the valuation now trading 62% cheaper than the sector with a peg of less than one and the dividend also climbing to one of the highest levels that it's been at that we've seen from them even more than where they were at during the Great Recession well I just think that it's worth betting on at these levels at about a 3 and a half per yield it is one of the you know I think it's the smallest dividend of today's list but I just feel that the overall package for Tyson Food stock is still extremely attractive",
