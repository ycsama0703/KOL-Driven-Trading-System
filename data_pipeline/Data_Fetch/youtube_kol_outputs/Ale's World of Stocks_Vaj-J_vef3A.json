    "excerpt": "Sofi stock is looking extremely interesting to me at the moment it's one that I used to consider speculative they were young without profitability and their business was weighted too heavily into lending which adds more risk during a weak economy and all the meanwhile they were trying to disrupt a massive finance and banking industry that I just wasn't 100% sure that they would actually succeed at however times have changed guys and this is a very different company that we're talking about now that isn't to say that there aren't any ISS isues notably Revenue growth is slowing down during what continues to be an extremely poor economy however the stock is trading incredibly low and even lower recently after falling around 20% coming off of Q2 earnings leaving it also down over 30% this year and over 70% from their all-time Highs but I actually thought that earnings looked phenomenal and I also think that the company just kind of in general is in a great position right now to turn things around longterm and actually be a winning stock to invest in it's just my opinion of course but here's why I feel this way now first of all we all know that the economy is struggling right now and when it comes to financial companies those always tend to get hit the worst during Times Like These especially if interest rates continue to linger higher for longer raising the risk of a recession hitting which is one of the biggest concerns that investors have for Sofi is a very big part of their business of course revolves around lending and during a recession you see people default on on their loans not pay them back credit ratings plummet it's harder to find more quality customers to lend to businesses of course invest Less on expansion and growth and so it all just kind of creates a snowball effect of businesses and consumers just getting hit really hard and that creates Havoc for banks and financial institutions but here's the thing even during this week economy Sofi is actually performing and diversifying shockingly well as they continue to not only destroy analyst estimates with another 60% beat on PPS this latest quarter but sales also Rose by over 20% year-over-year while the most important metrics of all their profitability more than doubled across the board net income up 136% EPS up 116% profit margins up 130% and operating income up 132% guys considering that people are just really not looking to make big new purchases right now I think we kind of see that out there well those numbers are extremely impressive for that challenging environment I I really feel like not a lot of people are going out there right now trying to buy a house or buy a car or take out some giant loan for some giant purchase when interest rates are so incredibly high and when inflation continues to also weigh on consumer spice so much yet sofi's all-in-one Finance platform it continues to grow and user counts continue to rise and Sofi is finding new ways to sell products to them in fact they've been consistently adding more than half a million new new members every single quarter at over 40% growth each one and those new customers means more products and services that they can sell to them which is driving up growth and look sofi's Revenue growth of around 20% I personally think that that's really strong within the context of this being such a challenging environment but in the past you know it has been better we of course had everything looking a little bit the economy looking brighter we had less inflation lower interest rates there were times of government stimulus so of course during those times sofi's Topline growth was soaring through the roof you're talking easily more than 50% growth many times much more than that but now it's a little bit lower however I feel that in this environment the most important thing to focus on is actually to become profitable and we've seen all year long companies that are not profitable take big punishment in the market but with Sofi well they've actually posted positive net income profits in each of the past three quarters in a row and that's a very good sign of them turning things around cuz this used to be easily the biggest critique of Sofi was how much money they bleed and it's not being sustainable and especially if the economy gets worse how are they going to survive well this is no longer the case they're actually turning to profit consistently and I do expect that to continue to be the case but here's where things get really interesting for me because this next part is really what I feel Wall Street is completely missing when it comes to sofi's business and that's that they continue to look at them as if they're just a traditional lender which to be fair it is basically how they got started and to this day it does remain a very big part of their business however that's quickly changing guys as Sofi is now pushing much more heavily into financial services and technology which are less Capital intensive they carry less risk and overall they're more reliable with higher returns than traditional lending and you can see that right there in the numbers as lending isn't really growing at the moment but the tech platform is up in the mid to high teens while Financial Services is skyrocketing by over 80% growth that's huge and the two together when combined are now expected to make up around half of sofi's entire business by Year's end this is a very big deal guys this is the future of Sofi and as an investor it is really what I want to see from them it's exactly the transition that I want to see taking place and that's what we have right now now speaking about the future of course the other major concern from Wall Street and the reason why the stock continues to sell off in my opinion is because of the macroeconomy and interest rates the lingering risk of a recession which by the way JP Morgan just raised their odds of a recession hitting later this year up to 35% and it's even higher for next year at 45% too but when looking at that you know most economists and analysts now largely expect the FED to start cutting rates in September so if that's enough if that's I should say soon enough to fend off a recession well where exact L would that leave Sofi in a sinking rate environment not a rising rate environment not a a flat one but a sinking interest rate environment how would sofi's business be affected by that well in that scenario I really can't see much of anything there other than upside for sofi's entire business cuz you likely get tons of refinancing across the board Home Loans student loans people just wanting to get lower rates on their loans which so far is a great option for doing that and with all the users that they keep accumulating it'll be really easy to target those potential customers with new products in their all-in-one you know platform on top of that we'd probably also see a rise in Stock Investing now whenever you lower interest rates the yield from money markets and fix income fixed income generally comes down so people look to other uh assets to invest in like stocks for a greater return and at least you know they'll increase the weight of them in their portfolio so that would likely help sofi's investing business too and again all of this is within the same platform that's what I love about Sofi the synergies everything being available there and on top of all of this you'd probably also see a rise in the value of their um existing fixed rate loans on sofi's balance sheet because investors would want those older loans that have higher yields compared to the newer ones coming out with the lower yields because of the lowering rates right so there's just a lot of ways that a sinking rate environment could not only help the economy which helps many finance companies across the board but I think it would also directly benefit Sofi in multiple ways which again this is all within the larger long-term context of the fintech market especially probably being worth trillions of dollars in the future because of all the disruption while Sofi is still just a tiny little player by comparison with lots of room to grow and that's why when you calculate their very high profit growth of you know sometimes more than doubling right now it's like expected to more than double per year next couple years well you end up with a 2026 forward p ratio of just 13 obviously that's looking a couple years ahead right but um and and of course it's also assuming that things go well for them but at these levels I just think that that's very cheap for a company that is really just getting started in my opinion they have so much more to go so much more to show I feel and so that's why I'm buying the stock right now again though as always do your own research and make your own decision I'm only sharing with you my personal opinion I own Sofi stock I happen to like it it's just my opinion but you know um ultimately it comes down to how you feel about it but I'd love to hear your thoughts let me know down below even if you hate it if you think it's a horrible stock I'd love to hear those opinions so let me know down in the comment section or if you own it let me know that as well but uh yeah I think that'll just about do it for this video just want to give you a quick update on Sofi why I like it at these levels",
