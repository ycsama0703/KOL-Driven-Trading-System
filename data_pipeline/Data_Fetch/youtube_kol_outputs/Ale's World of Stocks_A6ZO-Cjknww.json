    "excerpt": "first up here from the big Tech Giants we had Microsoft report who I thought did pretty well as usual I mean they pretty much always beat analyst estimates and this time was no difference with an albeit small beat on both the top and bottom line but most importantly their year-over-year numbers were absolutely fantastic with Revenue growth of 15% on almost $65 billion in a single quarter alone that is absolutely insane to still be growing like this at that size and even their net income profits were also about a double digit growth rate at 10% on over $22 billion so just crazy numbers coming from Microsoft as usual and yet typical Wall Street they actually sent the stock a little bit lower because of a small Miss on cloud which by the way just to show you uh how little sense this really makes Microsoft is the second largest cloud provider in the world and yet their sales uh for Azure their Cloud platform it still grew by a massive 29% but Wall Street wanted 31% so the stock fell almost 5% this week it's pretty funny now granted Microsoft was already trading at a record high so at this point it just kind of doesn't leave a whole lot of room here for upside unless you're beating estimates by a giant amount on every category but I do think that this little dip here is a buy but then again I'm a little biased because Microsoft is my number one largest holding and I think it's always a Buy on any little dip especially if I'm thinking long term but anyway take that how you will uh the rest of their earnings were just fantastic though in my opinion by the way Google was uh they have a a smaller Cloud platform and they grew their Cloud by 29% in the quarter so it's pretty crazy that Microsoft is still growing like a smaller player yet they're so much bigger plus you look at their businesses broken down by quarter in Azure has been consistently growing by around 30% every quarter pretty much forever which is in large part thanks to all the advancements that they've made with artificial intelligence and I would probably argue that Azure has the most complete uh offering of AI features and services out of really all the big cloud platforms out there and management spoke to that on the call saying that their share gains have accelerated this year driven by artificial intelligence and that demand is so high for their AI services that it's literally higher than their already massive capacity that's pretty wild anyway other parts did really well too Dynamics Cloud uh Services office commercial search advertising uh server Windows commercial all growing by double digit percentages and then kind of my favorite like little sleeper part of it was uh Xbox Microsoft Xbox gaming that has now grown by over 60% in each of the past three quarters I love to see that I think Game Pass is uh going to be really big in the future I think it has the potential of being the the next like Netflix of gaming as Microsoft as a whole already has over half a billion monthly active Gamers and that's extremely impressive so add it all up a great report from them analysts agree with me too a lot of buy ratings coming out of it despite the stock dipping a little uh by the way many stocks did fall a bit at the end of this week though because of macroeconomic concern concerns economy again is just not doing well it's been like that for a while so that did probably play a little bit of a factor too in dragging Microsoft a little lower but overall again I just think Microsoft very solid long-term stock to own.",

    "excerpt": "moving on though to the next big Tech Giant here to report this week we had meta who posted an even better beat on both the top and bottom line and have also beat each of the past four quarters too so a pretty good Trend there coming from meta which initially sent the stock climbing on all also upbeat guidance and what looks to be their huge AI Investments really starting to pay off for them now and that's something that I've really said uh for a long time now is that look meta is pouring a lot of money into AI but I think it is going to help them long term and that's what looks to be happening now on the earnings call CEO Mark Zuckerberg he noted that the company's AI is improving recommendations and helping people find better content that is more relatable to them which of course advertisers love to see because it makes their job so much easier and more effective easier to Target the Right audience and because of that advertising Revenue has been you know advertising uh business has been pouring into meta and revenues in total for the period it's soared by 22% it's up now to more than $39 billion it's incredible and net income you thought that was crazy net income profits skyrocketed by over 70% up to more than $13 billion too so just incredible what's happening with meta here uh again this is something that I've often said for a long time here about meta they are so incredibly powerful and profitable with their social media platforms like Instagram Facebook and so on that they can really afford to take on these type of heavy investments into other Ventures like Ai and even the metaverse so that they can really remain relevant longer term into the future that's something that I just feel they have to do you can't just rake in all of this money and do nothing with it that's how companies gradually become irrelevant over time they eventually start to disappear so I applaud meta for the moves I think it's the right thing to do use that money spend it and that's what we're seeing happen here with AI especially and they're reaping the rewards now um with that said though uh metaverse alone has been taking up a lot of their Investments and some people are not too happy with it as the reality lab segment which uh contains the the metaverse Investments Within it well it is at least posting a few hundred million in Revenue per quarter now but the total losses since 2020 have been about $50 billion and that's been a huge pill to swallow for investors it's why the stock has been so volatile since then and many people still would not touch this stock with a 10-ft pole but I just think that the Investments are worth it especially into AI as a whole and I continue to own this stock longterm myself speaking of which it climbed about 5% for the week to now about a record high but the interesting thing about it is that the valuation is still pretty attractive with a PEG ratio that is over 177% cheaper than the sector if you can believe it and that just really shows how profitable they are and how that's expected to continue into the future and that's what helps drive down that valuation and I think still leaves meta as a pretty attractive stock.",

    "company": "Amazon",
    "excerpt": "up next so we had Amazon one of my absolute favorite stocks in history really and they were a bit of a different story here in this quarter as the stock actually fell close to 9% this week after they missed on revenue and provided lower guidance than expected The funny thing though is that I care much more about their profits at this point Amazon is the type of dominant company that I never have to really worry about they're going to remain dominant they're going to find new ways to tap into growth for sales new markets to enter and take over so I'm not worried about the revenue side of things and by the way I'm not worried about profits either because I know that these will these these higher C cash profits will come over time as a long-term investor I am patient enough to wait for that but I just think that it's funny here that sales barely missed by half a percentage Point while profits destroyed analyst estimates by over 23% that's something that people have always complained about Amazon right this is not profitable it's not going to be very profitable well they destroyed estimates by over 23% and yet Wall Street actually sold the stock down that's wild to me anyway mind you guys this is a company here that is doing now almost 150 billon ion Dollar in Revenue per quarter so what the fudge else does uh you know Wall Street want from this company I mean they're just on fire and look I get it the stock is trading at near an all-time high but still I've always felt like people underestimate Amazon because of how much the stock has climbed and yet you know it's still smaller than Apple it's smaller than Microsoft it's smaller than Nvidia those companies are what like $3 trillion market caps or more each Amazon is still less than two trillion I actually think that Amazon should have been the first $3 trillion market cap company but that's actually not the case and to be worth so much less than like Nvidia that's pretty crazy to me anyway back to the report Cloud actually beat estimates that's a great sign for still being the largest provider there advertising slightly missed that could be better and they're projecting Revenue growth of around 10% in the current quarter which I think is great but it missed estimates from analyst too CNBC Notes too though that competition is heating up especially from Chinese discount Rivals like teu and Shane Shen I don't know how to pronounce that but that's apparently a big Chinese rival while Amazon's online store sales only grew by 5% year-over-year which management pointed to the weaker macroeconomy for as consumers are choosing to buy cheaper products which lower their average selling price but I would argue what do you expect I mean the economy is doing pretty bad right now inflation interest rates continue to weigh on consumers are through the roof so of course consumers are going to choose cheaper products it's going to drive down the average selling price not much of a surprise to me and it's not a concern either as a long-term investor in Amazon the fact that their most profitable segment cloud is still growing by almost 20% and it topped estimates despite being the market leader that is a very positive sign I think Amazon is still a great stock to own long term and I definitely think that it's a buy on any dips.",

    "excerpt": "lastly of the big dogs though we had Apple report which I'll be honest with you guys while I do own the stock myself it a small small position but it's uh easily my least favorite of the big Tech Giants and I have not been buying any of the stock for a while now and I don't plan on adding any more it's not that I think it's a bad stock by any means I still plan on holding it long term but I do think that it is way overpriced at this point I just think the other Tech giants like Microsoft Google and Amazon should be trading actually higher than Apple even though that's not the case the biggest reason why I feel this way is that I just don't think Apple is very Innovative anymore I mean I've seen people praising this as an AI stock but I can't really understand why I mean they're just adding AI features to their products like iPhones and stuff it's not going to really move the needle in terms of driving new giant growth for them it might help a little bit on services and we are seeing Services still perform well but iPhone sales still make up the vast majority of their business and yet it actually declined in the quarter while overall revenue is only crawling at a slow singled digigit Pace in terms of growth so I'm not really sure what's so exciting about Apple that deserves to be trading at such a high market cap and because they beat estimates on sales and EPS along with most categories uh and put up double- digit growth in services like I mentioned though the stock actually Rose this week it is near an all-time high still it's literally the most valuable stock in the entire world at over a $3 trillion market cap um if I was going to say something I guess positive about Apple I guess I would say that I still hold it longterm because of how profitable they are they have a ton of cash they have a very sticky ecosystem they can afford to invest in new Innovations even though I don't really feel like they do but they can if they wanted to and they buy back a ton of stock and so there are reasons to just kind of hold the stock I just don't think it should be worth as much as it is I don't think there's much growth to be had for the future and I just think the other Tech Giants are better buys with my money at the moment so that's just kind of how I feel about Apple.",

    "company": "AMD",
    "excerpt": "with that said though the last couple stocks to finish up here we had two chip Giants and AMD and Intel who also reported this week but had very different outcomes AMD put up a pretty good showing with the stock initially Rising on their earnings beats as well as some Geo political Tailwinds that may help them in the future before reversing course which I'll touch on in just a second but they just posted a slight beat on EPS which was a huge recovery on net income to year over-year while also guiding for a little more in Revenue this quarter than what analysts were expecting AMD is of course the second largest vendor of discrete gpus only behind Nvidia which uh of course have soared in popularity thanks to Ai and the data center and yet nvidia's stock actually more than doubled this year while AMD has been negative but it looks like AMD is starting to make some greater progress there as CEO Lisa Sue noted higher than expected demand for their AI chips in the quarter and they are having uh to raise their guidance for data center gpus by half a billion dollars as a result also noting that their data center segment which includes AI chip sales more than doubled year-over year because of that Rising demand geopolitically AMD and other American chip vendors may also experience a new Tailwind in the future as Reuters is reporting now that the US will exclude allies like Japan the Netherlands and South Korea from a recent export ban ON Semiconductor semiconductor uh related equipment and yet the stock actually fell for the week uh which was a little surprising but the entire sector really got beaten down heavily towards the end of the week because of macroeconomic reports about the economy doing worse than expected right now so that's kind of what dragged it down a bit plus you also had Intel report some horrendous numbers that we'll jump into in just a second but overall AMD stock fell about 7% for the week and while it is still up over 3,000% in the past decade it is also down over 30% from the top I actually do kind of like AMD at these levels I don't own it myself I used to I made a lot of profits on it but I right now have a huge position in Nvidia and I also have a small speculative position in Intel but AMD does look good too I can definitely understand owning that one.",

    "company": "Intel",
    "excerpt": "speaking of Intel though the stock had a horrible showing Falling by over 30% just this week alone leaving it now trading for literally the lowest price of the past decade and down close to 70% from the top it is really crazy just how much this company has I would say deteriorated over the years now of course much of this is due to the rise of Nvidia and AMD with their gpus being heavily used for AI and data center while Intel's CPUs have been less popular and they've also dealt with countless issues manufacturing their own chips which looks like the issues just continue to weigh on them this quarter resulted in them missing estimates on both the top and bottom line while also announcing that they will cut their dividend and lay off 15,000 workers which is an unbelievable amount and de for you know for sure prayers and thoughts and heart goes out to uh all those workers losing their jobs definitely don't want to see that so what is causing all of this well I dug into the report a bit here and really the two things that stood out to me the most were The Foundry business and their Altera business now Foundry is huge for them because that's where they build their chips that's that segment and of course that's uh been taking on a huge expansion recently because of the American subsidies and tax incentives and the West just in general kind of trying to uh rely a bit less on Asia for their chip for chip manufacturing so there are some Tailwinds there however those Tailwinds have not really materialized quite yet and it might take a couple more years until we really start to see the benefits from it but as it stands Foundry is losing tons of money for Intel with the last three quarters showing uh sequential declines in both sales and operating income on top of that there's subsidiary Altera uh which makes custom programmable chips for areas of telecommunication Automotive Aerospace and defense and even the data center it saw a 57% crash in sales year-over-year but the interesting thing is that everything else was positive for Intel total Intel products was actually up 4% so it's really just these two areas that I feel uh are really weighing down on Intel the heaviest and that's what's kind of dragging them and it's what's hurting them a lot to which management did at least address these concerns in the earnings call they said that The Foundry business was expected to Peak in losses this year and it should eventually start recovering from all the incentives to which they actually think it will generate considerable earnings growth long term also noting that some big companies are even enlisting Intel to build chips for them notably Microsoft who already has $15 billion booked in uh for sales for Intel they also noted that Altera is rebounding this quarter and they're optimistic that it will see a good year in 2025 noting that much of the losses being experienced right now are also due to capacity moves and restructurings of the business from factories that aren't being utilized effectively enough to ones that are operating more efficiently but look at the end of the day they'll say whatever they need to say to bring back investor confidence but the point is that Intel just has not been competing effectively enough with Nvidia or AMD for years now and that's really hurt them they've lost market share especially on the CPU side and they have not been competing nearly as well enough as Nvidia on the AI side of things uh so they really need to start fighting back with some Innovative products if they want to survive time will tell if that happens I'm not sure that laying off so much of your Workforce is going to get that job done for you but if I'm trying to be more optimistic about Intel I would probably argue that as unfortunate as it is cutting so many workers should help you save some money that can be used for investing in more Innovative products help you run leaner more efficiently help you survive and then most importantly cutting that dividend I mean that div I don't even I could not care less about that dividend get that dividend out of there because you're going to need as much of this money as you can get your hands on in order to compete with Nvidia and AMD so hopefully you start releasing more Innovative products which they are to be fair starting to do they're entering discrete gpus I don't know how that's going to turn out but right now ai accelerator custom chips these are new chips that they're making that looks to be a lot more promising gouty 3 is their newest one um it's getting praised a lot for price and performance compared to Nvidia and they're aiming to ramp that up in the second half of this year and going into the future so we'll have to see how that starts to perform if if that does well in sales and they can really build off of that that would help a lot help Intel recover a bit right now I guess my overall conclusion on Intel is just that it's a stock that obviously the company is struggling but the stock has crashed by so much it's very kind of unbelievable and the valuation is 70% cheaper than the sector despite them still being a market leader in CPUs so I just think that there is some promise here for a recovery for Intel again we'll see how it turns out it's only a small bet by me it's a small gam kind of uh speculative bet by me but and and of course I have way more money in Nvidia but I still just kind of want to have a piece of Intel because I think they are going to matter for America and the West becoming less chip reliant on the east or on Asia and stuff like that too so I think there's a lot of ways that Intel could recover but we'll have to see if those catalysts actually uh bear some for Intel anyway thanks for stopping by my friends I hope you enjoyed this week's earnings update hope uh you enjoyed it let me know down below if you have any questions or any thoughts on anything we discussed and I will catch you in the next video all right take care everybody bye-bye [Music]",
