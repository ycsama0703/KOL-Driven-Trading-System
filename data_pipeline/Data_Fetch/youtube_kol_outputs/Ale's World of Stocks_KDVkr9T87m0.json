    "excerpt": "hey what's up everyone we are back with another review video of five stocks that giant investors are buying and what better way to kick things off for the most recent quarter of Trades than to look at what is by far the largest asset management company in the entire world in Black Rock who being led by CEO Larry Frink it's often considered the one company with the most influence over the entire stock market as they currently hold over $1 trillion of assets under management that's what like probably uh close to half the entire economy of America I mean it's freaking wild how large they are anyway being that they have so much influence it's always interesting to see what stocks they're buying and they were just forced to disclose all their purchases from the previous quarter this past week so let's take a a quick look now at the five largest of those purchases and as always I'll give you my own opinion on each one and I'll even rank them from best to worst two just to make it a little more fun and interesting as well ... okay moving on to purchase number uh four though well it looks like one giant Investment Company decided to buy the stock of another with Berkshire Hathaway ticker symbol BR rkb at another 2% increase bringing it up to over $45 billion worth in the portfolio ... the third largest purchase here from Black Rock is actually one of my largest Holdings and that is Amazon ticker symbol amzn which they increased their position on by adding another 11 plus million more shares bringing the stake up to over 115 billion worth at about 2.7% of the overall portfolio ... starting with purchase number two here we have Nvidia ticker symbol nvda which Black Rock added over 2.5 million more shares of last quarter bringing the state up to almost $165 billion worth and Worth close to 4% of the overall portfolio too ... and that is the mighty Microsoft tier symbol msft coming in here at the largest purchase which Black Rock added another 7 million more shares of bringing the stake up to almost 230 billion do making it the only stock on the list to make up over 5% of the overall portfolio ... maybe not the most exciting quarter from Black Rock in the sense that you probably already know most of these names and maybe you even own some of these stocks too in your portfolio just like I do but it does make sense to me for you know the largest asset management company to want to played a little saf here with some of the best names in the market like Amazon Microsoft Nvidia who are all Proven Winners and proven leaders in several different high growth Tech markets some of the most important markets out there and uh yeah so I can't really disagree with their moves there I like those stocks myself but let me know what you think about these uh purchases here by Black Rock do you own any of these stocks yourself do you agree or disagree with anything I said today I'd love to hear your thoughts and is there any other you know Investment Company or uh famous investor that you want me to take a look at too let me know down there in the comment section and I can make that video for you but thanks again for stopping by my friends I hope that you are all doing well I hope you enjoyed the video I'll catch you in the next one all right take care everybody bye-bye",

    "excerpt": "all right so let's count down here from smallest to largest position in the portfolio among these uh stock purchases here and coming in at number five purchase number five we have the retail giant Costco ticker symbol Co which only makes up around half a perc of the overall portfolio yet it's still worth over $23 billion after increasing it by another 5% last quarter adding over 1.7 million more shares now I do believe I have talked about Costco maybe a couple times in the past but as you might recall it's a name that I consider to be uh pretty strong in the retail space however it's definitely not my favorite in terms of size and strength though there is a lot to like as the company has been growing their financials in most years with last year in particular seen pretty gigantic sales of over $240 billion doll and several several other billions in net income profit as well however for that size 6 billion on the bottom line compared to over 240 billion on the top line that's pretty weak margins in my opinion as it's only less than 3% that they're converting there in terms of market share though you do have to respect the fact that they are currently the third largest retailer in America only behind two even larger behemoths like Walmart and Amazon with also a fairly well diversified retail business that while it primarily relies on physical giant warehouses it has at least expanded in recent years into not only growing their online presence but also operating a pharmacy Center optical center Auto Center and more all conveniently within their warehouses too as well as online plus their subscription plans bring in steady uh recurring revenues for them which is Ni nice to have to and usually when people sign up for Costco they tend to keep those memberships for a long time and so I'm sure that this is a legacy retailer that can Outlast most smaller competitors thanks to that strong business however as long as Amazon is around I just can't find any reason to own this one when I could use that money to buy Amazon stock instead as most retail growth is obviously found online while Amazon also has the advantage of being a much more Diversified company particularly within Tech like cloud computing AI EVS video streaming music gaming and much more and as such Amazon is not only much larger doing more than double the sales of Costco but it's even growing at a much higher rate too and in fact it's at double the rate despite that gigantically larger size so I'm not really sure why black rock loves this one so much I mean the stock isn't even a great value either not only trading near a record high but also hundreds of percents more expensive than the sector median on a PE ratio basis so even though I like the business I just think that as long as I have Alternatives like Amazon to invest in Costco will continue to be of pretty much little to no interest for me and because of that it's going to get the last place ranking for now until I see what else is on this list",

    "excerpt": "in terms of market share though you do have to respect the fact that they are currently the third largest retailer in America only behind two even larger behemoths like Walmart and Amazon with also a fairly well diversified retail business that while it primarily relies on physical giant warehouses it has at least expanded in recent years into not only growing their online presence but also operating a pharmacy Center optical center Auto Center and more all conveniently within their warehouses too as well as online plus their subscription plans bring in steady uh recurring revenues for them which is Ni nice to have to and usually when people sign up for Costco they tend to keep those memberships for a long time and so I'm sure that this is a legacy retailer that can Outlast most smaller competitors thanks to that strong business however as long as Amazon is around I just can't find any reason to own this one when I could use that money to buy Amazon stock instead as most retail growth is obviously found online while Amazon also has the advantage of being a much more Diversified company particularly within Tech like cloud computing AI EVS video streaming music gaming and much more and as such Amazon is not only much larger doing more than double the sales of Costco but it's even growing at a much higher rate too and in fact it's at double the rate despite that gigantically larger size so I'm not really sure why black rock loves this one so much I mean the stock isn't even a great value either not only trading near a record high but also hundreds of percents more expensive than the sector median on a PE ratio basis so even though I like the business I just think that as long as I have Alternatives like Amazon to invest in Costco will continue to be of pretty much little to no interest for me and because of that it's going to get the last place ranking for now until I see what else is on this list ... well the third largest purchase here from Black Rock is actually one of my largest Holdings and that is Amazon ticker symbol amzn which they increased their position on by adding another 11 plus million more shares bringing the stake up to over 115 billion worth at about 2.7% of the overall portfolio and yeah obviously I just talked about Amazon being one of my favorites for several different reasons and while the stock is up to a record high after climbing by more than a th000 % over the past decade leaving behind a much more expensive valuation compared to the sector well the fact is that it's actually still pretty cheap when you factor in the future profits growth potential that Amazon has never really cared about which is actually what I want them to do as a shareholder I couldn't care less about their current profits right now I just want them to focus on dominating some of these biggest you know markets in the world and do that as much as possible for the long term because I know that in the future there will be huge profits to benefit from from when they're leading some of the you know some of those most important markets and we're already seeing some great signs of this where their most profitable segments like advertising and cloud computing are actually growing much faster than their e-commerce and the totality of their entire business which is exactly what I want to see as an investor you know last quarter total sales grew by 133% which is insanely good for their size but Cloud grew even more at 177% while advertising grew by 24% the result of that well you can already see it here operating income last quarter it grew by over 200% year-over-year and net income I mean guys you're talking about 700% growth for the trailing 12 months it's absolutely insane how on fire Amazon is right now and that's why their forward PE ratio is actually 77% cheaper than their 5year average while their peeg ratio is almost the same as a sector because they're growing into that valuation and those metrics there factor that in and again none of this even matters to me right now I'm just saying that longer term this right here is what I'm looking forward to more of this more of that profitability and more of that growth in those areas but even right now in the shorter term it again just means nothing to me I have faith in Amazon stock longterm to keep investing in it even if it's at record highs because I just know that longterm this will be a world leader that governments will probably have to throttle and probably break up uh into smaller pieces because of how large and dominant and successful they are and they'll probably continue to to be anyway they get the number one ranking from me and it's a pretty easy Choice ... so I do think Amazon is more well Diversified and I'm going to keep them at the top spot there but you know Nvidia is a rip behind them I'm going to put them right there at number two they're a close second but you know what guys this last one here it could be the best one of all it's actually my personal largest holding in my own portfolio and that is the mighty Microsoft tier symbol msft coming in here at the largest purchase which Black Rock added another 7 million more shares of bringing the stake up to almost 230 billion do making it the only stock on the list to make up over 5% of the overall portfolio and yeah I love this one like the others it's also up a lot recently with almost 1,000% gains in the past decade but uh just like those other leaders well Microsoft is also doing a great job of growing into that expensive valuation and overall the company has just been absolutely on fire lately I actually covered them in a recent earnings update video and take a look at some of these numbers here guys well their Cloud business it's already the second largest in the world right and yet it's still growing north of 30% per quarter it's absolutely incredible a big reason for that is thanks to their Cloud AI Services where they're seing huge demand and speaking of AI their co-pilot AI assistant helped boost their other businesses to where it's being implemented especially in office commercial which grew by double digits where they offer new subscription plans to companies that bundle together Ai and co-pilot for their employees they even had search Rise by double digits also boosted by AI they had Windows grow by double digits that's a key rebound there in the PC markets coming off the pandemic they had more server and dynamic segments Rising by around 20% or more too and they're even seeing Xbox gaming Rise by giant amounts as well with over 60% growth in each of the last two quarters and of course I've been telling you guys for a long time now keep an eye on Xbox game pass it's going to be the next Netflix of gaming and it just so happens that some leaks came out recently suggesting that they'll be adding future Call of Duty games to the platform 2 after having acquired of course Activision Blizzard a while back and that would be absolutely huge guys Call of Duty is easily one of the bestselling game franchises around so adding it to Game Pass now well that's very likely going to attract even more signups and get them uh even more recurring revenues there which is always very important for business now the stocks valuation itself it is a bit higher than both Amazon and Nvidia at least on a peg basis however the company is one of the most profitable in the entire world they're always on fire every quarter their business does tremendously well and I just have no doubt that they will continue to dominate longterm in some of the most important markets out there so uh they're going to go very high obviously I'm going to just put them at number two I have a lot of faith in in Microsoft stock I really do like them a lot I just personally feel like Amazon as a stock price it might just be a little more attractive at the moment just slightly cheaper but I really feel like you can't go wrong with any of those three there Amazon Microsoft Nvidia some of the best stocks absolute best in in the market in the entire world but there you have it guys maybe not the most exciting quarter from Black Rock in the sense that you probably already know most of these names and maybe you even own some of these stocks too in your portfolio just like I do but it does make sense to me for you know the largest asset management company to want to played a little saf here with some of the best names in the market like Amazon Microsoft Nvidia who are all Proven Winners and proven leaders in several different high growth Tech markets some of the most important markets out there and uh yeah so I can't really disagree with their moves there I like those stocks myself but let me know what you think about these uh purchases here by Black Rock do you own any of these stocks yourself do you agree or disagree with anything I said today I'd love to hear your thoughts and is there any other you know Investment Company or uh famous investor that you want me to take a look at too let me know down there in the comment section and I can make that video for you but thanks again for stopping by my friends I hope that you are all doing well I hope you enjoyed the video I'll catch you in the next one all right take care everybody bye-bye",

    "excerpt": "starting with purchase number two here we have Nvidia ticker symbol nvda which Black Rock added over 2.5 million more shares of last quarter bringing the state up to almost $165 billion worth and Worth close to 4% of the overall portfolio too now it's funny cuz I actually just put out a video on Nvidia stock talking about how an analyst from HSBC is really bullish on it and still thinks that it can climb another 50% despite the stock having already skyrocketed by over 2,000% in the past 5 years and almost 20,000% in the past 10 years it's pretty wild how on fire nvidia's stock has been now I don't want to spoil that video for anyone that still wants to watch it but I will just say here really quick a couple things about Nvidia one is that even after soaring by so much what you have to keep in mind that they are absolutely dominating the AI Market with Wells Fargo projecting around 98% server GPU market share and JP Morgan estimating over half of the entire AI market and it's because of that along with the fact that AI is booming right now that Nvidia has really been putting up tremendous growth that can kind of justify that rise in stock price with data center revenue for example surging by over 400% last quarter and total profits net income what up nearly seven times last year guys this is what I'm talking about here it's similar to Amazon in that yeah technically nvidia's valuation is expensive it's around 30 to 50% higher than the sector on a Ford P but compared to their 5-year average it's actually 37% cheaper while their p G ratio factoring in the future growth for the next 5 years expected it's not only 50% lower than their 5year average but even lower by about the same amount compared to the sector that's pretty freaking wild for what is clearly a giant market leader here again it's very similar to Amazon where longterm they can grow into that valuation so I do think Amazon is more well Diversified and I'm going to keep them at the top spot there but you know Nvidia is a rip behind them I'm going to put them right there at number two they're a close second but you know what guys this last one here it could be the best one of all
