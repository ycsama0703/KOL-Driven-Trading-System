    "excerpt": "I asked Elon Musk's Grok AI for the Top 5 Stocks to Buy for 2025! so AI chatbots have really been all the Rave these past couple years and more recently one of the biggest new entrance to rise in popularity is Elon musk's grock AI which is actually integrated into x what was formerly Twitter now normally to get access to grock you have to pay for a premium membership on X however there's actually a cool website that lets you play around with any AI chatbot that you want to so I chose the newest version of of grock and I asked the AI to give us what it thinks are the top five best stocks to buy for 2025 and Beyond so in today's video I'll run through these options that it gave us. for grock I worded my question like this I said give me the top five best stocks to buy for 2025 and Beyond. and so here are the results that it gave us. grock says despite its size Microsoft's forward-looking investments in AI cloud computing and gaming provide growth at a reasonable price. Gro says expansion in cloudservices with Azure advancements in AI through Integrations in all of its products. grock yeah it CHS it as a lowrisk option. and grock decided to go with the finance and payment process giant Visa. Gro says continued Global shift towards electronic payments. Gro says Visa's business model is less susceptible to economic downturns. grock gave us asml holding. Gro says as demand for smaller more powerful chips grow. grock decided to go with the e-commerce giant Shopify. reasonable valuation uh Gro says while high compared to traditional metrics. grock says as eCommerce continues to grow globally. Gro says competition from other e-commerce platforms. grock actually gave us a biotech in crisper therapeutic. for the valuation grock says given the speculative nature of Biotech. speaking of future growth potential grock says if successful crisper could offer treatments. Gro say the technology is still in relatively early stages. I actually love this list here from Gro I think it did a very good job of giving us several different options with a mixture of growth and even value depending on you know how you look at these how you value them but but I personally would be totally fine owning any of these five stocks myself so I like the list.",

    "excerpt": "it went with Microsoft ticker symbol msft which it says chosen from the Magnificent 7 for its Diversified Tech dominance now I'm fine with that I might have gone with something like Google or Amazon instead just because I like their current price a little more at the moment but Microsoft is actually my number one largest holding in my personal portfolio so I like it here a lot regardless now for brand strength it says Microsoft is a household name with products like Windows Office and Azure cloudservices known for reliability and innovation I 100% agree with that it's a big reason why I own Microsoft too almost everyone you know uses windows and office for work and school and everything else computer-wise and Azure of course is the second largest cloud platform in the world which often times has even more growth than even Amazon's so it's a huge play here on Cloud on AI on machine learning and Azure really helps facilitate all of that through the cloud too so I love that now reasonable valuation Gro says despite its size Microsoft's forward-looking investments in AI cloudcomputing and gaming provide growth at a reasonable price especially considering its robust Financial Health and consistent dividend growth again I totally agree here Microsoft is one of the most profitable companies in the world and while the dividend is very small it's just another nice little added bonus that they can afford to pay and grow out over time as you can see in their growth metrics on it and uh that's something they can afford to do for share holders because of the tremendous success that they've had over the years with sales not only reaching about $300 billion do per year but that Revenue guys is still somehow growing at about a 14% growth rate I mean it's absolutely incredible for that size so even though the stock is expensive by most valuation metrics you arguably get what I think is really one of the best if not the best run company in the world with a ton of quality for that price now for future growth potential potential Gro says expansion in cloudservices with Azure advancements in AI through Integrations in all of its products and potential in Quantum Computing uh position Microsoft for sustained growth that's another huge positive for Microsoft there really the fact that they are now integrating maybe slowly but over time it's going to really ramp up integrating artificial intelligence into all other parts of their business and office and windows and Cloud this will only grow larger over time guys and what it really does too is it's going to be strengthening their brand their MO their overall business even further too and there's even other great things that they're doing as well like with gaming mentioned earlier by grock it's becoming like the Netflix of gaming with Game Pass it's something that doesn't get talked about nearly enough in my opinion with Microsoft stock but I think it should be because it's just more evidence of how insanely good Microsoft is at generating recurring subscription Revenue it's probably my favorite thing about Microsoft you know along with artificial intelligence and and in Office 365 and in GitHub and in LinkedIn the list goes on of different platforms different areas that Microsoft generates consistent subscription revenue and that's huge it's you can't want much more than that it's the best thing for a long-term kind of vision for a company now for risk grock yeah it CHS it as a lowrisk option it says that it's Diversified revenue streams and leadership in multiple Tech sectors reduce the risk and I also agree with that and it's why I've chosen Microsoft as our lowrisk option in several of my three stocks to buy monthly videos in the past to I do think the stock is a little expensive at the moment but I can't deny that it's still one of the best overall stocks in the entire market for the long term so I'm ranking it high here at number two until we see what else is on this list there's still not nearly as large and diversified as Microsoft so I'm keeping Microsoft above them at number two but Visa will go just under them at number three and I'll bump Microsoft up one spot to fit them in.",
