    "excerpt": "as some of you may or may not be aware of Nvidia actually has a pretty large Venture Capital division that invest in other companies and stocks especially smaller tech companies that need uh really help building up larger over time with nvidias of course help and expertise in areas of artificial intelligence robotics gaming and other similar Technologies which in return Nvidia gets stock in these companies and partners up with them and can gradually benefit from their success too well this past year nvidia's Investments got so large that they're now required to submit a 13f report to the SEC every quarter which means we get to see exactly how much money they have invested in these specific companies and because they just reported again about a week ago well we're going to take a look at these stocks ourselves and I'll give you my own opinion on each one of them in today's video now there's currently uh six I'm trying to do with my messed up finger here but there's six uh stocks in total at the moment that Nvidia owns and ever since that they started having to report these figures well nvidia's stock portfolio has nearly doubled in size just in the past year alone reaching now well over $400 Million last quarter so running through these stocks here from smallest to largest position in that portfolio well we have stock number one in Nano X Imaging ticker symbol nnx which is very small for them at only 0.1% of the portfolio but worth over $360,000 now again this will probably be the least interesting of the bunch just because of how small it is however the company is developing some pretty unique and impressive imaging technology that uses artificial intelligence for greater precision and Detail in medical imaging which I feel is extremely important for the future of healthcare you know having a non-invasive way of getting into the body to see exactly what's wrong and how to fix these issues well that's going to be huge for healthcare moving forward and in this particular case you know Nano also deploys what they call simplified x-ray beds as well as lightweight 3D tomosynthesis imaging systems that they claim can scale up much faster and easier around the world without compromising on that high detail and efficiency and that's also alongside their Nano X Cloud platform that uses AI to enhance and improve the Diagnostics while also expanding its reach even further because of uh you know its ability to use the cloud like I said it's all pretty fascinating work and it's obviously an area that Nvidia you know can really help them with in terms of scaling up and expanding as the demand Rises while Nano can also help Nvidia get deeper into the healthcare Tech an AI field of course though Nano is still in the very early stages of commercializing their products with only a small presence in just a handful of countries where they are still working their way through various regulatory hurdles as they work on bringing more of their products to market the results being deep losses that are even greater than what they currently generate in sales now the stock has at least Fallen greatly from the top down almost 80% since they ipoed a few years ago and even much more from the giant highs that they briefly reached uh you know shortly after before then crashing all the way back down again to now being almost considered a penny stock today which may entice some speculative you know higher risk more oriented kind of investors to jump in now considering the high Revenue growth too of over 30% this year and another 200% plus expected next year probably coming from the recent FDA approval of their Nano X Arc platform that should help them expand further in America however for me the stock is still just a bit too speculative for my taste as the price of sales ratio is still extremely high at over 30 so they're going to really have to put up continuously really high growth numbers to even make this stock even a little justifiable from just a sales perspective alone my guess is that Nvidia wants to take a small Bet On It Here look at this Tech see how it evolves see how they can benefit or help this company grow and then maybe benefit from that over the long term but for me it's one that I'm going to be passing on myself as an outside investor for the moment with that said though stock number two is actually uh a lot of people consider to be much lower risk and less speculative of an AI stock and I certainly agree with that too and that is actually a very good company here in SoundHound AI ticker symbol s o u n which Nvidia owns about $8 million of and is worth 2% of the overall portfolio now the thing about SoundHound is that they really got popular through that smartphone app that helps the user detect a particular song that's playing in the background and then it gives you all the information for it however more recently while they've expanded much further on this sound detection technology they started integrating artificial intelligence into it making it much more powerful where the voice AI can now recognize and respond to all kinds of different voice prompts and speech even in different languages now it's really being used more heavily more recently in many speaker systems of like you know fast food drive-throughs it's used for phone and in store ordering and it's even used for handling customer service as well as in store operations with staff with just a few of their notable food customers including White Castle Jersey mics and even Crispy Cream but it doesn't stop there SoundHound also has a growing Automotive AI assistant platform that is not only being used by Mercedes Honda Kia and more but they're even partnered with square Qualcomm and just countless other companies that use their Tech in several different ways in fact Nvidia themselves are already benefiting from their closer relationship with SoundHound as their SoundHound AI platform and Technology it's actually being integrated into nvidia's own Drive platform as well that is often used for in autonomous driving and smart car kind of systems and they they're even integrating generative AI too like those found in chat GPT or Google's Gemini which SoundHound continues to expand on anyway the result has been soaring financials for the company with total sales growing by nearly 50% a year so far with the next two years expected to accelerate even further raising to nearly 100% growth which is really impressive unfortunately though this is another unprofitable company at the moment with deep losses on the bottom line and Rich valuation after seeing the stock price rise leaving a price of sales ratio of almost 30 I actually really like this stock but only as a speculative high-risk option I don't own it myself at least not yet because I'm not really looking for that type of stock at the moment however I completely understand why others are taking a chance on them and I do think they'll have a bright future with Rising demand for voice Ai and especially if Nvidia can help them uh in the future too all right up next though we have a newer pickup for NVIDIA this is actually a robotics company that barely ipoed this year so it's very interesting and this is serve robotics C symbol s RV which Nvidia owns over $30 million of at about 7% of the portfolio now as the name implies serve develops and operates electric robots for the services industry starting first with food delivery before later expanding into more areas that they plan to in the future now because of this even Uber has decided to invest and partner up with serve 2 using their zero emission AI powerered autonomous robots to deliver food for Uber Eats the company is even partnering with 7-Eleven and other brands too but Uber eat is really the more important one at the moment as they've already ordered a couple thousand of these uh kind of smaller insize robots that can drive around the city delivering food autonomously which they're already operating in Los Angeles with about a hundred of them and they have plans to expand elsewhere around the country throughout the coming year too as you would expect though financials have been pretty bad so far with very little sales and millions of dollars in losses however that is expected to improve dramatically in the coming years thanks to those new orders and also because of the really large Market size that they estimate to be worth $450 billion by 2030 whereas they only do thousands in Revenue at the current moment or at least in last you know last year however once again the issue really becomes for me valuation which we'll have to do some analysis on here but basically serve ipoed earlier this year I think it was technically for around like $4 a share but either way it quickly soared up to almost $18 probably at the time that the market found out that Nvidia was investing in them however just a month later it crashed all the way back down to around $8 a share where it continues to hover around today now you compare this to the revenue well like I said sales are expected to sore in the coming years so 2026 for example it's expected to grow by nearly like 300% up to more than 62 million dollar that's very good growth for them however when we calculate the price of sales ratio well we get a PS of over 1,900 for last year 181 for this year 24 for next year and still six by the year 202 2026 now obviously that's getting dramatically better over time right but again we're talking about at least a couple years out until we really see that happen while also assuming that everything goes perfectly well for them to get down to those valuations and they have to be able to hit all of their targets basically which even then they would still not be profitable by that time either and I wouldn't expect them to be for several more years out anyway so again unfortunately just a little bit too rich for me I totally understand why others like it and see potential in it very very high growth obviously but I just can't bring myself to buy in this early on at that high of a price tag till I see a little more but I'll I'll be keeping a close eye on this one all right stock number four though is actually one that I keep telling myself that I need to buy this one but uh just haven't gotten around to it but maybe I will soon because that stock is recursion pharmaceutical SEC symbol rxrx which Nvidia owns over $50 million of and is worth 12% of the portfolio now recursion is often thought of as really Kathy Woods like one of her favorite biotechs it's one of her largest really but what I think is much more important is their partnership with Nvidia because their platform actually uses AI for discovering new drugs at lower cost and higher efficiency reducing the time that it takes to research identify and even develop new treatments and while their own programs are still going through trials the company supplements that by licensing out the platform to other giants like Ro bear Mark and more but sticking with Nvidia here for a second they're act they've actually helped recursion build literally what is considered the most powerful biotech supercomputer in the world that is used for analyzing over 50 pedabytes of health related data that they gained through another partnership with Tempest all of that alone makes me super interested in this stock for what is really one of the largest most robust Healthcare AI research platforms for the future now the problem however is that just like the rest of these ruran is another unprofitable company here with a rich valuation there losses far eclipse what they even generate in sales while the price of sales metric itself is also skyh high at over 23 however with the stock price now trading at just about the lowest levels that we've ever seen and considering that all it would really take is maybe like one or two breakout treatments to send their financial soaring and the rich valuation tanking well I'm not opposed at all to taking a small chance on this one here it's a very small kind of speculative stock to bet on long term I think they have a ton of potential and it's one that I am actually interested in all right guys we're now down to the final two stocks these are the two largest and coming in at number five but we actually have a brand new pickup here by Nvidia who's already become their second larg is holding and that is applied digital ticker symbol apld which Nvidia now owns $64 million of worth about 15% of the overall P portfolio now applied if you've never heard of them the biggest thing they do is build these large is build and host these large nextg data centers for high performance Computing cloud and even blockchain and cryptocurrency operations in fact crypto uh crypto hosting I should say is currently the largest part of their business and considering how Nvidia and AMD chips in particular are so often used for crypto mining well it it does actually make sense here that Nvidia would want to invest more heavily into this area as well also because apply digital themselves use tons of Nvidia gpus in their own data centers as it is so the match just makes perfect sense all around now as we all know there's been a significant rise in demand for AI and cryptocurrencies which applied host many of these companies and their operations which we can see evidence of in the rise of hyperscale data centers being built worldwide as well as the recent skyrocketing price of Bitcoin that has once again reached a new all-time high the result also being high growth for applied digital as their sales nearly tripled last year however this is where the bad news mostly starts as analysts expect that growth to dwindle down over time falling to 65% next year 55% the year after and only 20% the year after that which even then they would still not be expecting to generate positive EPS meaning we have to really value this stock here based on sales once again and after having more than doubled in the past year with a price to sales ratio of more than six well I just think that the stock here is a little too expensive for me at the moment don't get me wrong I do think that they're doing a great job of carving out a nice kind of n niche in the crypto space especially but I just own so many great data center stocks as it is like Microsoft Google Amazon Alibaba more that it's a little just too crowded of a space for me at the moment to be taking on another you know risky or higher risk kind of name like this too so it's going to be a pass for me but finally guys coming in as the largest holding of all at stock number six we have what many consider to be much lower risk with what is actually another chips related company in arm holding s symbol arm which Nvidia currently holds over $280 million of withth the whopping 65% of the entire portfolio now when it comes to the business arm is responsible for Designing the most popular chip architecture in the world that many other chips are actually built on including by the way around 99% of all smartphone processors which arm then gets to collect royalty and Licensing fees on those and the reason why it's so popular is because arm is the really the more simpler kind of battery efficient architecture as opposed to x86 and thus arm chips are usually used for smaller devices as opposed to you know something like massive data centers where there is actually still huge potential in not just for the smaller uh you know components smaller chips there's like The Internet of Things there's smartphones there's a lot of lot going on there but even as they grow into the more power hungry areas too while arm still tries to maintain efficiency that's made them so popular but just kind of deliver on higher power as well so um there's a lot of areas where they can continue to expand anyway the point being that Nvidia sees so much potential in arm themselves that they even tried to flat out acquire arm uh at one point before the deal was ultimately blocked by Regulators because of how powerful really it would make Nvidia and thus they've had to resort to just doing smaller Partnerships while also investing in the stock instead now arm only recently ipoed last year and so far the stock has been a very strong performer currently up about 50% over that time which is a direct result of rising AI demand and the likely large profits that will come from that in the future which at the moment arm is already profitable with a new record high in net income reported this past year sales usually rise consistently by over 20% a year to and EPS is expected to continue soaring by large amounts as well but after the run up in stock price so too has the valuation gotten very expensive with a 4p ratio that would still be about 50 even by the year 2027 according to an analyst estimates and even by the much more forgiving peeg ratio it still trades about 30% more expensive than the sector I mean at that price I'd rather just buy more Nvidia stock whose Peg is actually 30% cheaper than the sector despite their giant market cap so even though I love the business of arm I just can't really bring myself to buy into it at this current valuation but hey there you have it guys overall I understand why Nvidia is buying these stocks here because of how much they can partner with them mutually benefit from their Technologies while helping them grow larger too and potentially get a rise in stock price that can help benefit them but for an outside investor like myself I just see most of these as a bit too higher risk type of stocks that I would only want to buy if I'm specifically looking for that a riskier kind of gamble on the future rather than what we usually carry you know most of us in our portfolios which are by far larger and more wellestablished companies safer stocks that we don't have to worry so much about but hey there are a couple names on here that I did like and I'd love to hear what you guys think about these stocks how do you feel about it I'd love to hear your thoughts Down Below in the comment section",
