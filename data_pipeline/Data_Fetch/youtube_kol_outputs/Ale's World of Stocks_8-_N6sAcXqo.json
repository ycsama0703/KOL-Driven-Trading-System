    "excerpt": "purchase number one is going to be global payment sticker symbol gpn which was a new addition to the portfolio at over $200 million worth of stock being purchased just in that quarter and it was uh still only worth less than 1% of the overall portfolio because that's how big they are now if you've never heard of this company here or the stock well gpn is of course a Payment Processing Company that basically facilitates the transactions between not just customers and Merchants but also business to business as well as offering additional services and add-ons as well including payroll and more therefore it's a fintech that is notably benefiting from the gradual shift in finance towards digital payments which is a market that nearly doubled inside during the pandemic years and even now moving forward it's just a general Trend that will very likely continue with analysts expecting it to add another $6 trillion of transaction value over just the next few years according to statista now as a result of all this well gpn's sales have been steadily Rising for years and although their profits have been a little shaky at times they've mostly been trending upwards too with last year in particular being a record year for both the top and bottom line the only concern though that Wall Street does seem to have right now is just how much growth can still be experienced in future years which not only have tough comparisons to the pandemic years which might have been more favorable to online digital sales and payments right but the other concern is that the market is also just being too heavily saturated at the moment with all kinds of rising competition showing up now now a lot of these companies that I'm about to show you they're not all direct competitors perfect ones as many of them have different characteristics different makeups to their business and what they specifically do themselves but you're still talking about many large companies in the digital payment space including recognizable names like PayPal stripe Square venmo Shopify and cash app as well as giant behemoths like Google Apple Alibaba Amazon and more again while they may not all be perfect direct competitors they're all basically giant fish within the same Lake and over time they could start to eat away at each other's market share depending on how it all plays out and because of that well sales are now only expected to rise for gpn by a mid single digit rate in each of the next upcoming two years on the bright side though this actually caused the stock to lose almost half of its entire value from the top leaving behind a very cheap valuation for a fintech like this with a PEG ratio that is 35% cheaper than the sector now part of that is also due to their earnings per share expected to actually Rise by a double digit rate on average over the next 5 years and that helps BR that helps that valuation actually be a bit lower because of that earnings growth because of that profit uh profit growth now my only concern though is you know can their revenue growth keep up with that it might the revenue growth slow down that they seem to perhaps be experiencing might that also take a little bit of a toll on their earnings growth in the future as well given the very saturated Market which to be fair I think they're doing a great job of still competing there and they have already managed to attract millions of merchants and customers to their platform servicing over a hundred different Industries worldwide so they definitely have some moat they definitely have some brand recognition that I think is strong um and I also think that it's just really impressive everything that they're doing and how they're running the business and that shows in their relatively strong financials so given that plus the overall growth of the market that do expect to get even larger over time plus the cheap stock price I actually do consider this stock to be overall a buy however the only reason why I'm not buying it myself at least not at the moment maybe in the future but the only reason is because I already own so many different stocks that give me plenty of exposure to the digital payments markets including PayPal Alibaba tensent Google Apple Amazon and more and most of those are much larger and much more Diversified companies that I feel are safer overall Investments as well but uh I'm still ranking gpn pretty high here cuz like I said I would give them an overall buy rating especially if I didn't have the stock uh if I didn't have those other stocks instead um but I'm going to put them pretty high at number two I'm going to give them the number two ranking uh because of those Pros I mentioned all right let's see what else is on this list though",

    "company": "Dell",
    "excerpt": "and that is the Legacy computers maker Dell ticker symbol D L L how long has it been since you guys you know probably considered this one but uh this one's pretty interesting here it wasn't quite a new purchase for Coen but it was a, 1600% increase up to almost $330 million and yeah when it comes to Del you know like I said I think most people don't really talk about this company a whole lot these days they used to be pretty well known for making computers especially more affordable ones it was something similar to like HP for example but more recently I actually think that they've done a very good job of diversifying it at least as much as they can into other areas like data center creation cloud computing cloud storage where where they actually ranked number one in Enterprise storage by the IDC that might surprise you I know it surprised me a little bit and they also offer many Associated services like their new Apex platform that offers higher efficiencies at lower costs and they even do a lot of work in AI now too not just through all the things I mentioned already but also in various other services and they're integrating it into their new PCS as well which could help Drive sales for those uh Dell PCS and overall all of these different moves different things I feel will help them remain relevant in a more competitive landscape over the longer term and that's a good thing like for example you look at the number of hyperscale data centers skyrocketing last year because of the rise in AI well Dell plays actually a major role in that in fact they're even helping Elon musk's X AI build the largest supercomputer data center in the world what they call Colossus used to train grock which it already houses over a 100,000 Nvidia h100 gpus and it's expected to double in size by next year too that's pretty crazy and again Dell is a major beneficiary from that work providing server racks and other components to these projects unfortunately though being a legacy PC player coming off of the pandemic highs last year was actually a significant decline for the company in Revenue but those diversification initiatives that I mentioned earlier should help them bounce back up to around a double digigit growth rate with EPS also expected to deliver similar results over the next 5 years whereas the previous five were actually negative and that's why most analysts are now very bullish on the stock and have even been raising price targets over the past year or so unfortunately though most as most of you know the market tends to be forward looking and has already priced in much of these gains with the stock Rising by over 300 % over the past 5 years however if we zoom in a bit we can see that from the recent highs the stock has actually dipped in recent months fing by almost 40% which also leaves behind a dirt cheap valuation that is around 40% cheaper than the sector on most metrics I know it's been a lot of back and forth on this stock here that I've been giving you but uh I'm actually I would say overall fairly bullish on Dell stock at the moment I think that it is looking pretty attractive at these levels which by the way it also pays a nice little dividend two but regardless when ranking it it's going to be a very tough one to rank I feel like they're very tied with gpn I would go with either one of them at this point but I'm going to give gpn just the very slight edge here and bump them up to number one uh to fit Dell in right behind them at number two that's kind of just what my gut is telling me but again I feel like they're very close with all of that said though we are now left with the fifth and final purchase which is the largest of the list at least you know in relation to these ones and that is none other than Apple tiger symbol AAP which like the others Cohen added the stock as a brand new position last quarter buying up over $330 Million worth now this one did surprise me a little given that we recently had some other giant investors like Warren Buffett and Ray Doo actually selling the stock recently which I made a whole video about and my theory is that they did this mostly because of how much the stock has climbed recently into to lock in some profits not only with Apple stock trading at a record high right now after climbing by close to 800% over the past decade but it's also the most highly valued company in the entire world at over $3.3 trillion of a market cap which puts me in an extremely difficult position trying to rank this stock on the list because on one hand I feel like the valuation is significantly higher than the sector on virtually any metric you look at and that's not very attractive while Revenue growth appears to also be a bit Limited at their already massive size with last year in particular actually being a slight decrease but on the other hand this is one of the largest most profitable companies in the entire world that will see it doing over 400 billion and 100 billion in sales and profits next year alone with Revenue growth also expected to re accelerate pretty close to a double digit percent likely thanks to the new additions of AI and even the prospects of folding phones coming in the near future too which all of that I do feel will convince consumers to upgrade their handsets the additions of different AI services and features and again if they uh once they do make folding phones which I know are coming so because of that and several other Pros too like the fact that they have one of the biggest cash reserves in the world that they can easily choose to deploy that into any new market or growth initiative whenever they feel like it not to mention the high margin growth that they see in their service for an extremely sticky ecosystem as well as the billions they pour into stock BuyBacks year after year overall it just makes Apple an extremely difficult stock to bet against so I guess I have to give them the number one spot here by default I'm not happy about it I'm not buying any Apple stock myself at these levels although I do already own some but in terms of long-term safety it's just a stock that a lot of people like to hold on to so I kind of have to go with that ranking but let me know if you agree with this would you put Apple at number one or do you think that gpn or even maybe Dell might offer a bigger uh perhaps buying opportunity maybe you know obviously higher risk but perhaps more reward potential if they can kind of turn things around or perform well longer term I don't know I'd love to hear your thoughts maybe you think those are laughably you know much worse companies and stocks that shouldn't even be compared to apple I don't know I'd love to hear your thoughts personally I think number one to number three three the way I rank them I think they're very tied but they have different unique characteristics so it would depend on what type of investor you are or what you're looking for specifically uh to where H you know to how you might rank those but anyway thanks for stopping by my friends I want to hear your thoughts down in the comment section",
