    "excerpt": "my favorite all-around stock in the entire Market continues to be Google ticker symbol G which I know it's climbed a lot already like most other giant tech stocks especially among the Magnificent 7 but something that might surprise you is that Google consistently trades lower than many of its bigger siblings which I think makes very little sense in my opinion and should ultimately send Google stock Rising even more in the future let me explain first of all you take a look at their stock price and despite Google being one of the steadiest and strongest performing stocks out there well a recent dip this past month has actually left it down about 16% from the top which in turn when you look at the largest companies by market cap well it actually leaves Google still sitting at just under a $2 trillion cap while other giants like Amazon have surpassed that and even bigger ones like apple Microsoft and Nvidia have all soared north of $3 trillion yet I actually think that Google deserves to be right up there with them in fact here's a few charts that I created to help illustrate some of this now you look at their market caps and you can see how Google sits well behind all of them yet when you look at their businesses Google is performing just as well if not better than most when it comes to sales if you exclude the giant outlier of Amazon because of course of how many people shop on amazon.com well Google actually comes in just a bit behind apple with significantly more Revenue than both Microsoft and Nvidia in fact it's almost as much as both of those combined and the same goes for their dominance in profitability where they do almost double the amount of net income as Amazon and are only behind Apple in terms of size at a massive $88 billion last year basically tied with Microsoft there but again those companies are worth more than a trillion dollars more than Google so how does that make any sense and by the way it's not like Google is in decline in fact they're putting up incredible growth numbers on both the top and bottom line with sales even Rising by a double digigit percent every year despite them already doing over 300 billion that's insane and profits are just as crazy with EPS growth of over 20% per year expected over the next five years and guys that's even after they already did over 20% growth in the previous 5 too so what could it be well maybe you could argue that these other companies are doing a ton of work in artificial intelligence right I mean we've seen lots of market caps balloon recently because of the rise of AI you know these past couple years well even there you could argue that Google is maybe the most important player in artificial intelligence certainly one of the biggest cuz what's at the core of AI it's data right well who has more data than Google they lead almost every internet based Market out there they have more search more email more maps and travel data they have business apps they have the number one market share in digital advertising that huge they have YouTube the number one streaming platform in the world that's even ahead of Netflix they have autonomous driving with whmo they even have the number one largest smartphone operating system with Android even ahead of apple plus they also have Chrome the number one browser as well and they have Gemini 2 the new generative AI platform that's being integrated into many other areas for Google too including by the way their pixel lineup of products and services which happens to be similar to Apple's I mean they even do AI in healthcare so they really do it all plus they even have a giant cloud computing platform to help power all of that too the third largest in the world so with all of that in mind what could it possibly be keeping Google out of those you know two and three trillionaires clubs well it's got to be the valuation right nope not even there in fact Google actually has a cheaper peeg ratio than the sector median despite them being the clear market leader so I just think when it comes to lower risk stocks Google is at the top I would say for me I feel that the stock is a Buy on any dips this one included and even as high as the market cap is already I actually think that it'll continue to go much higher over the long term so I love Google stock",

    "excerpt": "finally guys that's going to leave us now with stock number three the highest risk of the bunch and for this one uh I'm actually going to go with perhaps a lesser known name in artificial intelligence but one that has been beaten down into the ground and is trading at such a cheap valuation that I just think it's being heavily slept on and I'm picking up shares myself and that is super micro computer ticker symbol smci this is a company that basically sells various components for computing servers as well as the actual fullon servers themselves which is really one of the things that really help them stand apart from the competition is just how highly customizable their servers are that can be tailored towards really any specific workload of various sizes and types and tasks including of course artificial intelligence and supercomputing as a result super micros platform is often used in combination with Nvidia gpus and they've even partnered together with Nvidia for nvidia's Omniverse as well another standout feature is their liquid cool technology alongside other innovations that really help their servers run more efficiently than much of the competition where they claim to offer the highest compute density very important makes it more powerful while also still being able to reduce heat and electricity sometimes by anywhere around 40 to even 90% depending on the rig that's huge guys it's a huge proposition for a market that is absolutely on fire with the number of hyperscale data centers continuously growing by giant amounts every year as the adoption of AI continues rise but you know one of the things that people are always worried about is uh you know how much energy that takes up well you know super micros Technologies are a bit better than most now as a result super micros financials have also been soaring right along with that too with sales and profits more than doubling in size last year and yet the stock price actually crashed more recently mostly due to two primary concerns number one is their falling margins that have been steadily dropping over the past year or so now super micro claims that this is due to initial costs related to their newest Innovations like liquid cooling Technologies which they feel those components will get cheaper for them over time and thus start to help them grow their margins again over the next couple years so it's a bit of kind of a waiting period for now but it's one that Wall Street doesn't seem to really want to wait around for and especially if it might be signaling uh more kind of pricing competition that's something that you always worry about when you see weaker margins pricing compet comptition if super micro can't really compete um as strong enough if they don't have a strong enough moat to fend off the competition then that is something that can start to eat away at the margins now I personally think that they do have a decent mode because of again the much better and more Innovative products and technologies that they offer but it's a concern for investors nonetheless another issue though that they've run into recently was catching the attention of a major short seller known as Hindenberg research which tends to short stocks then release negative reports on that compy to send the stock lower and thus profit from it which in this case they claim that super micro has committed accounting malpractice now normally I wouldn't pay too much attention into what a short seller is telling me because you know of course they tend to be incredibly biased however in this particular case it is a bit more of a cause for concern given that the doj has just today at the time of making this video uh they're now reportedly looking into the company as well now this is a developing story it's already caused the stock to sync like 15% and we don't have much of any details on it so far so keep in mind that if you're watching this video at a later date you probably know much more about this developing situation than I do so I'm working with limited information here but at the moment super micro has already denied the claims made by the short seller and in my premature opinion again with the limited information that I have I just think that this is more of a short-term kind of issue that will cause volatility for sure it's you know hurting the stock a lot but ultimately I don't think it'll matter as much in the grand scheme of things because I think Super Micro will remain just such a critical piece to the ongoing buildout of AI infrastructure worldwide that it's more just going to be a drag in the short term whereas longer term the business should still be intact but that's just my opinion either way though it's already been enough negative press to crash the stock sending it down well over 60% from from its high again there's multiple reasons for that but it's Fallen a lot uh by the way there's also going to be as if there isn't enough uh crazy things going on well there's also going to be a 1041 stock split in just a couple days so keep in mind that the actual stock price will probably be somewhere in the 30s range uh once this happens and just my quick opinion on that too is that while I don't normally care about stock splits because it doesn't change any fundamentals about a stock well they do usually outperform the market historically speaking at least with more than double the gains than the S&P 500 on average uh over the following year so I do think that it's something worth mentioning n nonetheless now something that is much more important to me though is just how Dirt Cheap of a stock this has become now with a PEG ratio of only less than 0.3 guys that is so damn low in fact it's over 86% cheaper than the sector even if the company is going through some struggles right now which by the way sales are still expected to grow by 88% this year and another 177% next year to kind of correct a little with EPS also soaring by over 50% this year and 30% expected next year well that is a ridiculously low valuation for that kind of performance in my opinion again obviously things could get worse I do think it's a higher risk stock than usual because of these various factors but with the rise of AI I just think this could be easily you know a slept on player in the AI space that is worth picking up so um we actually just added it to the the community portfolio and I am also adding it as of right now to my personal portfolio too a small SM speculative amount but yeah we'll see how it does there",
