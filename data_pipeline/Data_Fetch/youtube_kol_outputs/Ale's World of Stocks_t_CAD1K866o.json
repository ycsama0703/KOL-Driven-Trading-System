    "excerpt": "I'm going with a giant that is about to announce earnings in the coming week and that is Amazon ticker symbol amzn which look normally I would try to avoid choosing a stock like this that is you know about to announce earnings for this type of video because even though I am a long-term minded investor who really couldn't care less what a stock does in the short term I do sometimes get the occasional viewer that does care a little bit more about the shorter term and so if I can avoid some of the huge swings from earnings on a video like this then maybe I try to do so within reason however this time especially it really doesn't bother me at all because if Amazon shoots up on earnings that'll be great for me and the tons of other people that already own it maybe I'll look good with a with a video like this but if earnings are bad well that's even better in my opinion because I actually really hope I'm always hoping that Amazon stock would crash into the ground so that I can take as many people's shares off their hands as possible and build my position out even larger that's how much faith I have in Amazon stock long term but sadly I don't even think that's going to happen this time because I actually think earnings will be pretty strong and the stock is already a buy before earnings for several reasons and even after earnings too cuz first of all you have to understand just what an already massive Behemoth of a company this is with well over half a trillion dollars in sales every year and is still somehow growing at a double digit rate it's absolutely incredible and yet that's not even the biggest reason why I'm bullish what really excites me is their potential for profits as currently their net income is only a tiny fraction of their sales at around 5% but has been showing tremendous growth over the past five quarters with OP operating income surging by close to 400% in the last one year-over-year free cash flow has also been skyrocketing and with interest rates likely coming down next year I think their profitability will only get stronger and despite the stock trading near an alltime high right now their forward price of sales ratio of around 2.5 is actually not that bad considering the huge profit potential of course the biggest reason for that is because their cloud and digital advertising segments are both seen higher growth than the totality of their business which is still dominated by e-commerce but cloud and advertising are hugely more profitable and if they can continue growing like this which I think the upcoming earnings will give us a better idea of well then profits I think will continue to rise as well and that's why you see analysts projecting really high EPS growth above 30% on average over the next 5 years now cloud is already very large and dominant as the market leader but advertising is still relatively small on the global stage with only a single digit share meaning that there is plenty of room to keep growing there still not to mention that this quarter in particular is about to be the one that's about to be reported is the uh first one to include commercials on their Prime video platform which they launched at the start of the year and while that may not sound like a giant game changer for them at least not quite yet I do think that it's a great example of how Amazon is finding new ways of not just monetizing their business more effectively but also pushing further into advertising and I'll some Amazon stock up with this seeing some of these other companies break north of Two And even three trillion dollar market caps with Amazon still lagging behind them just doesn't feel right to me and as a long-term investor I have more than enough patience and and confidence to wait for them to join the club there too so I am a buyer right now and I will continue to be a buyer even after earnings too regardless of how it moves the stock but especially on any dips too",

    "excerpt": "our medium risk option stock number two has already reported this past week and it actually fell quite a lot right after that but I think it's a solid pickup on the dip and that stock is going to be meta ticker symbol mea which I don't even really consider to be all that risky either with how insanely profitable they are doing tens of billions in free cash flow every year however Wall Street is more focused at the moment on their continuingly giant investments into Ai and especially the metaverse which this most recent quarter painted another scary picture of as a reality lab segment that houses it only did 440 million in sales with over 3.8 billion in losses bringing the cumulative amount since the end of 2020 up to now over $45 billion in losses that's pretty staggering however I just continue to think that met can not only afford it but that these investments will eventually pay off for them too during the earnings call though the stock at one point had plunged almost 20% and lost around 200 billion in value to which CEO Mark Zuckerberg commented on in real time saying I think it's worth calling out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock writing this phase of our product Playbook where we're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it and he cited past efforts like their short video service reals that of course mimics Tik Tok Instagram stories that mimics Snapchat and also their transition into Mobile anyway it's a great point there by Zuck that I do agree with myself because when you look at those other services and how they try to mimic other platforms I I mean there's even the new threads mimicking Twitter now well these are areas that may not show a lot of benefit right away but over time they're absolutely crucial to an already giant company like meta staying relevant within social media and digital advertising which of course is where they generate the vast majority of their revenues from at around 98% and so investing into Ai and the metaverse may open new opportunities for them to maintain dominance and expand further too I mean they even have metal llama 3 and meta AI to compete directly with open ai's chat GPT in the earnings call Mark talked about several other ways that they can use AI to improve advertising and even introduce new ways of placing ads too I mean think of it way McKenzie analysts project that the metaverse will be worth trillions in the future and a gigantic reason for that will be due to digital advertising which can easily be placed just about anywhere in the metaverse not to mention all the other ways that it can be monetized like through online shopping or gaming you know digital travel learning business entertainment and much more and so one of the ways that meta hopes to dominate this giant landscape is by licensing out their own metaverse operating system to third parties this is probably what I'm most excited about myself as a shareholder for the future met have just recently announced that their meta Horizon OS will be open to third parties like Microsoft Lenovo Asus and more to help them accelerate their developments and build headsets and apps and everything else using meta's own operating system similar to like how Microsoft licenses out windows to other oems and uh yeah I just think this could be huge guys I mean it's also drawing comparisons to like how Apple keeps their iOS for their themselves for their iPhones but Google actually provides Android for just about every other smartphone maker out there and so if meta can become like the windows or the Android of the metaverse I mean the opportunities are going to be endless there it's giant meanwhile though it wasn't even a bad quarter in my opinion as they beat on both the top and bottom line while growing sales by $8 billion year-over-year and operating income from their family of apps by around $6 billion year-over-year resulting in even higher operating margin of 38% versus 25% the year before so outstanding performance and outstanding profitability and yet the stock actually fell by double digit percent this past week I mean I get that the stock is pretty elevated as it is but with a PEG ratio more than 15% cheaper than the sector and over 26% cheaper than their own 5-year average I think meta is a very solid pickup on the dip",

    "company": "Verizon",
    "excerpt": "this is going to be the highest risk option of the bunch and this time I'm going with another company that actually just reported earnings this past week it fell a bit the stock is down huge from the top two and the dividend is Sky High so even though it's risky in my opinion I'm still buying more and that stock is of course Verizon ticker symbol VZ who fell on earnings by around 5% and is now still hovering around the lowest levels of the past decade down over 36% from the top but with that massive crash comes one of the biggest dividend yields it's ever paid at close to 7% however the reason why I consider to be much riskier than the rest is due to their low growth and massive amounts of debt that were greatly increased due to the investments into 5G and fiber and more and this latest quarter showed a bit of a continuation of that with lower sales than analysts were expecting as the macroeconomy struggles and consumers are choosing to hold on to their phones for longer periods of time ra rather than upgrade and because Verizon is also known for charging higher prices than Rivals like AT&T and T-Mobile well you know given the weak macroeconomy you can see why performance might be lacking for a company like that however it's not all bad news uh ryzen does usually charge a premium for good reason as their services are consistently ranked the best in the world and that strength showed in this quarter as well as profit speed estimates and subs subscriber losses actually came in lower than analysts were expecting thanks to new flexible plans and even Partnerships with streaming giants like Netflix Disney plus and HBO Max total revenue was also at least positive in terms of growth even if just barely with adjusted eida Rising a little too wireless service though uh Rose 3% probably the most important metric there which helped offset the loss in business probably due to macro conditions and their investments into FiOS and fixed Wireless continue to pay off with huge gains in subscribers on internet still cash flow from operations was down a bit but that too was also offset by a huge reduction in capital expenditures that's because they don't have to invest as heavily into 5G anymore what really concerns me though is how their dividends were barely covered in the quarter with total debt still gigantically high and that really does need to be paid off more but from all the research that I've done I gather that this was more of just like a one-off quarter that will see large improvements in the second half the same thing basically happened last year where they still ended the year with almost 8 billion dollars in excess free cash flow even after paying the dividend which they could then use to pay down debt and this year should actually be even better given the guidance of a rise in sales rise in profits and also a decrease in capex in the earnings call management also spoke a bit more on this too saying we are on track to meet our financial guidance and deliver positive phone ads this year we're back to usual levels of capex as promised and have uh struck a balance between profitable growth and free cash flow that supports both our dividend and a stronger balance sheet giving us greater flexibility to accelerate paying down debt throughout the second half of the year and closer to our long-term leverage Target our cash flow generation is solid and it shows that we are executing well against our financial objectives including supporting our dividend and paying down Deb yet with strong momentum already in the start of the second quarter I'm confident in our ability to sustain progress towards unlocking Verizon's full potential for all stakeholders and so again what I like here is the Beaten Down stock the dirt cheap valuation around 30 to 50% cheaper than the sector despite this being a market leader in both size and quality and of course a huge dividend with a manageable payout ratio below 60% and almost two decades of consecutive growth it is high risk though because again debt is gigantically high and honestly if we go into a recession uh it really wouldn't shock me all that much to see a cut in the dividend especially if it's a big recession but at these levels as a long-term investor I'm kind of okay with the risk that I'm taking here I know what I'm betting on and it still feels worth it to me personally",
