    "excerpt": "Petro-Dollar Collapse about to CRIPPLE the US Economy & Stock Market?! with more countries seemingly moving away from the US dollar being their exclusive Reserve currency for oil will this lead to a crash in the US economy and by virtue of the stock market well that's what I'm going to answer for you in today's video it is a bit of a complicated topic but I'll do my best to break this all down into smaller pieces something a little simpler and easy to understand for anyone that is not too familiar with what's currently going on out there so uh the way we'll do this is I'll explain what the Petro dollar is why there's a fear going around of it possibly diminishing and how that might impact the economy with of course my overall opinion on all of this and what I plan to do myself as an active investor in stocks okay so uh jumping straight into this let's start with a quick explanation of what the Petro dollar even is well when we really think of oil it's kind of like the lifeblood of our modern world right it's used for energy for lubricants for different chemicals it's in fertilizers and pharmaceuticals uh Plastics in general I mean there's so much that petroleum can and really is used for which has made it so valuable over time well ever since the 1970s most oil has been traded in US Dollars and there's two primary reasons for that at number one the US dollar was relatively considered the strongest currency and is the world's uh really reserved currency so it provided a lot more stability to oil producing countries that used it now number two this is a a big one here America essentially offered military security and protection in these regions for any country that agreed to sell their oil for dollars a famous famous example of that is Saudi Arabia of course who in exchange for military protection and access to America's markets essentially agreed to price their oil in dollars and invest a large portion of that Revenue back into the US economy and buy treasury bills this was kind of a secret agreement that was made in 1974 does get a little complicated and it didn't directly state that their oil would be priced in dollars but it was sort of implied and ultimately led to that happening anyway all of this also LED is several advantages for not just the oil producers but obviously a giant one for America in in particular who now saw demand for their currency rise which not only strengthened their position as the world's Reserve currency but because the demand was so high it also allowed them to print more money while not devaluing their own currency on top of that it also allowed them to borrow at lower interest rates because everyone was buying their treasury bills which sent the interest rates down and because they're the world's Reserve currency when other countries borrow and pay back money they often do that in dollars too which sends demand Rising by even more all of this to say that It ultimately gave America a ton of financial strength and involvement and influence around the world which of course continues to this day however there's a fear going around now that uh you know things might be changing and to the detriment of America and the US dollar so what exactly is going on here well there's a few reasons for this sentiment going around right now for one America has seen growing tensions with many of the biggest players in the market for example they impose sanctions on Iran uh making it more difficult to sell oil in dollars and because Iran has several ties to China well they're now bartering deals with them like exchanging oil for goods and have even used the Chinese Yuan currency for selling their oil as well now now the same can be said for Russia which is the second largest oil exporter in the world only behind Saudi Arabia and they too have many sanctions on them right now by the us because of the war in Ukraine so they've now turned to using more currencies in their transactions too including of course their own currency the Russian Ruble as well as even the Chinese Yuan now reason number two though many of the countries that have been really so dependent on America or have been heavily t TI to America are now looking for different ways to create more economic independence for themselves kind of separating themselves from riing so heavily on that US dollar and then uh that really kind of leads to reason number three as many of these nations are now turning to each other for greater collaboration and cooperation without the US the idea being that if many of these smaller Nations work together they can be just as strong as Big Brother America and so so we're now seeing greater collaboration from some of the biggest players in oil and elsewhere especially from China who continues to invest in just about every part of the world kind of getting their tentacles spread out everywhere making New Deals and offering big incentives for using the Chinese un as opposed to the US dollar and another big example of some of this is Saudi Arabia of course what has been really one of America's most relied on Petr dollar users has more recently made some questionable decisions that is now fueling the fear of the Petro dollar slowly deteriorating for one just a couple months ago uh they let expire that 1974 economic cooperation agreement with the US that we talked about earlier without any renewal and although I can't tell you if the two countries are still working on getting a new deal signed there are some reports out there saying that they are working on different deals so that you know is possible that something gets announced relatively soon but regardless it's already been enough reason to raise concern especially given that Saudi is now reportedly accepting different currencies in certain cases including the Chinese un and to make matters worse well I actually just reported to you guys just a little while back that Saudi Arabia sold close to half of all their investments in US Stocks earlier this year which is of course another major red flag if they're predicting you know that the stock market might be going down that could be a reason why they're selling stocks and you know if they're predicting the the econ the American economy and the stock market is going to go down does that have ties to the petrol dollar I mean there's a lot of things here that could be connected all right now I'm going to give you the counterargument to everything that I just said here and I'll do that in just a second but first let's just assume that all of these changes in policy and even sentiment actually do lead to an eventual deterioration of the Petro dollar what would that mean for the US economy and for stocks well the first impact is very obvious it would weaken the dollar which in turn would also make Imports more expensive since most goods are priced in dollars and that could eventually lead to even more inflation than the insane amounts that we've been having to deal with lately so that alone could be pretty disastrous also you'd end up with higher borrowing costs because of the weaker demand for us treasuries meaning that the government will have to pay higher interest rates on debt which is another pretty disastrous situation considering how bad our debt levels already are and finally the other pretty obvious point is that the US will have their Global influence reduced in financial markets and trade negotiations and elsewhere just making our overall kind of standing on the global stage even weaker which will ultimately hurt us back at home too and so when you add up all of these neg negatives uh yeah the economy would very likely take a big hit and I think a type of like recessionary crash for both the economy and the stock market that that of course is so heavily tied to it uh that would be very likely at that point now could we still kind of work our way out of that type of mess if we were in it with new agreements new Partnerships new policies and still remain a strong economy with the US dollar also being a reserve currency in the world even if it's a weaker one well yeah I I do think so America is a global power with a very strong military and strong connections to all parts of the world to to the point where there should be some alternative options available even if things get worse from here and as long as America's economy does remain relatively strong and well Diversified which I personally believe that it is then it should still remain a leader in my opinion but of of course that's if we even get to that point which I guess I would make like two main counterarguments for that not being the case number one even the loss of the so-called Petro dollar or the weakening of it especially as the world's Reserve currency I think would likely be very slow and gradual giving the us plenty of time to adjust I don't think we'd wake up one day and everything has collapsed I think there will be lots of different warning signs more warning signs than we already have and with that the opportunity to adjust or at least try to kind of rest strengthen that that dollar the position of the of the US dollar but for number two in my opinion Saudi Arabia and most other countries are still extremely likely to continue using the US dollar for most oil transactions keep in mind we've had many years throughout history where everyone panicked about the Petro dollar going away only for that to never be the case in fact in 1975 literally the very next year that the US Saudi agreement was first made well the New York Times put right on the front page headline that OPEC was uh cutting would cut ties with the dollar and essentially end the Petro dollar and yet here we are in 2024 uh now saying the same things right now predicting the same things but it hasn't happened throughout all this time now to be fair I do actually think that this time is a bit different in that there are bigger threats out there especially from rising superpowers like China for example but I'm not convinced that it's enough reason to panic I mean even there you look at China well the US dollar is still by far the world's biggest Reserve currency at around 58% the euro is the next closest at 18% and then everything else is in is in the single digits including the Chinese un at only around 2% so it's not even close and again I do think things can gradually change slowly over time but keep in mind there are still many benefits for countries to continue using the US dollar and especially for exporting oil I mean for example we talked so much about Saudi Arabia guys saudi's own currency the real uh is actually pegged to the dollar meaning that it has a constant exchange rate with it so it actually benefits Saudi Arabia to keep the US dollar as stable as possible which it inherently is and that too benefits Saudi as well because if you compare the dollar to other options like the Chinese un for example well the US dollar is much more liquid and freely convertible than the yuan is there's even been recent reports too from Bloomberg saying that most leaders in the region that they've talked to in the Middle East uh don't even see much of a benefit at all for ever shifting away from the dollar either but then of course why did Saudi sell so many stocks and why did they allow that economic agreement with the US to expire well again some of that might still be kind of a pending but assuming that they do all let all of that expire and you know we do know that they did already sell much of their stocks well look I can't read mines but I'll give you my best guess as to what's going on there I feel like they were just mostly taking gigantic profits from the stock market being up so much they went heavily into stocks during the pandemic when stocks were falling a lot then we had a huge surge in stock prices uh right after that kind of in the recovery phase and in my opinion I think they're taking a lot of profits but it's not just that I think they're also using a ton of this money to invest in their own projects and economy cuz look back when that first agreement was made in 1974 Saudi had a giant surplus of money north of 50% of its GDP from all the oil they were selling but back then these Middle Eastern countries were still severely underdeveloped and they didn't really have anywhere to put that money so parking it in Us treasuries in exchange for huge benefits was an ideal choice but you fast forward to today and these are now some of the wealthiest nations in the world with gigantic IC profits and Investments that they're pouring unbelievable amounts of money into many times in the hundreds of billions even trillions in fact it's so much that the international monetary fund is now predicting that Saudi Surplus will actually turn into a deficit in the coming years and yet despite all of that and and despite the decrease in Saudi financing American debts the US dollar is actually still very strong it's some some of the highest levels uh that it's been at in in recent times which is another good sign so in conclusion is this a big deal to keep an eye on as the situation develops because it can have some major repercussions for the US dollar and the economy over the longer term of course anyone turning a blind eye to all of this is just being in my opinion flat out ignorant it's something that we should be taking very seriously and we should be uh talking about early on and as often as possible so that we are completely aware of what's going on we see the flags and we make adjustments wherever possible and we stay on top of it but is it guaranteed to be this devastating Blow To America I mean I've seen so many you know headlines out there in articles I've seen a lot of people on social media everybody saying you know this is the end the Petro dollar is over and everything's going to come crashing down is it that type of a you know kind of devastating blow to America and is that going to be the case right now or even in the near future I personally don't think so I think there might be a little bit of an over reaction here in that even if things do get much worse I think it'll take a long time to really start to see the big impacts of that and frankly I'm more concerned about more immediate pressing matters like our current interest rates and inflation uh that I think is uh much more likely to cause a crash for you know the economy and the stock market within the next couple years if you're asking me like what's going to crash the stock market what's the biggest threat to it here soon I I would say it's probably that I would say it's just the current state of our economy in general that we already have enough issues already and then of course if we were to lose the Petro dollar and all that yeah that would be pretty devastating because that would just be on top of everything else that we're already dealing with but again I just personally don't really see that being the case at least not anytime kind of relatively soon maybe over the longer longer term but I think it would take a very long time and again I think we'd see more Flags along the way uh but hey that's just my opinion I could be wrong and so I'd love to hear what you all have to say Down Below in the comment section personally I'm still investing in stocks long term but I will also be keeping a very close eye on this situation going forward because I think it does benefit us as investors to be aware of everything going on at the macro levels too.",

in exchange for huge benefits was an ideal choice but you fast forward to today and these are now some of the wealthiest nations in the world with gigantic IC profits and Investments that they're pouring unbelievable amounts of money into many times in the hundreds of billions even trillions in fact it's so much that the international monetary fund is now predicting that Saudi Surplus will actually turn into a deficit in the coming years and yet despite all of that and and despite the decrease in Saudi financing American debts the US dollar is actually still very strong it's some some of the highest levels uh that it's been at in in recent times which is another good sign so in conclusion is this a big deal to keep an eye on as the situation develops because it can have some major repercussions for the US dollar and the economy over the longer term of course anyone turning a blind eye to all of this is just being in my opinion flat out ignorant it's something that we should be taking very seriously and we should be uh talking about early on and as often as possible so that we are completely aware of what's going on we see the flags and we make adjustments wherever possible and we stay on top of it but is it guaranteed to be this devastating Blow To America I mean I've seen so many you know headlines out there in articles I've seen a lot of people on social media everybody saying you know this is the end the Petro dollar is over and everything's going to come crashing down is it that type of a you know kind of devastating blow to America and is that going to be the case right now or even in the near future I personally don't think so I think there might be a little bit of an over reaction here in that even if things do get much worse I think it'll take a long time to really start to see the big impacts of that and frankly I'm more concerned about more immediate pressing matters like our current interest rates and inflation uh that I think is uh much more likely to cause a crash for you know the economy and the stock market within the next couple years if you're asking me like what's going to crash the stock market what's the biggest threat to it here soon I I would say it's probably that I would say it's just the current state of our economy in general that we already have enough issues already and then of course if we were to lose the Petro dollar and all that yeah that would be pretty devastating because that would just be on top of everything else that we're already dealing with but again I just personally don't really see that being the case at least not anytime kind of relatively soon maybe over the longer longer term but I think it would take a very long time and again I think we'd see more Flags along the way uh but hey that's just my opinion I could be wrong and so I'd love to hear what you all have to say Down Below in the comment section personally I'm still investing in stocks long term but I will also be keeping a very close eye on this situation going forward because I think it does benefit us as investors to be aware of everything going on at the macro levels too.",

    "excerpt": "for one America has seen growing tensions with many of the biggest players in the market for example they impose sanctions on Iran uh making it more difficult to sell oil in dollars and because Iran has several ties to China well they're now bartering deals with them like exchanging oil for goods and have even used the Chinese Yuan currency for selling their oil as well now now the same can be said for Russia which is the second largest oil exporter in the world only behind Saudi Arabia and they too have many sanctions on them right now by the us because of the war in Ukraine so they've now turned to using more currencies in their transactions too including of course their own currency the Russian Ruble as well as even the Chinese Yuan now reason number two though many of the countries that have been really so dependent on America or have been heavily t TI to America are now looking for different ways to create more economic independence for themselves kind of separating themselves from riing so heavily on that US dollar and then uh that really kind of leads to reason number three as many of these nations are now turning to each other for greater collaboration and cooperation without the US the idea being that if many of these smaller Nations work together they can be just as strong as Big Brother America and so so we're now seeing greater collaboration from some of the biggest players in oil and elsewhere especially from China who continues to invest in just about every part of the world kind of getting their tentacles spread out everywhere making New Deals and offering big incentives for using the Chinese un as opposed to the US dollar and another big example of some of this is Saudi Arabia of course what has been really one of America's most relied on Petr dollar users has more recently made some questionable decisions that is now fueling the fear of the Petro dollar slowly deteriorating for one just a couple months ago uh they let expire that 1974 economic cooperation agreement with the US that we talked about earlier without any renewal and although I can't tell you if the two countries are still working on getting a new deal signed there are some reports out there saying that they are working on different deals so that you know is possible that something gets announced relatively soon but regardless it's already been enough reason to raise concern especially given that Saudi is now reportedly accepting different currencies in certain cases including the Chinese un and to make matters worse well I actually just reported to you guys just a little while back that Saudi Arabia sold close to half of all their investments in US Stocks earlier this year which is of course another major red flag if they're predicting you know that the stock market might be going down that could be a reason why they're selling stocks and you know if they're predicting the the econ the American economy and the stock market is going to go down does that have ties to the petrol dollar I mean there's a lot of things here that could be connected all right now I'm going to give you the counterargument to everything that I just said here and I'll do that in just a second but first let's just assume that all of these changes in policy and even sentiment actually do lead to an eventual deterioration of the Petro dollar what would that mean for the US economy and for stocks well the first impact is very obvious it would weaken the dollar which in turn would also make Imports more expensive since most goods are priced in dollars and that could eventually lead to even more inflation than the insane amounts that we've been having to deal with lately so that alone could be pretty disastrous also you'd end up with higher borrowing costs because of the weaker demand for us treasuries meaning that the government will have to pay higher interest rates on debt which is another pretty disastrous situation considering how bad our debt levels already are and finally the other pretty obvious point is that the US will have their Global influence reduced in financial markets and trade negotiations and elsewhere just making our overall kind of standing on the global stage even weaker which will ultimately hurt us back at home too and so when you add up all of these neg negatives uh yeah the economy would very likely take a big hit and I think a type of like recessionary crash for both the economy and the stock market that that of course is so heavily tied to it uh that would be very likely at that point now could we still kind of work our way out of that type of mess if we were in it with new agreements new Partnerships new policies and still remain a strong economy with the US dollar also being a reserve currency in the world even if it's a weaker one well yeah I I do think so America is a global power with a very strong military and strong connections to all parts of the world to to the point where there should be some alternative options available even if things get worse from here and as long as America's economy does remain relatively strong and well Diversified which I personally believe that it is then it should still remain a leader in my opinion but of of course that's if we even get to that point which I guess I would make like two main counterarguments for that not being the case number one even the loss of the so-called Petro dollar or the weakening of it especially as the world's Reserve currency I think would likely be very slow and gradual giving the us plenty of time to adjust I don't think we'd wake up one day and everything has collapsed I think there will be lots of different warning signs more warning signs than we already have and with that the opportunity to adjust or at least try to kind of rest strengthen that that dollar the position of the of the US dollar but for number two in my opinion Saudi Arabia and most other countries are still extremely likely to continue using the US dollar for most oil transactions keep in mind we've had many years throughout history where everyone panicked about the Petro dollar going away only for that to never be the case in fact in 1975 literally the very next year that the US Saudi agreement was first made well the New York Times put right on the front page headline that OPEC was uh cutting would cut ties with the dollar and essentially end the Petro dollar and yet here we are in 2024 uh now saying the same things right now predicting the same things but it hasn't happened throughout all this time now to be fair I do actually think that this time is a bit different in that there are bigger threats out there especially from rising superpowers like China for example but I'm not convinced that it's enough reason to panic I mean even there you look at China well the US dollar is still by far the world's biggest Reserve currency at around 58% the euro is the next closest at 18% and then everything else is in is in the single digits including the Chinese un at only around 2% so it's not even close and again I do think things can gradually change slowly over time but keep in mind there are still many benefits for countries to continue using the US dollar and especially for exporting oil I mean for example we talked so much about Saudi Arabia guys saudi's own currency the real uh is actually pegged to the dollar meaning that it has a constant exchange rate with it so it actually benefits Saudi Arabia to keep the US dollar as stable as possible which it inherently is and that too benefits Saudi as well because if you compare the dollar to other options like the Chinese un for example well the US dollar is much more liquid and freely convertible than the yuan is there's even been recent reports too from Bloomberg saying that most leaders in the region that they've talked to in the Middle East uh don't even see much of a benefit at all for ever shifting away from the dollar either but then of course why did Saudi sell so many stocks and why did they allow that economic agreement with the US to expire well again some of that might still be kind of a pending but assuming that they do all let all of that expire and you know we do know that they did already sell much of their stocks well look I can't read mines but I'll give you my best guess as to what's going on there I feel like they were just mostly taking gigantic profits from the stock market being up so much they went heavily into stocks during the pandemic when stocks were falling a lot then we had a huge surge in stock prices uh right after that kind of in the recovery phase and in my opinion I think they're taking a lot of profits but it's not just that I think they're also using a ton of this money to invest in their own projects and economy cuz look back when that first agreement was made in 1974 Saudi had a giant surplus of money north of 50% of its GDP from all the oil they were selling but back then these Middle Eastern countries were still severely underdeveloped and they didn't really have anywhere to put that money so parking it in Us treasuries

the economy over the longer term of course anyone turning a blind eye to all of this is just being in my opinion flat out ignorant it's something that we should be taking very seriously and we should be uh talking about early on and as often as possible so that we are completely aware of what's going on we see the flags and we make adjustments wherever possible and we stay on top of it but is it guaranteed to be this devastating Blow To America I mean I've seen so many you know headlines out there in articles I've seen a lot of people on social media everybody saying you know this is the end the Petro dollar is over and everything's going to come crashing down is it that type of a you know kind of devastating blow to America and is that going to be the case right now or even in the near future I personally don't think so I think there might be a little bit of an over reaction here in that even if things do get much worse I think it'll take a long time to really start to see the big impacts of that and frankly I'm more concerned about more immediate pressing matters like our current interest rates and inflation uh that I think is uh much more likely to cause a crash for you know the economy and the stock market within the next couple years if you're asking me like what's going to crash the stock market what's the biggest threat to it here soon I I would say it's probably that I would say it's just the current state of our economy in general that we already have enough issues already and then of course if we were to lose the Petro dollar and all that yeah that would be pretty devastating because that would just be on top of everything else that we're already dealing with but again I just personally don't really see that being the case at least not anytime kind of relatively soon maybe over the longer longer term but I think it would take a very long time and again I think we'd see more Flags along the way uh but hey that's just my opinion I could be wrong and so I'd love to hear what you all have to say Down Below in the comment section personally I'm still investing in stocks long term but I will also be keeping a very close eye on this situation going forward because I think it does benefit us as investors to be aware of everything going on at the macro levels too.",
