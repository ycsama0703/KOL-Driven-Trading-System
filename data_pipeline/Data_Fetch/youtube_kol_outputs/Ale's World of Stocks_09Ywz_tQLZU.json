    "excerpt": "there's actually one stock that Buffett has actually been pouring many billions of dollars into every year so the complete opposite of what he's been doing with the rest of his portfolio and that is in his own stock Berkshire haway his own holding company run by the CEO Buffett where we can see that share repurchases from just 2019 to last year so in the past 5 years alone they bought over $73 billion worth of their own stock and even in the first half of this year they already bought another roughly 3 billion on top of that too so what exactly is going on here well I think Buffett likely feels that the market is a bit overvalued at the moment and look I don't blame him I also have similar feelings about the market right now which continues to break new record highs and so taking some profits off the table does make sense here especially after the huge runup that we've seen since 2020 now on the other hand of course like I showed you before they've been buying tons of their own stock too so why are they more bullish on Berkshire half theway stock versus the rest of the market well it's actually very simple now a lot of people don't even know about this but prior to 2018 Burkshire had a rule in place where they would not be allowed to buy their own stock if the price was 120% of its Book value by the way Book value is the assets minus the liabilities and so if the stock price was a lot higher than that like over 20% more then Buffett considered that to be overvalued and thus it wouldn't really be a good investment to their shareholders so they wouldn't buy the stock NOW under that rule they would have to wait until the stock price came down under those levels at which point they would consider it to perhaps be undervalued at that time and thus they could actually buy the stock if it was a good deal like that however in 2018 the board of directors changed that rule to where now they could actually buy the stock regardless of that metric and ever since then Buffett has essentially CAU Ham on their own stock scooping up billions of dollars worth now why would he do that well I think there's two primary reasons number one Berkshire has been flushed with cash that I think they didn't really know what to do with typically they like to either buy stocks or even acquire smaller companies but with the market soaring as much as it has they might not feel like there's attractive enough prices out there in the open market to be spending that money on and as a result in fact you look back to 2018 ever since that year they've had well over A1 billion in cash which has only gotten larger to where last quarter it was north of $276 billion and that's even with all the spending that they've done on Berkshire stock so I just think that they were kind of left in a situation here where you lift that restriction and you have all of this insane amount of cash from the selling that they've been doing in the market market Rising they've been cashing in profits so they they're got so much cash that it just makes it so much easier now to buy their own stock which leads me to reason number two and that's that assuming you have a good enough business that you believe in well buying your own stock generally makes sense it's generally considered a good idea because it gives you really more control uh with less outstanding shares out there in the open market plus it gives more value to your shareholders by improving your earning earnings per share cuz of course less shares means more earnings per share thus also making the stock more attractive to more value oriented investors as well okay well now that we know Buffett has been a big believer of his own stock should we also be buying Berkshire stock ourselves and following his trades well my personal opinion is a little mixed here because first of all I never like to copy anyone's moves just to copy them and as much as I do like Warren Buffett and agree with many of his long-term investing principles the man is not perfect and much of the selling that he's done in recent years has actually left a ton of profits still on the table Apple alone is a great example of this where the market cap has actually climbed by over half a trillion dollars higher just this year which according to Forbes because of his selling it may have cost buffet around $16 billion of lost potential profit if he would have just held on to the stock longer instead that's not to say that it's a horrible move again you know timing the market that's something that I consider to be impossible I always tell you guys timing the market is an impossible thing to do and considering Apple stock is as high as it is right now it's literally the most highly valued stock in the entire world you know I think locking in those profits while you can while you know that you've got major profits to cash in on and you know that the stock is extremely high I think that's completely fine of a decision to make and i' I've never been want to overly criticize anyone for buying or selling a stock I think you should really do whatever you're comfortable with and whatever fits you and your investing style and your strategy and your goals best as for me though Berkshire ha the away the stock while being a reliable long-term investment that I think most people will have success with for me it's always been a little too boring and low growth for my taste yes the financials are strong and yes they own Fairly reliable companies in areas of finance and insurance and oil and Railroad and Retail and a lot more but for me I've always been more attracted to higher growth maybe technology stocks or other areas that just excite me a little bit more which even in the case of like apple which is still berkshire's largest investment well it's just so highly valued at this point that I don't see a lot more gains to really be had from it long term although I do own Apple stock myself just for their insane size and profitability and sticky ecosystem of products and services but Berkshire though just kind of feels like I don't even know how to describe it I guess I feel like I'm kind of buying into like a boring ETF if that makes sense I know that's not a great comparison but that I guess that's how I would describe it which by the way Berkshire stock itself is also trading at a record high right now with a p ratio that is about 100% higher than the sector on an adjusted basis and it's even the already the number nine largest company in the entire world too by market cap so that just doesn't really get me all that excited at those levels not to mention that my interest would likely drop even more whenever Buffett finally decides to step down from CEO which at age 94 I got imagine that that's going to happen very soon and I hope I'm not sounding overly bearish on Berkshire when saying this because I do actually think that it's a solid stock overall but the other thing that annoys me a little bit about bercker stock is how little analy coverage it seems to get for example one of my favorite websites for analysis is Yahoo finance a super popular site and yet there's only two analysts even covering the stock there which by the way they only project revenues to grow by around 5% or less per year going forward now contrast that coverage with most other stocks out there like I don't know I mean I guess we could look at Apple since we've been talking about them already but they have like over 40 different analysts covering the stock so with birgire I'd have to stay much more on top of it myself and maybe even calculate my own projections for future growth which can be really hard to do when you're looking at essentially a large conglomerate like this that owns other companies and stocks and is therefore heavily dependent on how all of those companies perform too that's just too much of a headache for me to keep track of and analyze and try to project all that stuff so for a stock that again I don't think is super cheap or any kind of screaming by at these really high levels I just feel like I'd rather invest elsewhere myself but again that's just my personal opinion and I can still understand why others would want to own the stock",
