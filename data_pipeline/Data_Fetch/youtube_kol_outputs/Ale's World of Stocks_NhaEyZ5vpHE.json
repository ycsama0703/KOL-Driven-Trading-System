    "excerpt": "so much so that JP Morgan even claims that there is no recession in sight guys that we've successfully had a soft landing and their stocks went up because of it. five largest banks in America are of course JP Morgan Chase... well Chase and Wells Fargo were the the first to report last Friday and Wall Street and the media responded so well to them that they actually helped lift the broader market up to new record highs now to be fair Chase was at least in my opinion the best performer of the bunch as is typically the case with Chase it's why I've always invested in them myself because I just feel that they are really the best overall run Bank in the world and they showed that strength on earnings posting better than expected results on both the top and bottom line while also raising their annual interest income forecast for the full year which is actually a pretty big deal because the FED is of course lowering rates right now and everyone expects that to continue so the fall in interest rates should technically mean lower interest income that Banks can generate on the loans they give out but despite that again Chase actually raised their interest income guidance so it's pretty interesting why they would do that and I'll explain exactly why they did it in just a second so hold tide on that one. for example Chase climbed over 5% this past week and continues to trade at a record high. in fact JP Morgan just flat out came out and said that we have officially succeeded in a soft Landing with the CFO saying quote broadly I would say these earnings are consistent with the soft Landing narrative and the fact that companies are optimistic is pretty consistent with this kind of Goldilocks economic situation. for example JP Morgan and Wi Fargo they both saw their Investment Banking fees Rise by over 30% year-over-year and yet their profits actually declined their overall profits declined by 2% and 11% respectively a clear sign that the majority of their underlying business is actually worse than maybe they're letting on but because both declines were still better than analyst expectations it was just considered an overall positive and their stocks went up. but for JP Morgan to just kind of come out and say immediately now that it's already been proven that we are for sure in a soft Landing I'm just not sure I'm ready to call that you know so soon I think we could actually still have some volatility headed our way. full disclosure the only two banks that I own that that we talked about today are Chase and US Bank Corp... overall I continue to think that really Chase is still I would say the best overall run of the big Banks the highest quality the largest size uh the most trusted out there and that's why again we saw them actually take the smallest hit of the group two you know when looking at their overall profits but you know with JP Morgan Chase you also have to to pay a premium for that quality and with how shaky the economy is right now I'm just not uh really feeling like buying any shares of Bank stocks at the moment I'm only just really holding what I have in those and instead I'm buying other stocks that I think look a lot more attractive out there in the Market at the moment",

Bank of America is also right near a record high too by the way speaking of which though we then had Bank of America and City Group report on Tuesday which is the day I'm recording this video myself and those are the number two and number four largest banks who also reportedly had a great showing beating analyst estimates as well. Bank of America reported their highest third quarter trading Revenue in over a decade and even City groups saw their investment fees Rise by over 40% as well and yet profits still tanked Bank of America even witnessed a double digit decline in their net income saying that it stems from higher Provisions for loan losses and Rising expenses that's a clear sign that the economy is actually not as great as they're making it out to be at least they don't think so and even their net interest income also fell by almost 3% despite the country still having incredibly High interest rates During the period period",
