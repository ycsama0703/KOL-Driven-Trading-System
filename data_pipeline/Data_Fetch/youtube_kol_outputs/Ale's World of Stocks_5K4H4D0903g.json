    "excerpt": "hey welcome back everyone to my world of stocks in today's video we'll be diving into five reasons why investors are rushing back into Neo stock I'm going to break it all down for this Chinese EV company and because I own a little bit of the stock myself I'll give you my own opinion on everything too so it should be a ton of fun I hope you enjoy this update let's go ahead and dive straight into it all right now before we dive into the five reasons let me just quickly show you the stock price for some cont context here and by the way this was likely also a reason for why investors are jumping in because the stock has been heavily beaten down up until recently where it now bounced back up by over 133% this past week and it's also up over 33% in the past Quarter Two however even after this recent rise Neo stock is still down over 90% from the top so perhaps a little bit of a short squeeze happening here too as investors are now buying the dip by the way uh I'll just get this out of the way now my personal history with this stock is that I was a buyer before that huge runup that we had towards the end of 2020 where I completely sold out of it made a ton of profit this is all documented on the channel you can see this in past videos but then more recently when it's when it uh crashed by a huge amount that's when I decided to now start buying in a little bit on this dip now it's only around 1% of my entire portfolio at the moment so it's very insignificant but you know I just kind of treat this as a very interesting Spec stock that I want to hold on to longterm and you know be buying in small pieces while it is down a lot and then see how it performs you know many years from now but hey so far in recent months I've actually been liking a lot of what I see from Neo which brings us to reason number one why I think investors are buying the stock and that is their new cheaper sub brand called envo which is targeted more towards the mass Market with much more affordable EVs and I just can't overstate how important of a deal this is for the company because by tapping into those lower price ranges well it's going to greatly expand their customer base that Neo can now can now Market to and it also helps them compete more directly with not just other EV companies on price but also with traditional ice vehicles that tend to be a lot cheaper as well which is even more important in today's economy that is you know pretty weak all around the world coming off of the pandemic with inflation and high interest rates and everything else going on in fact you know price is something that has historically and and and you know especially recently weighed pretty pretty heavily on Tesla uh for some time now too and we all know how long we've been hearing and and really waiting uh for them to release a cheaper Mass Market vehicle well Neo looks to be already doing that with the new l60 model starting at just around $21,000 if you include the uh battery swap service now obviously these aren't going to be the same kind of Flagship level EVS that you would typically get from the more expensive Neo brand but the whole point here is to just be able to offer multiple options at multiple different price points for all possible consumers on any budget right and that's exactly what Neo is doing here with enbo now for comparison I think the cheapest Tesla you could get right now is around $40,000 or more in America so there's a pretty big gap there on price now obviously it's going to take some time for that cheaper brand to expand globally I think right now it's only even been available for like a month and most sales will still happen in China and Europe for now but that should be fine at least for the moment as those are really still the two biggest markets for EVS in the world and by the way China just recently broke EV penetration of more than 50% for the first time in history now you contrast that with America which is still in the single digits and that's a big difference there so China very good Market to be you know selling EVS but also in Europe too you want to be taking advantage of that and you also want to slowly expand internationally globally as much as you can and uh anyway all of this has really been helping Neo's numbers now too which is reason number two uh that they're having a big recovery in their delivery numbers because for a while there Neil was actually going through a bit of a rough patch in terms of growing their sales but more recently their delivery numbers have actually rebounded to now posting five consecutive months of over 20,000 deliveries which there was only one other single month I believe in their history where they had done uh numbers like that and altogether for the third quarter deliveries also broke a new record high too with double digit year-over-year growth so it's a very big deal now like I said the envo brand it just recently launched which you can see on this chart here how tiny of a percent that makes up but that was with only about 10 days of deliveries which always starts very limited before ramping up with any new model let alone you know an entirely new brand like this so the good news is that Neo was already doing much better it it is doing much better they're already recovering and moving forward they're also going to get a big boost here from that cheaper sub brand 2 that can Target more customers at different price points which you know could slowly snowball into better performance for the company as a whole and uh yeah that's exactly why more analysts are actually coming out now bullish on the stock which is reason number three where we've had recent upgrades from Morgan Stanley Deutsche Bank and more who are not only citing new Chinese economic stimulus but also more company specific details like Neo's stronger deliveries increased production the new cheaper sub brand and their Innovative Technologies like battery swap helping Neo differentiate themselves compete more on price build up their brand strength and ultimately expand in market share plus one more thing they note a recent cash infusion of close to half a billion dollars from strategic investors in China That's reason number four because what this does is it not only strengthens Neo's balance sheet but it's also going to help them fund the growth of envo any upcoming vehicle launches help them scale production and even their battery swap Network too uh help them expand across Europe and even parts of the Middle East and overall it's also just a good sign of really increased Confidence from influential players with a lot of money which is money and backing really that Neo is going to need for them to continue expanding and investing in research and development and growth initiatives speaking of which that brings us to reason number five and that is Firefly because believe it or not guys Neo is actually planning to launch yet another sub brand except this one will be even cheaper than envo it's been called an ultra affordable brand and it's code named Firefly and it's said to be unveiled as early as the end of this year on Neo day at the end of December with plans to launch models for as low as get this guys around $114,000 that is insanely cheap now obviously those would very likely be on a battery swap service plan too but a lot of people actually like those plans anyway I think it's like aund around $100 a month and you never have to worry about your battery getting old or degrading and you don't have to wait for long times at Chargers you just swap the battery in under 5 minutes and you hit the road but you know if you want to you can always just buy the battery out too it's make the vehicle a little more expensive for that but it's still going to be cheaper than Tesla's anyways at at these price points so I just think all around Neo is making the Right Moves here I do think there is significant risk from two specific areas though one is in Market saturation do think there's a lot of rising competition in the EV space and reason number two would be tariffs many countries are putting tariffs on imported EVS from China because really if they don't then they would likely just take over the entire Market but you know that also just shows that what they're doing is working and I don't know as a speculative stock acknowledging the risk I still like to have a small piece of Neo in my portfolio just in case for the long term and we'll see what happens with it but uh you know by the way I do have much larger positions in Tesla it's one of my biggest stocks and then I also have a little bit of GM stock too that I consider both of those to be relatively safer options right and so Neo is just that tiny spec play for me if I'm going to have some spec stocks a couple you know here there I think Neo is an interesting one it's okay to have a little piece of it and see how it does long term but hey that's my opinion guys what do you all think I'd love to hear your thoughts do you uh own any Neo stock are you invested in it have you thought about it or is it something you wouldn't touch I totally get it's a Chinese stock has in inherently carries a lot of risk just for being a Chinese stock but I'd love to hear your thoughts down there in the comment section and hey thanks for stopping by my friends hope you enjoyed this quick update on Neo now we'll catch you in the next video all right take care everybody bye-bye",
