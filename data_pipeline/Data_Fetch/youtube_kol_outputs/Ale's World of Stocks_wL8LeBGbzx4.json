    "excerpt": "the first purchase that we have here is actually a brand new addition to the portfolio that was Amazon ticker symbol amzn very surprised that they didn't already owned some of this one but uh yeah this was a giant purchase here of close to $200 million and yet that's not even worth one% of the entire portfolio it's pretty crazy right anyway I love Amazon myself it's usually a top five holding in both my personal Port portfolio and the public Community portfolio where it's actually the second largest at the moment and business-wise I think Amazon is one of the very best I have no doubt that cloud computing will be the really the infrastructure of the future which Amazon leads the World in at over 30% market share I also think e-commerce is the future of all retail and here in America Amazon controls that Market at uh well over 37% while the next closest isn't even in the double digits and yet despite that dominance uh would you believe that Nvidia actually has a market cap that is worth over a trillion dollars more than Amazon that's kind of crazy I actually think an argument could be made for Amazon being the most valuable company in the world in terms of they should be and certainly more than Apple who also beats them by over a trillion as well I found that to be uh pretty interesting now I do think Microsoft and Google are more reasonable on this list here but yeah apple and Nvidia to be worth that much more than Amazon is pretty crazy and I just think eventually Amazon will catch up especially when they actually start caring about profits which you can see on this chart here that it's never really been much of a priority for them compared to the out of this world World gigantic sales that they do now right now the stock is up to a record high but that's a bit deceiving there as their Ford p ratio is actually 77% cheaper than their 5year average while their PEG ratio is close to the same as the sector to despite again paying almost no attention to profitability now once they do pay attention to that though in the future I think people will be shocked by the giant profits that this company can actually start raking in which will send the valuation falling and I think the stock price s so Amazon gets the number one ranking for now on this list I think for being such a large and dominant giant they're actually pretty heavily slept on by investors in my opinion. Microsoft will get the number two ranking just barely behind Amazon. I think several other big Tech Giants are better including Amazon and Microsoft. I mean I really think that Amazon Microsoft and Nvidia are all great options in the top three I think valuation wise Amazon has the most attractive market cap but you know Nvidia does have the best peeg ratio however I also think that Amazon and Microsoft are much safer and more Diversified companies to invest and so I'm going to keep them at the top but Nvidia is very close behind at number three. my order would be as follows Google at number one my favorite Amazon at number two so close there.",

    "excerpt": "giant purchase number two though is absolutely going to give Amazon a run for its money because it's actually my number one largest holding in my personal portfolio and that is Microsoft T symbol msft which they nearly tripled their position on last quarter so just a gigantic increase there very bullish move by them bringing it up to over 200 $40 million and just over 1.2% of the portfolio Okay now Microsoft I am equally as bullish on this one but within the context of it being a long-term investment because right now the stock is up a lot it grew another 220% these past 5 years it has a higher PEG ratio than Amazon it's about uh 20% more expensive than the sector 2 and the market cap is also the largest in the entire world at over $3 trillion and yeah also more than than a trillion higher than Amazon as well so you know right now might not be the best time to be going ham on Microsoft however longterm it's still just as a reliable stock in my opinion second most Cloud a a quarter of the entire market number one in computer operating system with Windows nobody else even comes close uh so right there I mean you're talking about powering and facilitating most Computing in the entire world and that's huge and they're one of the biggest players in AI through their partnership with open Ai and their own products and services like co-pilot and more so they're not going anywhere amazing size and profitability doing over 200 billion 70 billion in sales and profits per year and they're just one of the best core stocks for any investor to have but at current prices I just think Amazon is a little more attractive here just a bit cheaper in my opinion so Microsoft will get the number two ranking just barely behind Amazon. I do think Microsoft and Google are more reasonable on this list here. I think several other big Tech Giants are better including Amazon and Microsoft. Nvidia is now ranked as the third largest company in the world by market cap at almost $3 trillion and only behind Microsoft and Apple. I mean I really think that Amazon Microsoft and Nvidia are all great options in the top three. I also think that Amazon and Microsoft are much safer and more Diversified companies to invest and so I'm going to keep them at the top but Nvidia is very close behind at number three. Microsoft at number three uh also a great option",

    "excerpt": "up next so at purchase number three well we actually have a pretty much another brand new pickup here cuz it was a 166,000 per increase and uh yeah that was in apple ticker symbol AAPL which apparently they held just a very small amount of prior to this so I would really consider it just another giant brand new addition here to the portfolio in the quarter amounting to over a $300 million uh purchase essentially now I do own some Apple stock myself too however when looking at the top like you know five or seven market cap companies out there American ones well I would probably rank apple somewhere close to last place not because I don't like them but rather I just think that the others have better values now Apple stock is up at the second largest market cap right now at over $3 trillion which I feel is just too high for my liking and that's after climbing by over 300% in just the past 5 Years also leaving them with the most expensive PG ratio that we've seen so far at over 40% higher than the sector and look I'll grant you that they have a very sticky business with a great ecosystem of hardware and software that you know gets people hooked in which translates to Giant profits of around hundred billion dollars per year and that's nothing to uh look past there I also don't think that's going away anytime soon however the thing that bugs me right now is the currently high price tag without much growth to show for it in fact profits have been stagnant for years with last year in particular actually seeing a decline in both sales and profits which you would think that coming off of that you'd now get some big growth in recovery but instead sales are expected to be almost flat this year with barely a mid- singled digit rise expected next year as well and while I love their business I actually just kind of hate their lack of innovation which in my opinion is why their iPhone market market share has uh remained below 25% throughout history with also iOS being dominated by Android so until Apple uses their unbelievably large amounts of cash cash flow and cash you know balance sheet to actually invest in something Innovative and exciting for the company and no by the way that expensive uh headset that is out of most people's reach does not count as them being Innovative or taking a risk in my opinion but until they do anything like that then I I just don't think that it deserves to trade this High I think several other big Tech Giants are better including Amazon and Microsoft so I'm going to rank Apple in third place for now. I'm actually an Android guy so you know some of my analysis might be a little biased because of that but a fun fact I actually tried using an iPhone these past few weeks and I almost went crazy with the lack of customization options available on iPhone I I couldn't believe just like how much money Apple rakes in as a company and how large and dominant they are and yet they lack they lack so much compared to Android again it's just my opinion I know that Apple has other amazing features I know that the quality is very good on iPhones and uh you know things work very well within their ecosystem of Apple products and services but just compared to Android like when I went back to Android I it was like a breath of fresh air I could just have everything look and feel exactly how I wanted to uh everything was just easier everything was like in place where I would want it to be everything was just working better and um I also just like the more options of Android like I feel Freer with Android I can get different phones like not everything has to look exactly the same not everything is exactly how Apple wants it to be um you know of course Android has like full holding phones now too and they have other stuff too but I just felt like with apple it was and iOS it was kind of like do it do everything our way or hit the highway that's kind of like how I feel about Apple. more than Apple who also beats them by over a trillion as well. Nvidia is now ranked as the third largest company in the world by market cap at almost $3 trillion and only behind Microsoft and Apple. Apple at number five and again I'll just stress to you guys that I love all of these stocks here for the longterm... the only one that I probably wouldn't make myself at the current moment is Apple just because I feel that the price is a little expensive at the moment",

    "excerpt": "moving on to purchase number four we're down to the final two stocks here and uh we have a bit of a dozy here with a red hot AI stock that has been on fire this year and that is of course Nvidia ticker symbol nvda which they more than doubled their position on it looks like each of the past two quarters they increased it by huge amounts bringing the total stake up to now well over half a billion dollars and yeah if we go back to our chart here once again we have a top player as Nvidia is now ranked as the third largest company in the world by market cap at almost $3 trillion and only behind Microsoft and Apple that's so crazy of course that is due to the stock skyrocketing in recent years climbing by over 3,000% in just the past 5 years alone and check this out guys over 2,000% over the past 10 years it's so mind-blowing it actually made them my second largest stock in my portfolio because of that anyway you know what's uh really crazy about all this though even with that rising in stock price well and by the way you guys can fact check me on this because you might not believe me but if you go to seekingalpha.com according to seekingalpha their peeg ratio is still almost 30% cheaper than the sector how crazy is that now if you're wondering why that is it's all because of their insane growth especially on the bottom line if you head over to Yahoo finance for example you'll see that last year not only did sales more than double the previous year but profits went from like 4 billion all the way up to about 30 billion in one year that's crazy and yet you look at what analysts are still projecting going forward and sales are still expected to nearly double this year while profits uh more than double and continue to grow by nearly 50% a year through the next 5 years as projected and that's all because of the insane popularity and Rise of AI of course I mean just generative AI alone is expected to be worth trillions with AI as a whole is expected to surpass that several times over two and so companies are just really fighting to get their hands on as many Nvidia chips as possible since they are clearly the leader in terms of performance and functionality especially when it comes to AI so as long as the insane demand continues it's going to be hard to bet against Nvidia even at these really high levels. would you believe that Nvidia actually has a market cap that is worth over a trillion dollars more than Amazon that's kind of crazy... yeah apple and Nvidia to be worth that much more than Amazon is pretty crazy. in terms of ranking it though I mean I really think that Amazon Microsoft and Nvidia are all great options in the top three I think valuation wise Amazon has the most attractive market cap but you know Nvidia does have the best peeg ratio however I also think that Amazon and Microsoft are much safer and more Diversified companies to invest and so I'm going to keep them at the top but Nvidia is very close behind at number three and I could also understand someone ranking this a little bit differently but yeah overall I just think that every investor should have a piece of each of these three stocks in their portfolio. Nvidia at number four and again I'll just stress to you guys that I love all of these stocks here for the longterm I think every long-term investor should have really every single one of these stocks in their portfolio and even the rankings here are very close as well I think Nvidia could be ranked higher and I'd be fine with that too",

    "excerpt": "that'll leave us now with the final stock of the list and look as hard of a ranking as we just had this last one might throw every everything out the window cuz at purchase number five we have what has really long been one of my probably my number one absolute favorite stock in the entire Market in recent years and it's the one that I've been buying the most aggressively to and that is Google ticker symbol G which they also more than doubled their position on bringing it up to over $800 million and worth over 4% of the overall portfolio and yeah I think I like this one the most here now like the others Google to is up there in market cap however it's well below Microsoft Apple and Nvidia by close to a trillion dollars and the main reason for that is because the stock price simply hasn't climbed by the same amount in recent years now it is still trading near a record high and has performed very well but when you compare it to the others it's only climbed by less than 500% over the past decade while the others have soared by much higher amounts at around double or more and yet I can't really give you a good reason for that I mean Google's business in my opinion is just as as strong as all these other ones and in some cases even better like what's the most important overall Market in the world I would probably say the internet right well Google dominates the internet with not only the number one market share and digital advertising internet search internet browser mobile OS all platform OS that's right Android is even bigger than Windows but they also have the third largest cloud platform they have billions of users on YouTube and they even have Gemini for AI to compete with J chat GPT and uh co-pilot I mean shoot they even have a growing family of products too with the pixel lineup that is kind of trying to emulate what Apple does and so as a result of all of this strength their financials have also been incredible doing over 300 billion in sales and 73 billion in Profit just last year alone while still growing revenues by double digit rate and EPS by almost 20% a year too that's unbelievable and the stocks valuation is actually cheaper than both their 5year average and even the sector Median on a PG basis as well so ranking it on the list I got to go with Google at number one given that they have a reasonable valuation but with also the size and strength of any of these other companies on the list too. I do think Microsoft and Google are more reasonable on this list here. my order would be as follows Google at number one my favorite",
