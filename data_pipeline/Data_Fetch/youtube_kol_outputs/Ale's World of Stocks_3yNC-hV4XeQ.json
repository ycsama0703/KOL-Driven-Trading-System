    "company": "NVIDIA",
    "excerpt": "so as you guys know Nvidia stock has of course been on an absolute tear in recent years but their most recent earnings reported this past week sent the stock Falling by close to 20% that's almost a fifth of its entire value being wiped off the board so naturally the question becomes is this a dip worth buying into well that's what we're going to talk about in today's video I'll share my thoughts on the earnings report the stock valuation and where I think they're heading long term as well as what I plan to do myself as a very large Nvidia shareholder it's one of my biggest stocks in my personal portfolio so without wasting any time guys let's just go ahead and jump straight into this now pulling up the stock chart here we can see that just in the past week alone it's Fallen by about 19% so right away we can assume right that earnings must have been horrendous there's got to be some really bad like jaw-dropping negative results because of course Nvidia is so popular it's a loved stock everyone wants to own it demand for AI is through the roof this year so for the stock to tank like that losing about a fifth of its entire value earnings just got to be really bad right like really really bad well yeah that's correct earnings were horrendous some of the worst I've actually ever seen guys in fact take a look at this sales they barely Rose by only 122% are you kidding me over $30 billion in sales and all you could manage to do was just more than double them in size are you going out of business or something that is terrible results and oh man if you think that's bad their profits were even worse with net income only Rising by a bit more at 168% growth that's it that's so bad guys I think we should just start to short this stock with everything we've got because Nvidia is clearly going out of business okay all jokes aside those numbers were obviously incredibly strong so what could possibly be bringing down down the stock it's got to be that they missed analyst expectations right I mean we see that happen all the time a stock Rises a lot so analysts expect Perfection they expect too much growth from a company even one that is doubling their sales and profits like Nvidia but they expect even more than that and then it gets to a point where a company just can't quite meet those expectations so that's got to be what's happening here right well not only is that not what's happening here but in fact in each of the past four quarters in a row Nvidia literally beat expectations on both the top and bottom line despite the incredible performance that they've been putting up so there is almost nothing to complain about here the company is doing incredibly well in fact during the earnings call they even said that demand for their products continues to be higher than they can even Supply which they also expect to continue into next year as well while also giving higher guidance than analysts were expecting to at least according to CNBC speaking of which one analyst a bullish one noted that Nvidia is literally shipping out everything that they can sell right now so they're essentially performing at their very best this is like Peak Nvidia that we're talking about here and yet again the stock actually fell by very large amounts so why could that possibly be happening well our best guess is that it had to do with their margins slightly dropping compared to the prior quarter at a time when the stock price is already just up by so incredibly much that it is kind of price to Perfection at this point which to be fair that stock price is up over 2,200 in just the past 5 years alone so it is very expensive but I'll come back to that in just a second when we talk about the valuation we're looking at their gross margin though it fell from 78% in the prior quarter down to 75% in this one too but two things on that first of all 75% is still incredibly strong but more importantly we're only comparing this to the prior quarter as opposed to the more reasonable comparison which would be the prior year in which case their margins actually improved from 70% the year before and 43% 2 years before now that's a giant Improvement obviously and that's what should really be the focus here instead of these you know dumb little quarter by quarter comparisons that really only short-term Traders and greedy investors and Traders are probably going to be caring about now in terms of whether the stock is a Buy on this dip of course of course is always do whatever you want make your own decisions but uh for me in terms of my opinion if we look at their valuation and we look at their future potential I'll break all of this down for you guys but my overall kind of General opinion on this is that yeah if this was a stock that I did not already own any shares of I would be a buyer here and even owning some I'm still a buyer on big dips like this cuz when we look at the valuation and you can just see how the explosive growth uh actually leaves a stock still pretty attractively valued so for example their trailing PE ratio is 114% more expensive than the sector median that's obviously very high but forward PE it drops down to 64% higher again still very high but it improves and then if we go forward even more their peeg ratio is actually 42% cheaper than the sector that's wild for the market leader while all ratios are also 20 to 50% lower than their own 5year average as well so what does all of that mean well it means that even though Nvidia is a very highly valued company there's no debating that it's I think right now it's like the third largest in the entire world it's a very expensive stock and Company right but even though they carry that rich valuation what this shows is that they're actually growing into that valuation because of their unbelievable earnings growth coming from the insane demand that they have for their products because of the rise of AI and many other things and I just don't think that that's something that we're going to see really slow down in a dramatic way anytime soon it it is possible that it slows down a little but not in such a giant way because most analysts really agree that these markets that Nvidia is um uh surveying right now are going to be worth really trillions in the future of course there's AI but also cloudcomputing cyber security gaming autonomous driving the metaverse The Internet of Things smart cities I think that'll be huge but there's a there's a lot overall going on here and in Nvidia will be powering much of it the majority of it will be powered by Nvidia and because there's so much Rising competition within those markets you know by nvidia's customers other companies with everyone trying to be first or at least trying to make sure that they can compete and not fall too far behind well the result is that even though they're investing so heavily into these areas they actually can't really afford to slow down cuz the risk of falling behind the competition is much greater and you don't have to take my word for it we've seen many big Tech CEOs speak out about that like at like with uh Google and meta for example uh saying that the risk of spending too little and falling behind is an even greater risk than overspending right now and Mark Zuckerberg for example was quoted in saying that they need to keep aggressively spending in in these areas because the downside of being behind is that you're out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years Nvidia CEO also commented on this during the the recent earnings call this past week saying that the people investing in nvidia's infrastructure are getting returns from it right away noting that the Next Generation AI models will require 10 20 and even 40 times more computing power which is similar to what former Google's uh CEO Eric Schmidt uh had to say as well um recently too now this was also in reference to something that Nvidia said in the prior quarter where they gave data points showing that a cloud provider could actually make five just from selling access to $1 of Nvidia chips in other words companies will pour a lot of money into Nvidia products but they will get a big return on those Investments and in my opinion that's what's going to kind of continue to cause this uh like Snowball Effect that's been going on for NVIDIA to keep on rolling keeping the demand for their products up so high which again we're already seeing the effects of in fact in each of the past four quarters in a row Nvidia saw Triple dig Revenue growth while profits have soared by even more so it's by all accounts a company that is just on fire right now now does that mean that the stock is really safe and that it's a screaming buy no of course not it's not going to be you know the third highest valued company without taking on some considerable risk because of that and it it's also a very newcomer at that I mean it's a it's a it's a it's a stock that recently like shot up by a gigantic amount in recent years so that alone makes it a Target I feeli for short selling and other negative pressures and just kind of a lot of volatility overall in fact over the past two years the stock has moved 5% or more in a single day on 50 different occasions by comparison other big Tech Giants that have been in the trillionaires Club much longer have seen much more stable performance like meta Microsoft and Apple who only had that happen to them 21 times six times and five times respectively Tesla of course being known for heavy swings so uh with also a similar kind of meteoric rise in recent years right well they had that happened to them 70 times so you can kind of see the similarities there but you know my point is that you can probably expect to see a lot of volatility with Nvidia going forward and there will be times where the stock sinks even on Amazing earnings just like they just had because because it is kind of price to Perfection so that's kind of the downside risk to it but in my opinion looking at it again from a very long-term perspective I I think into many many years into the future even decades if I if possible um I just think that over that time if I look back on all the dips I think they'll ultimately have been buying opportunities so I'm I'm a general buyer of Nvidia stock um whenever it does uh dip at all and hey it also helps to know a bit that uh Nvidia actually believes in their own future too having just announced another 50 billion dollar stock buyback program despite being at record highs in the stock price when that was decided on so uh anyway I'm bullish on it",
