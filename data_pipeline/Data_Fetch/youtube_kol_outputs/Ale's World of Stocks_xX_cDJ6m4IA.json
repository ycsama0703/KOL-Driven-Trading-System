    "excerpt": "all right and first up here on the list we uh we will be starting with our lest risk option first and this month I'm going with the media giant Disney ticker symbol dis who really doesn't get talked about nearly as often as it used to where back during the pandemic it was one of the highest flying stocks because of how many people were stuck at home using video streaming platforms and as such Disney stock had soared to about $200 a share at one point however since then it's proceeded to lose about half that amount and here's the most interesting part to today Disney stock trades even lower significantly lower really than almost all prices before the pandemic ever even happened and look anytime that Disney has traded for around $100 a share for me that's always been a level that I want to be buying at now most recently the stock also fell over 10% this past month coming off of earnings where sales only grew by 1% in the quarter while also missing expectations for the fourth quarter in a row as they continue to hurt from their linear Network business that uh is really has been in Decline for a while as they attempt to transition over to streaming where all the growth actually lies and thankfully that part of their business is actually doing quite well last quarter for example Disney plus and Hulu reported a combined profit for the first time ever and the entire streaming segment should also be profitable this year going forward guys that's huge news because it's really what investors should be paying the most attention to has this been the biggest drag on their financials with just how much money they've had to pour into streaming as they attempt to transition over the business but you know you look at guidance now for the full year and management claims to be on track to exceed their $7.5 billion cost cutting initiative which will help Drive even higher EPS growth than previously expected from 20% up to now 25% that's huge and just as important they're guiding for more than $8 billion of free cash flow guys that's a giant positive probably the most importantance because it's easily the largest amount of cash that they've generated in many years and it marks a clear return to solid profitability which by the way they're now using to not only buy back billions in stock while while the price is still low of course that helps their EPS numbers but they also increase their new dividend by 50% now granted I don't really care about that dividend because it's only yielding about you know 0 .3% to start with but again the biggest motivator for me is just how beaten down the stock is with a valuation that is also a bit cheaper than the sector by peeg and over 60% cheaper than their own 5year average as well which at those levels I actually think there's a few catalysts that could help rebound the stock much sooner than people might think for one they recently announced a new streaming bundle that will include Warner Brothers discovery which could theoretically house Marvel Star Wars DC Game of Thrones HP FX Discovery Disney Pixar Fox Food Network and so much more under just one paid bundle either ad free or add supported for multiple price points and another big thing to remember is that Disney's box office revenue has been falling these past couple years due to a lack of new content and also a rider strike going on which sunk their market share from well over a third to now just around 16% however there are actually a few hitters coming this year that I think could be big notably we recently had Planet of the Apes do surprisingly well and we have much more on the way from some of their biggest brands including inside out to from Pixar a new alien movie new Lion King and even a few more big titles following the next year like Captain America a new Snow White and even a new Fantastic 4 but of course the biggest of all of these is that new Deadpool and Wolverine movie coming this summer which I think will do giant numbers as those are probably the two most popular characters from Marvel at the moment which by the way can also help fuel their streaming service even after the theatrical release as well plus keep in mind we're also going into summer now and I think that their theme parks and Resorts business should also see a nice uptick there as well I was actually at Disneyland back in like February and I went on a weekday you know trying to avoid the crowds I thought everybody would be at work or in school and it was still insanely packed I couldn't believe it so I really can't imagine what the numbers are going to look like during summer and I think it'll do pretty well anyway all of this to say that I just think that you know for what is arguably the largest media and entertainment leader in the world to be trading cheaper than the sector I'm not sure how long that can last and while they certainly have many issues I just don't think that I would get the price this cheap if it didn't have some problems with the company so I'll take the bad with some of that good they're the good being the stock price being cheaper a good value and I'll try to be optimistic about about it long term anyway while I do own Disney stock already myself",

    "company": "Cisco",
    "excerpt": "well one stock that I do not own yet but that I am very likely going to be uh starting to buy here in the coming weeks for both my personal portfolio and the community one CU I like it that much well that stock is number two it's going to be Cisco ticker symbol CSCO which is our medium risk option for the month now look when it comes to that risk for Cisco I feel that it's mostly to do with them being a bit more of a legacy player that hasn't had you know I would say tremendous growth as maybe some of the other bigger names in Tech as they were founded all the way back in the early 80s but they really helped establish the internet that we use today with also many of their routers and switches connecting most computers around the world which I'm not saying that that's a bad thing it's actually led to some pretty strong performance in fact if you exclude the internet Tech bubble crash of 2000 well Cisco stock has actually performed quite well in the many years after ever I also think that it's a great value for their work in advancing AI cloud computing cyber security and all of the growth potential that comes along with all of that you know most AI related stocks skyrocketed this year but Cisco actually fell by close to 10% leaving the valuation around 40 to 50% cheaper than the sector and with an awesome dividend that yields about 3.5% with also a low payout ratio and a double digit growth history and yet that's not even the best part for me what I'm most excited about is their future growth prospects the biggest of which being their recent acquisition of Splunk which was their largest in history and look guys I actually liked Splunk even before the acquisition I had it on a few of my stocks to buy videos and now that it's together with Cisco well I feel like it's even better this is kind of like the perfect match for them see Splunk is an AI and cyber security software specialist they also do a lot of stuff with Cloud which helps Cisco diversify away from relying so much on on Hardware to now being what the CEO calls one of the largest software companies in the world which Cisco was already pushing heavier into with also the third largest market share in cyber security that's something that almost nobody ever talks about by the way but Cisco is a huge player in these areas and we all know how profitable those software like margins can become longer term especially combined with AI and other high growth areas which the CEO had this to say about the entire package too that they will now both power and protect the AI Revolution as they provide the infrastructure to power it the data to develop it the security platform to protect it and the observability platform to Monitor and manage it all in real time and look most cyber security and your AI startups tend to bleed money on the bottom line in fact even splan was heavily in the red before being acquired but Cisco has been around for decades with a proven track record of reliable financials and doing billions of dollars of profit every year year and so with the stock actually down right now trading cheaper than the sector and with a super attractive dividend and now all of this future potential too stacked on top of that well I just love the entire package here and I want to start adding it to both my portfolio and the community one as well in the coming weeks",

    "excerpt": "all right now with all of that said though we are now down to the third and final stock this is the highest risk option of the bunch in my opinion and this month uh well I'm going to go with one of my favorite fex that in the market and that is Sofi ticker symbol SFI who like Cisco has also been having a rough year so far despite what I feel have been actually very promising signs for their future yet the stock is actually Fallen about 30% year to date and it's still down 3/4 of its entire value from the very top now the biggest reason for this has absolutely to do with the horrible macroeconomy we've got Skyhigh inflation Skyhigh interest rates the constant fear of a looming recession these things have been plaguing consumers uh really and the entire economy of course keep in mind the vast majority of the economy is consumer-driven and this is weighing very heavily on consumers who by the way also have record levels of debt so if you go into a recession or the economy gets even worse well what do you think is going to happen to those consumers you're talking about delayed payments on loans even defaulting bankruptcy occurring and all of those things can of course hurt any Finance Company really but also Sofi who is no exception to that as a big part of their business is of course lending however I actually think that if the economy was in better shape this stock would be soaring right now and considering all of the challenges that they've been facing along with the fact that they're still a relatively young fintech well I actually think that their performance has been very impressive and they're also doing a good job of diversifying as much as they can to help lower the risk while also working towards profitability and if interest rates start coming down or the economy recovers I think this will be a high flyer once again and here's a couple reasons why now first of all last quarter wasn't even that bad in fact actually thought it was pretty good sure they guided a little less than analyst wanted to see for the next quarter but earnings still beat on both the top and bottom line while actually raising guidance for the full year too which I think is much more important we also saw their most important growth segments in financial services on the tech platform Rise by 54% which they are now guiding to make up as much as half of all their sales this year that's huge guys it's helping them diversify their business into more growth oriented more stable and even higher margin services for their long-term future especially in Tech because we all know how you know really financial services are becoming more digitalized every day and Sofi is really disrupting this Market with their Allin one platform that continues to grow every quarter adding another more than half a million members just last quarter alone it was like more than 600,000 and the ones from their Galileo acquisition are also seeing a reacceleration too that's really big and all of this is helping them cross-sell multiple products to their entire user base Under One Roof creating a snowball effect with almost a million more products added last quarter alone but the biggest news of all is how even in the current environment Sofi has managed to work their way into profitability with the last two quarters in a row being Gap netting profitable that's really big guys and if it continues I mean with a price of sales ratio of only around three I think you start valuing them based on profits instead when you do that the stock I think actually looks very attractive here in fact analyst project EPS of almost 50 Cents by 2026 based on today's share price well that would equate to a PE ratio for that year of only around 14 I think that's pretty cheap for a high growth fintech like this that grew sales by 26% last quarter and is uh operating in a giant market that is going to get even bigger it's projected to reach whopping 1.5 trillion dollar terms of Market size by 2030 again it remains risky of a stock here because of the macro headwinds that could potentially get even worse before they get better but I just think that you know without that I probably wouldn't get as cheap of a price here on this stock so I want the stock while it is still low right now so that when the macro Environ reent improves I can benefit from that lower stock price that should ideally recover longer term",
