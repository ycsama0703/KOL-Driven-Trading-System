    "excerpt": "I would love to make this video review for you to give you just a more kind of complete um look at my thoughts and my opinion on Nike stock as it stands right now so let's go ahead and dive straight into it now uh we'll start by just taking a look at Nike stock and seeing how much it's crashed so far and then we'll talk about why it's down and whether it might be a good buying opportunity for a rebound uh kind of play there and of course I'll let you know what I plan to do myself as someone that does not currently own Nike stock at this moment but hey maybe that'll change so let's go ahead and take a closer look and let's find out now uh just kind of looking at the past month here we can already see just how sharp of a crash Nike had recently kind of falling off a cliff there really uh losing about a quarter or actually more than a quarter of its value just this past month alone which mostly had to do with their most recent earnings report from their last quarter that we will also cover in just a second but the crazy thing is that Nike has really always been a very solid and and kind of reliably strong performing stock throughout its history but more recently the stock has been getting crushed and a lot of this is actually tied to the pandemic see during the 2020 crash like most other stocks Nike fell pretty hard but it soon recovered thanks to all of that you know stimulus money that was really pumped into the economy and it sent the stock soaring from you know really all the people using this extra income to buy Nike products either at the mall at this you know store or especially online since you know so many were stuck at home with that disposable income but the problem is of course that all of that careless spending by our government you know just taking taxpayer money and using it however they like creating money essentially and uh all of that type of stuff you know it sent us to insane levels of inflation and Rising interest rates to combat that and you know what was meant to actually help our economy well it ended up destroying our economy and now it's weighing heavily on consumers which sent Nike stock crashing by well over half its entire value leaving it lower today than what they seem to trade for during that you know disastrous 2020 year and also it's trading now for one of the lowest prices of the past decade as consumers seem to now be turning to cheaper alternative brands in an effort to save money wherever they can now don't get me wrong Nike is still of course a world leader they're a Powerhouse Global brand in apparel and access accessies especially athletic wear of course and in fact they're so popular that just as a brand alone they're actually the 11th largest online retailer how crazy is that and look I have no doubt that people will continue to buy Nike products well into the future but the point is that right now consumers are obviously struggling and you don't have to take my word for that there are countless surveys out there that you could look up that show just how much you know consumer sentiment is down and even businesses so many CEOs have been saying that they're actively preparing for a recession but you know meanwhile consumers are just kind in my opinion you know I think consumers are really drowning in record levels of debt right now you take a look at credit card debt especially and it's at insane levels and people are just kind of uh you know overleveraged they're just taking out so much debt to pay for things and it's kind of crazy and so I think in that type of environment uh you're going to have some weakness there for a premium brand like Nike that is probably having to put more product on clearance than they would like which is going to be hurting their growth uh because consumers are probably going to be looking for cheaper alternatives and kind of just trying to save money wherever they can so that you know probably more of that more of their money can go towards paying down some of their for example credit card debt which of course with Rising interest rates is at insane levels of interest rates and people are just kind of they're looking at their monthly statements and they're saying I can't believe how much interest I have to pay every month so they're trying to pay down those debts well you know you're going to be cutting back on premium Brands you're going to be you know buying cheaper stuff out there and it looks like that's probably starting to hurt Nike I mean we can we can kind of see it in their earnings and in their financials so for example Revenue growth went from -4% in the really tough 2020 year before skyrocketing from all the stimulus soon after to now falling back down again to -4% expected this year and again I think that is because of the weakening economy which is exactly actually what what management point 2 in their most recent earnings report that sent the stock Falling by about 20% in a single day where they also blamed China too for their ongoing struggles and they signaled uh the current quarter that it will see a 10% fall in Revenue while also cutting their full year guidance down from a positive outlook to now a mid singled digits Decline and when speaking to the performance Nike's Finance Chief said a comeback at this scale takes time and he expects the next few quarters will will be challenging as well which again is due to several factors they pointed to slowing online sales that's a big red flag uh declines in their classic Footwear franchises that tells me that their brand is probably losing some of its strength there as customers again like I like I suspect are probably switching to competitors um probably cheaper comp competitors and then they also note an increased macro uncertainty and that's especially the case in China and they're seeing uneven cons consumer Trends across uh really all of their different markets and they added that they also expect their wholesale business to struggle too as they pull back on Classic Brands to bring in new Innovations and that actually right there it kind of brings me to another concern I have you know when you think of wholesale you know Distributing your products to retailers for them to sell off right well there's just so much competition out there there's really no barrier to entry in the apparels market so really your brand is what means everything right and okay luckily Nike is a globally recognized brand long history everyone's aware of Nike right so that should bode well for them but when I think about uh retailers like Amazon for example where it feels like really more and more people are just doing the bulk of their shopping online now going to Amazon getting everything they want well you can find so many Alternatives there that are so competitive on price to anything that Nike offers that that I just feel like Nike is probably being forced to lower their prices in in many cases to stay competitive and that seems to be slow uh showing here as they now struggle either they're selling less or they're lowering their prices um to help offset the lower demand so but either way either way it's affecting them right that's kind of my take on it and in fact you can you can look at some of their U market share for example and we can see some of this I mean take athletic footwear for example right so that's is like bread and butter I I personally play a ton of sports especially basketball and that's an area where I can't get cheap shoes because you know I could get injured it's more likely that I'll cause wear and tear on my body so as an athlete I am willing to spend extra if there is higher quality coming from a name brand and I think most athletes would feel the same way and so that's always been kind of the strength of Nike right so people are willing to pay more to get a little bit higher quality and get that recognized brand from Nike but even there I mean you take a look at Nike's market share according to statista this is for athletic footwear and you can see all that growth that they had for so long but then in recent years they just completely plateaued that's crazy and to me what that chart right there shows me is that there's probably been a rising competition that is uh probably putting pressure on Nike's pricing power too and of course ultimately that ends up hurting your growth hurting your margins and all that kind of stuff and so again uh all of this by the way too is on top of all the macro conditions and and issues that are going on which you can also see in their Nike Direct business too so this is the direct to Consumer part part of their business that was always super high growth for them but more recently you look at their last quarter and you can see that it actually fell 8% year-over-year while Nike digital that that includes their website and the mobile apps this is online sales well it also fell by 10% and that's even after another 4% decline the quarter before that too and even wholesale Revenue like we talked about earlier wholesale how important that is well that also declined by 5% as well they also noted that uh traffic in in China is declining across all channels and uh all of that all of this combined all of this NE negative stuff combined is resulting in Mass layoffs for Nike uh over 1,600 workers that they that they're laying off and about 40% of top Executives being cut too as they try navigate the more difficult macro environment and and by the way so we just mentioned China right all uh what was that so that was a decline across all channels in China well China is a big part of this too guys because you know a lot of people invested in Nike stock because of the growth potential in China but I've always seen that as a bit of a double-edged sword if you want to be fair about it because really what China likes to do is they let you into their market right it's a huge opportunity and you can get a lot of growth there but they also end up copying you with cheaper Brands once you're there and Tesla I think is a good example of that that we can kind of look to right they were allowed to come into the country and a lot of people got very excited about that but uh now what you're seeing is that China has started copying Tesla's technology right there's a lot of EV startups in China that have similar technology to Tesla and that are selling at much cheaper prices and in fact Elon Musk himself like again everything I'm saying guys you don't have to take my word for it there's so much data on this but Elon Musk himself said that if we don't put trade barriers on these Chinese companies that they're going to run all the other companies out of business so uh just kind of keep that in mind yes you do want to have access to China but you can't rely on that too much because China's own population too uh they're also going to be likely to want to buy Chinese Brands as well I mean there's a lot of nationalism there but also just for the fact that it's a lot cheaper which you know we talk about the macroeconomy the economy is struggling in China as well and so if you're trying to save money well you're going to buy cheaper Brands and of course in China there's going to be no shortage of Cheaper brands for pretty much anything you want right so uh again though I don't want to sound overly negative about Nike I I know I am hammering down some of these negative points but what I also want to say is that I actually do think that this is still a very strong Global brand and from these lower levels I think the stock price will probably perform well over time you just have to wait for this transitionary period to pass as they invest in new products new Innovations you know they cut costs there's new marketing campaigns and of course you need the economy to also get better so long term I think those things will probably take shape and you'll get some momentum uh from that but at the current moment well I think it's going to probably remain a little bit of a bumpy ride here now as for me why do I still not own Nike stock myself well I just think that there's more exciting companies out there at better prices and to be honest I've always felt like Nike stock was overrated to begin with and a bit overvalued cuz even here after this giant crash well the stock is still trading about 50% higher than the sector on a forward P basis and even when you look at the dividend many investors praise uh praise it for the you know the two decades of consecutive growth the low payout ratio and the double digit growth rates like 11% right but at only a 2% starting yield I mean when you consider a really high inflation or interest rates that yield is average at best guys and it's definitely not enough to get me excited into buying the stock when I'm worrying about everything else going on in the economy at 2% dividend yield and what it's growing by 11 I mean I've heard people say Nike is a great uh dividend growth stock it's growing at 11% that's not anything when you start at 2% you're growing at 11% it's going to take you years before that dividend gets uh you know really attractive so again not not something to get overly excited about for me now again I I will just kind of emphasize though that look if you really like Nike's business and you believe in them long term and you always wanted to buy the stock but you felt it was too expensive like you know myself I feel it's too expensive but you see it fall a lot right now and you have a long-term mindset and you're patient enough to wait for the turnaround and this is a stock that you've always wanted to own then yeah I think right now is probably your chance to buy in and I think you'll probably do well with this stock long term I'm not telling you what to do but my opinion is that it will probably perform well at you know from these lower levels so I have no objection to buying the stock but for me I still don't see it as this gigantic buying opportunity I think the valuation is just reasonable I think the dividend is just average at best and I think Nike is the type of stock that really needs a strong economy to to thrive in so I'd rather buy other stocks right now that I think are more exciting that I'm more excited about myself",
