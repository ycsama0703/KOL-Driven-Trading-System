Another poll I ran was on patreon asking uh which of our negative performing stocks at the time should I buy more of to which 53% of the votes went to Sofi and that was ahead of by do at 20% followed by Cisco Disney visa and veras sign so I purchased more Sofi stock. then I spent $15 went to Amazon and Sofi each. Google Amazon Microsoft Sofi metronic and meta currently make up about half of the entire portfolio just in those six stocks alone which I'm very happy about I think that's a good mixture there of some very large dominant companies along with still a lot of future potential in them too. whereas our larger positions aren't up by quite as much like for example Google Sofi metronic and meta are some of our largest but they're up much closer to like 10% gains which is closer to what our portfolio is doing at as a whole.",
