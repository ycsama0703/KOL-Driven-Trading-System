    "excerpt": "NVIDIA Stock to Climb ANOTHER 50% 😲 Profit-Power Not Priced In Yet?? hey what's up everyone welcome back to my world of stocks so we actually just had someone uh one of our Discord members send me an article about Nvidia stock and he asked me to share my thoughts on the article so I decided to just do a quick ask allive video for it it actually looked kind of interesting to me uh it's about HSBC analyst saying that Nvidia stock can still rise another 50% because their earnings power is apparently not yet priced in so let's run through this article and I'll give you my own thoughts on it as we go through it by the way this came from Bo thank you for your support my friend and thank you for sending me this article and it says Nvidia stock can SAR 50% as earnings power is still not in this coming from HSBC analyst Frank Lee who says that despite nvidia's continued big rally this year investors are still significantly underestimating their earnings potential uh of this uh semiconductor and artificial intelligence company and for his part Lee reiterated his buy rating on the stock while also raising his price Target up to $1,350 which implies more than 50% up upside from the closing price at the time that the article was written which was about $900 a share at that time now I am recording this a couple days after that but the stock price is still hovering just a bit above that which from this price up to lease Target it would still be about 50% gains too so it's still pretty relevant here uh by the way while I have this chart up here I might as well mention that Nvidia stock has now skyrocketed by over 2,000% just in the past 5 years alone it's pretty freaking crazy and uh full disclosure by the way Nvidia stock is currently my third largest in my personal portfolio now too after overtaking Tesla but I actually purchased most of my shares many years ago when you know a lot of people were still kind of avoiding the stock calling it too expensive um you know myself and many other Bulls just felt that Nvidia stock had a lot of long-term potential and that just kind of goes back to what I'm always telling you guys it's that short-term mentality versus the long-term investing mentality short term you know 5 years ago many people were calling Nvidia stock way too expensive and they didn't want to touch it but you know us Bulls in Nvidia stock and you can go back on my channel and look at the old videos I I've probably made more bullish videos on Nvidia stock than probably any other stock market YouTube out there but uh we just felt like long-term they would kind of grow into that valuation and that's definitely what happened the business has flourished and I'll show you more evidence of that as we go through this video but uh for now let's just finish up with the art article here and let me share my thoughts with you so uh the article goes on to say that Lee is the second most bullish of the 60 analysts surveyed by fax set behind Rosen blat who has an even higher price tag of about 55% gains from here and it mentions that Lee believes that Nvidia will continue to demonstrate its strong pricing power via its nvl server rack systems and gb200 processor platform adding that despite the strong gains the stock has has already seen he thinks Wall Street will be surprised once again by their overall strength in the coming year as for the fiscal first quarter though that Nvidia will be reporting later this week well Lee expects sales to actually come in much higher than previous guidance by around $2 billion extra dollars in sales he also thinks that the current quarter will see 28 billion in Revenue versus analyst forecast of less than 26.5 billion that's for the the current quarter that we're in right now and for the next fiscal year he also believes that we will see significant upside to earnings which he also feels is not being priced in by Wall Street at least not yet as such Lee raised his estimate for EPS by 45% higher than the fact set consensus while also lifting his revenue forecast up to 42% higher than fax set as well those are analyst expectations there and just to finish up here the article then notes that of the 60 analysts that are surveyed who who cover Nvidia well 53 of them are bullish while seven are neutral and a whopping zero analysts are actually bearish on the stock none of them so lots of positivity there with the average price Target also being about 12% higher as well and then it just finishes up by noting that Nvidia stock has already soared by over 200% in the 12 months while the in the in the past 12 months while the phlx semiconductor index and the S&amp;P 500 Index X have only risen by 62% and 26% respectively by contrast obviously it's still very good performance too but it just shows that Nvidia has been on another level okay so uh there's a few things noted here that I want to just kind of quickly touch on before we go any further now first of all there's a lot here that I agree with in the article and with what Lee said especially on the bullish side of things but also a little bit on the bearer side too where it notes just how much Nvidia stock is already up and I'll touch more on that in just a second when we cover the valuation cuz you might actually be surprised that how somewhat reasonable and video's valuation actually still is even despite the giant climb too but again we'll touch on that in just a second first I want to address what Lee said specifically and that's just that you know he really has a very strong kind of overtone on how dominant Nvidia is how strong their performance is likely to continue being and how that actually justifies that high price tag well on the pricing power and strong performance side of things guys there is no question at least in my mind that Nvidia is absolutely dominating right now especially when it comes to AI among other things and that certainly leads to pricing power and this is a case here where their gpus are just widely considered the best in the world and companies are scooping up as many as they can as many as they can get their hands on for all of their Ai and data center needs in fact Wells Fargo is now estimating that around 98% of the data center GPU Market might actually be controlled by just Nvidia alone and it points to AI being the primary reason for that there's also this report here by JP Morgan a little while back that estimated how much market share of AI related Revenue each company is generating and it put Nvidia way ahead of everyone else at over half of the entire Market that's freaking crazy guys and by the way it's not just gpus anymore either Nvidia has even entered the CPU space with their newest gray CPU line which gets combined with their already Superior gpus to form a kind of like a 2inone nvl super Computing system this is the platform that Lee was actually specifically highlighting in his analysis and guys it's an absolute Powerhouse it connects 36 gray CPUs and 72 Blackwell gpus to give 30 times faster realtime trillion parameter large language model inference doing 130 terabytes per second of low latency GPU Communications for AI and HPC that's high performance Computing workloads and it does it all at 25 times less operating costs and energy that's an absolute Game Changer guys for AI and large large language models which of course have been all the Rave the past year llms is what everybody's talking about and because of it it's already seen widespread adoption by every major cloud provider server maker and leading AI company including the likes of of course Microsoft Amazon Google and more and those are the big players and and they're all included there anyway you see these moves here and it's no wonder that Nvidia just continues to grow at the rates that they've been you know growing at we all know that AI will be one of the biggest markets in the world long term with most analysts placing its value in the trillions and Nvidia themselves estimate at least a trillion dollar addressable Market just for themselves as it is well in all of last year they only generated 60 billion in sales so even a conservative estimate of of like a trillion Market size uh long-term well that would still be around 177 times larger than nvidia's current size and that's why you see these explosive growth rates where last quarter for example their Data Center business grew more than five times larger year-over-year and just look at their financials last year their profits skyrocketed by nearly seven times larger to that's insane now I'm not saying that those uh crazy insane levels of growth will continue but my point is that Nvidia is absolutely on fire from a business standpoint and I can't really see a reason for why it would slow down too much other than just really the entire macro economy crashing which granted that is a very fair expectation these days but you know Lee also mentions that he thinks earnings will be better than expected and look I'm not a fortune teller as a long-term minded investor I don't make any investing decisions based on what happens on a quarterly basis I'm always looking multi-year out and things like that but even on that point too that Lee emphasizes well I think there are some signs that Nvidia could outperform there too I mean for example we've seen huge spikes in AI spending recently from all the big players like Amazon meta Microsoft Google Apple and more that could Bode very well for an AI chips developer like Nvidia and speaking of Nvidia developing chips not many people actually know this but Nvidia doesn't actually build their own chips instead they hire taiwan's semiconductor for most of that specific work well most recently Nvidia has not only grown to become tsmc's second largest customer only behind Apple but tsmc has also seen their April sales Spike 60% on what they called sustained demand for AI chips while also noting in their earnings call that they continue to see insatiable AI demand all of which is another positive sign here for NVIDIA on top of that super micro computer manufacturer of AI servers that actually deploys Nvidia chips well they recently saw their quarter L Revenue triple as a direct result of higher demand for AI servers and we even saw higher guidance from nvidia's Top Rivals like AMD and Intel where AMD raised data center chip guidance while Intel raised their AI accelerator Revenue guidance for the year noting increasing momentum heading into next year on the back of their gy 3 AI chip now you might have noticed that in some of those headlines uh they mentioned that a stock still fell regardless because of perhaps not meeting the really high expectations which to be fair that is something that could hurt Nvidia at least in the short term you know our analysts may be expecting a little bit too much from them has the valuation ballooned so high has the stock risen by so much to where Nvidia has to perform at the best best levels and if not it might actually dip a bit that's all you know a very real um concern you know those are reasonable expectations too I mean Nvidia is of course now one of the most valued companies in the entire world so I I do feel like there is really no room for error at these prices and they'll likely need to come out with amazing performance every quarter from here on out to kind of justify those levels however I will say that the valuation uh you know a lot of people talk about how expensive Nvidia stock is I'm not sure people are actually looking very deep into the valuation because if you do look at it it's actually not as crazy as you might think let me just show you some of these numbers here so here's the numbers from Seeking Alpha now forward PE uh yeah it's still pretty high about 30 to 50% higher than the sector median so it that's the short-term kind of valuation right there yeah it's a bit High I I for sure grant you that however compared to their own 5year average it's actually as much as 36% cheaper which means that the business is improving and that's kind of helping them grow into that valuation and here's the really crazy part here the PEG ratio this factors in future profit growth it's not just around 50% cheaper than their own 5year average but guys it's also 46% cheaper than the sector median that's pretty freaking wild for what is already what we've already established as by far the market leader here and yet their PEG ratio is still around one which is generally considered a good valuation on its own it's also close to 50% lower than the SE that's pretty crazy and it's really because of that really high profit growth that um Nvidia has been experiencing and that they're expected to continue to experience long term which you know to be fair that's exactly what Lee mentioned in that article that Wall Street is not yet pricing in that future profitability perhaps into that valuation at least not quite yet but at the same time uh I do think that expectations are high and so Nvidia will have to perform it it's a bit of a balancing act guys like I do feel that the valuation is a little high I just don't think it's as crazy as maybe some other people would like you to think um and overall I just think you know Nvidia is such a good stock it probably deserves a position in most people's portfolios at least just a tiny one just kind of in case for the long term so we'll see um like I said this is one of my largest positions I'm not currently adding more to my uh personal portfolio at the moment although I certainly could still add some to our community portfolio that's been a newer position and I might add more there and that's kind of how I feel about it I feel that um if I didn't already own Nvidia stock I would probably buy a just a small amount just in case and then just kind of add to it on any fluctuations in that stock price because uh you know we have earnings coming up this week for Nvidia stock this coming week they're going to be announcing earnings if the stock happens to fall hard on those earnings if earnings come out and and they disappoint and the stock Falls hard that would be a fantastic buying opportunity in my opinion now the stock could soore it could rise even more or it could just kind of stay the same but as a shareholder I actually want it to go down I I I would love to see Nvidia stock go down so that I could pick up more and especially for our community portfolio so and I can guarantee you guys in the community portfolio where it's a brand new position if Nvidia stock falls on earnings that'll definitely be a stock that I think we'll be adding to um on there as well but like I said in my personal portfolio I've already built it up for such a long time it's a position that I've already got such a great cost basis on it's already one of my largest there's not much reason for me to be messing with it too much at those levels",
