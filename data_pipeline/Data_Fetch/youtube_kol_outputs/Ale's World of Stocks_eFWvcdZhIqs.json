Microsoft always trades for a premium it's even more expensive than Amazon actually by both Peg and about a trillion dollar more in market cap even apple and Nvidia actually are about a trillion higher than Amazon 2 which I don't agree with myself but Microsoft I think you could make the argument for it just because of you know this being a stock that is so profitable and and in terms of the company and is still growing at such a high rate too now because of the valuation it is a stock though that I would much rather buy very heavily mind you whenever it happens to dip which is extremely rare so you have to be V vigilant for it but I just think that at the current moment Amazon might be a little more attractive at the current price tag Amazon trades cheaper because the market is kind of looking at the current profitability which Microsoft is better at but if you consider the longer term uh I feel that Amazon actually has a gigantic opportunity for huge growth on the bottom line so you match that with the valuation and it could mean better performance from here in terms of the stock price that's just my opinion could be wrong about that but um I'm going to put micro roft and number two and bump the others down one spot to fit it in and I'm going to keep Amazon at the top there. I prefer other stocks a bit more at the current moment like Google Amazon Microsoft who are cheaper buys with more interesting Diversified businesses in my opinion.",
