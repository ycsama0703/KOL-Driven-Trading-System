    "excerpt": "starting with stock number one this is the lowest risk one I'm going with medronic ticker symbol MDT who initially saw a giant Spike during the pandemic before losing all of those gains soon after falling by close to 40% from the top and is even much lower today than where they were trading even before the pandemic ever happened to down over a quarter of its value well metronic is literally the largest supplier of medical devices in the entire world so right at the start of the pandemic everyone was assuming that their business would perform really well with more hospitalizations and more like equipment and services being needed however the complete opposite happened in fact tons of hospitals actually went bankrupts because everyone was staying home and avoiding them as much as possible especially for any elective proced procedures that they just kind of put on hold until a later date the result being that hospitals were actually closed down and anyone that did need medical advice was mostly just using tah Health instead and that really sent metronics demand I would say but also of course their growth and their margins falling hence why the stock crashed by so much too however this is no longer the environment that we're living in right now hospitals are now back up and running and even people that delayed surgery and operations are now in large part getting all of those procedures done again yet metronic stock is still trading even lower today than before the pandemic even happened like I showed you earlier which tells me that this is one heck of an overcorrection here by Wall Street for what is still in my opinion an excellent value dividend stock cuz you look at some of these numbers here forward PE is around 20% cheaper now than the sector while the dividend yields over 3% on almost five Decades of consecutive growth that's almost dividend King status and you know we usually pay a premium for those type of stocks and while their sales actually took a hit you know a couple of times during 2020 and 2023 all other years have actually been their typical mid singled digit growth rates which is expected to continue in all future years as well according to anal estimates and while EPS profits have been more volatile those two are now recovering in back up to record highs in the coming year by by 2027 for example well they'll be generating about 10 billion more in Revenue per year compared to before the pandemic with nearly double the EPS you know profits earnings per share as well and yet based on today's prices that PE would only be about 13 guys that's 3% cheaper than the sector and by the way it's not like their business will be in Decline they have plenty of growth Catalyst on the horizon to help them get there too first of all interest rates are falling now that's expected to continue and that's going to make it less expensive for hospitals and companies really to finance metatronics devices thus raising their demand while the company itself also continues to innovate usually getting over a 100 new product approvals per year and I think like last year was uh I think it was like 120 the year before that was over 200 so they they're they've been innovating at a high rate for a long time and they're even expanding into surgical robotics too which I think will play a huge role in the future of healthcare with their Hugo robot system likely receiving FDA approval by next year according to Industry analyst so there's actually a lot to like about this stock right here and I continue to be a buyer myself while it trades for this low",

    "excerpt": "all right now moving on to stock number two we'll increase the risk a bit here up to medium status for this one and this time I'm actually going to go with kind of a sleeve play in AI that nobody ever really talks about I never hear them talking about it but coming off the pandemic it's been getting crushed into the ground and so now I myself am actually very tempted to start buying into this stock myself too and that stock is docu sign ticker symbol docu which despite the stock not getting much attention the company actually is the world leader in electronic signature software it's very popular has a whopping 67% market share nobody even comes close to that you might have even used them yourself either signing documents on you know some digital pad or maybe just you know online through the internet through the computer which you can see why they would be you know so popular during the pandemic right with so many people staying home and getting most of their work and paperwork and all that type of stuff you know digitally online including signing and filing documents and all that same sort of stuff which yeah obviously after the pandemic a lot of that has returned to iners however remote work especially in more kind of redundant office and legal and paperwork type of jobs well that will still be easily on the rise long term which bodess very well for a company like doy sign in fact according to Statia the percentage of employees that work from home all or most of the time worldwide has only gone up by huge amounts with even last year past the pandemic still sitting at a whopping 28% that's up from just 10% before the pandemic that's a huge increase guys and look the numbers by industry are even more impressive Tech is at 67% remote agencies and Consulting is at 50% finance and insurance is at 48% guys th those are absolutely industries that would actually use the types of products and services that doggy sign exactly the ones that doggy sign offers which by the way over that time they've also grown and expanded themselves too to offer more adjacent services including HR legal and more basically it's at the point here where if you're either a new business or you know maybe you're already an existing one but you're trying to transition more digitally and improve your efficiencies as a company well you can easily hire DocuSign to come in and transform so much of that work for you the biggest of which the most exciting new product that they offer is their AI powered intelligent agreement platform call it I am that does all the hard work for you of reviewing and managing all these complex contracts all in one place which by the way is also secured by their blockchain Technologies too they're big play they're a big play on blockchain a lot of people don't know this but you know doyan actually uses blockchain to heavily secure their contracts and even their signer identities and all that kind of stuff too so they're play for that as well now granted I am the platform it's uh still in the early stages of really rolling out but management thinks that it will help them recover a lot of their growth rates over the longer term which have been dwindling down to the single digits ever since the pandemic highs and also you know given the rise in competition which is where all the risk really comes in for me is because of a lot of new companies trying to um I would say like duplicate what DocuSign does so well but if you think that their branding power is strong enough if you think their moat is large enough to fend off the competition then you know this stock continues to get just more attractive I would say the more that it falls because you know at one point here the stock was even Trading North of $300 during the pandemic but since then it's crashed by a whopping 75% down to just the $70 range today and with all of those pandemic gains wiped away so too has the valuation Fallen to an adjusted PE ratio that is uh 80% lower than their 5-year average and a gap PE ratio that is over 40% cheaper than the sector despite this being really the market leader uh now like I said I don't own them quite yet myself but it's probably at the very top of my watch list right now in terms of future stocks that I don't own yet but that you know I would like to buy soon and I probably will pick up a little bit of this one here in the coming month but only as a long-term I got to have a long-term Horizon with this one but I do like it here",

    "excerpt": "now finishing up here with stock number three this will be the highest risk of the bunch and for this one it's actually kind of crazy that I'm even categorizing it as high-risk but you'll understand why I'm going with fizer ticker symol PFE now why do I consider the absolute largest pharmaceutical company in the world to be highrisk when we know how much of a profitable cash generating machine you know pharmace the Pharmaceuticals Market can be well the reason is because regardless of how strong of a position I think fizer is in as a company right now in terms of dominance and and what they're doing around the world uh the stock just continues to crash regardless of that even this past month you know the entire Market has been like soaring this past month fizer was down another 10% now my guess is that it has a lot to do with you know Kennedy uh he's going to be appointed to run the Department of Health and Human Services and you know I don't know how much you guys know about Kennedy or and obviously I don't want to get political or any of that kind kind of stuff but uh the thing is that you know a lot of people feel like Kennedy might be disruptive to the the current healthc care system the way it's run right now but as disruptive as he might be personally I don't really think that he's going to go in there and just completely dismantle these biotechs or fizer uh nor has he even really said that that's exactly what he wants to do my opinion is that he really is just advocating here for common sense things that I I feel both liberals and conservatives can agree on like taking unnecessary and unhealthy ingredients out of people's foods and even medicines most of which by the way a lot of them are actually already banned in many other countries so why not just have more transparency and healthier natural alternatives to you know a lot of the junk that we as humans let's let's be honest about it we put a lot of junk into our bodies so why not just be a little more conscious about that and that doesn't mean going in and just destroying all these companies it just means that they have to these companies are going to have to consider People's Health a little bit more than what you know how they currently do which I don't see any problem with myself that's just my personal opinion but by the way there's so many checks and balances with the way the government is set up that even if he did want to dismantle some of these giant corporations and maybe you're worried about that I I highly doubt that he he would even be able to which you know your opinion whether that's good or bad I'm just saying that's just kind of the reality that we live in and yet when you look at fizer's stock it continues to crash as if they're headed for bankruptcy even trading now at a decade low after losing more than half of its entire value from the top that's a huge crash that really tells me that it's probably oversold here because really regardless of how any of us feel about this company you know politically or socially or anything else when you just look at the numbers from an investment perspective alone putting that you know those other feelings aside for a second um you know even after losing all of its growth that they were getting from the vshot during the pandemic well fer is still expected to generate over $20 billion more in Revenue this year than they even did before the pandemic ever started and they're also doing more in EPS to and while growth is very stagnant now you know as you would expect because of the loss of the vshop well I think that growth will likely return over the longer term thanks to the $70 billion of profit that they generated almost entirely from the vshot and then they they spent all of that money on a acquiring multiple different large biotech companies to build up their massive pipeline even larger it already has over like oh over a hundred different drugs and treatments coming in the future and at the very least I think it'll just help them maintain their already massive size their large profits while they continue to pay a huge dividend at a dirt cheap valuation with a forward p ratio around 50% cheaper than the sector and a dividend yield of almost 65% with also an affordable payout ratio of less than 65% by the way that yield is also more than 300% higher than the sector that's how much the stock has fallen and it's also one of the highest that we've ever seen from them so I just think that you couple the dividend with the cheap valuation and the future growth from the massive Acquisitions that they were basically just kind of gifted by the government cuz let's be honest like taxpayer money funded the vshot and yet the stock price continues to crash and I just think that you know as a high-risk option if we categorize it as that I think it's got to be one of the most attractive out there in the market as a high-risk stock right so anyway that's my thoughts on it",
