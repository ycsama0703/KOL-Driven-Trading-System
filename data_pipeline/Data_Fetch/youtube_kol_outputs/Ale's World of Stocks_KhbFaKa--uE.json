    "excerpt": "I've actually been getting lots of comments asking about cyber security specialist crowd strike uh ticker symbol crwd so I just picked a quick comment here from one of you guys this one from IJ man 35 who asked would love your thoughts on Crow uh crwd uh do you think they will come back from the recent blunder or will they keep falling I'm trying to decide if I should get out while I'm still up and buy back cheaper thanks. So instead I'm just going to do some analysis here for you guys and Share My overall thoughts on the stock from a long-term perspective whether I think it's a good buying opportunity for a recovery um or not and I'll let you know what I plan to do myself too as someone who does not currently own the stock so uh we'll just start with a quick recap on why it crashed by so much it lost about a quarter of its value just in the past week alone and then I'll give a couple of bullish arguments some bearish arguments and I'll finish up with my overall conclusion and what I'm doing myself sound good. Okay so just looking at the past week here we can see almost a 25% crash in the stock price and more than a 30% crash over the past month alone so why did this happen well the first thing to know about crowd strike is of course that they are one of the biggest cyber security specialists in the world with their cloud and AI powered Falcon platform being one of the most popular options for businesses thanks to how convenient yet powerful and robust the all-in-one singular platform is to really set up for your organization and then you can add upgrades and special modules to fit your specific needs as time goes on all of which crowd strike advertises as improving your security performance and efficiency while also saving on costs which is a great proposition these days given how weak the economy is and how businesses are trying to uh you know digitalize more they're turning to things like big data Ai and Cloud Technologies to fuel New Growth all of which crowd strike can help keep safe which is of course very important data is like the new uh I would say like gold it's like the oil you know whatever uh analogy you want to use but it's very very important for these businesses to keep all of that data safe and so that's why cyber security is so important and because of this well crowd strike has now been able to attract about 29,000 different companies around the world to use their services including even some very well-known giants like Google Amazon Intel Target and even the US government all of which has helped crowd strike become the fourth largest global market share leader in cyber security in the world at least according to Canalis research which is the most recent data we have on it but while it may seem a little small at just around 4% market share well the really important number that you got to pay attention to here is the 34% growth rate because it's completely unmatched by really any of the competition other than maybe Microsoft there just in that segment now CH crowd strike has easily been putting up the highest growth numbers in recent years and again it's because of that robust yet simplified Falcon platform that businesses love to use and that's really kept them growing red hot that is up until of course recently where about a week ago well the world experienced what is being referred to as probably the biggest it outage in history now this was caused by a faulty software update from crowd strike that they released for Microsoft Windows systems of course you know most computers run run on windows so if you're a crowd strike customer which me many businesses are and you also use Windows which most people do then you likely encountered this bug that caused widespread disruptions impacting everything from hospitals to Airlines to Banks and countless other businesses now crowd strike did quickly issue a patch to address the core issue but many systems remained problematic with most affected computers requiring manual reboots that's a process that can take considerable time and even manpower to resolve those lingering issues as a result of all this because so many business operations were disrupted well the fear is that crowd strike might be facing settlements fees and perhaps even lawsuits for months if not years to come now much of that right there of course though we have to clarify that it is mostly speculation cuz we really won't know the real impact of all of this until probably years from now where we can look back and see just how many companies actually find crowd strike or want any L any litigation against them which by the way I believe that in their terms uh and conditions uh they state that it limits their liability to just fees paid by the customer so the most likely scenario I think we'd see is really just a lot of refunds taking place for services that crowd strike has provided these other companies but even that of course could still be pretty substantial if you're having to refund you know a big chunk of your revenues plus we don't even know if any of their customers had custom contracts that might actually raise their liability from there so again all we can really do is kind of speculate at this point but what's probably a lot less speculative is in just kind of assuming that their brand and reputation has at least taken you know probably a pretty big hit from this which could slow down some of that explosive growth that we talked about earlier that is you know you know really so important for differentiating crowd strike from much of the competition that's a big advantage that they've always had was that explosive growth well if now you're seeing that less companies want to sign up with them if less companies want to renew with them or upgrade with them you know that growth is going to come to uh maybe not a screeching haul but it's going to probably take a big hit so anyway because of that investors sold out of the stock and droves causing it to crash heavily over the past week as we looked at earlier so uh where does all of this really leave us now is this a massive buying opportunity to get in while we still can or is the risk and uncertainty of their future following this giant blender just too big to ignore well let's start with a couple bullish viewpoints on this now first of all cyber security is we all know it's one of the absolute hottest high growth Tech markets that you could possibly invest in right now in fact according to gner research the area of Technology with the largest amount of increased investment among companies recently was actually cyber security guys that's even ahead of cloud Ai and more that's pretty freaking crazy and in total most anal agree that this is a market that will be worth you know many trillions of dollars long term I mean Forbes even thinks that by next year there will be 10 trillion dollars worth of cyber security damage so there's a giant need here for added protection and the good thing about crowd strike is that even as bad as this recent issue was it didn't really have anything to do with their abilities in cyber security instead it was really just a faulty software update which by the way many companies tend to have uh those kind of um mistakes tend to make them those mistakes pretty often now granted it's probably nowhere near the scale of this size and damage but I just think that this is uh a much more kind of understandable mistake as opposed to allowing some kind of massive data breach or Cyber attack that would make customers think that the Falcon platform isn't as good as they once thought that but that's not the case here had nothing to really do with that and yet it was still a big enough mistake to crash the stock price by a very large amount which leads me to the second bullish argument and that's that this really looks like here another classic case of you probably weren't going to get a deal like this for a red hog growth Tech stock if it weren't for some type of big mistake that tempor at least temporarily drags it down just long enough to present us with a buying opportunity for the long term and ultimately that's what I mostly feel this is cuz cyber security will only get larger over time in fact most years we see a record number of data breaches because of how digital the world is becoming so demand will only grow larger over time and crowd strike was growing faster than all the competition before this mistake happened which again I think is a much more fixable mistake that we can eventually move past of rather than it being about their actual product not working or or not being effective so just from that standpoint alone I actually do think that the stock is mostly a buy here which by the way most analysts agree with me as the current price is right near even the most negative lowest price targets out there in fact there's been a ton of talk lately about analyst downgrades which by the way also helped push down the stock further but the funny thing is that even with those downgrades and zero upgrades like there's been no upgrades but it's mostly just been maintains or downgrades well all the new price targets are still much higher than where the stock trades today like look at some of these figures here so since the event took place uh here's some ratings maintain 56% gains on the price Target downgrade 2% gains maintain 30% gains a couple downgrades with no price Target but then you have another maintain 50% gains maintain 15% gains uh maintain 30% gains maintain 41% gains a downgrade but still 11% gains maintain 47% gains downgrade 12% gains maintain 24% gains maintain 20% gains and then a total of 42 analysts with an average buy rating that has over 35% upside so that is still very bullish sentiment overall on the stock however there are uh still some bearish arguments to keep in mind here for why the stock may actually not be a buy right now why it may not be as great of a deal as you might initially think at first glance and look I know for me there's really a couple reasons why why I might feel that way in particular the most obvious of course being just that sheer amount of uncertainty that is surrounding crowd strike right now in terms of not really knowing just how big of a hit their brand and their financials will take going forward especially considering how saturated and highly competitive the cyber security Market you know is becoming these days and how much um that might hurt crowd strike and give an advantage give an opportunity for some of their competitors to steal some market share or steal a little bit of the thunder right now and that's actually the case considering that crowd strike just started becoming profitable last year so if we see them now get pushed back further from that profitability in the coming quarters or even years because of fines refunds or even lawsuits well that could definitely still sink the stock even lower from where it is today which actually leads me to reason number two this is probably the biggest kind of bearish argument that I could make on the stock here and that's that it's not even as cheap as you might expect it to be even with the giant crash uh you're still talking about a very rich well let's put it this way you're talking about a stock that was already very rich to begin with and now after the crashes just gotten more reasonable but not necessarily cheap because we go back to the stock here for for just a second we look at this chart so we can see that even after losing more than 30% from the top it's really only lost the gains from the past year or so where the stock had absolutely skyrocketed in fact even today it's still trading at one of the highest prices that we've ever seen and if you think that's crazy well even with the recent crash crowd strike is still positive this year so how much of a deep crash or discount are we even talking about here well you look at the valuation and it's a bit of a mixed bag now yes it is around 70% lower than their 5-year average on an adjusted PE basis and the peg is also about 16% lower than the sector which I would normally say is extremely good for what is you know the highest growth cyber security stock in the market but the that's assuming that their profits continue to grow in the coming years which again is not guaranteed coming off the Fallout of these Rec recent issues that they just had and if we look at the valuation from just where it sits today adjusted forward PE is still about 200% higher than the sector so that's pretty darn expensive so it's really the future that we'd have to look forward to for that valuation to come down and we would need a lot of um earnings growth for that to happen too and so right now the forward p is around 6 7 I would say a good PE for them would be somewhere less than like 30 closer to 20 I think would be you know I think there there we'd be talking about a solid deal for the stock but if we look at forward estimates from analyst even with EPS growth expected to rise in the coming years we still wouldn't get to those PE levels until around 2027 or 2028 at best which again that's assuming that they don't face many lawsuits or major blowback uh from the recent issue so in conclusion guys is a stock a buy right now is it a good value here to pick up again short-term predictions are purely speculative and anyone's guess is as good as mine but longer term uh it's really going to rest on the shoulders of how bad of a hit does their brand and their financials take in the coming quarters and years so from that standpoint I think being a little more cautious and kind of waiting for some clarity does make sense but on the other hand I would still rate the stock a buy here just from what I'm seeing today my gut tells me that the stock will be trading higher in the future than where it is today so I still think it's it's pretty good cyber security Market is red hot this is a company with very high growth and the recent issues had nothing to do with their abilities to protect customers so for me a big 30% haircut uh on that stock looks like enough of a good reason for me to start buying into it in small amounts for a long-term recovery and yet I am still not buying the stock myself which I I know it sounds a little hypocritical but there's one very clear reason for that and it's that I already get all the cyber security exposure that I need plus way more from other companies that I think are much safer bets and I own several that fit that bill but just for example I'm investing in Microsoft and Cisco Microsoft has close to the same amount of market share as Crow strike with also close to the same growth in cyber security yet they're insanely larger more profitable and way more Diversified and while Cisco is barely growing they already have much more market share a way cheaper valuation and a super attractive dividend to go along with it too so because of that reason I have really in in the position that I'm in myself I know this is just kind of for myself but I'm in the position I I have the luxury of not needing crowd strike immediately in my portfolio and therefore I can wait to see if the stock does happen to go a little lower before buying in I can actually wait for a a better looking valuation that I'd be more attracted to buying in but again that's just for my personal situation that's my own opinion I would love to hear your thoughts though and actually I plan on adding crowd strike to our polls in the community portfolio to see if you guys want it added there too cuz I am actually willing to buy the stock I do like them here but I'm just kind of 5050 at these levels for my personal kind of private portfolio I think if it does keep sinking I might add it but for right now I just don't feel like I'm in a huge rush to to jump in.",
