    "excerpt": "investors feel so pessimistic about future growth for the country that they expect the FED to lower rates in order to you know help boost or recover the economy which is typically within a recession right well a couple important notes on this first of all interest rates have been rising at one of the sharpest inclines in history over the past couple years this of course being the Fallout from all the money creation and spending that did during the pandemic leading to Giant inflation that we later had to try to control by raising rates to cool the economy problem is though when you try to manually cool the economy you often overcorrect and send it into a recession well if you're raising rates at one of the highest inclines in history yeah chances are going to be you know pretty damn high that you overcorrect in fact almost every recession in history came right after a period of sharply Rising rates so why would this time be any different if it is one of the sharp Rises we've ever had I mean it just makes logical sense that a recession would hit you know this time around too right well that's exactly what investors are predicting and so they've been buying up long-term bonds right now so that they can lock in higher fixed rates before the FED starts to lower them and also because us-backed long-term bonds are generally considered safer than stocks which would like likely crash more during a recession right now there's a lot more to this but basically this increase in demand sends the long-term bond prices rising which lowers their yield and meanwhile investors aren't as interested in short-term bonds so that sends their price falling but their yield Rising the result being if the swing gets big enough the two different yields actually end up inverting which is a very rare occurrence that since I believe like the mid 50s has always preceded a recession with 100% accuracy and of course there's you know kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy with a lot of this stuff right I mean that's why you know the fed and and economists and the media that's why they're always so careful about you know talking about the economy and all that kind of stuff because you want to have confidence in the economy once once investors are actually betting with their money Big Time investors are betting that the economy is going to crash and people you know start to freak out and consumers start spending less and businesses stop investing and all of this stuff ends up you know snowballing and really hurting our economic growth well it ends up being this self-fulfilling prophecy that ends up crashing the economy and hurting the market and that's why these indicators can actually be so accurate because of how much power uh you know consumers and businesses and investors actually hold within the economy now yeah it just so happens that we had such an inversion this time around too it was around the end of last last year the 3month and 10e treasury yield curve inversion occurred around the end of last year and the scary thing is that it's really been inverted ever since then in other words this is a real inversion it's not like you know oh it just kind of barely dipped it's just this tiny little inversion and then it it went right back to normal no this is a fullon inversion that has been lasting for about a year now and is absolutely by you know all the definitions of it it is absolutely signaling a recession now the caveat to all this is that typically the range when a recession would likely hit after a yield curve inversion can be as much as like 18 months I think one time it was like 22 months so you know it can be at the high end it could be getting close to like two years can be a pretty big period of time but the average is usually around one year which kind of makes things even scarier because that would mean that a recession we could already be in one or it could be like very very soon and that actually lines up perfectly with the next indicator again just making it even that much scarier and the next indicator that I'm going to show you guys is what we call the Sam Rule now what's that well the Sam rule was actually created to predict a recession within a much smaller time frame as opposed to the inverted yield curve and I'll explain what that means uh I'll explain that in further detail in just a second but just a couple quick points on this first now the indicator was developed not too long ago it was in 2019 by Claudia Sam an economist who recognized that traditional economic indicators for signaling recessions often lagged behind real-time economic conditions that can take time to gather and analyze of which Sam focused primarily on the unemployment rate because of how sensitive it is to our current economic health of course when an economy is in Decline like a recession unemployment Rises quickly and can often be observed more quickly than other economic metrics and after doing her research well she found that through history basically since at least the 1970s Whenever there was a 3month moving average of unemployment Rising above half a percentage point or more over the low of the past year Well it indicated a recession with 100% accuracy and yeah you guess it guys the Sam rule has also been triggered now in fact it just got triggered this past July where it remained triggered in August and while we don't have September unemployment numbers in quite yet it's widely expected to be triggered that month too and so here's a chart showing this and as you can see a recession was already taking place every single time that the Sam rule had been triggered and then you look at the very tail end of that chart there and well you can see that we just started triggering it once again and so the point being that a recession has already started if this model is correct which it always has been so if it's not correct this time well that would be an extremely rare occurrence more like a one-off kind of outlier has never happened before so what are really the chances of it being wrong well surprisingly there's actually many economists that are arguing that it will be wrong this time because of a sudden rise in migration particularly the illegal kind from South of the Border which is estimated to be well into the millions these past couple years now I'm not saying that for any kind of political reasons I'm just telling you the facts and economists are arguing that this is why unemployment is rising not because of a lack of jobs or a weakening economy but rather just too many available workers okay well regardless of whether that's true or not other economists is time uh I believe I think they're from a college might have been Berkeley I I forget which college but uh anyway they modified this economic indicator the Sam rule to also add on top of it the metric of the job vacancy rate to make up for that for you know for for that issue and this is the rule that is referred to as the mchz rule it's named after the combined last name of the two economists behind it and well this new indicator is actually even more accurate than the Sam rule it's dating back even further to the 1930s but here's the thing guys here's the bad news this one too despite you know the immigration all that kind of stuff th those those reasons or excuses or however you want to look at it this one too has also been triggered in fact its threshold of 0.3 was triggered back in March so what's my overall conclusion here well I think you know making the case for us to be in a recession already is a pretty easy one to make at this point people in businesses of course generally feel that the economy is weak these days the yield curve inverted about a year ago which lines up you know almost perfectly in terms of timing for a recession to be occurring either now or at least very soon and on top of that both the Sam Ru and the mchz rule have both officially triggered and have never been wrong for many many decades and those typically trigger when we're already in a recession so you know it'd be either already in a recession or or again it could be like coming very very soon right so the likelihood of a recession I would say is pretty high based on a lot of this data right and it's I would also say it's probably higher than most other times like I you guys probably remember ever since like the Great Recession we've had so many e eous and and the media and and others for years saying that there would be a recession right like for years we heard that that rhetoric or that talk about a recession and it never really happened and and not just that but we also had like much less data back then than we do now signaling a recession like right now all the cards are are you know saying that that a recession is on the table and yet you know they're not really um talking about it as much or I would say they're just they're not really saying that it's going to happen you know they they tend to give excuses or reasons for why this time is different which is totally fine you know they might be right but you know it it's just in my opinion I feel that the economy is probably worse than they're letting on than they seem to be letting on and that's why of course you're now seeing the FED cut rates they just cut rates by half a point which was more than anyone expected it to be in September and they're likely going to cut another half a point this year before this year even ends they have like two more fed meetings probably going to be cutting out both and then they have a whole point that is expected to be cut next year and then still another half a point the year after that so that's pretty aggressive for an economy that is supposedly doing so great right and so my guess is that the FED is actually worried about a recession and they've put off lowering interest rates for as long as they could and you know they're not going to just go out right right out and say right like they're not going to say oh we think we're in a recession or recession's right around the corner because again this can be a so fulfilling prophecy so you don't want to freak out all consumers the econom most of the economy is consumer-driven if you freak out all the consumers what's everyone going to do they're going to stop spending all of a sudden companies stop you know make less money they have to start doing Mass layoffs they stop investing it tanks the economy so you don't want to uh you don't want to cause it yourself but you'll just kind of start lowering interest rates and hopefully if you're the FED you're you're just hoping that you did it soon enough or fast enough to actually prevent vent a recession this time which again it could happen it is possible that we're not yet in a recession and you know maybe we got super close to one but now the FED is lowering rates and we just kind of barely miss it that is possible but either way here's why I'm actually more optimistic this might surprise you based on everything we've everything I've shown you in this video I'm actually optimistic I would say more optimistic than most about the future because the biggest reason why is that we have the high interest rates it's funny as a long-term investor I actually kind of like high rates because I know that if a recession hits and the market crashes I know that we have the Firepower to quickly get out of it by being able to lower rates it's kind of a nice thing to have in your bag right and so here's my overall summary and what I'm doing myself now n number one I think focusing on a stable job and career is top priority in this environment with so much uncertainty you got to make sure that you have a reliable job because if a recession hits you don't want to get caught off guard and I know it's not always possible to have a reliable job but I would just say put as much energy and focus and attention into that as possible because being employed is ultimately going to be the most important thing if you do you know have to suffer through a recession now number two try to have some savings don't just put all your money and faith in stocks that's ridiculous always have a backup plan always have emergency funds and at least try to the best of your ability and then finally at number three though this would be for me the lowest priority is where I I am still investing in stocks because I feel that longer term again we have the Firepower to get out of a recession and maybe we actually end up missing it all together so I'm still investing in stocks but I am being a little more cautious here I mean right now the market is at record highs it's not the most attractive times far from it and with so much uncertainty and all the data I just showed you guys about signals of a recession well I think it is okay to invest a little slower than normal and instead put a little more of that money a little more of that budget into cash if possible into emergency funds and things like that and so if a recession does hit well guess what that's where I really want to be able to go ham on stocks in my opinion that's where I want to be able to buy very heavy the market corrects or crashes or dips that's where I like to do the majority of my buying when stock prices are going down and longer term I can expect the lowering of interest rates to help boost up the economy and help it recover and so is this a little bit of a scary time yeah it can be a little scary for us investors out there and you know of course we also have a big election this year things can get a little volatile I think there is a disconnect between the economy and the stock market it's up a lot I think a dip a correction makes sense but nothing is guaranteed either and maybe you know so nothing maybe nothing ends up happening and we just kind of continue on the same course that we've been on time will tell but I just think that under the conditions under the uncertainty having a little more caution here just in in case I think will'll ultimately serve us better over the long run as investors so anyway those are my thoughts I'd love to hear what you guys think down below hope you enjoyed the video and I will catch you in the next one my friends best of luck wishing you with any decisions you make out there in the market but yeah thanks for stopping by I'll see you next time bye-bye",
