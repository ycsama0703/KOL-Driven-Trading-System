    "excerpt": "I'm going with by do ticker symbol b i du which is not only negative this year but is also down over 30% in the past decade and closer to 70% down from the very top and look considering how much AI socks have been on a tear this year I think it's pretty freaking crazy that by do is still so heavily beaten down like this when they're actually one of the absolute largest pure plays on artificial intelligence out there in fact many people don't even know this but BYU actually holds the most AI patents in the entire world even ahead of other giants like Google Nvidia Microsoft and more and a large reason for that that dedication to AI from them is because of the insane amounts of data that they're able to collect which they can then use to fuel their AI platforms not only holding more than half of the entire search engine market share in China but also being one of the top four largest digital advertisers there too and because of this dominance BYU has often been referred to as the Google of China which of course is a welcomed comparison since Google is one of the most talked about AI stocks in the world world but hey that comparison in my opinion is also a pretty fair one cuz like Google BYU also has a giant Cloud business in fact they hold number one market share in Cloud AI in China how crazy is that now their Ernie platform is also ranked as the number one Chinese AI chatbot and large language model in the country there similarly to Google with gini and they even have a growing autonomous driving division called Apollo which is similar to Google's wayo which by the way that was in the headlines recently they've shown impressive leadership there not only being the first Robo taxi service to receive approval in China but it's also the first 24/7 service and most recently they've even been hired by none other than Tesla to help them with their full self-driving and eventual Robo taxi launch in the country as well that's a huge deal guys cuz most analysts agree that the robo taxi Market will be worth trillions of dollars in the future with China likely being the largest market for them just like they are for Eves among other things too and meanwhile though BYU already has a very strong and profitable business and while it can sometimes be a bit volatile because of the current state of the Chinese economy well we have at least seen significant improvements to both their operating and free cash flows over the past few years growing by billions of un each time anyway the point is that if it weren't for being a Chinese stock that inherently carries significant risk for that fact alone well by would probably be a soaring stock perhaps reaching new all-time highs every year just like Google and other American peers but instead what we've seen is a beaten down AI leader with an insanely cheap valuation that trades over 27% cheaper than the sector on a forward PE basis over 42% cheaper than their own 5-year average and over 63% cheaper than the sector on a peg basis as well look for me that's cheap cheap enough to Warrant the risk and so I've been a buyer in recent years and I'll probably continue to be one in small amounts going forward I do often worry about their ties to China and the risk that comes with that but as a very small position in my portfolio with not too much influence over it I just think that it's worth the gamble because without that risk that it carries there's no way in heck that I would ever get an AI leader like this at such a low price price so you got to take the good with the bad in my opinion",

    "company": "C3.ai",
    "excerpt": "that is the AI specialist that uh actually has AI right in their name and their ticker symbol that's of course c3.ai ticker symbol AI it's one of my newest little tiny positions that I've just started building up um it's one that I actually sometimes refer to them as kind of like the riskier kind of smaller brother to paler which I know sounds a little weird but I feel that they do share some similarities as just like paler you know C3 is also primarily an AI software specialist that helps other businesses and even government entities manage their data using the power of AI to run better and more efficiently across a number of different Industries like manufacturing energy utilities Telecom Transportation Financial Services defense intelligence Healthcare and more to give you give you just a few examples here they helped a fortune 230 billion dollar Global Manufacturing Company optimized their inventory resulting in as much as a 52% reduction on inventory holding cost saving millions of dollars they also help helped the Fortune 500 Utility reduce the Transformer failures by almost 50% with a 98% accuracy rate and detecting future failure events resulting in $800,000 of cost avoided from early detection they helped the pharmaceutical giant improve their drug manufacturing and performance resulting in a 60% reduction in maintenance costs and a 90% reduction in false positive alerts and they're even using generative AI now too which of course has been all the buzz these past couple years where they were able to deploy their entire platform within two days and immediately integrate it with all of the company's data so that employees can now find the information required over 90% faster with also around a 90% accur accuracy rate anyway the reason why C3 has always caught my eye is because so much of this can be brought to an organization at a software level which allows C3 to deploy the entire platform and get actionable results within weeks and months rather than years and that's a huge selling point to Giant organizations that are always moving fast but are also looking to cut costs and improve efficiencies at scale as much as possible cuz when you have such large entities like this with so many assets you know so many employees so many processes running all the time well if you can make uh everything for them run better at scale you're going to get huge results at at those sizes and some of the savings that C3 has been able to provide to companies has been in the hundreds of millions of dollars at times and that's gigantic guys it's why you always really hear so many companies now talking about Ai and all of their earnings calls pick up listen to ear any earnings call out there you're always going to hear um management talking about AI now it's it's like the most used buzzword because they love to show off to analysts and investors how much better the company is running how much money they're saving by using Ai and it just gets some attention and and it's what everybody loves to hear from them and so again because of that a company like C3 who can do that for you very easily quickly at a software level well that's going to be very valuable to the entire global economy in fact it's estimated that the AI software Market alone will surpass pass a trillion dollars over the next decade according to president's research with many other analysts projecting even more but to give you some context of how large of an opportunity this would be for C3 well they barely did just over a quarter of only 1 billion in sales in all of last year so there's giant room there for expansion and yet the stock price has actually cratered into the ground not only negative year to date by almost 20% but since iping right at the end of uh 2020 well stock has lost more than 80% of its total value how crazy is that now obviously there's several reasons for that as the economy has been deteriorating ever since and especially in a rising rate environment where profits become even more important well c3's heavy losses year after year have caused major concerns among investors which I think are totally warranted on top of which their slowdown in Revenue growth to below 20% isn't necessarily helping their case however it does look like the business is at least re accelerating now with EPS growth expected to be above 50% over the next 5 years on average too and at these levels we're now talking about an EV to sales ratio below seven which mind you I don't even care about the valuation based on sales I think profitability could sore in the future and leave a cheap valuation based on earnings because of the software like margins that they can benefit from at scale and again that's what really excites me about this company like I said it is a risky one it's bleeding money and the economic environment isn't making me feel any better about any of that but at these levels as just a very tiny position to start out with I'm okay taking this bet here you know time will tell where it goes but my hope is that their business and their services are just too valuable to Enterprises and other entities to where they can't really disappear hopefully that's the idea but instead they actually grow larger and we'll see if that actually turns out to be the case but I think it's definitely an interesting sleeper stock for AI",
