    "excerpt": "I actually want to throw a travel stock at you guys this month that has been really beaten into the ground because of the pandemic yet I feel that there is a big recovery taking place in travel which leaves United Airlines stock looking extremely attractive at these levels now you start by looking at the travel recovery well we can see that domestic flight passengers have already reached a new record high last year so we are well past the pandemic at this point it's really in the rear view Mir mirror there's no lingering lockdowns or travel restrictions we're just right back to really where we should be breaking new record highs in travel and that bods very well for airliners speaking of which when looking at market share in America the four largest by a huge margin are Delta American southwest and United each of them hovering above 15% really close to each other now United is technically the smallest of the four but that's by a very small margin and even then I might actually consider that to be a positive as it just leaves a little bit more room for growth than perhaps the others which happens to be exactly the case when we look at projected Revenue growth this year with United leading the entire pack now if you're looking for really explosive growth then airliners are probably not for you they're much more of a value play than anything else but in that area they absolutely Excel because of really how much they crashed during the pandemic and are still trading just about as low as they did during the heat of it with United in particular having now lost over half of its entire value over the past 5 years basically since right before the pandemic started and if you think that's crazy if we zoom out a little further well we can actually see that it's also at one of the absolute lowest prices of the past decade to and it's actually negative during that time as well by over 133% that is wild for a leading airliner in a market that has already recovered to new record highs to still be trading this low and because of it the valuation is also Dirt Cheap with a forward p ratio of less than five so low and it's almost 80% cheaper than the sector and in the particular case of United they're also the cheapest among the big four as well which is again just makes him even more attractive than that now again this is all in despite of the strong recovery which is perfectly Illustrated right here in their financials showing sales and profits Rising right back up again however here's where a lot of the risk really comes in in my opinion because these airliners took such heavy damage during the pandemic that it really left them with massive amounts of debt but in my opinion i' I just feel that United is handling it better than most see airliners used to also be great dividend stocks in fact I actually used to own Delta myself just for that reason but you fast forward to today and all of them were forced to make Cuts with only Delta and Southwest paying a very small one today that are really nowhere near the levels that they used to be at but when you look at their cash flow statements I actually like the fact that United is instead focusing on paying down debt rather than paying any dividends at the moment I think it's a smart move so you look at operating cash flow for example it's recovered by many billions of dollars during that time and the only reason that their free cash flow is still negative is because they paid back almost $8 billion of debt last year that's huge now you contrast that with someone like Delta for example market share leader at the moment uh they only paid back three billion and because of that they were able to still squeak out a a $1 billion profit for free cash flow that they used to pay dividends but when you look at both current assets and current liabilities United actually has much better metrics on both fronts by many billions of dollars so I really feel like Delta should be the one paying back more debt than what United is doing but again I just I like that United is doing that and I like a lot of other things that United is also doing in recent years they've been focusing a lot heavier on customer service which you can see in their satisfaction numbers recovering greatly and I I love to see that they're also Diversified pretty well within their own business with economy business and premium business all of which are showing steady growth and they've also invested in other areas too like expansions more gates more training programs for Pilots they have the highest rated and most downloaded Airline app in the world with popular features like preferred seating and a lot more so I'm just overall bullish on United what they're doing and where stock sits at these levels but I do think that there is significant risk from potentially future pandemics hopefully we don't have any in the near future but you know that is a risk we saw just how much that can damage them because of government policies and things like that and we also have a weak economy so if we go into a recession yeah travel takes a hit airlines are also going to take a hit so there's risk there but at these levels I just feel like I'm just about ready to start dipping my toes back in with travel stock and I think United is the top one in in my opinion Top Choice among the airlines",

    "excerpt": "okay finally guys that'll leave us now though with stock number three the highest risk of the bunch and for this one I'm actually going to go with a gaming company a very popular one in Take 2 interactive ticker symbol ttwo now when it comes to take 2 they're behind some very popular video game franchises like NBA 2K Red Dead Redemption Borderlands Lego drive and of course Grand Theft Auto which I'll come back to in just a second but on top of that take 2 also owns Zinga which they acquired a couple years ago giving them further exposure to the fast growing mobile market with also hit Legacy titles like Words With Friends Zinga poker Farmville and more and so you can see how take 2 is actually pretty well Diversified across gaming with even some pretty attractive licensing deals from entities like Game of Thrones Lord of the Rings and even Star Wars with all of that said though there's really one primary reason why I purchased this stock recently myself and that is heav to do with the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 game set to release next year and the reason for that is pretty simple is this one franchise alone has the ability to generate billions of dollars in Revenue in fact GTA 5 that one video game has already done over 85 billion doll in sales do you have any idea how big that is well I'll tell you it's literally made it the bestselling video game in history now here's where things get interesting the reason for all of that money is not actually just from unit sales but instead it's Al it's uh primarily I would say from recurring digital revenue from their GTA online mode which is also very high margin and it continues to generate massive sales year after year I actually used to play GTA online myself and I can tell you from experience just how tempting it it can be to purchase fake money within the game using your actual credit card and that's to buy cool cars and weapons and houses and so on all of this in a virtual world kind of like the metaverse right I'll come back to that in just a second too but just GTA online by itself in 2022 almost a decade after release it still generated over half a billion in Revenue that is so crazy now when we look at the stock it still hasn't even climbed since the announcement of GTA 6 in fact the stock is actually down about a quarter of its value from the top and that's despite the GTA 6 trailer just the trailer alone it was the most watched non-music video on YouTube within the first 24 hours in history in history guys the most watched video ever and that was just for the trailer that's how big this video game will probably be when it releases and again the stock it still hasn't even climbed since since that announcement as positive as all of this might seem though really looks like a screaming by from everything we've talked about right where all of the high risk really comes from though is in the already very expensive valuation it's pretty much always been this way but most recently the Ford P sits North of 60 which is extremely high it's almost like the stock is priced to Perfection at this point so if anything goes wrong with the GTA release the stock will very likely get punished but despite that there's two main reasons why I've still been a buyer myself number one is GTA that alone is projected to help their sales and profits SAR by 40% and 100% respectively on the year releases just that one game alone and by the following year it would drop their PE all the way down to less than 17 which is much more attractive you know video game stocks usually swing wildly in valuation because they depend so heavily on individual releases and they go through various ups and down uh during those periods in between but historically in the most stable years for Take 2 their PE consistently hovered north of 30 so less than 17 would actually be pretty attractive and that leads me to the second reason which is that we know that other companies and experts value these these gaming companies very highly probably because of the potential of the metaverse and just the overall future of gaming and how much value uh these games can bring to other platforms for example we saw Microsoft spend nearly $70 billion just to acquire Activision Blizzard now I do think that that's a better larger more reliable gaming company but at the time of acquisition Activision Blizzard was doing roughly the same amount in sales that take 2 does today for sure with GTA 6 they'd be at about the same levels Plus at that time Activision's market cap was over 40 billion take 2's is less than 30 billion today so I'm not saying that take 2 should also shoot up to 70 billion I do think that Microsoft overpaid a large premium there but the point is that they were willing to pay that premium because they saw that much value in the gaming company and so maybe T2 has some hidden value here as well as well that should be considered again the valuation is very high PE wise but I just think that it's worth it for that future potential",
