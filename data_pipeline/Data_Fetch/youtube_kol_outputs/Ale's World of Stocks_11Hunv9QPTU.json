    "excerpt": "what's up everyone we are back with a fresh round of stocks giant investors are buying this is where the 13f reports to the SEC get released to the public and we're then able to see what stocks the giant Rich Elites have been buying in the most recent quarter and what a better way to kick things off than with the infamous Black Rock the absolute largest asset management company in the entire world who being led by CEO Larry Fink when Black Rock Mak moves it absolutely affects the market and our favorite stocks in a big way so let's not waste any time we got to take a look here at the five largest stock purchases that they just made and I'll give you my own opinion on each one of them and I'll even rank them from best to worst to based on that opinion to make it a little more fun and interesting as well. purchase number one we have cr ticker symbol CR who Black Rock has been kind of slowly adding to over the past year but then just decided to go ham on it out of nowhere in Q2 increasing their position by over 1,000% bringing the stake up to about $2.7 billion and and yet that's still only worth 0.06% of the entire stock portfolio that's how incredibly large black rock is anyway. it really is just the type of company that you would probably expect a giant like Black Rock to invest in because of how Dependable that business can be. plus keep in mind Black Rock plays a huge role in construction and overall development to many parts around the world so I have a feeling that they're very knowledgeable about what this company does and the market they operate in so it's just kind of a no-brainer for them to be investing in it too. I do think that black rock might be betting on CR here to potentially see a surge in demand hence why they're buying up the stock so heavily or at least so much heavier uh this latest quarter. moving on to purchase number two uh we actually have another gigantic increase here with a stock that I've never covered before on the channel and that is GE vnova ticker symbol gev which Black Rock increased by over 419,000 per. I'm guessing Black Rock had some type of early stake probably from owning GE I'm guessing which gave them some gev shares you know perhaps and then uh they probably just decided to increase that position by a large amount this last quarter which I don't blame them on. to the third purchase well we actually have another Energy stock except this one is a lot heavier into oil and gas although they are investing more heavily into Renewables recently too but that is of course Exxon Mobile ticker symbol XOM which they increase their position on by adding over 30 million more shares bringing the stake up to almost $35 billion. Moving on to purchase number four though uh oh yeah easily my favorite of the entire list here that's for sure in the giant Mighty Amazon ticker symbol amzn which they added another 10 million more shares of bringing the stake up to over $125 billion and worth uh 2.8% of the entire portfolio. that is of course the mighty Microsoft ticker symbol msft which Black Rock added another nearly 8 million more shares of this past quarter bringing the stake up to nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars at over 5% of the portfolio. overall I think it's a pretty interesting quarter by Black Rock obviously we expect them to keep adding to dominant winners like Microsoft and Amazon but the heavy additions in to construction and especially energy do look interesting and I can't really fault them for any of those pickups there either even though my moves would have been a little different I think there are better Alternatives but that's just my opinion anyway.",

The results being that their financials are pretty strong with the only dips occurring during times of macroeconomic slumps that are mostly out of their control anyway like the 2020 lockdowns where so much of the world was of course forced to shut down but soon after they recovered to new record highs and are still expected to post mid singled digigit increases to revenue in each of the next two fiscal years. One concern I do have though is our high interest and mortgage rates that do tend to discourage lending and spending on big projects that would normally benefit CR however so far it hasn't really affected them as far as I can tell in a very big way. I do think that black rock might be betting on CR here to potentially see a surge in demand hence why they're buying up the stock so heavily or at least so much heavier uh this latest quarter of course a lot of this is still speculation though and I still think that a recession is not off the table for the macroeconomy so it may not be the safest stock to buy at the moment I'm personally holding off on it myself but I can see why others want to be buying it for their portfolios especially when the valuation is slightly cheaper than the sector with also a low payout ratio for their dividend that yields 1.8% despite the stock trading near a record high. I I will just say though that stock has dipped at many times in the past and for me the company really is a bit too low growth for my taste with also too low of a dividend yield to really get me excited enough to buy in near a record high stock price if it was dipping I would probably buy some but for now it's kind of a soft pass for me I'll still give it a pretty good ranking though here I'll put it in the middle at number three until we see what else is on this list. hard to rank this one though putting it up against CR but I think I'd give the slight edge here to CR just because it'd give me more exposure to or I should say any exposure to something new in my portfolio as opposed to just having another Energy stock so I'll bump them up one spot to put gev in at number three.",

I don't like the valuation though quite as much as Amazon at the moment so I'm giving Amazon the very slight edge here and keeping them at number one.",
