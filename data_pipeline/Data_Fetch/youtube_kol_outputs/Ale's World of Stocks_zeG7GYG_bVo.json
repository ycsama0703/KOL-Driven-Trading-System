EV demand has actually been a lot softer this past year given the horrible macroeconomic environment that has really even affected Tesla in many ways too. keep in mind Tesla a pure play EV maker that doesn't have that same ability actually saw a 90% decline in cash flow during the same quarter. again I still like Tesla more for other reasons and I think them going all in on EVS from the start will ultimately pay off for them over the longer term I've always said that. GM happens to have one of the most advanced AV and Robo taxi Platforms in the world with Cru who even collected more fully autonomous driving miles in California than both Tesla and even Google's wh. but what do you all think again Tesla is my favorite for different reasons I see Tesla as a more revolutionary tech company willing to think outside the box and try things that other companies are too afraid to that's why I own much more Tesla shares while GM is still just a relatively tiny position of mine in my portfolio but I also like GM stock for different reasons too as more of a value kind of Legacy player that I personally feel is doing a pretty good job of adapting to a changing Market which I also believe can support multiple players including both Tesla and GM.",

    "excerpt": "but if I was to look for either an alternative stock or even just a great complimentary stock to Tesla then I would go with General Motors sticker symbol GM and here's a few quick reasons why. reason number one for more of a traditional automaker as opposed to a revolutionary tech company like Tesla I believe GM is still doing a pretty good job of diversifying within the industry. for example GM has found success in selling several different vehicle types at various price points to meet the mass Market from really popular Crossover SUVs starting at just $20,000 to some of the best pickup trucks starting at 30,000 to even high performance luxury vehicles surpassing 100,000. they also sell various fleet vehicles at many different prices too and altogether you know GM actually posted the highest Auto Sales in America last year even surpassing other giants like Toyota Honda and more who by the way all of those tend to be cheaper in price as well uh in most cases. but GM was not only able to grow sales by a double digigit rate with all of their brands posting uh posting Positive Growth including Chevy Cadillac Buick and GMC but they were also the top selling maker of trucks full-size pickups fullsize SUVs smaller crossover SUVs and even fleet vehicles as well. and if you think that's crazy it also marked the 10th year in a row for being the bestseller of trucks and almost five Decades of topping SUV sales to that's insane. as a result they're even expanding overseas 2 which by the way includes some very important markets for EVS like China and speaking of EVS 2023 was also a record year for their EV sales as well including a 63% rise in Chevy bolt sales alone which brings me to reason number two growth potential in EVS. GM is investing heavily into this now by electrifying their already super popular SUVs and trucks including some very hyped up models like the Blazer EV The Equinox EV Sierra EV and my personal favorite the silver verado EV which in my opinion is the best looking truck I've seen to date and it also carries some of the best performance too not to mention more Niche offerings like the Hummer that can still sell pretty well considering the high price tags. there's a reason why GM is only a small position of mind while Tesla is much larger and certainly the stagnation and profit growth is a big reason for that. however GM is at least showing promising signs of improvement on this front which brings me to reason number three and that's how successful they've been at leveraging the two businesses within one to achieve profitability. in fact this was something that management heavily emphasized in their latest earnings where they not only beat EPS estimates by over 20% and grew their net income by over 24% but they also raised guidance including even a profit forecast for their EV unit by the end of this year guys that's a huge deal. GM actually invested billions of dollars into upgrading their factories like the one in Tennessee so that they can now produce both electric vehicles and Ice vehicles on on the same assembly line which allows them to either scale up or scale down EV production depending on customer demand in the market. and as a result operating cash flow actually Rose by over 60% last quarter and again even their EVS will be profitable thanks to more strategic production. but on top of that GM was also able to reduce the price of their Cadillac lyri EV by $112,000 which is already their second bestselling Cadillac even among regular ice vehicles and their new Chevy Equinox EV will will start selling this year for around $35,000 to reach the mass Market. my only Point here about GM is that as a legacy player there at least handling the transition much better than other players that I've seen in the market and they're showing an ability here to make adjustments when necessary to keep the company operating efficiently which is why they're still so profitable and even have the ability to not only pay a small dividend but more importantly buy back giant amounts of stock. in fact at the end of last year they announced not just a huge 33% increase to their dividend but also a record-breaking $10 billion stock buyback which which equates to around a fifth of all outstanding shares how crazy is that. and yet despite all of these improvements and positive news the stock is actually still Dirt Cheap which is reason number four as it is still down about a quarter of its value from the top with a PE ratio of less than five that's 70% cheaper than the sector median and even 63% cheaper than their own 5year average too. GM happens to have one of the most advanced AV and Robo taxi Platforms in the world with Cru who even collected more fully autonomous driving miles in California than both Tesla and even Google's wh. but what do you all think again Tesla is my favorite for different reasons I see Tesla as a more revolutionary tech company willing to think outside the box and try things that other companies are too afraid to that's why I own much more Tesla shares while GM is still just a relatively tiny position of mine in my portfolio but I also like GM stock for different reasons too as more of a value kind of Legacy player that I personally feel is doing a pretty good job of adapting to a changing Market which I also believe can support multiple players including both Tesla and GM.",
