    "excerpt": "Let's start with first a relatively lower risk option which is not going to be easy to find one of these at also a decade low but I do feel that Disney ticker symbol dis uh might fit the bill here as probably the most obvious choice that we could look to as they've not only only Fallen close to 20% in the past 3 months but they've lost now over half of their entire value from the top leaving them at also one of the lowest prices of the past decade and that's pretty wild for what is arguably the biggest media and entertainment Giant in the world now there are of course several reasons for why the stock has fallen by so much including Rising competition and streaming along with heavy losses from all the investment into that there was also the pandemic that closed theme parks and resulted in less movie theater traffic something that continues to this day as people just generally don't go out to movie theaters as often anymore which by the way that also took a toll from the riter strike that delayed things even further for new movies and shows and at the same time many of those new movies and shows have actually received customer backlash for not being as high quality which is especially the case in Marvel and Star Wars at least for me personally I'm a big Marvel and Star Wars fan and yeah I haven't really liked what's been coming out from them lately for example the Marvel's was literally the worst performing Marvel movie of all time while the new acolyte Star Wars show on Disney plus has a terrible 177% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes but my argument in favor of Disney stock I guess you know putting those issues aside well not necessarily putting them aside but the fact that we're just not going to really be able to get a deal like this for a Powerhouse company like Disney trading at a decade low if it didn't have some of those serious issues and so my investment thesis is to buy the stock now while it is down in hopes of a rebound recovery which at these prices I do think is possible and here's why first of all the stock is trading 22% lower than the sector on a p basis and over 67% lower than their own 5-year average that is dirt for what is still a box office leader with also by far the most theme park attendance nine out of the top 12 in the entire world and it's also about tied with Amazon and Netflix as the largest subscription video streaming platform now too and while content has been severely lacking you don't have to tell me I've been a big critic myself but you know we have had a couple of new moves that are leaving me feeling a little more optimistic than I have been recently uh about their future notably the new Deadpool movie that not only became one of the bestselling Marvel movies of all time upon release but it's also shattered records for having the best opening weekend of any R-rated movie ever at close to double the amount of the previous record holder which oh by the way was actually another Deadpool movie too and I think this momentum may continue into the coming years as we just saw in ComicCon that Robert Downey Jr will be coming back to the MCU as the next Dr Doom and that's pretty freaking cool now I know that there are many people out there saying that this is kind of a cheap way of Disney you know kind of getting themselves out of the hole by just bringing back older actors and characters that everyone loved but I couldn't care less I think that if it sells go ahead and do it and I'm a fan of it I want this is actually you know I think that they used to have much higher quality the storytelling was way better back in the older movies and stuff that they used to do with Marvel and Star Wars so if you start to bring some of that back I think it's a good thing so I'm all for it and look hopefully they just give the audience more of what they really want moving forward and that's what I'm hoping for now in the meantime though I just think the stock is too cheap to ignore and I continue to buy uh it at these levels anywhere really less than $100 I think is a great price for Disney stock long term and especially you know 90 or below that I think it's even more attractive.",

    "excerpt": "Okay moving on to stock number two though what we're going be increasing the risk a little bit uh for the medium risk option here but we're also again staying near a decade low price and for this one I'm going to go with the Telecom giant Verizon ticker symbol VZ who has now seen their stock price Fall by over 20% in the past 10 years while also being down about 35% from the very top and look normally I wouldn't consider Verizon to be all that risky as they do operate in a pretty stable basically cash cow type of Market in Telecom that isn't likely to go away anytime soon as a number of people using smartphones and internet continues to grow around the world every day and is not only the number one market share leader of Wireless at close to 40% of the US market but also the largest quality Awards winner at over three decades in a row nobody even coming close to that I just think Verizon is unmatched by any rival with even their two biggest in AT&T and T-Mobile essentially just making up the rest of a triopoly market Market that isn't likely to get broken apart anytime soon either given how much money they've had to spend in building up the largest infrastructure and communication Technologies imaginable that aren't easy to duplicate I mean we're essentially talking about here hundreds of billions of dollars being invested into these things maybe even trillions if we go back to the Inception of these companies so that's just not going to be an easy Market to break into now if you're a newer competitor however that's also where the risk comes in because of all of that enormous spending uh especially recently in areas of 5G and fiber which along with some other mistakes and failed business mures that have left these companies with massive debt I mean a great example I have to point to is AT&T their acquisition history of like Direct TV and Time Warner just leaving them with so much massive debt but Verizon is no different they currently hold over $137 billion dollars of long-term debt which is absolutely massive especially given our high interest rate environment and that makes servicing all of that debt even more expensive now that has at least been coming down a little these past couple years so you can see that they are at least starting to make some progress on it coming off of the huge 5G Investments but at these levels it's still a very concerning amount that could lead to less cash for them to be able to invest back into R&D or to pay out their mouthwatering dividend which is really the most attractive feature of a stock like this since uh you know you're not going to really get much growth out of a company like this instead you're you're really just taking it for the value and the income but Verizon absolutely has that as the dividend now yields well over 6 and a half% one of the highest levels in their entire history while the stock is also 30 to 50% cheaper than the sector despite again them being a market leader and for as bad as that debt is I do at least think that the dividend is sustainable while also being able for them to pay back debt for example we just saw in their most recent earnings that uh through the first half of this year Capital expenditures fell by a couple billion dollars thanks to not having to invest so heavily into 5G anymore while operating Cash Flow came in at 16.6 billion enough to cover the 8.1 billion of capex leaving behind 8.5 billion in free cash flow which was also up half a billion and that easily covers the 5.6 billion in dividends which altogether leaves about $3 billion left over for paying down debt so at the moment at least it does look sustainable to me to a certain degree and the hope is that you know interest rates start coming down at some point they have to right putting even less pressure on them going forward and that makes the dividend uh a bit safer longer term at least that's the hope of course if things get worse and the dividend has to get cut yeah we get screwed as investors so there is significant risk from from that point of view but I just think at these levels it's kind of worth the tradeoff so I kind of see it as like a medium risk at the moment.",

    "excerpt": "but finally that'll leave us now with stock number three oh boy we got a special one for this one this is going to be the highest risk of the bunch and this is again another one that is trading near a decade low but I'm actually going to go with a stock here that just recently crashed into the ground this past week coming off of horrible earnings but hey if you want an extremely low price with turnaround potential well that means you're going to have to take on some heavy damage here and some high risk there's no easy way around that so my pick is going to be for that category the chips giant Intel ticker symbol INTC who I can really summarize their entire story and the turnaround potential too uh and kind of the investment thesis behind it with a couple of points now first of all we all know that processing ships will only become more important over time globally as the world becomes more digital and technologically advanced so the case for really any chip stock uh I think starts right there in that there is plenty of long-term potential for anyone in that space however what used to be a very dominant player in Intel has now really seeded tremendous ground to Rivals like Nvidia and AMD who went all in on discret gpus that have skyrocketed in popularity and demand thanks to how useful they are especially in areas of artificial intelligence and cloud computing which of course have been on the rise and popularity has been soaring to Which Intel instead focused primarily on CPUs and apus that haven't really proven themselves to be nearly as capable for those specific tasks and because of that plus a number of other blunders and screw-ups from management along with them also being their own manufacturer and that led to countless product mistakes and delays well the three stocks have performed very differently over the past decade in fact you look back a decade ago and intel was actually much larger than both of those two Rivals combined with a market cap that was more than 12 times larger so you take AMD and Nvidia combine them as one company and you make 12 of those and it would still have not been worth as much as what intel was at that time that's how important and dominant Intel used to be and yet you look at the way their stocks have performed and you see a complete reversal now over the past 10 years AMD stock has skyrocketed by over 3,000% Nvidia has also skyrocketed but by over 21,000% absolutely insane and yet Intel well it's actually down about 40% during that time leaving it now at literally the lowest price of the past decade while also losing over 67% of its entire value from the top after falling by over 30% just this past week alone on horrible earnings which by the way shows it those earnings show that the issues are continuing to linger on even to this day and until continues to struggle uh in adapting really to this evolving market now I will go deeper into those earnings in tomorrow's video because I'll be doing my weekly recap for several earnings reports of the week so if you want to learn more about it look out for that video tomorrow but for now the point is that this once giant and very dominant company has now lost ground with even AMD stealing lots of market share from their bread and butter CPU business too and yet I still think that they can turn things around and I really have like three specific reasons for why I feel that way number one they're still a market leader of CPUs and apus which are not going away and will actually continue to grow in demand with the rise of new AI featured computers and laptops especially going into the second half of this year people returning back to school and all that that kind of stuff so I think you could have a recovery start to take place there start to show up more prominently at that time but what is much more important than that is the fact that Intel is now finally fighting back against AMD and Nvidia on AI with not just their high power CPUs but also by now making discrete gpus too as well as most importantly a new type of Chip called an AI accelerator this is a specifically designed chip for AI workloads and it's already showing a ton of prom on not just performance but even price which is important for competing against Nvidia given the stronghold that they have over that market if you want to be able to break in and start to steal some market share well you're going to have to at least compete with them on price because you may not be able to beat them on performance but you know even there I mean this report here coming from forb says Intel's gouty 3 is reportedly showing a 50% and 40% Improvement on inference and power efficiency over nvidia's h100 AI processor which have been very popular but it's doing it at a fraction of the cost and guys that's a very big deal uh you know they're aiming to ramp up availability for G 3 here in the third quarter moving over to the second half of this year going into the future if this starts to perform well and they can build off of a little just a little bit of momentum there could really help them turn turn things around for Intel and look they don't have to overtake Nvidia I don't think they'll ever even get close at this point but they just need to start competing you just got got to start putting stuff out there that can actually compete whatever it is compete a little bit on price compete a little bit on performance whatever it is give companies an alternative and that can really start to help you longer term reason number two though chip production is outsourced by both AMD and Nvidia overseas and while that has had huge advantages over the past decade I believe that the future will uh you know it might play out a little differently with America and other Western countries wanting more manufacturing independence from Asia which bods extremely well for Intel who not only builds chips in America but even in Europe too and they've been expanding a little bit too uh and with America providing giant subsidies and tax incentives to the tune of tens of billions of dollars probably could end up being hundreds long term I mean it's massive like the amount that they're going to spend on this and when you also calculate in the tax incentives it's a giant amount of money well I think Intel sense to benefit greatly from that financial support and Rising demand it will take years to materialize you're not going to see it right away and I think that's why the stock is still getting punished today because it's not really being factored in but longer term it could help them rebound a little and lastly my last point I just think Intel stock is so dirt cheap at this point I mean I feel like I might as well just take the gamble on it with the market cap only being worth less than a 100 billion today that's less than half that of amds while Nvidia is north of $2.5 trillion and meanwhile Intel's PEG ratio is also 70% lower than the sector despite again still being a leader in in certain cases so I just think it's worth the bet at that price um even if it is high-risk but you know I I would only make a small treat it as a small risky bet but I like it for that and all three stocks that I talked about today I'm buying all of them at these levels cuz I just think they look attractive here but again you have to consider the risk.",
