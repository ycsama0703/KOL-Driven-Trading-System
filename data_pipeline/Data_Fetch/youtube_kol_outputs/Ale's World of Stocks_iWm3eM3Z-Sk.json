    "excerpt": "coming in at stock number one the smallest of the bunch that's actually not going to be a very speculative one at all in fact it's one of my absolute favorite stocks in the market and that is paler technology secet symbol pltr which by the way Kathy was one of the first mainstream investors to really push paler and she's mostly been a major bull ever since with this past month adding another close to 200,000 shares with over 5 million now the thing I love most about paler well it's really two things in particular it's their future potential and they already very strong performance as they continue to work uh their way towards that future potential see we all know that AI is very likely going to dominate the future and virtually everything we do and it'll be worth trillions of dollars across all markets and sectors but the most crucial aspect of that I believe is in its ability to take massive amounts of data and process it all to find Solutions that's pretty much at the core of what AI is and what it does well pal here being an AI data manage management specialist well that's exactly what they offer and it's why they get so heavily selected by both government and Military entities as well as also commercial businesses all of which rely on paler to help them run better faster and more efficiently now on the government side for example last quarter the Army awarded them $179 million for their Titan platform to be used in the Army's first AI defined vehicles for deep sensing targeting and Mission command both on and off the battlefield and with commercial they've actually been holding these uh like thousands of these really popular AI boot camps to show companies how they can use paler AI to run more efficiently with Lowe's for example praising them for now running much faster and smarter uh and General Mills also applied it to just a small piece of their Network and yet it's already saving them $14 million annually and that's why you see so much demand for them despite what has really been a horrible macroeconomy where you would think that all of these entities would cut back on spending but because paler actually improves their operations well they actually benefit from hiring them rather than cutting costs and avoiding them and so because of that you saw almost 70% growth in their us commercial customer account over the past year which is why you also see their profit soaring now for what used to be a stock that was heavily criticized for their losses but now you see Revenue still climbing by over 20% while their profit by EPS is surging by over 80% expected on average over the next 5 years which is also why you see their valuation now dropped to less than a 2 PEG ratio that is also lower than the sector median and that's despite the stock actually soaring by over 55% this year look I'm not saying that it's a cheap stock to Own by any means but overall I think it's a very strong play on AI data management for the long term and because I also own it myself too it's going to get a pretty high ranking here at number two for now until we see what else is on this list",

    "company": "Intellia Therapeutics",
    "excerpt": "all right going back to the list here coming in at stock purchase number two we have intellia therapeutic SEC symbol ntla which Kathy purchased over $122 million of this past month and yeah if you know anything about Kathy you know just how much she loves her biotechs with intellio being no exception as this to has been one of her longest Holdings that she's been building up for years and is in my opinion actually a pretty good play on the future of Gene editing with their development of crisper treatments cuz look with most Gene editing companies you have to settle for programs that are still in very early stages of development but rather intellia is quite a bit ahead of the pack as their ntla 2001 program was actually the very first inv Vio crisper therapy to receive FDA clearance for late stage clinical trials now it is still in phase three at the moment but this and a few other therapies they have could be giant Blockbuster treatments for the company as they aim to fix several diseases that currently have no cure available ntla 2002 for example just finished up a recent trial that showed extremely positive results it was done on 10 patients who suffer from Hae where the body randomly experiences uncontrollable swelling that not only causes sever pain but can even lead to death but the study showed that intellus treatment practically cured eight out of the 10 patients who've now experienced zero new attacks more than 18 months after treatment and of the two that still had swelling episodes while their number of attacks was still reduced by around 97% with no severe attacks following the treatment either and by the way how many times do you see new drugs and treatments having horrible side effects well this one had zero severe side effects reported that's pretty crazy definitely looks like a breakthrough here and as such intellia is planning to commence phase three trials in the second half of this year now look it's it's impossible really to perfectly guess where all of this is going to lead from here as a company will continue to bleed money on the bottom line until these products can be you know commercialized but once that happens the future could be very bright as most experts predict that the gene editing Market will be worth tens of billions of dollars in the near future so considering Natalia's stock price has now crashed by over 80% from their highs that they saw during the pandemic bubble of you know biotechs really surging to new record highs at that time well now might be a time worth taking a closer look here at intellia as even analysts are giving it an average price target of more than three times the level it currently trades for today it's obviously nowhere near near as safe as paler but for a very speculative play on the future of Gene editing I think intellia is one of the best options out there so I'm giving it the number three ranking for now",

    "company": "PagerDuty",
    "excerpt": "all right moving on to purchase number three though we have a bit more of a wellestablished company here in pager Duty ticker symbol PD which Kathy purchased over 17 million more dollars of and if you've never heard of this one they're basically a cloud-based AI software company that helps solve two important issues issues for other companies one is in helping them consolidate software and automate their work using AI to achieve faster task completions while also reducing costs which they advertise can be as high as 99% and 50% respectively and the other part of it is in their incident response platform that reduces website downtimes whenever a company runs into issues for example their apps and tools can help monitor online operations 24/7 making it easier for employees to report any issues they come across to the appropriate it departments so that they can quickly be fixed and help reduce any downtime sometimes by as much as 75% anyway these services are in such high demand especially as the world becomes more digital and technologically advanced that pag your duty is now being used by over 25,000 companies around the world and financially sales have risen consistently every year because of it but like most cathywood stocks this is another one here that bleeds heavily on the bottom line with even their revenue growth slowing down recently too causing further concern dropping from over 40% growth in 2019 to now only being in the low single teens going forward as a result the stock price has also lost more than half its value since iping in 2019 and because of it pager Duty has turned to large layoffs and cost cutting initiatives to help them get closer to profitability as soon as possible before the damage gets worse which if it all goes well it could get their valuation down to a 22 fordp ratio based on 2026 adjusted earnings estimates from analyst which I admit that would be attractive if it weren't for having to look out all the way to 2026 in the meantime it therefore remains an interesting but still pretty high-risk speculative stock that while I grant you is probably safer than intellia it also likely has a lower ceiling in terms of future potential so I'm still giving intellia the slight edge here just seems a little more exciting to me if I am going to have to invest in a spec one here and uh because of that I'll rank PD just right below them at number four",

    "company": "Roku",
    "excerpt": "all right guys that'll leave us now though with the final two stocks of the list these are the two largest purchases and coming in as the second largest of the bunch well we actually have a media and streaming services leader in Roku ticker symbol rku which Kathy picked up over1 18 million dollars of as well now this one you know surprisingly I kind of get a lot of comments or a surprising amount of comments on it once in a while it seems like a bit of a popular stock out there but I just don't really understand what people see in it now granted I will give you that the price has fallen by over 30% this year and whopping 86% from their pandemic highs so maybe seeing it as a turnaround play worth betting on you know I can kind of understand that but what I don't really get is if anyone is kind of looking at this as a reliable long-term investment for getting exposure to their specific business which of course inv involves video streaming an operating system for TVs Smart TVs and streaming Hardware too but the thing is guys I can get that type of exposure from a number of much larger safer more profitable and way more Diversified companies like Disney Amazon apple or even Google so I don't really see what makes Roku so special other than the stock price having fallen by so much which even there I mean you're still talking about a pretty rich valuation as the company continues to struggle with profitability So based on sales their PS ratio is still almost 100% higher than the sector even after the crash now that revenue is at least growing by a double digit rate but at only around 12% that's not nearly enough growth to Warrant the 100% premium over the competition and look maybe the company will start generating huge profits soon that make all of this irrelevant but number one we haven't seen that yet and number two there's giant competition in the space from bigger players that can potentially do do exactly what Roku does if they really wanted to and some already do like with Fire TV and so on so while it may not be a horrible stock at these low levels it's just not compelling enough of a stock for me to get very excited about so I'm actually going to give it the last place ranking at number five because I just think that there's such obvious better choices uh within their same Market",

    "company": "Recursion Pharmaceuticals",
    "excerpt": "Okay with that said though the last stock of the list is actually one that I'm very interested in and that is the biotech recursion pharmaceutical SEC symbol rxrx which Kathy picked up another $23 million of this past month now what I like about recursion is that they use artificial intelligence to not only discover new drugs and treatments but also to help lower costs and reduce the time it takes to research identify and develop them too all of which could be huge in the future and while their own in-house treatments are still working through trials and Regulatory approval the te technology has been so impressive that it's already landed them investment and partnership deals with pharmaceutical powerhouses like Ro and bear as well as even the redot AI leader Nvidia unfortunately though this is another Kathy Wood stock here that loses more money on the bottom line than they even generate in sales but after striking a deal with Tempest recursion now has over 50 pedabytes of health related data fueling their AI platform along with their new supercomputer built in partnership with with Nvidia that is now considered the most powerful one to ever be owned by a biotech in the entire world and so given that the stock has already lost close to 80% of its value since the 2021 IPO I actually think that it's one worth considering if you're looking for a speculative stock with you know a lot of long-term potential now I don't own it myself yet but I'm probably going to buy a very small amount of it soon maybe even this week just to kind of dip my toes in it get a little bit of exposure for my myself and because of that I'm going to give it the number two ranking on this list which will bump paler up one spot to fit it in",
