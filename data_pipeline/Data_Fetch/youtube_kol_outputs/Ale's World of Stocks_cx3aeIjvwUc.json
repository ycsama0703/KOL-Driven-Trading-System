As we usually do with famous investors and giant hedge funds today today we'll be looking at the five largest purchases that they they made during that quarter which theoretically may have been the final purchases that Simons had some oversight of although all of his uh strategies and of course algorithms will continue to be used well into the future either way by Renaissance Technologies of course we've done these videos several times in the past for Simon trades so it is uh pretty sad to now have this be kind of the final time that we'll be able to do this for Simon and I for Simons and I do just want to say that of course our thoughts and prayers go out to both Simons and of course all of his family and friends with that said we'll run through the five largest of these purchases I'll give you my own opinion on each one and as always I'll even rank them from best to worst two based on my opinion as well okay so let's go ahead and jump straight into it now we'll be sorting these purchases here from smallest to largest weight in the portfolio with purchase number one being the ultra popular video streamer Netflix sticker symbol nflx which was a new edition in the quarter for Renaissance picking up over 180 million worth. Renaissance does tend to trade in and out of stocks a lot more frequently though than others because of the algorithms that they use so they're not my favorite hedge fund to kind of track but if they were to be um looking at these as more kind of longer term investments I think they're all pretty reliable businesses here Netflix is the only one that I think I'd be a little worried about heavy competition in the future but the others I think look pretty solid.\",",

And then Netflix at the bottom not a bad group of stocks though I must say very heavy on Tech but I like Tech so it's fine with me Renaissance does tend to trade in and out of stocks a lot more frequently though than others because of the algorithms that they use so they're not my favorite hedge fund to kind of track but if they were to be um looking at these as more kind of longer term investments I think they're all pretty reliable businesses here Netflix is the only one that I think I'd be a little worried about heavy competition in the future but the others I think look pretty solid.\",",

Moving on to purchase number four well we have apple ticker symb ticker symbol AAP which they increased their position on by over 300% after actually selling in a few of the quarters prior now this one does look a little surprising to me because uh well I actually just put out a video yesterday showing how Warren Buffett and Ray Doo have actually been selling Apple stock and my theory is that they probably did this because of just how much the stock has climbed recently it's not only at a record high but it's literally the most highly valued company in the entire world at over a $3.4 trillion market cap leaving their PEG ratio more than 100% higher than the sector so it is a very expensive stock and look don't get me wrong I do think that Apple has an amazing business with insane financials a very sticky ecosystem of products and services and even some future growth potential too with integrating things like AI into their products and services or even launching some folding or flipping phon as well that could convince uh consumers to upgrade but I just feel that the price is just too high right now to where I can actually understand why some other giant hedge funds have instead elected to sell the stock and lock in those profits instead of buying it especially when growth is so limited at their already massive size and we've seen that in their iPhone sales stalling out and overall sales for the company actually falling last year and only expected to grow by 3% this year as well which is pretty darn low as for me I do own a small amount myself but I'm just holding it longterm I don't want to buy any more at these really high prices but I also don't want to sell because of how incredibly strong and profitable and how much cash they have how strong the business is and how much cash they have as far as ranking it goes though I think I'd put them just barely behind Qualcomm at number two just because the upside potential I feel is so limited already here at these prices with apple uh if the stock was a little lower there low lower though I would for sure put them ahead of them.

I kind of feel like Qualcomm would just give me a a little bit of like I said before exposure into a subdivision that perhaps I'm not already overly exposed to which is the smartphone chips market and for that reason I guess I got to give the slight edge here to Qualcomm so I will bump them up to number one so I can fit AMD right behind them at number two but again both stocks look pretty good to me overall. I could see the argument for why Qualcomm would you know perhaps deliver better returns at the at that cheaper valuation if they perform well right if they execute and perform well perhaps there's more upside potential but yeah overall I think I would stick with my rankings here with Broadcom at number one followed by Qual then Apple then AMD and then Netflix at the bottom not a bad group of stocks though I must say very heavy on Tech but I like Tech so it's fine with me.\",",

When it comes to AMD well there I feel like you're really talking about the cheaper alternative to Nvidia not just in stock price but as an actual business model too they are a cheaper alternative really to both Nvidia and I would say Intel in the GPU and CPU markets I think that's a very um compelling proposition for their business too and I think that that's just a great spot to be in where they can have a lot of success now I'm personally comfortable with what I have already in Nvidia and Intel but am is very attractive too and I've owned it in the past and I've made some huge gains on it it used to be one of my biggest stocks I made a lot of profit on it and I'd even be willing to buy back again in the future too but as it stands you know the stock is up over 3600% over the past 10 years uh but more recently it did actually dip by over 27% so you know a little bit of a mixed bag there financially they saw explosive growth during the pandemic before pulling back last year but seemed to now be back into recovery mode with sales expected to Rise by over 12% this year before accelerating to over 28% the year after too and EPS is even better Rising by over 30% on average which is why their peeg ratio is actually still cheaper than the sector despite that really strong performing stock price look if I was an outsider looking in with no stocks in my portfolio I would probably choose AMD over qualcom as perhaps the better long-term investment but because I already own so many chip stocks as it is is I kind of feel like Qualcomm would just give me a a little bit of like I said before exposure into a subdivision that perhaps I'm not already overly exposed to which is the smartphone chips market and for that reason I guess I got to give the slight edge here to Qualcomm so I will bump them up to number one so I can fit AMD right behind them at number two but again both stocks look pretty good to me overall.
