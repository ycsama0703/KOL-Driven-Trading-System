    "excerpt": "hey what's up everyone my name is all welcome back to my world of stocks in today's video I actually want to introduce a new series to the channel you guys will have to tell me if you like it if it gets a lot of likes or positive feedback then I'll definitely do more of these in the future but basically I thought it'd be fun to do a bear versus bull type of video where I cover five quick kind of Rapid Fire points about a stock from the perspective of a bear and then I try to either counter them or present new points from the perspect perspective of a bull now for this first episode I chose Tesla since that is really one of the most divisive stocks out there these days and because I actually own the stock myself I'm going to try to counter the five negative points from the bear attack which will be as follows number one the valuation number two the business number three the macroeconomy number four Rising competition and number five Elon Musk now I know some of this may sound a little confusing but hopefully the structure will make more sense as we work our way through the video so let's go ahead and jump into it we'll start with the bare arguments first and then I'll try to counter them as a bull and I'll finish up with my overall kind of personal conclusion and opinion on all of this so uh let's go ahead and just jump straight into it starting as the bear first Tesla bear let's go through this list at number one we have of course the valuation which should be pretty easy to argue as the bear since Tesla is one of the most most expensive automakers in the entire market with the stock price having risen Now by well over 1,000% in just the past 5 years alone leaving behind an extremely rich PE ratio that is over 400% higher than their peers within the sector which brings me to point number two that their business just isn't really good enough for that high of a price tag yes Tesla has done a good job of innovating and really no one is denying the role that they've played and bringing Lots of attention over to EVS but as the industry transitions over from gas powerered cars over to electric ones well the mass Market will require cheaper vehicles that they can actually afford but as of last year the range in price for a Tesla vehicle was between $40,000 and $133,000 even at the low end of that it's still Out Of Reach for the majority of consumers in this challenging economic environment which as a result of this and other issues Tesla's Revenue growth has now fallen in each of the past few years dropping from 71% growth in 2021 to only 1% expected this year for a stock trading over 400% higher than the sector that flat performance just ain't going to cut it especially in this challenging environment which is point number three the macroeconomy that's been plagued by Rising interest rates and crippling inflation that continue to weigh on consumers while also raising the risk of re recession and you can find study after study showing how Americans are struggling with this current situation in fact Elon Musk himself has admitted multiple times that if conditions don't improve customers will not be able to afford their higher priced EVs and he's therefore had to resort to numerous price cuts that are not only hurting their revenue growth but are also weakening their margins all of which has made even worse in the face of rising competition Point number four where Legacy players and even new startups are spending many billions of dollars on their own EV lineups too making the landscape even more competitive especially from China where four of the top 10 largest ev companies by global market share are now actually chines and in recent statements Elon has pointed to this growing threat of lower price EVS stemming from cheap labor in China saying quote frankly I think if there are no trade barriers established they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world and speaking of Elon Musk well that's Point number five in that the outspoken CEO is notorious for making giant promises that he can't deliver on within the timeline he usually gives whether that's in building new factories releasing a cheaper vehicle a robo taxi service you know fully autonomous driving the big Tesla semi the Speedy Roadster or even a humanlike robot many of those projects were supposed to be in full production some of them years ago but have still yet to come to full fruition and more recently Elon has tackled even more new Ventures like the giant Twitter acquisition with the fear being that all of it could become a distraction for the CEO at a time when Tesla requires his full undivided attention the most okay now as a Tesla shareholder that first half of the video was a little hard to sit through without giving any counterarguments so it's time now to give the bull perspective on each one of those points all right now it's time to give you guys the bullish perspective on these Five Points so let's go through them one by one okay now when looking at the valuation side well I grant you this is probably the hardest one to argue here in fact it's probably the only one that I might actually have to concede since I really always felt that Tesla is a very expensive stock but as a shareholder myself that was never really my focus instead I just felt that the business uh and their future potential was worth the high price tag which by the way as expensive as Tesla is that price has at least Fallen quite a lot from the top losing about half its value these past couple years which is why their PE ratio is also close to half what its 5-year average was too but again it's still very high so the real question is whether or not that's worth it for the business well while the Bears love to highlight the Slowdown and growth the fact is that Tesla has actually done a pretty good job of putting up any kind of growth at all during what has been some of the most challenging macroeconomic years in history with even next year analysts still expecting a large Rebound in Revenue growth up to 18% which is in large part thanks to their upcoming cheaper Mass Market vehicle and the eventual roll out of a robo taxi service you know probably a little further down the line both of which though could perform very well even during this challenging macroeconomic environment which was Point number three of course and the most recent updates we have on that is that we have an upcoming Robo taxi day in August as well as a new compact crossover uh Tesla vehicle costing around $25,000 for the mass Market which should be starting production in mid 2025 with initial planned production of 10,000 units per week look guys even if the economy gets worse a robo taxi service can actually generate additional income for Tesla owners while Tesla themselves get to collect a fee from every ride which could not only send Rivals like uber and lift out of business but the added savings and income generation could be a huge benefit to struggling consumers during that weak economy while also helping boost Tesla's profitability from software like margins in autonomous driving in fact that's really one of the biggest reasons why large Tesla shareholders like Kathy Wood or Ron Baron still hold price Targets on the stock that are many times higher than where it trades today even with the highp ratio that's because of the idea that uh you know those future profits from the software like margins are just going to be so gigantically higher that uh you know it's something that we can't really factor in to today's valuation but over time it would bring that valuation way down and the stock price could actually be worth quite a bit more if everything uh you know goes according to plan and of course just kind of sticking with the economy here for a second the cheaper Mass Market vehicle would also likely do likely do just as well well in that environment given how expensive EVS have become with most Legacy Rivals really nowhere close to that type of price tag that you know Tesla is aiming for with also the superior performance and features that you would typically get in a Tesla which brings us over to the the other point in competition Rising competition again my biggest worry is not domestic Rivals but rather those coming from China which I continue to feel is a huge threat to Tesla but even there we're now seeing huge progress being made on that front too through the implementation of new tariffs just like Elon asked for in fact recently America nearly quadrupled their tariffs on EVs and other related Goods coming from China that will likely level the plane field while also providing a huge boost to Tesla as well plus Tesla continues to innovate which is something that their legacy Rivals have really always been very complacent about whether it's expanding into Logistics with the semi in energy with battery storage even robotics with the Tesla bot and of course AI with autonomous driving Guys these markets could be worth trillions of dollars in the future some already are and it's the main reason why I still believe in Tesla's future even for that rich stock price that it currently trades for today and finally for Point number five when it comes to Elon Musk look I grant you that he sometimes overpromises and under underd delivers on timelines but the guy has been pushing the boundaries from day one trying to transform some of the biggest industries out there while again the competition has been largely complacent and just kind of sticking to the status quo and look I'm not saying that he's perfect or the best CEO that we could have but I still prefer him over just about any rival CEO out there that I know would not have gotten us anywhere near where we are today in terms of Tesla the business and Tesla the stock so I'd much rather keep him than never lose him without Elon Musk I'd be much less confident about Tesla's future Ambitions and even with the you know distractions and like the Twitter acquisition look guys some of those things could actually benefit Tesla in the future too when when I think about the Twitter acquisition I just see lots of integration there in terms of advertising probably free advertising or very cheap advertising for Tesla and that's something to get excited about as well too so there there could actually be synergies even with all the different things that Elon is doing outside of Tesla that you know the Bears think of as distractions I think in the long run could create an ecosystem of different synergies within the different businesses that he owns so overall I'm still very bullish on Tesla and look those are just my opinions though I could be wrong but that's how I feel about it and that's why I continue to stay invested in the stock but I'd love to hear what you all have to say Down Below in the comment section are you a bear are you a bull are you somewhere in the middle I'd love to hear your thoughts do you own the stock let me know down there and what other stock would you like to see a video like this for in the future a bear versus bull let me know what stocks like me to do that on uh down there in the comment section but thanks again for stopping by my friends thank you for all your support I hope you enjoyed the video hope you're all doing well I'll catch you in the next one take care everybody bye-bye",
