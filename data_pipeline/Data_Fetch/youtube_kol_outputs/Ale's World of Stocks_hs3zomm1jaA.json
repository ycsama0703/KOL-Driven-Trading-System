    "excerpt": "so one of uh Warren Buffett's most famous quotes is of course to be fearful when others are greedy and to also be greedy when others are fearful well with the stock market still surging up to a new record high this year despite the economy being in really bad shape it looks like Buffett is following the former of that strategy being fearful when others are greedy as last quarter his company Berkshire Hathaway only made a few small pickups in the market while actually selling much more more and so in today's video we'll be running through two stocks that he purchased as well as three stocks that he actually sold and they were some very large sales at that so you're not going to want to miss that part it's pretty interest interesting stuff whenever I look at the moves by by Warren Buffett especially more lately more so uh recently I just feel like he's perhaps a little too stuck in the past thinking that some of these Legacy players can bring back their old magic whereas instead I think him and Brookshire haway would be much better served investing a little more in some perhaps more exciting companies like Google or Microsoft Nvidia paler stuff like that even Sofi you know a financial company but kind of a fintech just companies that are innovating in some way I think would serve them a little better because uh when you avoid those and instead Focus so much on just kind of heavily beaten down stocks like these well you end up having to sell out of some of those positions when you just can't really make too much of a profit from them and of course we're starting to see some of that we saw that with like HP for example and a Paramount too and uh part of that might be because you know they never really believed in those companies in the first place but were perhaps just kind of chasing value which I can understand don't get me wrong but I think as long-term investors we're better served with a combination of both value and growth potential so I would do things maybe a little different anyway that's just my opinion and of course this is just a short YouTube video that we're only running through a few stocks here if we actually looked at all of Warren Buffett's stocks we'd see some amazing amazingly strong performing Holdings that he has so maybe this is a little bit of a unfair analysis here that I'm doing but uh regardless I just kind of wanted to share some thoughts with you anyway",

    "company": "Chub Limited",
    "excerpt": "let's start with the two purchases first and this one here was actually a brand new edition that they just started buying two quarters ago in chub limited ticker symbol CB which they now increase by another close to 30% in the first quarter of this year bringing the stake up to nearly 7 billion do and worth over 2% of the overall portfolio now when it comes to chub this is actually one of the largest insurance companies in the world with operations in over 50 countries and it's also the largest publicly traded insurance company as well it's also pretty well Diversified across commercial and personal property casualty accidents health insurance reinsurance and even life insurance too all of which makes it an ideal stock for Warren Buffett as the man has you know really always been drawn to insurance companies for their relatively stable financials and strong cash flows with chub being no exception doing a record almost 50 billion in sales and 10 billion of pure net income Profit just last year alone and even their growth is pretty good too considering their already massive size with sales expected to rise by a mid to high single digit in each of the next two years the strong performance has also allowed them to pay a pretty nice little dividend that you know while I grant you is pretty small at just under a 1.4% yield it at least has a ton of room to grow in the future with only a 16% payout ratio unfortunately for me though the stock has already risen to a record high leaving the valuation a bit higher than the sector at current levels I also think the business is a little too boring for my personal taste however I do think that it's a solid option for most investors as business will likely never go under given the massive Insurance Market that is already worth many trillions of dollars and continues to rise every single year insurance is just something that I think will always be needed and I also like how insurers are able to benefit from essentially interest free loans because of the Gap in time from when premiums are collected to when they need to pay out those claims which helps them grow their cash invest in other assets like bonds and stocks and of course pay out some pretty attractive dividends too so I can see why Buffett likes this one and I'll rank it fairly high for now at number two until we see what other stocks we got on this list",

    "company": "Occidental Petroleum",
    "excerpt": "moving on to purchase number two we have what is probably Warren's favorite Big Oil stock in ocidental petroleum tog symbol oxy which they increased their position on by only a couple percent however it's already one of their largest Holdings at over $16 billion worth I myself have never really been a big fan of this one though not because I have anything against them personally but just because I think Pure Play renewable energy stocks offer better growth while even other Legacy oil companies offer better value too for example comparing the last 2 years to one of my favorite renewable energy stocks in the giant NEX era energy well we can see that both companies generated around 28 billion dollar in sales last year however that was growth for next era from around 21 billion the year before while oxy actually declined from 37 billion during the same time and when compared to a legacy giant like like Chevron for example well oxy actually trades for a PE ratio that is over 40% more expensive than the sector and over 30% more than Chevron while Chevron also carries a much more attractive dividend of 4.2% versus oxy at just 1.4% which is pretty crazy considering that oxy stock hasn't even gone up in the past 10 years so you know you would think with that performance they'd have a super cheap valuation or a giant dividend but nope you get neither Buffett on the other hand has received tons of special stock privileges over the years for owning oxy and that's probably the only reason why he's stuck around with it but for me as an outsider it's of little to no interest so I'm putting it in last place at number five",

    "company": "Apple",
    "excerpt": "the first one on the list was a bit of a shocker as it's one of Buffett's all-time favorites in the mighty Apple ticker symbol AAP which they actually sold a pretty large chunk of at about a 133% reduction that's over 116 million shares that they sold and yet it's still worth over $135 billion and over 40% of the entire portfolio close to half of the portfolio and has the largest holding it's the only stock that is really anywhere close to that amount so then why did he sell some well uh you know sometimes even as long-term investors it is perfectly normal to trim some of your largest best performing stocks that perhaps make up too big of a portion I sometimes do that myself it's pretty rare but it does happen and while I grant you that this was a pretty large reduction here for Buffett you have to remember three key things here number one apple is still by far the largest holding at over 40% the next closest is Bank of America at only 12% so in the grand scheme of things he's obviously still very bullish on Apple number two Apple stock has been on an absolute Terror throughout its entire history and it's usually in the top three of the largest companies in the entire world by market cap so Buffett has you know obviously already made enormous profits on Apple stock which is okay to cash in on sometimes you know what we call locking in profits something that everyone does on occasion and lastly number three you know a couple weeks ago Buffett actually said in a shareholder meeting that he thinks tax rates are going to rise in the future because of our insane deficit and debt levels so he is selling some stock right now at what he feels will be a lower taxx burden and again with the market up by so much it makes sense for him to be more fearful than otherwise greedy which apple is no exception to that amazing performance in the broader Market too you know Apple stock itself is currently up over 300% in just the past 5 years alone leaving an expensive valuation behind on virtually any metric you look at like a market cap of almost 3 trillion pees close to 30 and even a peeg north of 2.2 and you know Buffett usually stays away from expensive tech stocks as they're not only a bit harder for him to understand at you know 93 years of age but he also prefers less volatile businesses with large cash flow Apple however I would say fits that bill actually very nicely with a sticky business billions of devices in the wild strong recurring revenues from Services a gigantic balance sheet and absolutely incredible financials of around 400 billion in sales and 100 billion in pure net income profit per year however the issue for me personally is that at these already high prices you know I'd want to see a little more growth from them which has been pretty stagnant in recent years and I just don't think you're going to see a major pickup in iPhone sales until they release something more Innovative like perhaps folding phones or heavier integration with AI like much of the competition is already doing but it is still a very strong stock regardless and I even own some of it myself so I'm going to put them up at number two and push chub down one spot to fit it in and bumping up Apple to number one by default so that I can fit it in",

    "company": "Paramount Global",
    "excerpt": "Coming in at the next sale though uh we have a gigantic decrease here almost a complete elimination of a stock and that was in Paramount Global ticker ticker symbol p a which they decreased their Holdings on by a whopping 88% selling over 55 million shares and leaving their position down to just 0.03% of the overall portfolio and yet that's actually still worth over $88 million just because of how large Berkshire haway is but anyway Paramount is of course known for being a giant Media company which most recently they've gained a lot of attention for entering the streaming Wars with Paramount plus which is offered at a couple different price points depending on whether you accept commercials or want Showtime bundled in I actually like the moves uh that Paramount has been making though and I think that they have a lot of strong Brands and IP to uh fuel that service as well I mean there even one of the biggest movie studios in America usually hovering at around 10% box office market share which is you know pretty large and if you look through their catalog they've got properties like bet CVS which also has news and sports CMT Nickelodeon with SpongeBob MTV Comedy Central with South Park there's Pluto which is a free streaming service with commercials and all the other backlog of hit movies and shows like Star Trek Sonic Indiana Jones Halo Top Gun Transformers and more but but unfortunately for them the box office Market isn't quite what it used to be and even the high growth available from streaming is constantly being fought over by rising and intense competition from some of the largest media companies in the world like Disney Netflix Warner Brothers NBC Universal and even Amazon and apple as such while Paramount did see an initial spike in Revenue during the Pandemic those sales have now been plateauing at best and while their profits also surged in 2021 they later declined in 2022 and actually turned negative last year now most analysts do think that they'll return to profitability moving forward and long term there is a lot of value to likely be had here with the stock trading close to 30% cheaper than the sector on a ptio basis however that's mostly because the stock has been a horrendous performer losing almost 80% of its entire value over the past decade and Buffett has likely seen enough to just exit the position out now Al together as for me I already own large positions in Amazon and Disney so Paramount does very little to attract me for exposure to video streaming however I do still like it more than oxy so I'll put them at number four because of their at least large amount of Brands and distribution rights especially",

    "excerpt": "finally here we are left with the last sale that we'll be covering today and that's going to be the computer giant HP ticker symbol hpq which they decided to sell completely out of last quarter after making some other pretty big sales in the stock the two quarters prior which is a little surprising to me as HP has really always seemed like kind of the typical waren Buffett Value stock that you'd expect him to invest in long term it's kind of a boring Legacy player and computers and printers this stock has slowly climbed over the years only up around 100% in the past decade which doesn't seem to bother Buffett very much it's a pretty big value with pees less than than 10 and more than 50% cheaper than the sector which Buffett usually loves and they generate billions in cash flow which Buffett also loves because it fuels a very attractive dividend that yields more than 3% with a low payout ratio a double- digigit growth rate and a double- digigit growth history so why then are they selling well my guess is that they're a little worried right now about HP just not having much future potential I know that sounds a little crazy given that Buffett you know doesn't typically care about uh that type of as much as he just likes to invest in kind of boring value plays but when you look at it I mean the PC market is flooded with competition right now from not just the typical giants like apple and even Microsoft but also from other oems like Lenovo Asus Acer and more and as such hp's financials have been falling for years with even this year still expected to decline before they finally see a small recovery the year after now longer term management is hoping that AI especially will help the PC Market recover which they're going all in on with new AI focused PCS and I do actually think that they're going to see some success with a lot of that but for me the noticeable lack of growth just continues to kind of keep me away I still like it more than most of the other options on this list though especially for the dividend and the cheap valuation so uh I'm giving them the number two ranking",
