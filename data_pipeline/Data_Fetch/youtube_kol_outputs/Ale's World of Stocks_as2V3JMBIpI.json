I did run another poll on YouTube asking which of our best four best performing stocks should we buy more of to which 32% of the votes went again to Sofi, very surprising here even beating out Palantir and Tesla, two of the most popular stocks in the market, but it looks like Sofi is starting to get a little more attention these days which I am happy to see. $10 went to Sofi. We have Sofi as one of the seven stocks making up more than half of the entire portfolio because it skyrocketed this past month. Personally I'm not a big fan of Sofi being ahead of Amazon or Palantir being ahead of Microsoft. I would be fine with those still being relatively high but maybe just not that high. I would rather have some safer larger companies be at the very tip top so I could actually trim a little bit of Sofi and Palantir right here just to help balance it out a little bit; they're up a lot, we could take some profits on that. Sofi is at 107% gains. Our four largest stocks though, Google, Sofi, Amazon and Palantir are all up on this list double digit gainers which I love to see.",

I'm actually a huge fan of VICI stock right now at the current valuation. The biggest purchase of the month went to VICI at $20 spent there. I like how everything else is structured so far except for VICI, it's one of our newest additions so it's still pretty small at only 2%. That's a dividend REIT that I think is dirt cheap right now so I definitely want to buy a lot more in the coming months. Nothing really would compare to VICI Properties, my favorite REIT in the market right now with a huge dividend, great valuation and yeah we're actually negative on it so basically want to be buying as much as possible of this one while I am still down on it.",

To have these actually be the four best performing ones in the portfolio, some of them even doubling in size in terms of gains it's just awesome to see. C3.ai was actually another stock that I would get some negative backlash on that one but I just felt like they were kind of a mini version of Palantir for obviously a much smaller price. The stock had crashed before I was buying into it, but now with the soaring rise of AI the stock rebounded quite a bit. That was another kind of speculative play, I was just playing on the rebound. I felt like they could rebound and I actually really like this one long term though too. What happened this past month they got a deal partnership deal with Microsoft which along with other positive news, a strong earnings report too, it just sent the stock soaring by over 40% this past month. I still love the stock long term so even though it's currently our fourth best performer right now I'm actually not planning on selling any of it but if they do dip at all I might actually buy a little more.",

I never recommended this stock; I've even said numerous times that this is the type of stock that most people should actually stay away from, it's a bit too risky for most people, but I was specifically buying just a very tiny amount myself as a speculative gamble on the hopes that they would have a rebound in the future, which in this community portfolio it was only around $25 that I spent on this stock.

I don't own it myself, I'm still doing more research on them and others too, but just off the bat I would say that the stock has risen a bit this year already but the valuation is actually very good. It's about the same as the sector and yet they have a very attractive dividend and they're a key utility in Virginia, their biggest market which also happens to be one of the biggest data center locations in the world so there's a lot to like about them. I'm actively doing more research on them and others too.",
