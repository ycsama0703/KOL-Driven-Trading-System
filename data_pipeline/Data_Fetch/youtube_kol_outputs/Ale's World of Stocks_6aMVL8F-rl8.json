    "excerpt": "hey what's up guys earnings Madness continued this past week with Google announcing a first ever dividend after just recently announcing more layoffs the week before but the stock sword it's one of my favorites so I'll share my thoughts all right so Google first now just the week prior they had announced even more layoffs and even moved some positions overseas which is not a great look especially since they had laid off another thousand in January and around 12,000 the year before which by the way many of those workers have been worried for a while now that they could get replaced by artificial intelligence well in this most recent round of layoffs it's been reported that they're doing it in order to cut cost so that they can invest even heavier into you guess it artificial intelligence so yeah there's probably some valid validity to those concerns anyway the reason why it's all a little surprising is because Google was literally willing to pay billions of dollars in fees to conduct those thousands of layoffs only to now announce a brand new dividend which guys this has to remind you exactly of the same thing that happened with meta who also laid off you know thousands of workers and then announced a brand new dividend too it's pretty crazy how similar it is anyway if you're wondering what this dividend will yield well it's supposed to be a 20 cent dividend I'm guessing that's per quarter and and they said that they intend to pay it in the future too so if we multiply that by four quarters it would be 80s and when compared to the current stock price you're looking at a yield of just around half a percent so yeah not very much at all there actually I believe that's almost exactly the same yield that meta had when they first announced a dividend too so man it's really strange how similar all of this is just like Google doing it a little bit later but very very similar to meta here anyway unlike meta who actually fell on earnings this quarter well Google stock actually soared by around 15% at one point with a beat on both the top and bottom line with also huge gains on practically all their financials ad sales for example Rose to almost 62 billion that's up around 7 billion year-over-year operating income for Google Cloud more than quadrupled which is a great sign for them because it shows that they're finally starting to reap the rewards of competing against their larger rivals in Amazon and Microsoft who of course generate huge profits from their Cloud businesses but Google is now starting to compete heavier there and all the meanwhile they continue to invest further into artificial intelligence to improve both of those areas as well by the way this is the most staggering figure to me net income profit it's skyrocketed by 57% to almost $4 billion in just this one single quarter alone how crazy is that I think that might be the most profitable quarter for them ever and as if paying a dividend wasn't enough they even announced another $70 billion in share BuyBacks with still over a hundred billion in cash and equivalence on their balance sheet too I mean it's just absolutely incredible how strong this company is and how good their performance is right now obviously uh sucks about the layoffs that's a horrible part I hate to see when anybody gets laid off but in terms of just uh Google and how they're operating I mean dang they're as strong as ever and you know uh just kind of looking at how much cash they have I mean it's kind of funny how everybody always talks about Apple having so much cash Google has like almost the same amount and uh in my opinion Google is a much more Diversified company it's much better um kind of stock to own in my opinion it's really my favorite and yet they have a smaller market cap I'm not saying to compare the two by the way they're both great stocks I don't mean to make those comparisons I just think that Google is uh one of the best out there maybe the best in the entire market and so I like to talk about them a lot I know that it's up to a record right now but I just think that they deserve it and I also think they deserve a position in just about anyone's portfolio out there at this point. In the uh public Community portfolio that we all kind of have a voice in that we like to mess around with uh Google is actually the largest stock in that one.",

    "excerpt": "and then Microsoft my number one largest holding continues to dominate with even more progress on AI I'll break it all down for you guys in this quick video Let's jump into it Google Cloud more than quadrupled which is a great sign for them because it shows that they're finally starting to reap the rewards of competing against their larger rivals in Amazon and Microsoft who of course generate huge profits from their Cloud businesses anyway I really like Google but let's move on to Microsoft stock okay so Microsoft similarly had a very strong quarter now Microsoft in my opinion always dominates on earnings they always seem to put up incredible numbers every time I look up their financials I'm always Blown Away by them I do think that Wall Street was a little disappointed in this one though it was had to do with guidance that tends to happen Microsoft doesn't shoot up a lot on earning earnings a lot of times they kind of downplay guidance a little bit and so the stock tends to not perform as well as others and also of course Microsoft already pays a small dividend so they couldn't like shock the market by announcing a brand new dividend like Google did so you weren't going to see the stock take off like like it did with Google but still just a very strong quarter in my opinion especially pushing further into Ai and Cloud but just look at some of these numbers here now they beat on both the top and bottom line sales skyrocketing by 17% year-over-year to almost $62 billion with net income rising over 3 billion more up to almost $22 billion in just a single quarter I mean it's so incredible how well they do now much of that has to do with all the progress that they've made in AI in fact during the earnings call management noted that their AI demand is so high above their available capacity that they're now having to increase their Capital expenditures just to secure more Nvidia GP use for running all of their AI models it's pretty crazy should be good news for NVIDIA shareholders too and of course I'm an Nvidia shareholder as well so I like to see that anyway speaking of AI remember all those times that I told you guys to keep an eye on co-pilot because it's going to be a GameChanger for Microsoft well yeah that too is already showing huge promise in fact earlier this quarter uh Microsoft announced new Surface PCS for business with dedicated co-pilot buttons on them as well as new premium subscriptions for businesses and individuals especially in office well if you look at the entire breakdown of all their platforms and services we had both office commercial and windows commercial Rise by double digigit percentages while everything else continues to outperform too especially Azure uh how impressive is this here it continues to accelerate every single quarter Rising another 30% in the prior quarter and another 31% this past quarter too this is already the second largest cloud in the world guys and it's growing at 30% plus that's unbelievable and then lastly how many times have I told you guys that Microsoft is trying to be the Netflix of gaming with Xbox game pass well Xbox Revenue up over 60% in each of the past two quarters that's really heating up now guys I'm telling you Xbox is going to be big for them despite all these positives though the stock was a little Rocky and only Rose a couple percent this past week part of that is probably because it's already up so much as it is but it also had to do with a little bit of weaker guidance there than analysts were expecting it's not a very big concern for me though I care much more about profitability and that forecast was still at a higher operating margin than analysts expected so from my point of view it's just kind of a foregone conclusion at this point that Microsoft will continue to dominate in many different areas of tech especially in AI in Cloud even in gaming too I mean I really have high hopes for all of these areas for Microsoft and it's why I continue to hold it as my largest stock by the way that's my my largest stock in my personal portfolio my private one.",
