    "excerpt": "Should You Buy Super Micro Stock After GIANT Crash?! 😲 hey what's up everyone welcome back to my world of socks in today's video I'm going to try to give you a quick recap on super micro stock and why it's crashing so hard right now losing over 30% in a single day and what I plan to do myself and in full disclosure I do own a very tiny piece of this stock. super micro stock while being a very popular name in the AI space has more recently faced a lot of controversy these past few months. In fact just back in August Hindenberg research came out with a scathing short report on the company accusing them of accounting malpractice saying that super micro has been inflating their revenue numbers while also bypassing us export laws and allegedly sending Technologies to Russia while also having a potential conflict of interest doing business with two suppliers that are also owned by the CEO's family. So just a lot of like weird kind of shady stuff going on. it's not a good sign for super micro as a company and I think it will likely continue to weigh on the stock for some time until we get some clarity on all of this. to be clear here the company super micro has denied most of these claims. so far it is working very well for Hindenburg because super micro stock continues to crash. it should be noted that following these reports it was also reported that the DOJ is now investigating allegedly into the company too not to mention that super micro themselves have even delayed their own Financial reports which only raised concerns even further. So it's just been I would say a total disaster these past few months for the company and everything surrounding them. Now as bad as all of this sounds though many investors have actually been buying the stock under the assumption that maybe these are issues that can gradually be corrected over time and thus we're just left with a very high growth AI company here that unlike most others in the space this one actually has a beaten down stock price with a dirt cheap valuation. Well unfortunately that low price has crashed even further today super micro stock is down another more than 30% in a single day leaving it also down over 50% in the past quarter and over 70% from the highs that they reached just earlier this year. The stock is actually still up over 3,000% from their IPO of course that was like 17 years ago though but most of these gains have actually happened just these past couple years so most investors that have owned the stock for at least a couple or a few years are probably still up a lot but again not to take away from the giant crash that they are now experiencing. This coming from CNBC Ernst & Young they usually refer to them as EY they officially resigned from being super micro's Financial auditor saying that they can no longer rely on super micro's Financial representations citing major concern about the company's governance and transparency saying too that they can no longer meet their legal and professional obligations if they were to continue serving as super micro Auditors. Now to put it more plainly here they're basically saying that they it can pretty much be assumed here that they found evidence that could question super micro's integrity and ethics and their honesty are being honest with their numbers and all that kind of stuff so they're stepping aside from being an auditor they don't want to be involved with it. Super Micro even paid like an $18 million fine back in 2020 to the SEC for prematurely and improperly recording their revenues so it's very possible that similar issues have actually been going on behind the scenes for some time with some of this now just starting to come to light which by the way super micro has even hired a law firm and a forensic accounting firm to review much of this. NASDAQ is even threatening to delist them if they don't comply in time with their delayed Financial reports. What if let's say much of this slowly gets corrected they pay some big fines but it's not enough to sync the company they can get through it and business just kind of goes back to usual at that point I mean you're still talking about an insanely cheap AI stock here with a lot of future potential so I can't understand why some feel the urge to want to gamble on it here in fact I'm feeling a little bit of that urge myself too after all super micro does have a fast growing and impressive business in AI where they sell various components for computing servers as well as the actual full-on servers themselves and one of the reasons why they stand apart from much of the competition is because of how highly customizable their servers are that can be tailored towards really any specific workload of various sizes and types serving not just large corporations but even small to medium-sized businesses too. As a result super micro platform is often used in combination with Nvidia GPUs which they're even partnered with for Nvidia's Omniverse platform too but you also have other big names like AMD and Intel being made your customers as well. And another standout feature about super micro often gets talked about is their liquid cool technology alongside other innovations that help their servers be more powerful while still reducing heat and electricity sometimes by as much as 90%. As a result super micro products continue to be in really high demand usually outpacing Supply and thus so too have their financials been soaring with sales and profits more than doubling in size last year. And yet because of the stock crash the valuation is actually Dirt Cheap on virtually any metric you look at with their PEG ratio in particular being 85% cheaper than the sector median. That's pretty crazy unfortunately though I do just think that the stock will remain under heavy pressure for some time until we get more clarity on the current situation and look if it turns out that there's a ton of fraud being committed the stock could very easily continue to drop especially if it gets delisted or even if the scandal gets so bad to where parts of management have to resign maybe even people go jail. What's the play here what do I plan on doing myself with super micro stock with at least the limited information that I have available to me. Super micro is very important to the ongoing buildout of AI infrastructure worldwide that I kind of feel like I just have to buy in at these levels seeing a big name in AI considering how much AI stocks have soared but this one is as low as it is at this valuation it feels like the type of stock that I got to buy at that price and I know that it has a lot of issues but I also don't think that the stock would have crashed or sunk this low if it didn't have major issues that need to be corrected so you kind of have to balance out the risk with the reward in that sense. I was actually going to buy super micro stock for my personal private portfolio around the same time I got it in the community one but I never got around to it and I kind of just forgot about it. it is very tempting but it would have to be with the acknowledgement that this is a very high-risk speculative kind of gamble play here it's not a safe core investment and it would have to be with money that I am willing to lose. So I would only buy for that reason and because it's such a cheap AI stock that I think would shoot up a lot if things got better from here if they corrected these issues maybe they pay some big fines but not enough to sync the company and they can survive and get back on track I think the stock would perform very well from there.",

How big of a deal is this well it's pretty big I mean EY is a large and fairly well-respected Financial firm so for them to say this in such an aggressive way like saying in the resignation letter for example that they are quote unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management and basically saying the same thing about the CEO and other members of management too. I just don't think a very reputable Financial firm like this would say these kind of things if they didn't have some credible evidence... it's also being reported that EY they're resigning but it's also reported that they had conflicts with management for months.",
