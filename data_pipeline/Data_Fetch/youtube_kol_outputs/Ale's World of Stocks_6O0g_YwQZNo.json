    "excerpt": "I'm instead going with a Renewables expert in next era energy ticker symbol NE which is actually the largest generator of wind and solar in the entire world but of course based here in America with operations in 49 different states offering battery storage wind solar and even nuclear all of which I feel is going to be really more and more important over time for a couple of giant reasons in particular one being that Democrats especially have an extremely strong preference towards renewable energy over fossil fuels and the other is because of how many new Emerging Markets of the future will rely so incredibly heavily on energy that next era will also be able to Prov that being things like electric vehicles which Democrats also heavily favored during the Biden Harris Administration they gave out many billions of dollars in subsidies and tax incentives for that exact purpose but there's also the rise in artificial intelligence which is something that nobody really wants to talk about is how much energy is required to actually run large AI operations and of course big Tech big tech companies also tend to love Democrats they usually donate uh almost entirely to them and I think there's a reason for that as they'll likely be much friendlier to them when it comes to all of that energy that is going to be needed which will probably end up requiring nuclear energy too in fact I think Google just recently said that they're thinking about using nuclear power for much of their work as well well again next era actually offers nuclear too so that's a big Plus on their side as well and in total they estimate that America alone will need another 175 GW of renewable energy and storage capacity through 2026 then increase to another 250 by 2030 which is more than a 40% increase and then here's the real crazy part by 2050 it's going to need another 7,000 kW to reach their Net Zero goals which is almost entirely an initiative pushed by democrats and guys that would equate to over $4 trillion worth of investment so next era as a leader stands to be really one of the biggest beneficiaries from all of this as they only produce around 72 gaw at the moment so that's almost like a 100 times increase to their addressable Market over time now in terms of the stock price of course a lot of the optimism has already been getting priced into this one so it currently trades near a record high like so much of the broader Market however the valuation is actually not as bad as you'd expect with a PEG ratio there's slightly higher than the sector that's because longer term they're expected to grow their profits substantially and I think a Camala Harris Administration would likely help with that as well as she's already campaigned on it saying in recent appearances that her and Biden invested the largest amount of money in history to combat climate change worldwide with a plan to spend over a trillion dollars over the next 10 years too and Cala herself as VP cast a tiebreaking vote to Triple renewable energy production in the country through the IRA the inflation reduction act that includes the largest climate change investment in history so this is all really part of the reason why I own next Era stock myself I just think that the whole kind of climate change movement is going to keep boosting them higher but there's also two more reasons why I like this stock in particular that I also think are very important number one I like that they're a utility because the rates that they charge can actually benefit from either government regulation or guaranteed contracts making their earnings more reliable which in turn also helps them pay a dividend which is the second thing I like about them as it's a high growth one with over a 2.4% yield a reasonable payout ratio a double digit growth rate and nearly three decades of consecutive growth.",

    "excerpt": "the overall safest and largest one to consider would be Alibaba tiger symbol baab which is already an incredibly strong business even without the tariffs and and trade War discussion but even more so it's been helped during the Biden Harris years as the relationship with America has gradually improved with delisting concerns settling down and more approved oversight from the SEC which I think is part of the reason why you're now seeing many Chinese stocks finally start to Rebound with Alibaba itself rising over 30% this past year however from the top it's still down a whopping 64 % which is a huge drop off for a company that is by all accounts still on fire not only being the largest e-commerce Leader by gross merchandise volume in the entire world even ahead of Amazon it's crazy but they're also the largest cloud provider in Asia and the third largest worldwide too yet their sales are still Rising by around a double digit percentage despite that massive size and so with the stock continuing to trade 24% and 12% cheaper than the sector on a for PE and PEG ratio bases respectively well I think it's looking pretty attractive here for a Camala Harris presidency",

    "excerpt": "So instead I'm picking General Motors sticker symbol GM and there's a very simple reason why now on the Trump campaign he said before that he would eliminate EV mandates on day one and he's even considering getting rid of certain tax subsidies for them too but Camala on the other hand well her and Biden have been pouring billions into EVS for years in fact not only are there continued tax credits for Ev purchases but in total the department of energy under VP Harris has committed over $15 billion to help auto manufacturers convert their factories into EV related production while the White House has also pledged more than 170 billion in EV and battery supply chain Investments with over 20 brand new Auto and Battery plans being announced since they took office including by the way most recently $2 billion in Grants to companies like General Motors by the way for them to expand EV production in key election swing States now it is true that GM is still far behind the likes of something like Tesla when it comes to EVS but they are quickly growing in fact they're already approaching double digit market share in America with new EV models like the Chevy Blazer Equinox Silverado Cadillac lyri Hummer and more rolling out Nationwide helping their EV sales Skyrocket last quarter by 60% year-over-year part of the reason being they argue is that they're able to grow their EV portfolio faster than the market right now because of their wide offerings of different EVS for anyone that wants them which is something that I've actually always argued about GM myself too is that they're actually pretty well Diversified for just being an automaker having so many strong Brands across regular sedans trucks and SUVs in fact they're the number one largest seller of total vehicles number one in trucks and number one in SUVs that's even ahead of other giants like Ford Honda Toyota and more so you basically get this dominant Legacy automaker of traditional gas power vehicles but you also get all of these investments into future growth like EVs and even autonomous driving too and yet the stock is actually not as expensive as you might expect it to be still being a bit flat over the past decade with also a dirt cheap valuation that is over 70% cheaper than the sector under another Camala Harris ad Administration I got to think that that valuation is going to be looking pretty attractive for GM stock long term",

    "company": "ChargePoint",
    "excerpt": "for stock number four I want to talk about another EV related company except this one is specifically for charging EVs and that is charge Point ticker symbol chpt now there's several reasons why I've been tracking this one a lot recently and that's because we often talk about EV makers but we tend to ignore many of the names responsible for building charging networks and the infrastructure for EVS which I feel is just as important for their future in fact in kamala's climate related spending that we talked about earlier well she's specifically outlined EV charging networks as a primary area of focus and according to Edmonds one of the biggest reasons why EV adoption is so slow at the moment only making up less than 10% of all vehicles in America is because of the lack of charging infrastructure that worries consumers into buying EVS so clearly this is an area that needs very large expansion well it just so happens that charge Point currently holds the most market share in America at over half the entire level to charger Market there is however Rising competition which Speaking of Evo just landed a guaranteed billion dollar loan from the Department of energy to build more charging stations which sent the stock Skyrock marketing by over 60% in a single day Charge point on the other hand has been struggling greatly given the slow EV adoption that was likely also caused by some of that weak economy where consumers have just uh not really been willing to pay the high price for EVS in these past couple years and as such they've seen their stock price crumble losing almost all of its value these past couple years falling from a high of $46 a share during the pandemic to now only being worth around around a dollar and being considered a penny stock but I just got to say at that low of a price I think it does start to get pretty interesting because I have to imagine that they'd be able to survive and maybe start to turn things around in such an EV friendly Administration especially if interest rates keep coming down which is also crucial for an unprofitable company like this as charge Point has been growing their sales by large amounts over the years but losses just keep stacking up as they try to expand and and invest in more growth of course under Trump my feelings on this one would be very different especially if he cuts subsidies for EVS and helps ice vehicle sales instead but again under Cala well I just think that this is a super interesting stock here to keep an eye on that I might even want to gamble a very small amount on myself too especially if it sinks even lower but we'll see",

    "excerpt": "for stock number five we'll finish things off here with a giant Safe Company one of the most profitable in the entire world and we'll go with apple ticker symbol AAP which my reasons for this one are also pretty simple Trump wants more International tariffs Camala wants less most Apple products are built in China and other countries so logic would tell us that Apple would perform much better under a CALA presidency than a trump one if they can actually get their products built at cheaper prices overseas now granted the stock is still trading near a record high as is often the case with such a strong performer like this but there are several reasons to still be bullish longterm number one they're insanely profitable doing close to 400 billion in sales and 100 billion in profits number two they're finding new ways to convince customers to upgrade their products the most recent of which is integrating new AI features across the board which seems to be working as analysts are projecting around double digit growth for both their already massive sales and profits over the next 5 years on average number three they still have more growth levers to pull like launching folding phones which I think will sell very well both folding and flipping number four they higher margin Services Revenue continues to sore every year with another quarter of double digigit growth this latest one number five the ecosystem is extremely sticky because of all the different hardware and software that customers get attached to making it really hard for them to ever switch over to a competitor number six they use that insane profitability to buy back many billions of dollars of their own stock every year making your shares more valuable with another $100 billion plan announced this year too which was the largest amount in history for any company in the entire world I mean it's pretty crazy and number seven they have also one of the biggest balance sheets out there with plenty of cash to invest in New Growth initiatives whenever they need to all of which makes this a stock that I think is a pretty good choice in my opinion for a CALA presidency where really high tariffs shouldn't be much of a concern",
