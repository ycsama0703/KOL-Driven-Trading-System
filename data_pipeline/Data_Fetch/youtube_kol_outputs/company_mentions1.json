    "excerpt": "well coming in at purchase number two though we actually have the other brand new pickup from Buffett which has also been getting a lot more attention recently and that is the pizza giant dominoes SEC symbol dpz which he purchased almost $550 million of last quarter now when it comes to Domino's business I tend to avoid these types of fast food kind of retail stocks myself just because of how saturated and competitive the market is making it a little harder to keep up with everything going on there however I will say that on a more personal level I'm actually a fan of dominoes and their brand out of all the fast food pizza shops Domino's is actually my favorite I like to taste more than like Pizza Hut or Little Caesars and the online app is super easy to use where I can customize everything I usually do like a handmade pan pizza with alfredo sauce mushrooms and and chicken maybe some pineapple I I this is starting to sell like a commercial for Pizza Hut but I I uh for dominoes I mean but I have actually used them in the past and it was a good experience and they also tend to have a lot of coupons too that makes it a little more affordable so just the overall experience I've been a fan of with Domino's personally just me but uh you know I I'm not the only one I'm guessing because Domino's has actually grown into the number one market share leader as a franchiser with still more room to grow in the future given the roughly $95 billion estimated Market size worldwide which they have a pretty large presence in across more than 90 different Global markets plus their new more initiative will launch another 5,000 new stores in the coming years to help keep their already large growth rates versus the competition many of which have actually been in Decline throughout recent years however for as good as Domino's performs in relation to their peers their overall growth as a company itself is still too low in my opinion to justify the valuation now the stock has actually dipped a little from the top losing about a quarter of its value but even here it still trades around 30 to 50% more expensive than the sector based on PE and Peg ratios that's just not going to cut it for a business that is only growing sales by around a mid single digit percentage on average nor is the really small dividend of less than a 1.5% yield now granted that dividend does at least have some excellent growth metrics on it so perhaps Buffett was looking for just another kind of market leader with a growing dividend similar to pool what we saw with pool right but like I said before I just think that there's way better options out there for any of the attributes that we're talking about here and for that reason I'm ranking them number three giving them just a slight Edge over pool since I've at least bought from Dominoes on occasion I I want to eat healthier so you know dominoes is not really something I eat often but you know the fact that I have used it before would probably make it a little easier to keep track of the business and their operations and understand them a little better than something like pool cuz I don't even have a pool",
