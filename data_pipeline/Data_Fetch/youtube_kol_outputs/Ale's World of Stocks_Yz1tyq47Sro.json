    "excerpt": "so paler stock used to be really hated by Wall Street but now it's absolutely loved with the price skyrocketing this year on the back of horizon artificial intelligence and all the hype surrounding that yet there's actually a much smaller company called c3.ai who shares some similarities with paler but their stock has actually been hammered into the ground so in today's video I want to compare the two companies a little bit here and explain why one is so l right now while the other is really hated on and then I'll finish up with what I'm doing myself and whether I consider either of these stocks to be a buy at today's prices it's going to be a ton of fun can't wait to share my opinion on all of this so let's just go ahead and jump straight into it now I want to start here first by just showing you how incredibly different these two stocks have performed in recent years by the way they both ipoed in 2020 so it's actually pretty easy here to compare their performances and when looking at it well over the past year paler stock has more than doubled in price while C3 actually fell by over 20% and from the 2020 IPO well paler has more than tripled to now just about an all-time high while C3 has actually crashed into the ground losing over 80% of its entire value so just completely different performances and completely different treatment by Wall Street on these two stocks and yet business-wise you know the two companies actually do have a lot of similarities both have expertise in using artificial intelligence software to improve the efficiency and management of companies and even government's data and their overall businesses albeit c3s is much smaller in scale and is really nowhere near as Broad and robust and probably as strong I would say as Pounders with a bit more of a specialized kind of maybe localized Focus um especially on generative artificial intelligence which they've been pushing more heavily into recently but it's still mostly the same overall concept I would say in terms of these two businesses and what they're kind of trying to achieve now for its part though paler has seen huge success in helping government bodies with things like counterterrorism and other military operations while more recently further expanding into the commercial sector as well Last quarter for ex for example their us commercial sales soared by a whopping 55% now mind you guys this is during what is a pretty horrible economy here with interest rates and inflation on everyone's minds and yet businesses are still willing to Shell out money to pound here for their services because well frankly they actually end up saving money in the long run when they use them For example Fujitsu recently said that they're getting a $9 million annual cost reduction after implementing paler after only only 3 months that's pretty crazy and even a even bigger example here would be their older partnership with Airbus who uses the platform to conduct optimizations on a set of issues worth tens of billions of dollars and similar stories can be found with C3 as well itbe it a bit smaller but one of the biggest uh deals that they have is with the oil giant shell who actually said not too long ago that they save more than $2 billion a year through the partnership and that's also very impressive now this really in my opinion shows the power of artificial intelligence and just how valuable it can be long-term for so many different entities especially big ones right which by the way going back to Pal here for a second well their government business it's also doing just fine too I mean it may not be growing quite as high in terms of a rate as commercial but it's still doing phenomenally well growing by over 20% and really it feels like every earnings report we hear about some new giant contract with the military being a awarded to Pal here with this most recent quarter being no exception either with another half a billion dollar 5year contract announced for AI and machine learning operations with the Department of Defense now turning over to C3 again it's a similar story here but just uh a bit I would say a much smaller one a much smaller scale in terms of everything that they do now C3 has also seen kind of a evenly split business between government and Commercial implementing their AI software to improve all operations across the board and just like pounds here they're also seeing a surge in demand this year despite the weak economy with another 47 agreements signed last quarter and total revenue growth of 20% again it's just not at the size and scale of pounds here but some similarities can be found and the demand for their AI capabilities also appears to be there as well even if it's not quite as strong as Pounders but if C3 is actually growing and they have a lot of future potential which we're already seen uh you know the benefits of and we can also see another very similar company benefiting from that in a gigantic way too with pound here having a lot of success there so we can see what's what's possible for C3 well then why aren't investors taking to C3 stock too just like they are with paler well it's actually pretty simple the differences when compared to paler is that paler grew much faster larger they built more connections and they're actually profitable now too which is huge whereas C3 is a much different story there and I'll touch on all of that in just a second here but one other thing that I also just want to quickly mention with paler success especially this past year has been the implementation of AI boot camps where they basically go out to all of these corporations they put them through an AI instructional course let's say where they show them and teach them how to use pounder software and capabilities and they demonstrate to them just how valuable those Services can be for their businesses which has been a huge success for them in convincing companies to adopt paler products and services in fact just over the past year alone they've already completed AI boot camps with over 1,000 different companies which helped them grow their us commercial customer count by over 80% during that time that's incredible growth considering the macro conditions and this latest quarter alone showed close to a 100 New Deals being signed worth over $1 million each with 33 of those being worth over 5 million each and 27 worth over 10 million too and you can also see in these examples too just uh how how much success really they're having with the AI boot camps for example it took them just 6 weeks to go from an AI boot camp to a seven figure deal being signed with the leading Global Life Sciences company and the same result was also seen for a large wholesale Insurance firm except that one they accomplished it in just 16 days it's very impressive work and I think it's a big reason for why the market is taking such a liking to poun your stock now of course another giant reason though like I said before is profitability something that C3 severely lacks in in fact they often lose just about as much money as they even generate in sales but palente here on the other hand is a completely different story having now reported positive Gap net income in each of the past six quarters in a row while also turning an operating income profit in each of the past seven quarters in a row too the reason why this matters so much is because of course we have been in a high interest rate environment which can be crushing to unprofitable companies and it's a scary thing for Wall Street and for investors to be betting on so I believe Wall Street is rewarding paler greatly for that breakout in fact paler net income alone is more than C3 even does in total sales that's a pretty big difference there it's a notable one for sure and look even there c3's Revenue growth has also struggled at times with even a heavy deceleration throughout their fiscal 2023 year falling from from 38% growth down to 25 then to just 7 then it actually turned negative for a little before falling flat right after and then just now in the past four quarters we've seen a slow recovery back up to 20% growth but that right there to me just kind of shows that C3 is not nearly as well insulated from macro conditions as pounder is and I think a big reason for that is just because of how much smaller and less known they are maybe less proven than paler so you get more hesitant adoption I would say from companies and even the government during these difficult times and yet despite all those negatives well I do actually think that both stocks are a buy now I have a much larger position in paler who I do not consider to be a speculative stock I think it's a sound long-term investment in my opinion whereas with C3 I treat that one as a very small speculative bet for the future cuz I just figure if I'm going to own a Spec stock I I like this one way more than most others out there in the market and here's why well first of all around that time that c3's growth was uh falling decelerating well they actually made an operational change to start focusing more on offering pilot programs and smaller contracts in both size and length which is making it much easier now for companies to be willing to try C3 and when they do give them a try they often have a lot of success and that's been helping them return to growth that's why you're seeing that now and another thing about C3 is that they've been historically so reliant on government and only a couple commercial sectors like energy especially but with these Pilots you're now seeing much more diversification take place across the board which is a great thing I think it's going to slowly benefit them longer term that's why you also have them signing close to 200 New Deals over the past year which is up over 50% that's huge and it includes some giant entities too like the largest American oil producer in Exxon Mobile as well as General Mills Quest Diagnostics and even the US Navy and intelligence community and while C3 is not currently profitable I can at least see the light at the end of the tunnel for that too as they are actually a company that can generate software like margins if they weren't spending so heavily on Advertising R&amp;D and overall expansion right now which I also think is necessary while the market for AI is heating up and demand is rising but you look at it here well their adjusted gross margin is like 70% % and they even started turning a free cash flow profit last quarter two which is another big Improvement when talking about the heavy spending that is weighing them down well the CEO had this to say about it he said uh which by the way I actually agree with everything he says here but he basically said that they're investing right now on lead generation branding Market awareness and customer success related to their generative AI Solutions and while they expect to be cash positive in the coming year they will continue to invest in these AI Solutions even if it keeps them in the red for the moment adding that they can use their large cash reserves to keep investing in sales marketing advertising and data scientists to capture more market share in generative AI based application software describing it as a land grab and saying that it would be crazy to not invest in this market when the demand of course is so high and the size of the opportunity is so large again all things that I agree with myself right now is really about proving yourself it's about growing it's about gaining traction and then you can worry about your profits you know later on once you've established yourself as a leader as a solid choice for companies and government entities to choose from which meanwhile I do feel that they have enough cash on hand to do that then I would say in the future after that I I I feel you can worry about you know making cuts and operating more efficiently but right now your focus really should be on just proving yourself and becoming more wellestablished as a a recognized brand cuz you look at the market opportunity just AI software alone is expected to break north of a trillion dollars by the 2030s and yet C3 didn't even generate even just 1 billion in sales in all of the past year so the opportunity is tremendous and they got to try to capture as much of it as possible and as early as possible and look I've said this many times but I'll keep saying it C3 is not the type of company that I feel needs to perform better than paler they just need to be in alternative option they need to be around they need to survive and they need to be available for companies and government entities to have a cheaper option I I feel that the market should be large enough to support multiple players and if C3 can carve out a path for themselves as a cheaper you know probably let's be honest less effective option but a cheaper one well I actually do think that many companies May uh you know actually take to that they may go for the cheaper less effective option if they're on a tighter budget again I only own this one has a very small speculative play and I just feel that at the current valuation it's a bet worth gambling on for me with a forward prices sales ratio that is almost 70% lower than Palante tiers obviously there's a reason for that again I went over all of that in this video namely profitability but also again I would argue that C3 has at least the potential to get there one day if they can continue to execute longterm.",
