    "excerpt": "some of my personal favorite platforms include Sofi Robin Hood Charles Schwab and E Trade. However my favorite allaround platform that I would especially recommend for any beginners out there that are looking to set up a brand new Roth IRA account would be Sofi because it's uh super easy to use it's an all-in-one platform for basically anything you need like banking loans credit and of course investing it's kind of a just all-in-one Finance platform super buttery smooth really easy to use great app for it as well and uh that's the example that we're going to be using for today. Now Sofi is also a platform that I already use on the channel for our community stock portfolio and it's been a total pleasure to use I've had a blast using it. by the way if you do create a Sofi account you want to use one of my referral links down in the description well it not only supports the channel but you actually get free money too just for signing up I think right now it's giving like 25 bucks for free so would definitely take advantage of that if you haven't already created a Sofi account. anyway here's what it looks like creating a free Roth IRA within Sofi which by the way another cool thing about Sofi is that they match 1% of your contributions for free too You don't even need an employer or anything Sofi will just match it themselves in a Roth IRA and that's pretty cool. anyway once you do have your Sofi account set up you'll log into your home member page and you're going to want to click on the invest tab once you're there you're going to see in the top right corner these different options and you'll just click on the add new account symbol then it's going to ask what type of account you want to create the first one is an individual brokerage account I already have one for the community portfolio so that's why it's gray out the other option is for an automated account uh that's uh where Sofi just kind of helps you with everything kind of like a robo account automatic account uh but the bottom option is what I want to use here so I'll just click on that it's the save for retirement option that has a self-directed IRA then it gives us options for a traditional IRA a Roth IRA or a SEP IRA I want the Roth IRA so I'll click on that then it's going to ask us to verify all of our personal information you agree to some legal stuff connect any bank account you want or you can even create one on Sofi itself and that's it you now have this brand new Roth IRA homepage where you can do things like add a beneficiary make any transfers or deposits and search for any type of stocks you want so for example I'll search Google one of my favorite stocks in the market right now and then I just click on the stock then I can click on buy choose the Roth IRA as the account and make any purchase that I want to make super simple right it's very easy to use and like I said there's also a mobile app that is uh buttery smooth and a lot of people love using it too I like using the app as well so I recommend downloading that too but the whole thing is very beginner friendly and E easy to use.",
