    "excerpt": "moving on to purchase number two though we actually have a dividend King in the pharmaceutical giant ABBY ticker symbol abbv which Vanguard scooped up another nearly 10 million shares bringing the stake up to over $31 billion worth now like I said ABY is a dividend King in that they've now increased their dividend for over five decades in a row which still yields 3.6% too and that's always made ABY an attractive dividend stock among investors in fact I actually own the stock myself too however my yield is much higher because I bought it many years ago at some you know much lower prices whereas today the stock has risen to almost a record high still many investors continue to buy the stock today for several reasons for one again that dividend is very attractive but also because ABY has really shown to be a cash generating machine growing their free cash flow from less than 17 billion in 2020 to more than 22 billion last year and that's huge now on the flip side times have been getting more challenging with Rising competition in a saturated Pharmaceuticals Market as well as the patent loss of key drugs including herera which was their uh number one bestselling drug was the number one bestselling drug in the world and as such that free cash flow actually declined by a couple billion last year while Revenue growth has also Fallen to just a mid to low single digit rate and the same goes for their EPS as well and so moving forward I think ABY should be looked at as a bit more of just like a strong cash generating dividend payer than uh something more like a growth type of stock uh and by the way I do feel that the cash will keep coming in I mean this is a company that spends many billions of dollars on R&D every year which results in a lot of innovation a lot of a lot of uh treatments that they can continue developing and putting out there in the market they've got a massive pipeline guys of new drugs and treatments it totals over 75 which is a lot larger than I've seen in a lot of other competitors and I also think that that will help them offset the current struggles and help them maintain their uh their size and their balance and and their dominance and and their cash flow and we're already seeing signs of this with uh for example renok and Sky rezy those two drugs alone are helping make up the losses of Humera as they uh continue to grow larger and larger over time and ab is also investing more heavily into genomic research which I also think will play a huge role in the future of medicine 2o and there's high hopes for that as well and even the valuation isn't as bad as you might expect it to be given the rising stock price I mean you've got a forward p ratio that is 20% cheaper than the sector that's not too bad their PEG ratio is a little higher though at 133% more expensive which illustrates the lack of growth that I talked about but for a giant leader like this to still be trading around these levels I actually think that it's uh pretty reasonable overall anyway it's definitely a stock that I plan to continue holding myself but again you have to keep in mind I got in at much lower prices and I have a much higher dividend yield if I was a new investor into the stock I wouldn't be buying it I I would actually prefer uh something else like fizer or Bristol Meers squib who are also in Pharmaceuticals biotechs but they have cheaper valuations and they have much higher dividend yields at the moment like double the yields I think right now so I would prefer that but because I do already own the stock I guess I have to rank it a little high I'll give it the number two spot above flutter but again I'm not buying any more myself it's just a hold",
