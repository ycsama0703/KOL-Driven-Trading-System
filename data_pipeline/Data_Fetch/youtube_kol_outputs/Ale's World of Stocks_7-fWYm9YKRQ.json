    "excerpt": "hey what's up everyone my name is Ali welcome back to my world of stocks so Sofi stock just dropped pretty hard on earnings this week despite what I feel was actually a pretty strong report and so in today's video I'll be sharing with you guys three reasons why I'm choosing to buy Sofi stock myself on the dip let's go ahead and jump into it all right so reason number one now I just don't think that earnings were nearly bad enough to cause this much of a drop in fact it mostly just had to do with guidance as Sofi actually beat earnings on both the top and bottom line for the first quarter but unfortunately guided a little lower than what analysts were hoping for in the upcoming second quarter as they gave an outlook for revenue and net income of up to 565 million and $10 million respectively while analysts wanted to see something closer to 580 million and 13.9 million instead and as a result the stock fell over 10% during the day leaving it now down over a quarter of its entire value so far this year while also being down over 70% from its high that's a huge crash there but in my opinion most of this is just Wall Street being really greedy and too shortsighted to really see how well this company is actually doing and performing which leads me to reason number two that there were not only way more Pros in the quarter worth paying attention to to but also the fact that Sofi actually Rose guidance for the full year now first of all like I said before this quarter was an actual beat with also an EPS profit which is super important for them since they're not usually profitable having actually reported a loss of 5 cents the year before on EPs and it was also a 100% beat there as well versus analyst estimate so that's pretty good you know that's a pretty big positive now Revenue in the quarter also Rose 26% year-over-year beating estimates there too with their most important growth segments the financial services and the tech platform surging by 54% combined to now making up a record 42% of the company's entire Revenue which they're also guiding to be as much as 50% this year so making up half of their sales and that's huge guys because you really want services and Tech to be as large of a portion of their business as possible longterm versus just lending it's what can be more I would say a little bit more reliable especially given the macroeconomic conditions but you know there is also a lot of growth potential there it can also be very disruptive with tech and it can also be pretty high margin too with Services it can be less Capital intensive as maybe lending so there's a lot of positives there to have a more Diversified business and that's what you're starting to see here with lending now not making up such a dominant position compared to everything else now everything else is start starting to take a little bit of a bigger share as well and everything's getting balanced out a bit and I love to see that and that was one thing that I was looking for in the report and looks like that's going to continue moving forward as well but on top of that we also had new members Rising by 44% now totaling more than 8 million which shows continued strength for the company and it also shows that their services are in high demand among consumers that's a big positive to see there and as a result you know everyone is freaking out about slightly lower Q2 guidance well for the full year which in my opinion is way more important well Sofi actually Rose their guidance for the full year so why aren't investors paying attention to that instead it's cuz really everyone is just so damn shortsighted they like to be really short-term Traders rather than long-term investors but meanwhile you know Sofi they actually Rose their guidance for both sales and profits to higher levels and they had previously forecasted you can see that right here now mind you this is probably during one of the worst macroeconomic conditions out there especially for a finance company and yet they're actually starting to turn a profit now their users are growing and they're even expecting the full year to be better than previously expected so if anything the stock should be climbing by double digits not crashing but again it's just that shortsighted kind of mentality by Wall Street of uh really caring more about this one immediate quarter while refusing to look at the entire picture and that's what's going to actually bring us to reason number three which is the future potential for them longterm that really short-term Traders on Wall Street couldn't care less about about now really the biggest reason why I choose to invest in SoFi myself as a long-term investor is because the entire Banking and Financial Services model of the past really does need to be revamped everything is turning more digital by the day and I just don't think most people need to go into a physical Branch as often as before to get basic tasks done and sure many banks are now offering more robust online platforms which is great and I still continue to invest in some banks myself too I like to have the exposure and the diversity and all that but in my opinion nobody does a better job of bringing everything together into one very simple but still very robust and easy to use online platform better than Sofi whether it's investing student loans like other types of loans mortgages banking uh savings refinancing Insurance credit cards whatever it is you can usually get most of it done right there in one place on Sofi and it's super fast and streamlined and convenient and I actually love to use to myself too but if it wasn't you don't have to take my word for it if it wasn't a popular choice among consumers that is like really disrupting the industry then we wouldn't see their user counts soore by such large amounts every single quarter adding another more than half a million members just in the last quarter alone which by the way having so many users Under One Roof regardless of what the specific product they're using is will it allow Sofi to cross sell multiple products to the same users which is why their products growth is so high as well adding almost a million more products last quarter as it benefits from a bit of Snowball Effect like compounding growth it's it's all really good for them now keep in mind that in the past Sofi did feel much of their growth by acquiring other companies and platforms like they did with Galileo which in turn hurt their profitability and for a long time caused them to generate heavy losses but what we've seen now is two profitable quarters in a row of Gap net income profits which Sofi says that we can expect to see in every quarter moving forward too and that's huge because the stock already trades in my opinion at a pretty attractive valuation based on sales with a PS of less than three which is lower than most of its peers but I believe that as their profitability rapidly scales up the valuation will get even more attractive when it's based on profits for example analysts are now projecting close to 200% EPS growth on average over the next 5 years and when you look at their projected EPS for 2026 well it's expected to grow to 50 cents a share so if you divide that from today's stock price translates to a PE ratio of only 14 even if that's you know still two years away I think that's dirt cheap for a fintech disruptor like this that has gigantic room for growth in the future in fact many analysts project the fintech market to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030 and the lending Market to surpass 15 trillion by 2033 I'm not saying Sofi will dominate these markets but considering that they only did two billion in sales in all of last year the growth opportunities here are pretty massive again especially for a still relatively small but upand coming disruptor like this cuz even if they can manage to capture just like a fractional piece of those markets I still think that that would translate to substantial gains for both the company and the stock so in conclusion this is why I still have pretty high hopes for Sofi I think the stock is beaten down at the moment because really Wall Street is more focused on the short-term issues rather than the long-term opportuni and granted the economy is pretty trash right now and if we go into a deep recession I do think Sofi like most other stocks in the market would get heavily punished especially for a fintech like this you know if the economy crashes and people stop using their services or struggle to make payments other issues arise like that then we could actually see their profits dip back down into negative territory and I think that would start to dominate all the headlines the stock would start crashing and all the negativity would just kind of start snowballing at that point which to be fair is probably the reason why Wall Street is so concerned about anything here even in the short term like the upcoming quarter and they're being so sensitive on the stock at the moment and I do think that all of that is something to keep in mind again the the environment is not very favorable to a company like this and that's especially the case if we go into a recession so um you know I've always called Sofi a high-risk category type of stock and I still believe that it remains one today even if they are starting to become profitable usually I reserve calling a stock very high risk or speculative if they're not profitable now Sofi is starting to turn a profit so it's a little less risky than before and I'm starting to feel a little more confident but given the macro environment I you know I'm still not too confident in sofa and I still try to limit my position to a smaller one but uh I would also say that as a long-term minded investor with you know I think I have a pretty strong stomach that can withstand a lot of volatility in the market and I only see dips and crashes as more buying opportunities rather than something to fear or be worried about well because of that I am willing to take a chance on a bright upand Comer like Sofi and that's why I'm picking up shares on any dips and that's especially the case on this one too so I'm going to continue to do that and if I continue to see more dips I'll probably pick up more",
