    "excerpt": "with Tesla's recent rise I started looking deeper into their markets could you give me some names to look into for the robotaxi market...I'm actually not going to go with Tesla at number one instead I'm going with Google...moving on to stock number two I really can't do a robo taxi video without including the most hyped name in the space for sure the most talked about going to have to go with Tesla tiger symbol TSLA which I can actually make the robo taxi case for very simply first of all nobody is at the level of Tesla when it comes to autonomous driving in fact it's estimated that they're already driving over 5 million miles of full self-driving every single day whereas weo for comparison is only doing a few thousand and they're likely the biggest competitor at the moment but this isn't even the I would say biggest reason why I feel they're they're so far ahead that honor goes to the millions of customers out there on the road doing all the hard work for Tesla for free mind you collecting hundreds of billions of miles of data that can be used to train their algorithms and their neural network Now you might be thinking yeah but not every Tesla out there is you know using full self-driving guys that doesn't even matter Tesla has something called Shadow mode that is running in the background running in in the background of their vehicles and it's generating control inputs without actually executing them and then it analyzes the discrepancies between those inputs and the actual Maneuvers and actions that are done by the drivers so that the entire platform can learn from them and become even smarter it's pretty crazy and that giant benefit alone that they have over the competition I think will make Tesla's platform perform much better than the rest over time not to mention the fact of course that Tesla already does everything inhouse with their own chips and even super Computing platform called Dojo obviously we only got a glimpse of this potential at their recent Robo taxi event but the fact that Tesla makes their own cars and has all these capabilities all the hardware and software for autonomy means they'll be able to scale up much faster than you might think too which at scale they're projecting that the robo taxi rides will be several times cheaper than traditional ride haing Services per mile while even being lower than personal car ownership too that's pretty wild and with the service already planning to launch in California and Texas by next year it's just another reason why so many analysts are so bullish on the stock like AR invest for example who predicts Robo taxi Revenue will make up around 44% of their total and a whopping 64% of their profits too helping lift the stock up to their 2027 Target of $2,000 per share Now for context Tesla currently trades for around 300 today now granted that price has skyrocketed this past month following the presidential election of trump which Elon has become very close with even helping him get elected and even that too though should come back I would say to help Tesla since probably the biggest hurdle of all for robo taxis will be government regulation well regardless of how you feel about Elon or Trump politically you have to admit that those two are always talking and kind of campaigning on deregulation so I wouldn't be surprised at all if that partnership actually ends up helping Elon Musk and Tesla to get to Market faster with robotx to now I admit that I'm not very excited about where the stock currently trades right now considering the lower growth that they're experiencing in this currently weak economy but longer term especially for the robo taxi Market Tesla does have a lot of future potential all right now I'll grant you that Tesla stock is pretty expensive at the moment...because BYU is so strong in this area they were even chosen by Tesla to partner up with in the country providing them with their extremely valuable mapping data",

    "excerpt": "instead I'm going with Google ticker symbol g o l and the reason is very simple like Tim said the robo taxi Market is going to take time until it fully develops into the hyper growth Market that we all kind of expected to be long term...because of that you know having a stock like Google who actually does so many other things on top of autonomous driving well I think it makes it just so much more attractive and really safer of an investment which in their case they have number one market share in digital advertising email web browser smartphone operating system web search video streaming their third in cloud and so much more they're even number one in mapping which is also going to be obviously very important for autonomous driving but speaking of which they also own wh Mo on top of everything else which admittedly is still relatively small in the grand scheme of things but it's been you know around for years developing their Technologies and they've even started to ramp up um at a faster rate more more recently going from around 10,000 weekly paid autonomous rides up to over a 100,000 in just the past year that's a 10 times increase in only 12 months plus they also just Rose over $5 billion in new funding to expand the robo taxi service into new markets next year which by the way that funding also means that the company is already worth over $45 billion in valuation just as a subsidiary for Google alone now Google stock itself is up a lot like you know most other stocks in the market right now but the valuation is actually still pretty attractive with the PEG ratio that is shockingly still cheaper than the sector because of their incredible growth at their already massive size in fact they're doing around 300 billion in sales per year and are still somehow growing at a double digit rate so you know if you tell me that I can get all of this for that price and even Some solid exposure into the robotaxi market too with weo as a subsidiary well yeah I'm going to take that all day Google is already my number one I would say favorite stock in the market just on its own and I love it for this reason here too",

    "excerpt": "if you want a much cheaper option for the RO taxi Market you might want to consider a Chinese alternative like by ticker symbol BIDU who by the way is also extremely similar to Google our number one pick with currently the most search market share in China the third most Cloud a giant player in AI with actually more AI patents than any other company in the entire world uh but it also has giant exposure to the robo taxi Market through their subsidiary Apollo just like Google that Google has wh BYU has has Apollo and by the way Apollo is no joke either in fact they were the very first Robo taxi service to get approved in China and yet like I said this is a much cheaper stock in fact they're actually negative over the past 10 years having lost well over half of their entire value and leaving a dirt cheap valuation with PE ratios that are over 40% cheaper than the sector 2 now of course the reason for that is because they are Chinese there's a lot of inherent risk from being a Chinese stock because of their structures that leave you know little shareholder rights especially you know for foreign shareholders among other issues too like Rising tensions with the US which could potentially get you know even worse under a trump presidency so you've been warned about that however there's also some benefits to being a Chinese company especially in the robo taxi Market not only because China has over half of the world's electric vehicles but they were also the fastest to approve robotaxi operations with Apollo themselves already planning to launch an over a 100 Chinese cities by 2030 which by the way because BYU is so strong in this area they were even chosen by Tesla to partner up with in the country providing them with their extremely valuable mapping data so I just think that there's a ton of future potential for this company and also the stock if it can uh you know really overcome some of those hurdles of being higher risk because of the Chinese factor",
