have reached an all-time high in America how could Wall Street be impacted let's dive in really excited about the guest we have joining us today we have Dylan Jovan with behind the markets Dylan you've been on our Channel a couple of times talking about biotech his stock picks earlier this year uh have now doubled in Valu since we last talked Dylan and we're excited not doing biotech this time this time talking about a different industry something everyone's talking about and that's the housing market what got you interested in this Dylan well thank you for having me here it's it's nice to be on uh I'm grateful to be here but you know what actually what got me interested in in the housing market specifically is um I have a lot of people that work with us and they make really good incomes and a lot of friends of mine make really good incomes and they're having trouble affording a house you know this is the foundation of the American dream so I started saying to myself well gosh why do people two income families six figures why are they having so much trouble affording a house what what is this all about so I really started to ask that question and I started to dig in to the root causes about of that and what I found was you know disturbing yeah what did you find I think that's the question that everyone's been asking because housing prices have just kept getting higher the last few years everyone is is talking about how houses are just not affordable anymore did you find that magic answer everyone's been looking for well first I don't think people realize I was surprised to learn just how expensive they had gotten just to give you some context they are right now more expensive houses than they were in 2006 23% more expensive and we use that we know that because you know in the stock market you have a PE ratio or price to earnings ratio which tells you the price of a company based on the earnings of the past 12 months well in the Home Market they have what's called a pi ratio price to income so basically what they do is they look at average homes in relation to average income now historically for the last 50 years since records have been kept in any meaningful modern sense uh the price to income ratio was about 3.4 meaning if you made $100,000 on average the average person made $100,000 the Aver a home would cost 3.4 that or $340,000 in the 2006 bubble that reached a high a then historic record of 4.7 meaning that housing prices were 4.7 times more expensive than the average income well right now we're at 5.8 wow so we are 23% higher than the housing bubble that caused the Great Recession and and the you know the financial crisis of 2008 2009 yeah that is a scary statistic and we all know what happened back then with all the foreclosures and the empty houses that we saw sitting around on the market for quite a while during that season but right now I feel like we're seeing something different in the housing market and that's that demand is still there lots of people are still looking for a home right now despite the very high prices that's right and you know what's what's interesting so if the average person in America so home prices of in the past 10 years since 2014 the average income's gone up 13.8% $73,000 a year so basically home prices could do anything they want in the short term but in the long term they're based on incomes I mean think about it a mortgage company's bank's going to look at your income and say okay we're going to write you a loan based on a third-year income so no matter what they have to approximate incomes in the long term so we have a two prong problem here two-sided issue here one is that housing prices have to come down the other is as you mentioned we still have demand people still want houses so what we've come to find out is that we have a supply problem there just isn't enough houses on the market and Zillow estimates that we are about four and a half million houses short of total demand now because of the inflation that we've had in the past few years a lot of folks aren't going to be buying those big three four 5,000 you know square foot mcmansions anymore they can't afford them we're going to have to there so what kind of homes can they afford so we're actually starting to now look at uh what is what size home should people who make $74,000 you know afford and that's kind of brought us to to where we are today well that all sounds like an opportunity for a company out there and also opportunity for investors who might be looking to to get in on that kind of a market uh what do you have for today well okay so there are a few small companies that manufacture you know they call them manufactured homes they used to call Modular Homes but you know basically one of them is Champion Homes symbol is Sky it's at 9315 now this is one of the largest Builders of manufactured homes I me their home home sold jumped 37% in the past year it's backlog jumped 28% earnings of 91 cents beat estimates by 21% you know ear you know I mean it's just crushing it so you see this new you know demand for these smaller houses that people can afford instead of these 3,000 4,000 5,000 square foot houses you're seeing these companies that are manufacturing 800 1500 2,000 square foot houses go Bonkers Champions right at the top of the list okay so Champion Homes definitely getting these houses affordable houses out quicker and that's something that's been heard a lot on the campaign trail from lots of different people running for office right now it's a topic that across the country everyone cares about so how is that impacting the stock well it's a great point you bring up as a matter of fact both major political candidates have talked about expanding the supply of uh single family homes on the market so that's one of the reasons a great question that Champion Homes has really been just killing it this year just absolutely killing it and as the FED keeps lowering rates they should do very very well as either candidate gets in office is going to be pushing to alleviate this uh housing Supply crisis frankly so Champions at the top of the list are there others stocks or companies like Champion out there that are also getting on that more affordable housing market absolutely another one is cavco Industries symbol AS cvco and this is also one of the largest makers of manufactured homes this includes single family homes they also do RVs vacation cabins they've been doing it for 60 years again this is a story where you have home sales volume up 20% backlog up 21% but that's not yet priced into the stock which is why billionaire investors like Paul tutor Jones Ray Doo and Joel greenblat have been buying the heck out of this stock those are some pretty big names you mentioned that are buying up this stock but how recently have those investors been buying up Capco Industries that's a great question I mean this is the most recent SEC filings we see that Paul tutor Jones Ray Delio Jo Joel greenblat either owned positions and started upgrading theirs or just came in now and started massive buying of these stocks so this is all live and it's all very current within the past few months and the stock has not moved much since they started buying so this is a great entry price for investors that are interested in this kind of uh supply problem with housing and the companies that are going to solve it we talk about upside for a minute just how much upside you think in investors could get if they're getting in now on this company I believe cavco is selling for half you know 50% below what it's worth I also believe the same thing about Sky I actually believe this is a $200 stock I mean it's selling at $93 right now but you know given the right circumstances this stock can really really really take off now do you have one more pick for us that's kind of in the same space of looking to take advantage of the need for more affordable homes well I have a few more picks but those are for our paying customers but I did of course bring another pick for you in the housing area that I actually like a lot uh and that's Toll Brothers this is kind of a name that everybody knows um and what I like about them they don't really specifically Focus they're not known for so focusing on smaller houses but they do make build to order homes which I like a lot because they don't get stuck carrying a thousands 2,000 5,000 homes on their inventory all the time they basically can build build a home to the size and taste of the buyer which gives them immediate flexibility to really go down and customize smaller homes uh for much more affordable prices so in my view that is of the Legacy bigname home builders that we all know uh every day Toll Brothers is probably best fit and Geared for this kind of thing couple of other things to point out about them I mean this is just such a well-run business massive stock BuyBacks I mean they have taken their float from 184 million shares outstanding 10 years ago to just 107 million now okay so what is it trading at right now is this kind of a bargain buy for investors yeah so this is trading at just 12 times free cash flow which is 35 40% lower than it has historically so you have a company that is growing its business that is buying back its stock that is trading historically cheap I mean the company is doing all the right things and as the FED keeps slowing rates that should send this stock soaring too that's a great tip for investors out there now with this stock and the others that we've talked about I want to talk about just the commodity prices does that impact the potential for these we've had such a range in commodity prices over the last few years it is getting better now but can that impact the riskiness maybe of some of these buys well I mean so basically commodity prices by the way they are going down right now they've been going down a lot which tells you that construction isn't great which is by the a recession warning sign you know it tells you that you know this is a this is a problem so we are keeping an eye on this of course but you know commodity prices go down that should make it this is why this is a hedge position that should make it easier for everybody they should be able to sell these units a cheaper prices which in theory would just expand the market get a lot more buyers and fill that four and a half million Supply Gap quicker well you gave us three great picks today that are involved in the the demand for more housing across the country but I know you have a lot more tell us where viewers can go to find more of the stock picks that you have in this industry well you're probably not going to have to go far because we we do a lot of stuff with Market bead but feel free to go to behindthe markets.com that's releasing our special report on housing a research report we spent the last four months doing only at Market beat we're breaking this special story you're getting a quick early preview of what kind of the things we're talking about in that report but that'll be out for our customers first of course

was surprised to learn just how expensive they had gotten just to give you some context they are right now more expensive houses than they were in 2006 23% more expensive and we use that we know that because you know in the stock market you have a PE ratio or price to earnings ratio which tells you the price of a company based on the earnings of the past 12 months well in the Home Market they have what's called a pi ratio price to income so basically what they do is they look at average homes in relation to average income now historically for the last 50 years since records have been kept in any meaningful modern sense uh the price to income ratio was about 3.4 meaning if you made $100,000 on average the average person made $100,000 the Aver a home would cost 3.4 that or $340,000 in the 2006 bubble that reached a high a then historic record of 4.7 meaning that housing prices were 4.7 times more expensive than the average income well right now we're at 5.8 wow so we are 23% higher than the housing bubble that caused the Great Recession and and the you know the financial crisis of 2008 2009 yeah that is a scary statistic and we all know what happened back then with all the foreclosures and the empty houses that we saw sitting around on the market for quite a while during that season but right now I feel like we're seeing something different in the housing market and that's that demand is still there lots of people are still looking for a home right now despite the very high prices that's right and you know what's what's interesting so if the average person in America so home prices of in the past 10 years since 2014 the average income's gone up 13.8% $73,000 a year so basically home prices could do anything they want in the short term but in the long term they're based on incomes I mean think about it a mortgage company's bank's going to look at your income and say okay we're going to write you a loan based on a third-year income so no matter what they have to approximate incomes in the long term so we have a two prong problem here two-sided issue here one is that housing prices have to come down the other is as you mentioned we still have demand people still want houses so what we've come to find out is that we have a supply problem there just isn't enough houses on the market and Zillow estimates that we are about four and a half million houses short of total demand now because of the inflation that we've had in the past few years a lot of folks aren't going to be buying those big three four 5,000 you know square foot mcmansions anymore they can't afford them we're going to have to there so what kind of homes can they afford so we're actually starting to now look at uh what is what size home should people who make $74,000 you know afford and that's kind of brought us to to where we are today well that all sounds like an opportunity for a company out there and also opportunity for investors who might be looking to to get in on that kind of a market uh what do you have for today well okay so there are a few small companies that manufacture you know they call them manufactured homes they used to call Modular Homes but you know basically one of them is Champion Homes symbol is Sky it's at 9315 now this is one of the largest Builders of manufactured homes I me their home home sold jumped 37% in the past year it's backlog jumped 28% earnings of 91 cents beat estimates by 21% you know ear you know I mean it's just crushing it so you see this new you know demand for these smaller houses that people can afford instead of these 3,000 4,000 5,000 square foot houses you're seeing these companies that are manufacturing 800 1500 2,000 square foot houses go Bonkers Champions right at the top of the list okay so Champion Homes definitely getting these houses affordable houses out quicker and that's something that's been heard a lot on the campaign trail from lots of different people running for office right now it's a topic that across the country everyone cares about so how is that impacting the stock well it's a great point you bring up as a matter of fact both major political candidates have talked about expanding the supply of uh single family homes on the market so that's one of the reasons a great question that Champion Homes has really been just killing it this year just absolutely killing it and as the FED keeps lowering rates they should do very very well as either candidate gets in office is going to be pushing to alleviate this uh housing Supply crisis frankly so Champions at the top of the list are there others stocks or companies like Champion out there that are also getting on that more affordable housing market absolutely another one is cavco Industries symbol AS cvco and this is also one of the largest makers of manufactured homes this includes single family homes they also do RVs vacation cabins they've been doing it for 60 years again this is a story where you have home sales volume up 20% backlog up 21% but that's not yet priced into the stock which is why billionaire investors like Paul tutor Jones Ray Doo and Joel greenblat have been buying the heck out of this stock those are some pretty big names you mentioned that are buying up this stock but how recently have those investors been buying up Capco Industries that's a great question I mean this is the most recent SEC filings we see that Paul tutor Jones Ray Delio Jo Joel greenblat either owned positions and started upgrading theirs or just came in now and started massive buying of these stocks so this is all live and it's all very current within the past few months and the stock has not moved much since they started buying so this is a great entry price for investors that are interested in this kind of uh supply problem with housing and the companies that are going to solve it we talk about upside for a minute just how much upside you think in investors could get if they're getting in now on this company I believe cavco is selling for half you know 50% below what it's worth I also believe the same thing about Sky I actually believe this is a $200 stock I mean it's selling at $93 right now but you know given the right circumstances this stock can really really really take off now do you have one more pick for us that's kind of in the same space of looking to take advantage of the need for more affordable homes well I have a few more picks but those are for our paying customers but I did of course bring another pick for you in the housing area that I actually like a lot uh and that's Toll Brothers this is kind of a name that everybody knows um and what I like about them they don't really specifically Focus they're not known for so focusing on smaller houses but they do make build to order homes which I like a lot because they don't get stuck carrying a thousands 2,000 5,000 homes on their inventory all the time they basically can build build a home to the size and taste of the buyer which gives them immediate flexibility to really go down and customize smaller homes uh for much more affordable prices so in my view that is of the Legacy bigname home builders that we all know uh every day Toll Brothers is probably best fit and Geared for this kind of thing couple of other things to point out about them I mean this is just such a well-run business massive stock BuyBacks I mean they have taken their float from 184 million shares outstanding 10 years ago to just 107 million now okay so what is it trading at right now is this kind of a bargain buy for investors yeah so this is trading at just 12 times free cash flow which is 35 40% lower than it has historically so you have a company that is growing its business that is buying back its stock that is trading historically cheap I mean the company is doing all the right things and as the FED keeps slowing rates that should send this stock soaring too that's a great tip for investors out there now with this stock and the others that we've talked about I want to talk about just the commodity prices does that impact the potential for these we've had such a range in commodity prices over the last few years it is getting better now but can that impact the riskiness maybe of some of these buys well I mean so basically commodity prices by the way they are going down right now they've been going down a lot which tells you that construction isn't great which is by the a recession warning sign you know it tells you that you know this is a this is a problem so we are keeping an eye on this of course but you know commodity prices go down that should make it this is why this is a hedge position that should make it easier for everybody they should be able to sell these units a cheaper prices which in theory would just expand the market get a lot more buyers and fill that four and a half million Supply Gap quicker well you gave us three great picks today that are involved in the the demand for more housing across the country but I know you have a lot more tell us where viewers can go to find more of the stock picks that you have in this industry well you're probably not going to have to go far because we we do a lot of stuff with Market bead but feel free to go to behindthe markets.com that's releasing our special report on housing a research report we spent the last four months doing only

drop in interest rates make 2025 the year of the small caps let's dive in here to talk about three small cap stocks you maybe haven't heard of but could bring some really good returns this year is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris uh let's start with why small caps what's going on with that industry right now well there's some feeling that with interest rates going down uh it could be a good year for small caps they've it's been terrible to own small caps over the last couple of years because many of these companies uh rely on debt to finance their operations they're not profitable yet and so in a rising interest rate Market that debt becomes more expensive to carry therefore the stock price generally goes down because that impacts earnings especially if the companies aren't profitable yet so the thinking is that high that lower interest rates excuse me will make the cost of money lower it'll allow this company to finance their debt easier and therefore it should lead to some stock price appreciation there are differing opinions about it but in general the idea is if you that small caps may be one area that investors may want to look at especially if they have a little bit of a speculative taste well that speculative taste usually leads to some pretty good gains at least good gain potential and that's what we see with your first pick let's go into the the first stock that you have on your list of three small cap stocks that are poised for some good growth this year right so the first one I uh I was looking at I was using the market beat stock screener by the way when I was doing this so the stock screener is a great tool to use I did it for this one I was looking in particular for stocks that were going to have at least 10% projected earnings growth over the next 12 months and just to see where it led me my first pick is star bulk carriers now this is a dry bulk shipping company so the Port strike is fresh on every Investor's mind uh you know the importance of these companies in terms of getting uh goods and services into our ports and therefore into the broader economy what I found interesting about star bolk is not only are they the biggest US listed carrier in terms of Fleet size they have like 160 vessels but one of their primary Market markets is China and that got me looking at them a little bit closer and one of the things that they said in their most recent earnings report is that they were noticing a 7.6 increase in shipments into China through July of 20124 the significance of that for me at least was that was before China announced these massive stimulus measures that they just announced so I would expect that you're going to start seeing more Imports into China especially in the areas of iron iron ore because China is one of the leading providers of Steel still regardless of any tff situation so I would expect that to go up then you have to look at valuation at 6.9 times forward earnings analysts give the stock about a 28% upside and that goes along with a 12.2% dividend yield again the valuation itself may not mean much but when you combine it with positive analyst sentiment and a great dividend yield star buul is one that investors may want to take a close look at that's very interesting as you said this company definitely got hit the last couple of years with the stock going down a little bit when there was less of you know just the interest rate situation and things like that any concern that it's not yet back to those uh historic highs the biggest concern I would have with star buul at this point would be Energy prices we're already starting to see an up ticket oil prices and ironically there were some people that said well you don't have to worry about oil prices going higher because China demand is down well now China demand is up and so that means oil prices are likely to keep going up that would be maybe my one concern here with the stock but otherwise I still think this is a good play right now because I think there's going to be increased demand that'll make up for that any for any upside in oil prices let's move on to your second pick Chris and this one is on your list for not the best reason right so we've talked about evolved Technologies before on the channel and um one of the reasons why it it's on my list right now is unfortunately we did have another school shooting and those are becoming all too common and um this isn't the place to talk about the reasons why or reasons to prevent that but one of the things I've noticed about evolved Technologies is the Stock's up about 59.9% in the last 90 days and I can't help but think there's not a that's not a coincidence um this company manufactures touchless um security systems so it's the next generation of metal detectors it allows people to pass through the system very quickly without having to open bags or raise your hands over your head or do any of that stuff and it's AI driven they use AI as the backbone for their entire system it's turning out to be very effective in detecting guns and detecting small uh knives uh anything that would be potentially used as a weapon and they've got every professional sports league has at least one if not more franchises using it they've got um churches schools hospitals using it the concern that some people might have about the stock is until the last quarter it wasn't profitable but it did turn a profit in its last quarter and that's expected to continue but it's something to watch for the other thing that some investors are concerned about is does this company have a moat in other words there are competitors there other companies that are trying to get into this field um but I think one thing that investors could look at is the annual recurring revenue for evolve continues to grow and that means that they're not losing customers once they get them and that's a very positive so Chris how much growth opportunity could there be for their stock especially considering it just had a near 60% runup yeah that's that's kind of an interesting point here because despite that runup um analysts are still believing that you could still see another about 51% upside to the stock that would be a price target of about $5.75 and it's still down about 177% for the year despite the runup so there are gains to be made here again it's a speculative stock but it's one that you might want to keep your eye on especially if you're looking at that convergence of small cap and AI all right all good information now let's move on to your last pick of the day Chris what are you going with so this is a company that quite honestly Bridget it was new to me it's called Central Garden and Pet and the uh the ticker symbol is senta c n ta very simple company business model in terms terms of if you just look at the name they have two business verticals one is garden supplies one is pet supplies um they interestingly I noticed they don't really it from what I saw on their website they don't really get into the pet food area a lot it's more of the the treats and the toys and other peripheral items that pet owners might have but what I did notice is they've noticed that the pet their pet business is very strong because of the um the willingness of consumers to pay a premium to keep their pets happy and healthy and the Garden business is doing well and so it seems to me that you've got two business verticals that consumers are willing to spend money on so I looked at the stock a little bit closer and I said okay well okay what's the opportunity here and the stock is up 7 and a half% in 2024 which okay that might not be that much but it's not bad for a for a quote unquote retail stock absolutely and you know I just adopted a new dog I we've had him about three weeks and I'm like yes pet owners are willing to spend all kinds of money to keep their pets happy right right exactly U but there are a lot of pet companies out there there's lots of these kinds of products what sets this company apart you know I think one of the things that sets this company apart is just the fact that it's really focused on its back balance sheet it really seems to kind of know where its Niche is and staying in its Lane uh it's got a strong e-commerce business which is good for it and I think that's really what you're looking at you're looking for a company that's that's fundamentally sound has a solid balance sheet and just it has a niche in this market and it's playing in that Niche very well as far as growth potential why would this industry this very consumer discretionary stock have so much growth potential in the next 12 months well I think it's again you're seeing interest rates go down and eventually that's going to trickle into the consumer who has already shown even with higher interest rates they were willing to spend in these categories so you'd have to imagine that that spending is just going to increase as the discretionary dollars become more available and analysts seem to agree with that on Market beat the price target for the stock is $43 and that's an increase of about 40 40 to 45% above where it's at now again a stock like this is kind of speculative but if you're looking for something in a retail space that's that's a hard upside to ignore oh yeah I had definitely not heard of that company before may have been new to some of our listeners as well so thank you for bringing that one out to our attention and kind of giving us a deep dive into three small cap stocks that have some great potential right now you can find more about all of these stocks right on market beat.com and we do a lot of coverage of other stocks just like this that maybe you haven't heard of that

drop in interest rates make 2025 the year of the small caps let's dive in here to talk about three small cap stocks you maybe haven't heard of but could bring some really good returns this year is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris uh let's start with why small caps what's going on with that industry right now well there's some feeling that with interest rates going down uh it could be a good year for small caps they've it's been terrible to own small caps over the last couple of years because many of these companies uh rely on debt to finance their operations they're not profitable yet and so in a rising interest rate Market that debt becomes more expensive to carry therefore the stock price generally goes down because that impacts earnings especially if the companies aren't profitable yet so the thinking is that high that lower interest rates excuse me will make the cost of money lower it'll allow this company to finance their debt easier and therefore it should lead to some stock price appreciation there are differing opinions about it but in general the idea is if you that small caps may be one area that investors may want to look at especially if they have a little bit of a speculative taste well that speculative taste usually leads to some pretty good gains at least good gain potential and that's what we see with your first pick let's go into the the first stock that you have on your list of three small cap stocks that are poised for some good growth this year right so the first one I uh I was looking at I was using the market beat stock screener by the way when I was doing this so the stock screener is a great tool to use I did it for this one I was looking in particular for stocks that were going to have at least 10% projected earnings growth over the next 12 months and just to see where it led me my first pick is star bulk carriers now this is a dry bulk shipping company so the Port strike is fresh on every Investor's mind uh you know the importance of these companies in terms of getting uh goods and services into our ports and therefore into the broader economy what I found interesting about star bolk is not only are they the biggest US listed carrier in terms of Fleet size they have like 160 vessels but one of their primary Market markets is China and that got me looking at them a little bit closer and one of the things that they said in their most recent earnings report is that they were noticing a 7.6 increase in shipments into China through July of 20124 the significance of that for me at least was that was before China announced these massive stimulus measures that they just announced so I would expect that you're going to start seeing more Imports into China especially in the areas of iron iron ore because China is one of the leading providers of Steel still regardless of any tff situation so I would expect that to go up then you have to look at valuation at 6.9 times forward earnings analysts give the stock about a 28% upside and that goes along with a 12.2% dividend yield again the valuation itself may not mean much but when you combine it with positive analyst sentiment and a great dividend yield star buul is one that investors may want to take a close look at that's very interesting as you said this company definitely got hit the last couple of years with the stock going down a little bit when there was less of you know just the interest rate situation and things like that any concern that it's not yet back to those uh historic highs the biggest concern I would have with star buul at this point would be Energy prices we're already starting to see an up ticket oil prices and ironically there were some people that said well you don't have to worry about oil prices going higher because China demand is down well now China demand is up and so that means oil prices are likely to keep going up that would be maybe my one concern here with the stock but otherwise I still think this is a good play right now because I think there's going to be increased demand that'll make up for that any for any upside in oil prices let's move on to your second pick Chris and this one is on your list for not the best reason right so we've talked about evolved Technologies before on the channel and um one of the reasons why it it's on my list right now is unfortunately we did have another school shooting and those are becoming all too common and um this isn't the place to talk about the reasons why or reasons to prevent that but one of the things I've noticed about evolved Technologies is the Stock's up about 59.9% in the last 90 days and I can't help but think there's not a that's not a coincidence um this company manufactures touchless um security systems so it's the next generation of metal detectors it allows people to pass through the system very quickly without having to open bags or raise your hands over your head or do any of that stuff and it's AI driven they use AI as the backbone for their entire system it's turning out to be very effective in detecting guns and detecting small uh knives uh anything that would be potentially used as a weapon and they've got every professional sports league has at least one if not more franchises using it they've got um churches schools hospitals using it the concern that some people might have about the stock is until the last quarter it wasn't profitable but it did turn a profit in its last quarter and that's expected to continue but it's something to watch for the other thing that some investors are concerned about is does this company have a moat in other words there are competitors there other companies that are trying to get into this field um but I think one thing that investors could look at is the annual recurring revenue for evolve continues to grow and that means that they're not losing customers once they get them and that's a very positive so Chris how much growth opportunity could there be for their stock especially considering it just had a near 60% runup yeah that's that's kind of an interesting point here because despite that runup um analysts are still believing that you could still see another about 51% upside to the stock that would be a price target of about $5.75 and it's still down about 177% for the year despite the runup so there are gains to be made here again it's a speculative stock but it's one that you might want to keep your eye on especially if you're looking at that convergence of small cap and AI all right all good information now let's move on to your last pick of the day Chris what are you going with so this is a company that quite honestly Bridget it was new to me it's called Central Garden and Pet and the uh the ticker symbol is senta c n

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,ypJGMDDg95Y,MarketBeat,2024-09-30 21:01:25+00:00,Inflation-Busting Dividends: 3 Stocks Raising Payouts 4X Faster,Kind: captions Language: en inflation is now down to 2.2% but are your Investments keeping up here to talk about three stocks that are not only keeping up with inflation they're actually beating it by four times is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris inflation has been a part of our lives and the economic story for years now um but some fairly good news came out just this last week correct um so the rate of inflation uh which means the rate at which inflation is growing it uh continues to come down the pce personal consumption expenditures index reading for the month of August was released on September 207th and it came in at 2.2% slightly above the fed's preferred Target of 2% but less so than it was perhaps when certainly when when that number was up around seven eight even nine per. yeah hard for anything to keep up with that rate uh now at 2.2% it might be a little bit easier for some especially dividend stocks to maybe keep up with that but not all of them do but you have spent some time looking for three stocks that are great dividend increasers uh talk about what do we usually see in the stock market for dividends actually choosing to increase is it common that they do it every year I wouldn't say it's common I think most companies try to at least match their dividend from the year before but what you really love is when you see the companies that do try to grow their dividend every year but even when they do they don't necessarily grow them at a rate that keeps up with inflation in the case of the three companies that I put in my article the growth in their dividend year-over-year is not only keeping up with that 2.2 inflation Target it's actually beating it by more than four times a four times in is something I think any investor would be looking for let's get to your first pick Chris which stock are you seeing with a lot of growth in their dividends the first stock that I put in my article was Hershey's it's increased its dividend by 15% the last time it did it uh that was this year the three-year average annualized return on their dividend is 12.2% um so again over the last three years it's been keeping up with not only keeping up with inflation but it's been beating inflation with the type of return that dividend investors have been getting the stock itself is up about 4.3% this year that's really good for a consumer discretionary stock like Hershey's that's not common among them this year and it's happening despite the fact that cocoa prices have been eating into the company's earnings a little bit now in the article I did bring up that there are some concerns that go P1 drugs are going to eat into Hershey's revenue and earnings I'm not seeing that in the numbers for this year and that's when you would be expecting to see it the earnings weakness as I just brought up that's more or less due to Rising cocoa prices which is Commodities are always going to be up and down for a company like Hershey's one area of concern that's come up since I wrote my article is the fact that we have many ports on the east coast of the United States where doc workers may be going on strike as early as midnight tonight we're doing this on Monday the 30th so it could be happening as early as tonight the hay is already in the barn for Hershey's for this year so people looking for their Christmas candy Halloween candy all that stuff it's already there don't worry about it the question for Hershey's is going to be maybe more as it gets into next year if the strike goes on for any length of time there could be some issues when you're starting to talk about Valentine's Day and that could start being reflected in the company's first quarter earnings not sure how much that affects the company in terms of the dividend but just something to think about yeah definitely something to to have on the horizon don't worry I've already stocked up on Plenty of Hershey's for Halloween getting my pantry ready in advance um let's talk about the the history of this company too Hershey's is such a f familiar company name it's been around for a long time does that increase the or help with the strength of its dividends um I don't know if I don't know if the brand name contributes to it but the fact is the company's very well run uh it's got a rock solid balance sheet again it does suffer as any of these companies do it's going to suffer from uh variations in commodity prices but certainly the fact that consumers are familiar with it they're brand loyal to it that's certainly going to help and the fact that the company then makes it a priority to reward their shareholders that's very welcome well speaking of commodity prices we'll move on to your second stock pick and that is Home Depot this company has seen commodity prices changing a lot over the last few years they have and yet over that time the company has increased their dividend by an average of 11.69% over the last three years so again company that's easily outpacing inflation if you been buying and holding the stock the rate at which your dividend is increasing is beating inflation that's what you want to see as an income oriented investor now uh the story with Home Depot it's 26 times forward earnings I put that My article that's a little bit expensive right now however I think what investors should be aware of is that you've been seeing a lot of movement in this stock in the last three months investors were kind of frontloading this stock in anticipation of rate cuts which are supposed to be very beneficial to the housing sector so I'm not so I think you have to take the valuation with a little grain of salt here and say okay theyve bit up the stock high now let's see where it goes from here and unfortunately because of the news we've just gotten this last weekend with hurricane Helen and the major damage that has gone on in the southeast United States that's going to be a Tailwind for companies like Home Depot and Lowe's uh because their products are going to be in demand I mean this is kind of one of those where you kind of have to take what the Market's giving you and it's a sad thing but it's also something that investor can take advantage of especially with the dividend payer Like Home Depot yeah that's an interesting point that hurricane storm season has an impact on these companies um but let's talk about the impact of interest rates that's been all everyone's talking about in inflation and interest rates and now that we've seen those come down does that really matter to the bottom line of these companies are people really holding off on any projects until those interest rates come down you know that's an interesting point Bridget and I'm not sure if I would say like a company Like Home Depot or like Lowe's I kind of would say they're kind of housing adjacent they don't necessarily rely on interest rates but it certainly is helpful for them when you look at interest rates you might look at the home builders you might look at even companies like Zillow that are right there in the actual buying and selling of houses and supply and demand and all that companies like Home Depot and Lowe's they can benefit even when people are staying in their houses because of remodeling projects and different things like that but as we've seen over the last couple of years some of that work has dried up because people did it in 20120 and 2021 and now they don't need to do that anymore and they're going to stay in their house so I think in this particular situation yes lower interest rates which drive more housing activity can be beneficial to Home Depot in this moment right now very good well let's move on to your third pick we had candy we had housing and now on to to another major stable Healthcare yeah yeah it's United Health Group and um healthc care stocks are sort of Evergreen stock everybody needs health insurance we're seeing the demand for health insurance go up certainly not down United Health Group is one of the largest companies by market capitalization they're just also just a huge Healthcare Network almost anybody that has a healthcare policy in some way or another United Health Group touches it um they've been growing their dividend by 14.7% uh on an annualized rate in the last three years one of the Tailwinds for this company is they just recently acquired LHC group and the significance of that is that it's moving United Health Group more into the Home Health Care Arena and this is an area where um there's been a lot of Buzz about this because we're seeing obviously the the baby boomer generation is now well into the retirement years they're getting to that point where you might be looking at you need Extended Care you need a little bit more of assisted living areas and that's something that we don't have the infrastructure in as a c as a country yet but we're building it and companies like LHC group were on the Forefront of that now UA now United Health Group is getting in on that as well so I think that's going to be a big Tailwind for their business this is again a stock that um it's it's not necessarily A flashy stock but it's one that it just it hits in an area where all Americans need to be in and it's a it's just a solid stock for investors yeah absolutely as you said it's one of those largest healthc care companies in the country everyone's heard of it um do you think there's any other environmental economic factors that could impact the future success of this stock or is this just an essential item that's going to continue to grow right now I can't foresee anything happening that would prevent this company from growing I mean I think you'd have to have some sort of radical shift um in public policy that would be unfavorable to private insurers and I just can't see that happening so right now I I think again if you're an investor you want to take what the market gives you and right now the market has been giving you Healthcare especially for the last you know 10 to 15 years well thank you very much for the rundown Chris of three stocks that are giving really great dividend growth year over-year you can find more of the details in Chris's

inflation is now down to 2.2% but are your Investments keeping up here to talk about three stocks that are not only keeping up with inflation they're actually beating it by four times is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris inflation has been a part of our lives and the economic story for years now um but some fairly good news came out just this last week correct um so the rate of inflation uh which means the rate at which inflation is growing it uh continues to come down the pce personal consumption expenditures index reading for the month of August was released on September 207th and it came in at 2.2% slightly above the fed's preferred Target of 2% but less so than it was perhaps when certainly when when that number was up around seven eight even nine per. yeah hard for anything to keep up with that rate uh now at 2.2% it might be a little bit easier for some especially dividend stocks to maybe keep up with that but not all of them do but you have spent some time looking for three stocks that are great dividend increasers uh talk about what do we usually see in the stock market for dividends actually choosing to increase is it common that they do it every year I wouldn't say it's common I think most companies try to at least match their dividend from the year before but what you really love is when you see the companies that do try to grow their dividend every year but even when they do they don't necessarily grow them at a rate that keeps up with inflation in the case of the three companies that I put in my article the growth in their dividend year-over-year is not only keeping up with that 2.2 inflation Target it's actually beating it by more than four times a four times in is something I think any investor would be looking for let's get to your first pick Chris which stock are you seeing with a lot of growth in their dividends the first stock that I put in my article was Hershey's it's increased its dividend by 15% the last time it did it uh that was this year the three-year average annualized return on their dividend is 12.2% um so again over the last three years it's been keeping up with not only keeping up with inflation but it's been beating inflation with the type of return that dividend investors have been getting the stock itself is up about 4.3% this year that's really good for a consumer discretionary stock like Hershey's that's not common among them this year and it's happening despite the fact that cocoa prices have been eating into the company's earnings a little bit now in the article I did bring up that there are some concerns that go P1 drugs are going to eat into Hershey's revenue and earnings I'm not seeing that in the numbers for this year and that's when you would be expecting to see it the earnings weakness as I just brought up that's more or less due to Rising cocoa prices which is Commodities are always going to be up and down for a company like Hershey's one area of concern that's come up since I wrote my article is the fact that we have many ports on the east coast of the United States where doc workers may be going on strike as early as midnight tonight we're doing this on Monday the 30th so it could be happening as early as tonight the hay is already in the barn for Hershey's for this year so people looking for their Christmas candy Halloween candy all that stuff it's already there don't worry about it the question for Hershey's is going to be maybe more as it gets into next year if the strike goes on for any length of time there could be some issues when you're starting to talk about Valentine's Day and that could start being reflected in the company's first quarter earnings not sure how much that affects the company in terms of the dividend but just something to think about yeah definitely something to to have on the horizon don't worry I've already stocked up on Plenty of Hershey's for Halloween getting my pantry ready in advance um let's talk about the the history of this company too Hershey's is such a f familiar company name it's been around for a long time does that increase the or help with the strength of its dividends um I don't know if I don't know if the brand name contributes to it but the fact is the company's very well run uh it's got a rock solid balance sheet again it does suffer as any of these companies do it's going to suffer from uh variations in commodity prices but certainly the fact that consumers are familiar with it they're brand loyal to it that's certainly going to help and the fact that the company then makes it a priority to reward their shareholders that's very welcome well speaking of commodity prices we'll move on to your second stock pick and that is Home Depot this company has seen commodity prices changing a lot over the last few years they have and yet over that time the company has increased their dividend by an average of 11.69% over the last three years so again company that's easily outpacing inflation if you been buying and holding the stock the rate at which your dividend is increasing is beating inflation that's what you want to see as an income oriented investor now uh the story with Home Depot it's 26 times forward earnings I put that My article that's a little bit expensive right now however I think what investors should be aware of is that you've been seeing a lot of movement in this stock in the last three months investors were kind of frontloading this stock in anticipation of rate cuts which are supposed to be very beneficial to the housing sector so I'm not so I think you have to take the valuation with a little grain of salt here and say okay theyve bit up the stock high now let's see where it goes from here and unfortunately because of the news we've just gotten this last weekend with hurricane Helen and the major damage that has gone on in the southeast United States that's going to be a Tailwind for companies like Home Depot and Lowe's uh because their products are going to be in demand I mean this is kind of one of those where you kind of have to take what the Market's giving you and it's a sad thing but it's also something that investor can take advantage of especially with the dividend payer Like Home Depot yeah that's an interesting point that hurricane storm season has an impact on these companies um but let's talk about the impact of interest rates that's been all everyone's talking about in inflation and interest rates and now that we've seen those come down does that really matter to the bottom line of these companies are people really holding off on any projects until those interest rates come down you know that's an interesting point Bridget and I'm not sure if I would say like a company Like Home Depot or like Lowe's I kind of would say they're kind of housing adjacent they don't necessarily rely on interest rates but it certainly is helpful for them when you look at interest rates you might look at the home builders you might look at even companies like Zillow that are right there in the actual buying and selling of houses and supply and demand and all that companies like Home Depot and Lowe's they can benefit even when people are staying in their houses because of remodeling projects and different things like that but as we've seen over the last couple of years some of that work has dried up because people did it in 20120 and 2021 and now they don't need to do that anymore and they're going to stay in their house so I think in this particular situation yes lower interest rates which drive more housing activity can be beneficial to Home Depot in this moment right now very good well let's move on to your third pick we had candy we had housing and now on to to another major stable Healthcare yeah yeah it's United Health Group and um healthc care stocks are sort of Evergreen stock everybody needs health insurance we're seeing the demand for health insurance go up certainly not down United Health Group is one of the largest companies by market capitalization they're just also just a huge Healthcare Network almost anybody that has a healthcare policy in some way or another United Health Group touches it um they've been growing their dividend by 14.7% uh on an annualized rate in the last three years one of the Tailwinds for this company is they just recently acquired LHC group and the significance of that is that it's moving United Health Group more into the Home Health Care Arena and this is an area where um there's been a lot of Buzz about this because we're seeing obviously the the baby boomer generation is now well into the retirement years they're getting to that point where you might be looking at you need Extended Care you need a little bit more of assisted living areas and that's something that we don't have the infrastructure in as a c as a country yet but we're building it and companies like LHC group were on the Forefront of that now UA now United Health Group is getting in on that as well so I think that's going to be a big Tailwind for their business this is again a stock that um it's it's not necessarily A flashy stock but it's one that it just it hits in an area where all Americans need to be in and it's a it's just a solid stock for investors yeah absolutely as you said it's one of those largest healthc care companies in the country everyone's heard of it um do you think there's any other environmental economic factors that could impact the future success of this stock or is this just an essential item that's going to continue to grow right now I can't foresee anything happening that would prevent this company from growing I mean I think you'd have to have some sort of radical shift um in public policy that would be unfavorable to private insurers and I just can't see that happening so right now I I think again if you're an investor you want to take what the market gives you and right now the market has been giving you Healthcare especially for the last you know 10 to 15 years well thank you very much for the rundown Chris of three stocks that are giving really great dividend growth year over-year you can find more of the details in Chris's

wrote my article is the fact that we have many ports on the east coast of the United States where doc workers may be going on strike as early as midnight tonight we're doing this on Monday the 30th so it could be happening as early as tonight the hay is already in the barn for Hershey's for this year so people looking for their Christmas candy Halloween candy all that stuff it's already there don't worry about it the question for Hershey's is going to be maybe more as it gets into next year if the strike goes on for any length of time there could be some issues when you're starting to talk about Valentine's Day and that could start being reflected in the company's first quarter earnings not sure how much that affects the company in terms of the dividend but just something to think about yeah definitely something to to have on the horizon don't worry I've already stocked up on Plenty of Hershey's for Halloween getting my pantry ready in advance um let's talk about the the history of this company too Hershey's is such a f familiar company name it's been around for a long time does that increase the or help with the strength of its dividends um I don't know if I don't know if the brand name contributes to it but the fact is the company's very well run uh it's got a rock solid balance sheet again it does suffer as any of these companies do it's going to suffer from uh variations in commodity prices but certainly the fact that consumers are familiar with it they're brand loyal to it that's certainly going to help and the fact that the company then makes it a priority to reward their shareholders that's very welcome well speaking of commodity prices we'll move on to your second stock pick and that is Home Depot this company has seen commodity prices changing a lot over the last few years they have and yet over that time the company has increased their dividend by an average of 11.69% over the last three years so again company that's easily outpacing inflation if you been buying and holding the stock the rate at which your dividend is increasing is beating inflation that's what you want to see as an income oriented investor now uh the story with Home Depot it's 26 times forward earnings I put that My article that's a little bit expensive right now however I think what investors should be aware of is that you've been seeing a lot of movement in this stock in the last three months investors were kind of frontloading this stock in anticipation of rate cuts which are supposed to be very beneficial to the housing sector so I'm not so I think you have to take the valuation with a little grain of salt here and say okay theyve bit up the stock high now let's see where it goes from here and unfortunately because of the news we've just gotten this last weekend with hurricane Helen and the major damage that has gone on in the southeast United States that's going to be a Tailwind for companies like Home Depot and Lowe's uh because their products are going to be in demand I mean this is kind of one of those where you kind of have to take what the Market's giving you and it's a sad thing but it's also something that investor can take advantage of especially with the dividend payer Like Home Depot yeah that's an interesting point that hurricane storm season has an impact on these companies um but let's talk about the impact of interest rates that's been all everyone's talking about in inflation and interest rates and now that we've seen those come down does that really matter to the bottom line of these companies are people really holding off on any projects until those interest rates come down you know that's an interesting point Bridget and I'm not sure if I would say like a company Like Home Depot or like Lowe's I kind of would say they're kind of housing adjacent they don't necessarily rely on interest rates but it certainly is helpful for them when you look at interest rates you might look at the home builders you might look at even companies like Zillow that are right there in the actual buying and selling of houses and supply and demand and all that companies like Home Depot and Lowe's they can benefit even when people are staying in their houses because of remodeling projects and different things like that but as we've seen over the last couple of years some of that work has dried up because people did it in 20120 and 2021 and now they don't need to do that anymore and they're going to stay in their house so I think in this particular situation yes lower interest rates which drive more housing activity can be beneficial to Home Depot in this moment right now very good well let's move on to your third pick we had candy we had housing and now on to to another major stable Healthcare yeah yeah it's United Health Group and um healthc care stocks are sort of Evergreen stock everybody needs health insurance we're seeing the demand for health insurance go up certainly not down United Health Group is one of the largest companies by market capitalization they're just also just a huge Healthcare Network almost anybody that has a healthcare policy in some way or another United Health Group touches it um they've been growing their dividend by 14.7% uh on an annualized rate in the last three years one of the Tailwinds for this company is they just recently acquired LHC group and the significance of that is that it's moving United Health Group more into the Home Health Care Arena and this is an area where um there's been a lot of Buzz about this because we're seeing obviously the the baby boomer generation is now well into the retirement years they're getting to that point where you might be looking at you need Extended Care you need a little bit more of assisted living areas and that's something that we don't have the infrastructure in as a c as a country yet but we're building it and companies like LHC group were on the Forefront of that now UA now United Health Group is getting in on that as well so I think that's going to be a big Tailwind for their business this is again a stock that um it's it's not necessarily A flashy stock but it's one that it just it hits in an area where all Americans need to be in and it's a it's just a solid stock for investors yeah absolutely as you said it's one of those largest healthc care companies in the country everyone's heard of it um do you think there's any other environmental economic factors that could impact the future success of this stock or is this just an essential item that's going to continue to grow right now I can't foresee anything happening that would prevent this company from growing I mean I think you'd have to have some sort of radical shift um in public policy that would be unfavorable to private insurers and I just can't see that happening so right now I I think again if you're an investor you want to take what the market gives you and right now the market has been giving you Healthcare especially for the last you know 10 to 15 years well thank you very much for the rundown Chris of three stocks that are giving really great dividend growth year over-year you can find more of the details in Chris's article we've got that linked here comment with your thoughts we'd love to hear what you think about any of these companies or about dividend growth in general thanks again for joining us here on

inflation is now down to 2.2% but are your Investments keeping up here to talk about three stocks that are not only keeping up with inflation they're actually beating it by four times is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris inflation has been a part of our lives and the economic story for years now um but some fairly good news came out just this last week correct um so the rate of inflation uh which means the rate at which inflation is growing it uh continues to come down the pce personal consumption expenditures index reading for the month of August was released on September 207th and it came in at 2.2% slightly above the fed's preferred Target of 2% but less so than it was perhaps when certainly when when that number was up around seven eight even nine per. yeah hard for anything to keep up with that rate uh now at 2.2% it might be a little bit easier for some especially dividend stocks to maybe keep up with that but not all of them do but you have spent some time looking for three stocks that are great dividend increasers uh talk about what do we usually see in the stock market for dividends actually choosing to increase is it common that they do it every year I wouldn't say it's common I think most companies try to at least match their dividend from the year before but what you really love is when you see the companies that do try to grow their dividend every year but even when they do they don't necessarily grow them at a rate that keeps up with inflation in the case of the three companies that I put in my article the growth in their dividend year-over-year is not only keeping up with that 2.2 inflation Target it's actually beating it by more than four times a four times in is something I think any investor would be looking for let's get to your first pick Chris which stock are you seeing with a lot of growth in their dividends the first stock that I put in my article was Hershey's it's increased its dividend by 15% the last time it did it uh that was this year the three-year average annualized return on their dividend is 12.2% um so again over the last three years it's been keeping up with not only keeping up with inflation but it's been beating inflation with the type of return that dividend investors have been getting the stock itself is up about 4.3% this year that's really good for a consumer discretionary stock like Hershey's that's not common among them this year and it's happening despite the fact that cocoa prices have been eating into the company's earnings a little bit now in the article I did bring up that there are some concerns that go P1 drugs are going to eat into Hershey's revenue and earnings I'm not seeing that in the numbers for this year and that's when you would be expecting to see it the earnings weakness as I just brought up that's more or less due to Rising cocoa prices which is Commodities are always going to be up and down for a company like Hershey's one area of concern that's come up since I

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,RaUtaJRWpls,MarketBeat,2024-09-27 19:49:13+00:00,AST SpaceMobile Takes Major Leap in Global Connectivity with Satellite Launch,Kind: captions Language: en first it was the telegraph then the telephone the cell phone and now the next stage of telecommunications is one step closer to [Music] reality here with an update on as space mobile is Market beat analyst jayu Jay it's been a really busy September for this company yes uh after seven years and a billion dollars later they finally launched their first five Bluebird satellites into low earth orbit um this is their black one bluebirds and they're finally finally up in space so anyone who had doubts that they would be able to get up in space well those doubts are proven wrong yeah we did a video on this one just a month or so ago kind of going through what this company is and really their idea is to make sure that the whole world is connected right talk a little bit more for those who missed that last video sure so as space mobile is trying to make the uh make drop calls a thing of the past normally you have to be within a cell tower range in order for your cell phone service to to to stay steady uh and to not have drop calls uh what a space mobile is doing is they are creating a space-based Broadband cellular network that is going to be there to basically fill in all the gaps in between cell towers in fact it's like they're putting up 168 cell towers in space and theoretically you should be able to complete calls anywhere on the planet and unlike satellite phones you're not going to need any special equipment basically any off-the-shelf smartphone will enable you to place a call anywhere in the world I think the other interesting thing that you wrote in your article about this is that right now you know as Americans you might think most of the world is covered with cell phone coverage but really this company is opening up an opportunity to reach more customers right absolutely uh basically according to a they believe that there's 67 billion out there waiting for them by 2032 uh the reality is 42% of the global population uh doesn't have access to cellular service uh they want to cash in on some of that and they are teaming up with uh over 40 uh Telecom mobile network providers to go ahead and basically have them provide this Fillin service who knows they may even actually provide you know full service AT&amp;T and Verizon the two biggest uh cell phone players in the US they've come on board they've come on board head first uh you know AT&amp;T has a six-year deal with them Verizon is basically spending a B100 million uh in order to get their uh customers outfitted with this service so the other thing to keep in mind is that now they are past the concept stage they actually have the satellites the first satellites in space so a lot of these other memorandum of understanding uh for potential contracts Partners they can move forward because now it's no longer a concept but they're actually getting closer to commercialization and so I expect to see a lot of Theseus actually turn into Partnerships uh in real conscious tracks yeah I think those Partnerships are a huge part about this company's cash flow let's talk about that a little bit because they've spent a lot investing to get this infrastructure up but now with these contracts uh where do they stand with cash flow they have about $440 million in cash now each satellite costs about $30 million uh the first block one five satellites cost $150 million to basically manufacture and put up in the space block two satellites they probably cost less but we're looking at 17 block two satellites which are actually 10 times more powerful than the block one satellites and those are looking to go up uh in 2025 with the first batch going up in first quarter 2025 now the company made a major move right after launching its first five satellites they announced a second stock option uh talk about what that's done right so actually about five or six days before the September 12th launch uh as had put out an announcement basically stating that they were going to be doing a $400 million secondary offering this is what's known as an at the market offering which means that they can sell shares at the market up to $400 million now that threw off a lot of investors uh and the stock did Take a Tumble because they basically stated that they we're not looking to raise any more cash through offerings uh in 2024 now the at the money offering uh actually has a three-year time limit so they have up to three years to be able to raise the $400 million in cash by selling stock um so they could start doing that 2025 but the notice basically says they can do it at any time living yeah let's talk about all of the movement this stock has seen this month you'd expect with the major launch that they be a lot of positive reaction in the stock to that news but that paired with the new offering there's been a lot of volatility for ests this month so the offering basically took the air kind of out of the stock uh it fell down to the 25 area and when they did launch on September 12th the stock actually pulled back some and then the day after is when the stock rallied back up into the 30s but it has been slow pulling back now and that's mostly because you know they don't produce revenues yet and you almost have a sell the news reaction that tends to happen when a significant event actually happens so now uh we have to look forward to uh potential catalysts down the road well with all the movement we've seen in the stock this month is this a buy for investors right now or is it still a pretty big risk oh yeah this is a definite speculative stock like I said they don't generate any revenues yet but they're getting closer now to that commercialization stage and according to a there's a potentially 67 billion doll out there by up to 2032 by filling in these connectivity gaps with the telephone carriers well we will continue to watch all of the moves and where this stock goes right here at Market Beach thanks for the Deep

the Bears who will prevail when it comes to Nvidia let's dive [Music] in here to talk about these two different viewpoints on the biggest stock in the market right now is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris Nvidia has been the hot topic for years now uh recently there's been a lot of movement on this stock let's talk about what we're seeing right now so right now uh Nvidia jumped about 4% yesterday had been Tuesday the 24th and that actually led the S&amp;P 500 higher uh at at start of the day kind of weak and then because of Nvidia Nvidia kind of led the way and the reason why it jumped 4% yesterday was because um Jensen Wong the CEO announced that he was done with this round of selling that had taken place that he had been doing since the company's earnings report in late August I put this in my article as one of the as kind of a bull bear Counterpoint this is kind of one of the weakest reasons I think that people have to sell the stock but I understand the I understand the thinking um retail investors sometimes get nervous when they see a CEO or another corporate Insider selling a lot of stock but in general these are nothing Burgers um most of these events are orchestrated well well in advance they're called these rule 1065 B1 trading plans and they have to file these with the SEC usually months in advance of when they actually sell so the SEC is well informed about the fact that these sales are going to take place it's just a matter of when they take place and the CEO or The Insider doesn't really know what the stock price is going to be on that date so a lot of people thinking that Jensen Wong was selling cuz he knew something bad was going to happen to Nvidia that's really not the case here nevertheless on the news that he wasn't selling any more stock the stock did start to go up so it looks like the Bears and the Bulls had a little bit of win on that one on that point yeah um moving on to another point that you brought up in your article uh the Bears are arguing this Blackwell delay um as a reason to not go for this stock give us both sides of the argument on Blackwell well this is another one that I would say among the arguments that I would have this one's kind of a not very strong the the reasoning that some investors have is that you have companies like meta and Microsoft who have already expressed an interest in getting their hands on other high performance AI chips they don't want to be just beholden to Nvidia that's all well and good and certainly there are some competitors along the way Advanced Micro devices being the most prominent one but none of these competitors at this particular moment are ready to capture market share at scale and keep in mind Nvidia has 85% of the market and so I mean it's it's going to be really really hard for these other companies to to start chipping away that market share unless they have ai chips that they can start delivering at scale before Blackwell comes out and Blackwell is going to be available by the end of this year or early next year according to Nvidia which is not that far off at this point exactly exactly another Point argument that you pointed out in your article is talking about kind of what's going on in the economy we know we just saw these rate Cuts it's all anyone is talking about right now what's the argument from the Bears and the Bulls on how those rate Cuts might impact Nvidia stock right this actually to me is the strongest of the arguments if you were going to make a bearish case there's a lot of contradictory signals in the market right now and you've seen this with chip stocks over the last couple of months they go up they go down if they if there's fears of a recession they go down if there if there's thinking that there's going to be a soft Landing they go up the concern is that if the economy goes into a recession that the companies that need nvidia's chips are going to slow down on AI spending in my article I cited a study from payments that said said companies that spent between 1 million and 5 million said that there's really not going to be any change in their spending now all of that can change but this would be the one concern that I would have if I was an Nvidia shareholder would be would companies be starting to pull back on that AI spend if the economy goes into a broader recession it's too early to tell and to be honest we just don't really know right now another argument you pointed out for or against Nvidia is the value ation of this company let's talk about what the Bears and bulls have to say about that so this is one that you hear about almost every day um and that's just that Nvidia is a very expensive stock and by expensive for the retail investors that may not quite understand what I'm saying here um I'm not necessarily talking about the stock price they've split their stock it's not expensive necessarily from that measure the stock price but it's expensive from valuations like price to earnings uh um the multiple was I think around 23 times forward PE when I wrote the article um there's other back ofth metric back in the envelope metrics that investors use price to sales Peg and by almost any measure Nvidia is an expensive stock to buy you're paying a premium to buy the company's future earnings which many investors feel already priced into the stock the more compelling argument I guess I would say there is people look at in market cap which is two which was 2.84 trillion when I wrote the article and that's an amount that's equal to what the entire cloud computing and generative AI Market will be worth around 2030 so it's expressing the fact that again this is an expensive stock investors are paying a premium for it my Counterpoint to that is that you're it's really kind of feudal to argue against math and that's really what you're doing if you're taking the other side of this I don't like to argue against math but I would also point out that Nvidia has margins of over 75% and that's using generally accepted accounting principles its profit margin was 55% I mean that means that they're just generating a lot of profit on what they do and that doesn't show any signs of slowing down earnings are what Drive stock price growth and so you have a reason to believe that even though the Stock's expensive it's going to continue to go up because earnings are going to continue to go up and unless that changes it doesn't really matter what the math says it just seems like the Stock's going to go up so I'm sounding like you are with the bulls on this one is that right I really am with with again with the one caveat being the broader economy but there's so many question marks around that right now I think investors can safely dollar cost average into Nvidia which means just putting a regular amount aside and putting it into Nvidia at a reg at different intervals you don't have to worry necessarily about what the prices of the stock on any given day if it does drop a little bit woohoo you're getting stock on sale and if it goes up a little bit okay then you've bought the stock at where it is now and that might be the new floor so you're okay but you know to S to Simply sit there and say you should ignore Nvidia I just don't think the other arguments really hold that much weight for me well thank you for the

go up because earnings are going to continue to go up and unless that changes it doesn't really matter what the math says it just seems like the Stock's going to go up so I'm sounding like you are with the bulls on this one is that right I really am with with again with the one caveat being the broader economy but there's so many question marks around that right now I think investors can safely dollar cost average into Nvidia which means just putting a regular amount aside and putting it into Nvidia at a reg at different intervals you don't have to worry necessarily about what the prices of the stock on any given day if it does drop a little bit woohoo you're getting stock on sale and if it goes up a little bit okay then you've bought the stock at where it is now and that might be the new floor so you're okay but you know to S to Simply sit there and say you should ignore Nvidia I just don't think the other arguments really hold that much weight for me well thank you for the

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,KaeJL1UGaeo,MarketBeat,2024-09-25 21:57:08+00:00,What the Bulls and Bears Are Saying About NVIDIA Stock,Kind: captions Language: en the Bulls or the Bears who will prevail when it comes to Nvidia let's dive [Music] in here to talk about these two different viewpoints on the biggest stock in the market right now is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris Nvidia has been the hot topic for years now uh recently there's been a lot of movement on this stock let's talk about what we're seeing right now so right now uh Nvidia jumped about 4% yesterday had been Tuesday the 24th and that actually led the S&amp;P 500 higher uh at at start of the day kind of weak and then because of Nvidia Nvidia kind of led the way and the reason why it jumped 4% yesterday was because um Jensen Wong the CEO announced that he was done with this round of selling that had taken place that he had been doing since the company's earnings report in late August I put this in my article as one of the as kind of a bull bear Counterpoint this is kind of one of the weakest reasons I think that people have to sell the stock but I understand the I understand the thinking um retail investors sometimes get nervous when they see a CEO or another corporate Insider selling a lot of stock but in general these are nothing Burgers um most of these events are orchestrated well well in advance they're called these rule 1065 B1 trading plans and they have to file these with the SEC usually months in advance of when they actually sell so the SEC is well informed about the fact that these sales are going to take place it's just a matter of when they take place and the CEO or The Insider doesn't really know what the stock price is going to be on that date so a lot of people thinking that Jensen Wong was selling cuz he knew something bad was going to happen to Nvidia that's really not the case here nevertheless on the news that he wasn't selling any more stock the stock did start to go up so it looks like the Bears and the Bulls had a little bit of win on that one on that point yeah um moving on to another point that you brought up in your article uh the Bears are arguing this Blackwell delay um as a reason to not go for this stock give us both sides of the argument on Blackwell well this is another one that I would say among the arguments that I would have this one's kind of a not very strong the the reasoning that some investors have is that you have companies like meta and Microsoft who have already expressed an interest in getting their hands on other high performance AI chips they don't want to be just beholden to Nvidia that's all well and good and certainly there are some competitors along the way Advanced Micro devices being the most prominent one but none of these competitors at this particular moment are ready to capture market share at scale and keep in mind Nvidia has 85% of the market and so I mean it's it's going to be really really hard for these other companies to to start chipping away that market share unless they have ai chips that they can start delivering at scale before Blackwell comes out and Blackwell is going to be available by the end of this year or early next year according to Nvidia which is not that far off at this point exactly exactly another Point argument that you pointed out in your article is talking about kind of what's going on in the economy we know we just saw these rate Cuts it's all anyone is talking about right now what's the argument from the Bears and the Bulls on how those rate Cuts might impact Nvidia stock right this actually to me is the strongest of the arguments if you were going to make a bearish case there's a lot of contradictory signals in the market right now and you've seen this with chip stocks over the last couple of months they go up they go down if they if there's fears of a recession they go down if there if there's thinking that there's going to be a soft Landing they go up the concern is that if the economy goes into a recession that the companies that need nvidia's chips are going to slow down on AI spending in my article I cited a study from payments that said said companies that spent between 1 million and 5 million said that there's really not going to be any change in their spending now all of that can change but this would be the one concern that I would have if I was an Nvidia shareholder would be would companies be starting to pull back on that AI spend if the economy goes into a broader recession it's too early to tell and to be honest we just don't really know right now another argument you pointed out for or against Nvidia is the value ation of this company let's talk about what the Bears and bulls have to say about that so this is one that you hear about almost every day um and that's just that Nvidia is a very expensive stock and by expensive for the retail investors that may not quite understand what I'm saying here um I'm not necessarily talking about the stock price they've split their stock it's not expensive necessarily from that measure the stock price but it's expensive from valuations like price to earnings uh um the multiple was I think around 23 times forward PE when I wrote the article um there's other back ofth metric back in the envelope metrics that investors use price to sales Peg and by almost any measure Nvidia is an expensive stock to buy you're paying a premium to buy the company's future earnings which many investors feel already priced into the stock the more compelling argument I guess I would say there is people look at in market cap which is two which was 2.84 trillion when I wrote the article and that's an amount that's equal to what the entire cloud computing and generative AI Market will be worth around 2030 so it's expressing the fact that again this is an expensive stock investors are paying a premium for it my Counterpoint to that is that you're it's really kind of feudal to argue against math and that's really what you're doing if you're taking the other side of this I don't like to argue against math but I would also point out that Nvidia has margins of over 75% and that's using generally accepted accounting principles its profit margin was 55% I mean that means that they're just generating a lot of profit on what they do and that doesn't show any signs of slowing down earnings are what Drive stock price growth and so you have a reason to believe that even though the Stock's expensive it's going to continue to go up because earnings are going to continue to go up and unless that changes it doesn't really matter what the math says it just seems like the Stock's going to go up so I'm sounding like you are with the bulls on this one is that right I really am with with again with the one caveat being the broader economy but there's so many question marks around that right now I think investors can safely dollar cost average into Nvidia which means just putting a regular amount aside and putting it into Nvidia at a reg at different intervals you don't have to worry necessarily about what the prices of

whether you believe they have an edge or not members of Congress are making lots of trades in 2024 here to talk about three stocks members of Congress are trading most right now our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys let's start off the conversation by talking about why people look at what members of Congress are trading because you have to assume that they have some Insider knowledge I mean they they might not know about the inside deal details of a specific company but they certainly know about political movements that could impact businesses and within that sphere they may actually become privy to some knowledges that the average investor will not have right and the and the Market's always forward moving in terms of the economy and Congress Knows What legislation is not only being proposed today but maybe being proposed in a few months and of course getting in on those stocks before that legislation hits is would be advantageous I agree with Thomas it's more of a it's more of a suspicion than it necessarily is reality but it's still it's you can't deny it coincidentally you know the suspicion whatever members of Congress tend to outperform the average investor so in in the world where you want to follow the money and Follow the Leader congressmen Congress people members of Congress are certainly a leader for investors to follow yeah there are no coincidence there's a lot of tools on Market beats website that investors can use to look at what traits Congress are making right Chris if you go on the market beat website under Market data and this is a free tool for any investor um there's a there's a link that says members of Congress and what's really nice about the link is that you can sort it by the actual members of Congress it gives you that option so you can actually look to see what a specific member of Congress either your Congressional leader or senator or someone like Nancy Pelosi is doing and you can just sort by that you can also see what the most recent trades have been so what stocks have been bought most recently and also what are the most bought stocks overall and you can sort that by a period of time I think it starts with like 90 days and it goes maybe as far out as like 180 days so there's a so there are tools there that are available for investors who are interested in that kind of information want to keep your finger on the pulse of the market text the word YouTube to 6 6 8285 that's 68 285 and get free breaking news alerts from marketbeat for the stocks that matter most to you don't miss out on crucial updates stay informed and stay ahead let's get to some of the three hot stocks that Congress members are buying right now Thomas your first one uh really no surprise really it's not a surprise it is the hottest stock in the market today Nvidia but in regards to Congress five members have made Seven purchases in the last 90 days that includes Nancy Pelosi we have members of both sides of the aisle so it's bipartisan buying in addition to the Congressional buying there's also a tremendous amount of Market support so this is more than just a congressional play Nvidia is a most followed stock a most upgraded stock it's got a top rated stock on marketbeat website so there are many factors going into the Nvidia trade yeah I think one of the things that's uh interesting to me about Nvidia being one of the most uh traded stocks by Congress especially it's being heavily bought is the idea that you're starting to see the US Congress now actively look at AI they understand that this is not something that's a bubble it's not something that's going away and now they're looking to find out how Congress should or might be able to regulate it that's why I think it's really interesting that now you're starting to that's coinciding with activity in Nvidia all right and speaking to our our conspiracy theory before coincidentally Nvidia is now up to potentially sell its ships to Saudi Arabia and who would have that knowledge first but the members of Congress correct that's a very interesting point anything about Nvidia being down the volatility the stock has seen in the last month or so are members of Congress still all in on this stock despite the recent volatility yeah I haven't seen any selling and there have been some recent purchases so like the most recent purchases were made after the stock dipped I think think that the members of Congress are and generally speaking are buying Nvidia in alignment with the uptrend well Thomas let's move on to that second hot stock members of Congress are buying right now yeah that's broadcom it's another chip stock uh in 2024 it's uh growth is accelerating in high double digits I think last quarter it was close to 50% growth that's supposed to or is expected to continue to be strong um it's being driven by Rebound in its end markets but also there's an upcoming Apple upgrade cycle Apple's getting ready to release their latest phones that's supposed to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle in that business Apple's a huge customer of broadcom and then again members of Congress are buying it we've got four members on both sides of the aisle including Nancy Pelosi um we have representatives and um Senators uh four members made five purchases now broadcom also has something else in common with Nvidia and that's a recent stock split uh what is that mean Chris well as we've talked about on this channel numerous times the stock split doesn't really do anything to change the fundamental valuation of a stock but it's interesting that you're seeing Congressional buying of both Nvidia and broadcom after the split because that does suggest that there's going to be momentum in both of those stocks going forward both of these stocks are in the chip or the AI industry are there more regulations happening at that Federal level that Congress might just know more more information about than the rest of us yeah there's there's no major legislation pending but you know that they're talking about it so they they certainly know which way the wind is blowing yep let's move on to your third pick Thomas this one's maybe a little bit lesser known and not quite in the same category as Nvidia or broadcom yeah this is an insurance stock this is chub it's one of the world's largest insurers it's uh well regarded as a highquality blue chip gross stock and dividend grower um it's grow gr it's growing its margin it's paying its dividend it uh provides some value um regarding Congress it was purchased to a smaller degree than the other two but still enough to be the third most purchased stock over the last 90 days um Miss Pelosi did not buy this one but again we have bipartisan representation um and the stock is in an uptrend it's got a very good uh support from the analyst as well with an expectation for earnings growth to continue in 2025 I found particularly interesting about chub being on the list is the fact that um there's been a lot of talk about inflation and where inflation's happening and a lot of people are ignoring the fact that insurance cost is one of the highest examples of inflation that a lot of people are experiencing not only in their home and car and other things but this is also when you talk about a chub you're talking about this is a lot of the commercial insurance that's being impacted and so I just think it's interesting that at a time when kind of nobody wants to talk about it Congress is investing in a company in an insurance company yeah that's an interesting point Chris and and wondering if for General investors should they be following this trend and going and looking at chub yeah I see chub as a as a high quality stock for dividend portfolio for sure it's definitely um could be a core holding and one thing I've noticed with chub is that in the last two quarters year over-year revenue and earnings have are both well above the prior year and I think that's reflected in the stock price but maybe not fully reflected in the stock price especially if investors and members of Congress are expecting that that type of Revenue growth is going to continue

stock split uh what is that mean Chris well as we've talked about on this channel numerous times the stock split doesn't really do anything to change the fundamental valuation of a stock but it's interesting that you're seeing Congressional buying of both Nvidia and broadcom after the split because that does suggest that there's going to be momentum in both of those stocks going forward both of these stocks are in the chip or the AI industry are there more regulations happening at that Federal level that Congress might just know more more information about than the rest of us yeah there's there's no major legislation pending but you know that they're talking about it so they they certainly know which way the wind is blowing yep let's move on to your third pick Thomas this one's maybe a little bit lesser known and not quite in the same category as Nvidia or broadcom yeah this is an insurance stock this is chub it's one of the world's largest insurers it's uh well regarded as a highquality blue chip gross stock and dividend grower um it's grow gr it's growing its margin it's paying its dividend it uh provides some value um regarding Congress it was purchased to a smaller degree than the other two but still enough to be the third most purchased stock over the last 90 days um Miss Pelosi did not buy this one but again we have bipartisan representation um and the stock is in an uptrend it's got a very good uh support from the analyst as well with an expectation for earnings growth to continue in 2025 I found particularly interesting about chub being on the list is the fact that um there's been a lot of talk about inflation and where inflation's happening and a lot of people are ignoring the fact that insurance cost is one of the highest examples of inflation that a lot of people are experiencing not only in their home and car and other things but this is also when you talk about a chub you're talking about this is a lot of the commercial insurance that's being impacted and so I just think it's interesting that at a time when kind of nobody wants to talk about it Congress is investing in a company in an insurance company yeah that's an interesting point Chris and and wondering if for General investors should they be following this trend and going and looking at chub yeah I see chub as a as a high quality stock for dividend portfolio for sure it's definitely um could be a core holding and one thing I've noticed with chub is that in the last two quarters year over-year revenue and earnings have are both well above the prior year and I think that's reflected in the stock price but maybe not fully reflected in the stock price especially if investors and members of Congress are expecting that that type of Revenue growth is going to continue

whether you believe they have an edge or not members of Congress are making lots of trades in 2024 here to talk about three stocks members of Congress are trading most right now our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys let's start off the conversation by talking about why people look at what members of Congress are trading because you have to assume that they have some Insider knowledge I mean they they might not know about the inside deal details of a specific company but they certainly know about political movements that could impact businesses and within that sphere they may actually become privy to some knowledges that the average investor will not have right and the and the Market's always forward moving in terms of the economy and Congress Knows What legislation is not only being proposed today but maybe being proposed in a few months and of course getting in on those stocks before that legislation hits is would be advantageous I agree with Thomas it's more of a it's more of a suspicion than it necessarily is reality but it's still it's you can't deny it coincidentally you know the suspicion whatever members of Congress tend to outperform the average investor so in in the world where you want to follow the money and Follow the Leader congressmen Congress people members of Congress are certainly a leader for investors to follow yeah there are no coincidence there's a lot of tools on Market beats website that investors can use to look at what traits Congress are making right Chris if you go on the market beat website under Market data and this is a free tool for any investor um there's a there's a link that says members of Congress and what's really nice about the link is that you can sort it by the actual members of Congress it gives you that option so you can actually look to see what a specific member of Congress either your Congressional leader or senator or someone like Nancy Pelosi is doing and you can just sort by that you can also see what the most recent trades have been so what stocks have been bought most recently and also what are the most bought stocks overall and you can sort that by a period of time I think it starts with like 90 days and it goes maybe as far out as like 180 days so there's a so there are tools there that are available for investors who are interested in that kind of information want to keep your finger on the pulse of the market text the word YouTube to 6 6 8285 that's 68 285 and get free breaking news alerts from marketbeat for the stocks that matter most to you don't miss out on crucial updates stay informed and stay ahead let's get to some of the three hot stocks that Congress members are buying right now Thomas your first one uh really no surprise really it's not a surprise it is the hottest stock in the market today Nvidia but in regards to Congress five members have made Seven purchases in the last 90 days that includes Nancy Pelosi we have members of both sides of the aisle so it's bipartisan buying in addition to the Congressional buying there's also a tremendous amount of Market support so this is more than just a congressional play Nvidia is a most followed stock a most upgraded stock it's got a top rated stock on marketbeat website so there are many factors going into the Nvidia trade yeah I think one of the things that's uh interesting to me about Nvidia being one of the most uh traded stocks by Congress especially it's being heavily bought is the idea that you're starting to see the US Congress now actively look at AI they understand that this is not something that's a bubble it's not something that's going away and now they're looking to find out how Congress should or might be able to regulate it that's why I think it's really interesting that now you're starting to that's coinciding with activity in Nvidia all right and speaking to our our conspiracy theory before coincidentally Nvidia is now up to potentially sell its ships to Saudi Arabia and who would have that knowledge first but the members of Congress correct that's a very interesting point anything about Nvidia being down the volatility the stock has seen in the last month or so are members of Congress still all in on this stock despite the recent volatility yeah I haven't seen any selling and there have been some recent purchases so like the most recent purchases were made after the stock dipped I think think that the members of Congress are and generally speaking are buying Nvidia in alignment with the uptrend well Thomas let's move on to that second hot stock members of Congress are buying right now yeah that's broadcom it's another chip stock uh in 2024 it's uh growth is accelerating in high double digits I think last quarter it was close to 50% growth that's supposed to or is expected to continue to be strong um it's being driven by Rebound in its end markets but also there's an upcoming Apple upgrade cycle Apple's getting ready to release their latest phones that's supposed to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle in that business Apple's a huge customer of broadcom and then again members of Congress are buying it we've got four members on both sides of the aisle including Nancy Pelosi um we have representatives and um Senators uh four members made five purchases now broadcom also has something else in common with Nvidia and that's a recent

waiting a rate cut finally came but what does it mean now here to talk about what this rate cut means for the market going forward is Market beat analyst Thomas Hughes and Thomas let's start off with just how much of a rate cut we saw was this kind of surprise for some people um I think it was a surprise for some people but not a great shocking surprise for the market I would say that there was about a 50/50 chance for 25 basis points or a 50 basis point cut what I would say is they started out aggressively which you can tell by the headlines the market is pretty much in agreement with that we've had an aggressive start to the rate decrease cycle and it's been a long time coming uh the market bet many investors have been waiting and watching for this cut for years it's been very much expected this time around but you're right I think that 50 basis point cut is more than some people were expecting talk about how the market is reacting to this aggressive approach well the response has been pretty volatile I mean initially the market surged higher set a new high but then it quickly sold off and closed lower for the day uh the following day Futures indicated a strong open in which we've gotten but the market is now struggling to move even higher so I think that there are still a lot of swirling factors in play and the Market's trying to figure it out absolutely let's let's backtrack a little bit and talk about why do you think the FED went with that 50 basis point cut all right so this goes into the idea of volatility and who's right and who's wrong the aggressive 50 basis point cut could mean that inflation is cooling the economy is solid there's no risk of recession soft Landing will happen sooner and the FED will usher in that economic shift that we've been talking about more quickly than we've been expecting however they might be trying to front run a recession which is bad news for the market and that case no amount of cutting will stab off the recession or an ensuing market decline it's just a matter of wait and see right now yeah what do you think we're going to be seeing in the market in the days and weeks to come I think we're going to see a lot of volatility right now the market needs either confirmation that we're okay or confirmation that we're not okay so every data point is going to be a market mover uh especially the labor data the labor data has been softening if it continues to soften over the next month um I would not expect to see the S&amp;P 500 move significantly higher you've talked a lot in the last few weeks Thomas about walking that tight rope and the FED is trying to avoid the recession but also try to keep inflation in check is that what they're trying to do here and do you think it's going to have an impact on inflation down the road I think this is the case of be careful what you wish for because you just might get it you know the aggressive pace of cuts uh could signal soft Landing but it will also help re accelerate the economy and help sustain inflation so ultimately I think that's bad I think that we may have a higher for longer inflation situation still in place I think the FED may be um exacerbating that situation I also want to point out that you've been predicting volatility for weeks too and I think that's exactly what we're seeing with this rate cut it didn't just magically solve some of the economic concerns and issues that people have how long do you think the market could be in this volatility stage I mean it could last for months you have to remember that the situation we're in is the result of not just the last two or three years of stimulus spending and inflation but also the preceding 10 years of easy money policy and the Japanese Yen carry trade the carry trade is really significant because that's been building up for years people borrowing money from Japan to lend to the United States and that money has to come back and be paid back to Japan which means that there's going to be a lot of selling so I would expect any Market uptick to be followed by a downtick as people sell into the rallies but again so far as the soft Landing scenario still in play any down kick down tick should also result in a buying opportunity for stocks that are presenting values yeah let's talk about that a little bit more what does all of this volatility mean as far as potential opportunities for Traders well right now with recession not on the table I mean it's on the table but it's just a risk it's something we're worried about it's not up in our face I would expect the market to move sideways with that same Dynamic I just just described you know selling into the rally to take profits and close out the carry trade also moving to flight safety but any downt should result in a buying opportunity as people focus on their values now the big risk is that uh the uh the labor data or other data will start to point more significantly towards a recession and in that scenario we might start seeing more um intensified selling uh more flight safety selling more riskof selling and that could lead to a more significant Market downturn yeah in your article that you wrote which I'll link to here you also talked about this rate cut is going to take months potentially to even be reflected in the data uh talk about that a little more well right it's generally accepted that it takes 12 to 18 months for a single 25 basis point cut to fully impact the market so we're looking at a quarter or two before we start seeing significant changes in the data which gives us six month mons of upcoming pce CPI and labor data that is going to drive volatility as I said before any good news is going to cause a market to go higher but any bad news will cause it to move lower and one last thing I want to close out with today this is the First Rate cut we have seen in years but some people are predicting potentially even more yet to come do you think we're going to continue to see this aggressive approach well the the FED has indicated that they've indicated that they want to cut another 50 basis points by the end of the year and another 100 points next year uh and if they do that it just plays right into what I've been saying they're either going to usher in that economic shift sooner than we expected or they're trying to front run a recession and again we're just waiting for the next few months of data to understand are they actually going to cut more or do they need to keep rates where they are now or possibly even raise them back up again if inflation starts to rise again because you have to remember there's still a lot of demand in the economy consumers are still spending even though the housing market is pretty crappy um people want to buy houses so if the price of houses starts to fall inflation or interest rates start to fall it's going to Spur demand in that sector we can already see oil prices starting to move back up again all of those things play into inflation um I think that ultimately we're still walking that tight rope the FED still has plenty of risks we're still data dependent and the next few months are going to be very telling well we will continue to watch how well they balance on that tight rope they're walking right here on Market beach in the days and weeks and months to come thanks

microcomputers stock in a lot of volatility this month but has it reached its bottom yet here to dive into where this stock is at right now our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes Thomas you had an article this week about where smci stock stands right now and whether or not we're close to that bottom what do you think we are at right now Thomas well I think that there are still some risks but I think that the stock is at or very near its bottom if you look at the chart uh the selloff since the peak earlier this year it shaved 65% off of the stock price but it's retraced almost 100% of the rally that occurred this year which to me is a bubble it was an aid driven bubble the market got ahead of itself started to sell off as some expectations were reset that sell off was accelerated by a short report over the summer but now we're back at these levels where the stock was very attractive last year it's in a hot Market it's still growing so it should still be an attractive stock today and Chris I think we're seeing a little bit of that in the market right now what has the stock done most recently in the last few days well what we've been seeing since about um a little bit after Labor Day let's just say is the stock is starting to go up a little bit like Thomas said I think there's some buyers that are starting to look at this and saying it's overdone I think Thomas made a really good point in saying there was probably going to be a selloff in the stock when you saw how high it had gone in such a short time 65% drop is not just because of a short selling report I mean that especially when we don't really know what the details of that report are well right and the selloff Really began before the short report came out the short report really just accelerated pushed it down to the bottom it was a resetting of expectations and then their earnings over the summer margin was a little bit weaker than expected and that gave the market some reasons to fear so it is kind of a combination of factors but again the stock has retraced back to these levels where it was attractive before the market created a bubble so we have to ask ourselves has anything really fundamentally changed for the business because if it has it could go lower but if it's still in a strong industry it's at a good price it should begin to rebound and next year should be a solid year for the market I think that question is what has a lot of investors having some caution right now there is some uncertainty and some people questioning that report that both of you just mentioned uh Thomas let's dive into what's the issue with this delayed report and what are some people speculating well right so the report was delayed it's the end of the year filing um and it was delayed we don't really know why but I assume given uh the benefit of the doubt that it is just an overabundance of caution uh the Hindenberg short report certainly raised some doubts about the company's financial reporting um there has been some history in the past of some misrepresented numbers but that was years ago we have to assume the company has moved on from that and that uh once the new the finalized report comes out a lot of those um fears will be alleviated Chris do you have any concerns about the report delay I I don't um what I would be more interested in going forward is going to be hearing about one concern that was brought up in the Hindenberg report that was outside of the financials is potentially that uh super micro is understating the competitive pressures that there are some super micro customers that are looking aggressively looking for lower cost Alternatives that they feel might have better quality if I'm an investor looking to buy the stock that's something that might concern me a little bit more than accounting rate irregularities which I agree with Thomas I think this delay is probably being done out of an abundance of caution to make sure that they've got the numbers right and I don't necessarily think that's going to be the reason why you should stay out of the stock right now and Thomas you already alluded to this that there's just as much of a risk the stock could go down as it could go up um it just depends on the solidness of the industry but Chris you just brought up an interesting point the competition is that part of what we're seeing with with the stock price is that there's just more competitors and more saturation of the AI market and what super micro is providing I don't know if that's the reason yet but I I would say that could be an issue going forward I mean when super micro reported earnings they also said that they're not seeing any slowdown in demand from Nvidia which is one of their biggest customers in terms of the data center market so that would seem to be good however that's also the type of thing that the Hindenburg report is is trying to question the answer that I have for You Bridget is I just don't know and that would make me a little bit hesitant to get in right at this moment on super micro but it doesn't necessarily mean it's not a good stock to own over time it's just maybe I don't want to jump in right now right right what Chris is saying plays into the idea that there may be volatility over the next few weeks or months um like the proof and the pudding will probably come out with the next earnings report when they deliver or don't deliver on what the expectations are right now the market is expecting about 200% Revenue growth in the next quarter which is substantial it's huge however it does align with nvidia's own ramp in Revenue over the last couple years and you had to think there's some correlation between the two and also the analysts have been lowering their targets so it's a low bar the company could very easily outperform and even if it just reports in alignment with the consensus The Whisper numbers are low consensus so that would still be a strong report all that said I think that the Q2 report could be a catalyst for higher share prices let's move on to short interest a little bit you talk about that in your article too Thomas uh what's the concern there right so the short interest is a big factor in the stock price right now I mean the the short report from Hindenberg was matched by another short report by another short selling firm uh short interest is up at 15% they certainly took advantage of the report to help Drive the stock back to these lower lows but again at 15% there's ample fuel for short covering rally and a short squeeze so all we need is some good news to come out and the stock could not only just move higher but rocket higher all right so again pulling it back to the near-term in volatility High short interest fighting against a bullish Outlook is going to provide volatility so I would certainly expect to see the market make some whipsaw moves uh throughout September and possibly into October and maybe through the end of the year I'm hearing a lot of volatility expect a lot of changes quickly especially in the short term um let's talk about what this stock could look like for investors long term well long term you have to assume that the peak set earlier this year is the market pricing in the best case scenario so if we get a best case scenario in the results we can see the stock climb back up to retest those highs um otherwise I see the stock advancing possibly even um where are we at possibly even doubling or more in price over the next 12 months to 24 months but setting a new high uh could be difficult without some other Catalyst for the Outlook that's some great information for our viewers to consider when they are looking at buying smci thank you both for diving into

microcomputers stock in a lot of volatility this month but has it reached its bottom yet here to dive into where this stock is at right now our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes Thomas you had an article this week about where smci stock stands right now and whether or not we're close to that bottom what do you think we are at right now Thomas well I think that there are still some risks but I think that the stock is at or very near its bottom if you look at the chart uh the selloff since the peak earlier this year it shaved 65% off of the stock price but it's retraced almost 100% of the rally that occurred this year which to me is a bubble it was an aid driven bubble the market got ahead of itself started to sell off as some expectations were reset that sell off was accelerated by a short report over the summer but now we're back at these levels where the stock was very attractive last year it's in a hot Market it's still growing so it should still be an attractive stock today and Chris I think we're seeing a little bit of that in the market right now what has the stock done most recently in the last few days well what we've been seeing since about um a little bit after Labor Day let's just say is the stock is starting to go up a little bit like Thomas said I think there's some buyers that are starting to look at this and saying it's overdone I think Thomas made a really good point in saying there was probably going to be a selloff in the stock when you saw how high it had gone in such a short time 65% drop is not just because of a short selling report I mean that especially when we don't really know what the details of that report are well right and the selloff Really began before the short report came out the short report really just accelerated pushed it down to the bottom it was a resetting of expectations and then their earnings over the summer margin was a little bit weaker than expected and that gave the market some reasons to fear so it is kind of a combination of factors but again the stock has retraced back to these levels where it was attractive before the market created a bubble so we have to ask ourselves has anything really fundamentally changed for the business because if it has it could go lower but if it's still in a strong industry it's at a good price it should begin to rebound and next year should be a solid year for the market I think that question is what has a lot of investors having some caution right now there is some uncertainty and some people questioning that report that both of you just mentioned uh Thomas let's dive into what's the issue with this delayed report and what are some people speculating well right so the report was delayed it's the end of the year filing um and it was delayed we don't really know why but I assume given uh the benefit of the doubt that it is just an overabundance of caution uh the Hindenberg short report certainly raised some doubts about the company's financial reporting um there has been some history in the past of some misrepresented numbers but that was years ago we have to assume the company has moved on from that and that uh once the new the finalized report comes out a lot of those um fears will be alleviated Chris do you have any concerns about the report delay I I don't um what I would be more interested in going forward is going to be hearing about one concern that was brought up in the Hindenberg report that was outside of the financials is potentially that uh super micro is understating the competitive pressures that there are some super micro customers that are looking aggressively looking for lower cost Alternatives that they feel might have better quality if I'm an investor looking to buy the stock that's something that might concern me a little bit more than accounting rate irregularities which I agree with Thomas I think this delay is probably being done out of an abundance of caution to make sure that they've got the numbers right and I don't necessarily think that's going to be the reason why you should stay out of the stock right now and Thomas you already alluded to this that there's just as much of a risk the stock could go down as it could go up um it just depends on the solidness of the industry but Chris you just brought up an interesting point the competition is that part of what we're seeing with with the stock price is that there's just more competitors and more saturation of the AI market and what super micro is providing I don't know if that's the reason yet but I I would say that could be an issue going forward I mean when super micro reported earnings they also said that they're not seeing any slowdown in demand from Nvidia which is one of their biggest customers in terms of the data center market so that would seem to be good however that's also the type of thing that the Hindenburg report is is trying to question the answer that I have for You Bridget is I just don't know and that would make me a little bit hesitant to get in right at this moment on super micro but it doesn't necessarily mean it's not a good stock to own over time it's just maybe I don't want to jump in right now right right what Chris is saying plays into the idea that there may be volatility over the next few weeks or months um like the proof and the pudding will probably come out with the next earnings report when they deliver or don't deliver on what the expectations are right now the market is expecting about 200% Revenue growth in the next quarter which is substantial it's huge however it does align with nvidia's own ramp in Revenue over the last couple years and you had to think there's some correlation between the two and also the analysts have been lowering their targets so it's a low bar the company could very easily outperform and even if it just reports in alignment with the consensus The Whisper numbers are low consensus so that would still be a strong report all that said I think that the Q2 report could be a catalyst for higher share prices let's move on to short interest a little bit you talk about that in your article too Thomas uh what's the concern there right so the short interest is a big factor in the stock price right now I mean the the short report from Hindenberg was matched by another short report by another short selling firm uh short interest is up at 15% they certainly took advantage of the report to help Drive the stock back to these lower lows but again at 15% there's ample fuel for short covering rally and a short squeeze so all we need is some good news to come out and the stock could not only just move higher but rocket higher all right so again pulling it back to the near-term in volatility High short interest fighting against a bullish Outlook is going to provide volatility so I would certainly expect to see the market make some whipsaw moves uh throughout September and possibly into October and maybe through the end of the year I'm hearing a lot of volatility expect a lot of changes quickly especially in the short term um let's talk about what this stock could look like for investors long term well long term you have to assume that the peak set earlier this year is the market pricing in the best case scenario so if we get a best case scenario in the results we can see the stock climb back up to retest those highs um otherwise I see the stock advancing possibly even um where are we at possibly even doubling or more in price over the next 12 months to 24 months but setting a new high uh could be difficult without some other Catalyst for the Outlook that's some great information for our viewers to consider when they are looking at buying smci thank you both for diving into

Market's been waiting for for two years but rate Cuts could finally be here here to talk about what this means for the market volatility is Market bead analyst Thomas Hughes Thomas you've been following all of the economic factors very closely for the last few years and this week this month especially we've seen a lot of volatility what's behind that well the volatility started back in July with the CPI report uh it was kind of exacerbated over the last few weeks with the pce and the CPI report again but what it means is the market is getting ready for a shift in economic fundamentals as you said we've been waiting for years for the fomc to lower interest rates when they lower rates it will ease economic headwinds it's supposed to help uh not accelerate growth but help invigorate the market so that it can sustain the growth that it's at without too much inflation the take away from that is the Market's looking for a sector rotation getting out of all the highly concentrated names that have been uh invested in over the last two years and preparation for the next stage of rallying you mentioned CPI let's talk about what last week's CPI report release kind of did to the market all of last week well last week's CPI report I would call the Goldilocks number it wasn't too hot it wasn't too cold um I believe the headline number was a 10 cooler than expected but that really wasn't too much uh the takeaway is that inflation isn't cooling so fast that we're in fear of recession and it's not so hot that the fomc won't cut rates it's right in line with the idea of a soft economic Landing the takeaway is that the market won't get aggressive rate Cuts but we should get the First Rate cut this week and at least one or two more by the end of the year right after that CPI report was released on Wednesday morning we saw a sharp Market downturn but then it finished up stronger at the end of the day and we saw a little bit more of that throughout the week what should investors take from that kind of action well the the takeaway is that volatility is here um the initial reaction was very bearish and in the article I wrote I even took a bearish tone it looked very bearish the late day surge on Thursday was pretty surprising but it plays right into the idea of volatility uh the next day the day after the market didn't follow through on that move uh so ultimately what we're looking at is a high volatility period but not so much of a A downtrend or a market correction but in a sideways moving market so we should expect to see day-to-day action move kind of sideways each up day will be followed by a down day and that'll probably persist through September and maybe past the election do you expect that volatility to continue even after we get Wednesday's report a potential interest rate cut uh it may actually increase increase after the rate cut because the rate cut should come with a policy statement that either affirms or refutes the Market's Outlook the way I see it right now the economic data is still solid enough that the FED shouldn't Cut Rate too quickly because by cutting them too quickly they could actually re accelerate inflation they don't want to do that uh so again uh High expectation for a cut this Wednesday also a high expectation for the policy statement and what it may point to later on in the year so the soft Landing that they are looking for what would that actually look like Thomas well what that looks like is inflation slowly trending down to the 2% Target rate the fomc able to slowly cut interest rates to the point where inflation stabilizes at or near that 2% rate because the economic data is still so good I mean to me it's very healthy relative to pre-pandemic periods that should lead to a broadening economic rally because with weakened or diminished economic headwinds a wider range of businesses those more susceptible to interest rates will be able to have better business uh consumers should start spending more and so we should really see a really much broader stock market rally possibly beginning early to mid next year that all sounds like the ideal soft Landing but I think there's a lot of questions on will it actually go down that way is that why we're seeing so much volatility right now right that is the volatility I mean that's the the the that's the in a nutshell right there because we're on this tight rope path towards 2% inflation we have uh the soft Landing in play but there are risks the fomc maybe they held rates high for too long that could cause recession if recession's in the cards we won't even know it until the next round of monthly data comes out but at the same time if the FED hasn't done their job enough inflation will only re accelerate and that will keep us in a higher for longer state so again you know the market is just wrestling with this Whata if scenario of what's really happening while the soft Landing is is is taking place so expect a lot of ups and downs along the way while we try and figure out where we're at right if we haven't said it enough in this video volatility is the name of the game for at least the next month all right

of questions on will it actually go down that way is that why we're seeing so much volatility right now right that is the volatility I mean that's the the the that's the in a nutshell right there because we're on this tight rope path towards 2% inflation we have uh the soft Landing in play but there are risks the fomc maybe they held rates high for too long that could cause recession if recession's in the cards we won't even know it until the next round of monthly data comes out but at the same time if the FED hasn't done their job enough inflation will only re accelerate and that will keep us in a higher for longer state so again you know the market is just wrestling with this Whata if scenario of what's really happening while the soft Landing is is is taking place so expect a lot of ups and downs along the way while we try and figure out where we're at right if we haven't said it enough in this video volatility is the name of the game for at least the next month all right

AI industry for weeks months maybe even years but there's a silent industry that's really starting to make a big [Music] comeback here to talk a little bit more about the Biotech Industry is Weiss ratings technology editor Michael a Robinson Michael you do a monthly newsletter all about this right right we're talking about uh my monthly newsletter is called disruptors and dominators and what we're looking at and those are disruptive uh areas which obviously biotech is a disruptive area especially when you put biotech and AI together that's disruptive or someone who's a dominant player in their field and in fact you mentioned I'm working on a special report we'll talk a little bit about this one stock but they dominate a particular type of Biotech franchise I mean they totally own the segment of the market and we talk a little bit more about the disease area so they're using disruptive science and they're also a dominant player in in their in their in their sector which is which is which is great to have those two together I love the symmetry of that yeah and we are going to get to that information in those picks in just a little bit but first let's do an a general overview of where the Biotech Industry is right now in the stock market how is this industry trading right now it's had quite a comeback but sort of uh very quietly sort of almost under the r radar because as you mentioned you know AI is getting a lot of attention and specifically nvidia's like sucked all the oxygen out of the room right it's was like all the market was like oh they're going to report on August 28th they was like holding their breath but how's it going to be but biotech has really kind of come back if you think about Bridget why uh there was an overreaction we went into a postco tail spin for a lot of these stocks people felt there was no more upside left that all the all the money that could be made uh sort of like biotech at that time sort of like going out for the low hanging fruit but they've made quite a bit quite a bit of comeback all results oriented of course some of these guys have been really just killing it with earnings and sales growth and so a couple of a couple of names that pop out at me is arus Biotherapeutics and they had Peak gains recently of 212% which is you know apple apple investors would like to have that in the same amount of time right speaking as an apple investor and then um the other one was janx and this one's up like almost 275% for its peak gains just just a very short amount of time so what we've seen is that biotech kind of went like this and some of these leaders have just just really broken out and you know that's like you know a bunch of years of the S&amp;P gains all in one all in one and so what's been going on behind the scenes and I think not that many investors really realized what's going on but the FDA has a program let me use a metaphor you know what a first class passenger is at an airport right they get front of the line they get the good seats they get the good drinks they get the best food they get the best service the FDA is doing something similar because it wants us the the Americans to have to be healthier and a lot of these drugs uh uh they want to get them faster to Market so what they do is they give you they give these companies what amounts to a first class ticket they give them special treatment they do what they can to encourage them and what's really fascinating from an investment standpoint is I actually couldn't believe this I had a team go through this we spent quite a bit of time going through all of the data 97% of the time it's almost like pretty close to 100% the stock goes up when they get this and the FDA doesn't say anything it's just a very quiet signal FDA doesn't put out a press release the companies typically put out a press release and then when they do that their their their stocks can go up pretty dramatically uh one was up 845 per in the first six months after it got this first class ticket and another one I'm just of I want I want to give you the accurate data here one of them was up 119% two days wow what is that 15 years the S&amp;P return or something like that in two days that's pretty amazing it's incredible I want to talk about that a little bit about the Biotech Industry for investors if you are getting in on any biotech stock I feel like it is all a reaction to FDA approval advancements or announcements in a in a new breakthrough or even just a news event I feel like this industry and the sector specifically are really impacted by these potentially volatile announcements yeah um it is true you don't want to be on the receiving end of a FDA say no that that hurts the stock so what we're always looking for as investors is where that we want the Dex act in our favor so that's why we're looking at companies that have a really good relationship with the FDA and have a good track record uh of getting of getting these things approved and in fact um I've just prepared a special report on this very topic uh and it looks at the signal that we've been talking about where 97% of the time the stocks go up that's there's no such thing as a sure thing in investing but with a 97% win rate that that's as close as you're going to get uh to doing that so that's one of the things we want that we monitor um and there three companies in particular that I think kind of exemplify that if if you'd like can kind of give you some of the high high points of each one of these players and and kind of what makes them so exciting yeah let's see some examples of what this looks like because I think for investors the real value comes in they want to take advantage of that 800% growth but they need to get in before it happens are these stocks kind of examples of that well what they are examples of is these are got these are all three of these players one's a moonshot one's a low pric moonshot stock we like you know I like the moonshot stocks you don't bet the farm on them I'll get to that in a second but one one of one of them is I think gets to your point and I think it does it very well this company has the best of both worlds so they have a lot of experimental science stuff in the gene therapy but they also have a lot of drugs on the market right now that are cash cows they basically own the cystic fibrosis Market there have several drugs out there right now generating you know hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Revenue every year and so we got the stability but then they also have joint ventures where they're working with gene therapy again you're going in and fixing things at the genetic level so that you don't have to keep taking drugs and you don't have to have a chemotherapy or operations or a series of both um and and the first two that they have going on right now is one has to deal with CLE cell anemia that's a you don't want that it's it's a genetically related disease it affects about 100,000 people in the United States at any point in time often fatal so these guys have a therapy out for that and the other one that they have which is a larger patient population is type one diabetes and that affects around just just shy let's it's like around 3.8 million so just shy of four million peoples so that's a pretty large uh uh patient population and this company and this is the other thing we're looking for because we have our moonshot stock but you have something very stable here that these guys have done a really good job of growing earnings faster than sales so as somebody who analyzes technology Investments all day I really like to see that um so well that tells me it's a very efficient firm it tells me it's an extremely well-run firm it tells me that the that the drugs that are on the market are really generating a lot of cash that falls to the bottom line with investors that's what we want and so they've been growing their earnings the earnings over the last three years have averaged per share profits have grown 30% a year on average over the last three years but even better uh Bridget is that they're growing their earnings five times faster than sales ah man that is that you know I want that I want that stock I mean that's that's something I I get both I get stability a lot of drugs on the market they've got 18 drugs in their pipeline they've got these joint ventures go going on in in gene therapy so that that that that's kind of the number one right there that gives as I said I love I love the double play here we it's a twofer we get Cutting Edge science but if something doesn't go right it's not going to bring the firm down they've got a really good moat for us as investors they can take a flyer and invest you know hundreds of millions of dollars potentially if they want to and it's not going to kill them if if the if if the thing doesn't eventually pay out but what they're doing is they joint venturing with stuff that they can get on the market right away as or as fast as possible that sounds like a great company and a great first stock pick in the Biotech Industry for those looking for a a pretty solid stock to get into this industry uh what's the second stock that you're looking at in the biotech sector it's also a large a larger stock you know we're looking at quality that the first two are are are quality plays CU talk about the moonshot in the second but what one of the things I I really like about these these guys is that they have we talked about Ai and the marriage of AI and biotech they actually have a joint venture going on with Microsoft they're using Microsoft's AI model or their AI platform to help accelerate drug Discovery and they've also moved into some interesting areas of cutting egg science they recently struck a deal with a company called Voyager Therapeutics and this thing covers this this pack covers Huntington's disease and muscular distrophy spinal muscular distrophy yet I want either one of these diseases they're they're bad news all right um but this could be worth 1.2 billion dollars in the next few years in in extra sales so again what we have is an established player that's that's joining forces with somebody a little bit more on The Cutting Edge and we we as investors get access to The Cutting Edge science but without we're not betting the farm on that like a lot of these smaller biotech companies do uh these guys have been around for a long time and they're on paage to double their earnings bridging in the next three years so I that's something I like to see I like to see an earnings double it tells me you know kind of where out where we going to be three years six years if they keep that pace up doubling your earnings every three years or so is pretty good that also sounds like a great biotech stock but I do notice you haven't named it yet how can people find out what you're talking about here well you have to get a copy of my special report and the title of it is the next FDA signal how to profit off of first class drugs and we we lay all this stuff out in that report I know you wanted to preview one more of that's going to be in that report and this one's kind of more of a long shot right I mean this is a this is a stock that trades under $10 a share um and so it's not yet invest investor grade so what that means is that you're not going to find a lot of institutional investors backing the stock it's going to be mostly smaller players uh the $460 million market cap uh it's small for a lot of even even hedge funds it's a little bit on the small side um but what's really interesting about is what makes this a great there's two things really is they're involved in this Cutting Edge signs we've been talking about here today Bridget with genetic therapy and and looking at solving disease at the at the genetic level but these guys have a CEO who used to be at Biogen Biogen is a major player in the industry and has been for quite some time now and what's interesting about that is he was there when they were building out their franchise he was involved in another a number of uh drugs that made it to Market so that so he's got to track where you're getting drugs to Market and then what's also interesting just from a just from a almost an intuitive standpoint the company when he was at Biogen it's it's now a $33 billion market cap company so it's a it's at the upper end of the of the midcap his cap right now is $460 million but if he just got to 10% of Biogen market cap you'd go from let's call it 450 to make the math easy 450 billion 450 million to about 3.3 so let's just say 450 to 3.5 billion that's a pretty substantial increase and that's why I think it's just a it defines a moonshot stock If he if he lives up to just 10% of the potential that he that he that he helped bring to Biogen we can see some pretty uh pretty big move in the market cap which the stock has to follow the market cap right the two are are closely interrelated so just getting that up there is going to push the stock price up and this is one that we call it a moonshot I think this is one that you know I always tell people the same thing on on a on a play like this shouldn't put in more than you can afford to lose personally I I I like I like having some Moon shots in there it's just it's an exciting way to do it and you don't bet the farm yeah that's some great investment advice Michael and lots of interesting biotech stocks to look into I know our viewers I'm sure are interested to hear what those are again we will link to Michael and Weiss ratings report that will be coming out soon naming some of those stocks he just previewed for us Michael thank you again for this great conversation on biotech stocks

scenes and I think not that many investors really realized what's going on but the FDA has a program let me use a metaphor you know what a first class passenger is at an airport right they get front of the line they get the good seats they get the good drinks they get the best food they get the best service the FDA is doing something similar because it wants us the the Americans to have to be healthier and a lot of these drugs uh uh they want to get them faster to Market so what they do is they give you they give these companies what amounts to a first class ticket they give them special treatment they do what they can to encourage them and what's really fascinating from an investment standpoint is I actually couldn't believe this I had a team go through this we spent quite a bit of time going through all of the data 97% of the time it's almost like pretty close to 100% the stock goes up when they get this and the FDA doesn't say anything it's just a very quiet signal FDA doesn't put out a press release the companies typically put out a press release and then when they do that their their their stocks can go up pretty dramatically uh one was up 845 per in the first six months after it got this first class ticket and another one I'm just of I want I want to give you the accurate data here one of them was up 119% two days wow what is that 15 years the S&amp;P return or something like that in two days that's pretty amazing it's incredible I want to talk about that a little bit about the Biotech Industry for investors if you are getting in on any biotech stock I feel like it is all a reaction to FDA approval advancements or announcements in a in a new breakthrough or even just a news event I feel like this industry and the sector specifically are really impacted by these potentially volatile announcements yeah um it is true you don't want to be on the receiving end of a FDA say no that that hurts the stock so what we're always looking for as investors is where that we want the Dex act in our favor so that's why we're looking at companies that have a really good relationship with the FDA and have a good track record uh of getting of getting these things approved and in fact um I've just prepared a special report on this very topic uh and it looks at the signal that we've been talking about where 97% of the time the stocks go up that's there's no such thing as a sure thing in investing but with a 97% win rate that that's as close as you're going to get uh to doing that so that's one of the things we want that we monitor um and there three companies in particular that I think kind of exemplify that if if you'd like can kind of give you some of the high high points of each one of these players and and kind of what makes them so exciting yeah let's see some examples of what this looks like because I think for investors the real value comes in they want to take advantage of that 800% growth but they need to get in before it happens are these stocks kind of examples of that well what they are examples of is these are got these are all three of these players one's a moonshot one's a low pric moonshot stock we like you know I like the moonshot stocks you don't bet the farm on them I'll get to that in a second but one one of one of them is I think gets to your point and I think it does it very well this company has the best of both worlds so they have a lot of experimental science stuff in the gene therapy but they also have a lot of drugs on the market right now that are cash cows they basically own the cystic fibrosis Market there have several drugs out there right now generating you know hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Revenue every year and so we got the stability but then they also have joint ventures where they're working with gene therapy again you're going in and fixing things at the genetic level so that you don't have to keep taking drugs and you don't have to have a chemotherapy or operations or a series of both um and and the first two that they have going on right now is one has to deal with CLE cell anemia that's a you don't want that it's it's a genetically related disease it affects about 100,000 people in the United States at any point in time often fatal so these guys have a therapy out for that and the other one that they have which is a larger patient population is type one diabetes and that affects around just just shy let's it's like around 3.8 million so just shy of four million peoples so that's a pretty large uh uh patient population and this company and this is the other thing we're looking for because we have our moonshot stock but you have something very stable here that these guys have done a really good job of growing earnings faster than sales so as somebody who analyzes technology Investments all day I really like to see that um so well that tells me it's a very efficient firm it tells me it's an extremely well-run firm it tells me that the that the drugs that are on the market are really generating a lot of cash that falls to the bottom line with investors that's what we want and so they've been growing their earnings the earnings over the last three years have averaged per share profits have grown 30% a year on average over the last three years but even better uh Bridget is that they're growing their earnings five times faster than sales ah man that is that you know I want that I want that stock I mean that's that's something I I get both I get stability a lot of drugs on the market they've got 18 drugs in their pipeline they've got these joint ventures go going on in in gene therapy so that that that that's kind of the number one right there that gives as I said I love I love the double play here we it's a twofer we get Cutting Edge science but if something doesn't go right it's not going to bring the firm down they've got a really good moat for us as investors they can take a flyer and invest you know hundreds of millions of dollars potentially if they want to and it's not going to kill them if if the if if the thing doesn't eventually pay out but what they're doing is they joint venturing with stuff that they can get on the market right away as or as fast as possible that sounds like a great company and a great first stock pick in the Biotech Industry for those looking for a a pretty solid stock to get into this industry uh what's the second stock that you're looking at in the biotech sector it's also a large a larger stock you know we're looking at quality that the first two are are are quality plays CU talk about the moonshot in the second but what one of the things I I really like about these these guys is that they have we talked about Ai and the marriage of AI and biotech they actually have a joint venture going on with Microsoft they're using Microsoft's AI model or their AI platform to help accelerate drug Discovery and they've also moved into some interesting areas of cutting egg science they recently struck a deal with a company called Voyager Therapeutics and this thing covers this this pack covers Huntington's disease and muscular distrophy spinal muscular distrophy yet I want either one of these diseases they're they're bad news all right um but this could be worth 1.2 billion dollars in the next few years in in extra sales so again what we have is an established player that's that's joining forces with somebody a little bit more on The Cutting Edge and we we as investors get access to The Cutting Edge science but without we're not betting the farm on that like a lot of these smaller biotech companies do uh these guys have been around for a long time and they're on paage to double their earnings bridging in the next three years so I that's something I like to see I like to see an earnings double it tells me you know kind of where out where we going to be three years six years if they keep that pace up doubling your earnings every three years or so is pretty good that also sounds like a great biotech stock but I do notice you haven't named it yet how can people find out what you're talking about here well you have to get a copy of my special report and the title of it is the next FDA signal how to profit off of first class drugs and we we lay all this stuff out in that report I know you wanted to preview one more of that's going to be in that report and this one's kind of more of a long shot right I mean this is a this is a stock that trades under $10 a share um and so it's not yet invest investor grade so what that means is that you're not going to find a lot of institutional investors backing the stock it's going to be mostly smaller players uh the $460 million market cap uh it's small for a lot of even even hedge funds it's a little bit on the small side um but what's really interesting about is what makes this a great there's two things really is they're involved in this Cutting Edge signs we've been talking about here today Bridget with genetic therapy and and looking at solving disease at the at the genetic level but these guys have a CEO who used to be at Biogen Biogen is a major player in the industry and has been for quite some time now and what's interesting about that is he was there when they were building out their franchise he was involved in another a number of uh drugs that made it to Market so that so he's got to track where you're getting drugs to Market and then what's also interesting just from a just from a almost an intuitive standpoint the company when he was at Biogen it's it's now a $33 billion market cap company so it's a it's at the upper end of the of the midcap his cap right now is $460 million but if he just got to 10% of Biogen market cap you'd go from let's call it 450 to make the math easy 450 billion 450 million to about 3.3 so let's just say 450 to 3.5 billion that's a pretty substantial increase and that's why I think it's just a it defines a moonshot stock If he if he lives up to just 10% of the potential that he that he that he helped bring to Biogen we can see some pretty uh pretty big move in the market cap which the stock has to follow the market cap right the two are are closely interrelated so just getting that up there is going to push the stock price up and this is one that we call it a moonshot I think this is one that you know I always tell people the same thing on on a on a play like this shouldn't put in more than you can afford to lose personally I I I like I like having some Moon shots in there it's just it's an exciting way to do it and you don't bet the farm yeah that's some great investment advice Michael and lots of interesting biotech stocks to look into I know our viewers I'm sure are interested to hear what those are again we will link to Michael and Weiss ratings report that will be coming out soon naming some of those stocks he just previewed for us Michael thank you again for this great conversation on biotech stocks

AI industry for weeks months maybe even years but there's a silent industry that's really starting to make a big [Music] comeback here to talk a little bit more about the Biotech Industry is Weiss ratings technology editor Michael a Robinson Michael you do a monthly newsletter all about this right right we're talking about uh my monthly newsletter is called disruptors and dominators and what we're looking at and those are disruptive uh areas which obviously biotech is a disruptive area especially when you put biotech and AI together that's disruptive or someone who's a dominant player in their field and in fact you mentioned I'm working on a special report we'll talk a little bit about this one stock but they dominate a particular type of Biotech franchise I mean they totally own the segment of the market and we talk a little bit more about the disease area so they're using disruptive science and they're also a dominant player in in their in their in their sector which is which is which is great to have those two together I love the symmetry of that yeah and we are going to get to that information in those picks in just a little bit but first let's do an a general overview of where the Biotech Industry is right now in the stock market how is this industry trading right now it's had quite a comeback but sort of uh very quietly sort of almost under the r radar because as you mentioned you know AI is getting a lot of attention and specifically nvidia's like sucked all the oxygen out of the room right it's was like all the market was like oh they're going to report on August 28th they was like holding their breath but how's it going to be but biotech has really kind of come back if you think about Bridget why uh there was an overreaction we went into a postco tail spin for a lot of these stocks people felt there was no more upside left that all the all the money that could be made uh sort of like biotech at that time sort of like going out for the low hanging fruit but they've made quite a bit quite a bit of comeback all results oriented of course some of these guys have been really just killing it with earnings and sales growth and so a couple of a couple of names that pop out at me is arus Biotherapeutics and they had Peak gains recently of 212% which is you know apple apple investors would like to have that in the same amount of time right speaking as an apple investor and then um the other one was janx and this one's up like almost 275% for its peak gains just just a very short amount of time so what we've seen is that biotech kind of went like this and some of these leaders have just just really broken out and you know that's like you know a bunch of years of the S&amp;P gains all in one all in one and so what's been going on behind the scenes and I think not that many investors really realized what's going on but the FDA has a program let me use a metaphor you know what a first class passenger is at an airport right they get front of the line they get the good seats they get the good drinks they get the best food they get the best service the FDA is doing something similar because it wants us the the Americans to have to be healthier and a lot of these drugs uh uh they want to get them faster to Market so what they do is they give you they give these companies what amounts to a first class ticket they give them special

into this industry uh what's the second stock that you're looking at in the biotech sector it's also a large a larger stock you know we're looking at quality that the first two are are are quality plays CU talk about the moonshot in the second but what one of the things I I really like about these these guys is that they have we talked about Ai and the marriage of AI and biotech they actually have a joint venture going on with Microsoft they're using Microsoft's AI model or their AI platform to help accelerate drug Discovery and they've also moved into some interesting areas of cutting egg science they recently struck a deal with a company called Voyager Therapeutics and this thing covers this this pack covers Huntington's disease and muscular distrophy spinal muscular distrophy yet I want either one of these diseases they're they're bad news all right um but this could be worth 1.2 billion dollars in the next few years in in extra sales so again what we have is an established player that's that's joining forces with somebody a little bit more on The Cutting Edge and we we as investors get access to The Cutting Edge science but without we're not betting the farm on that like a lot of these smaller biotech companies do uh these guys have been around for a long time and they're on paage to double their earnings bridging in the next three years so I that's something I like to see I like to see an earnings double it tells me you know kind of where out where we going to be three years six years if they keep that pace up doubling your earnings every three years or so is pretty good that also sounds like a great biotech stock but I do notice you haven't named it yet how can people find out what you're talking about here well you have to get a copy of my special report and the title of it is the next FDA signal how to profit off of first class drugs and we we lay all this stuff out in that report I know you wanted to preview one more of that's going to be in that report and this one's kind of more of a long shot right I mean this is a this is a stock that trades under $10 a share um and so it's not yet invest investor grade so what that means is that you're not going to find a lot of institutional investors backing the stock it's going to be mostly smaller players uh the $460 million market cap uh it's small for a lot of even even hedge funds it's a little bit on the small side um but what's really interesting about is what makes this a great there's two things really is they're involved in this Cutting Edge signs we've been talking about here today Bridget with genetic therapy and and looking at solving disease at the at the genetic level but these guys have a CEO who used to be at Biogen Biogen is a major player in the industry and has been for quite some time now and what's interesting about that is he was there when they were building out their franchise he was involved in another a number of uh drugs that made it to Market so that so he's got to track where you're getting drugs to Market and then what's also interesting just from a just from a almost an intuitive standpoint the company when he was at Biogen it's it's now a $33 billion market cap company so it's a it's at the upper end of the of the midcap his cap right now is $460 million but if he just got to 10% of Biogen market cap you'd go from let's call it 450 to make the math easy 450 billion 450 million to about 3.3 so let's just say 450 to 3.5 billion that's a pretty substantial increase and that's why I think it's just a it defines a moonshot stock If he if he lives up to just 10% of the potential that he that he that he helped bring to Biogen we can see some pretty uh pretty big move in the market cap which the stock has to follow the market cap right the two are are closely interrelated so just getting that up there is going to push the stock price up and this is one that we call it a moonshot I think this is one that you know I always tell people the same thing on on a on a play like this shouldn't put in more than you can afford to lose personally I I I like I like having some Moon shots in there it's just it's an exciting way to do it and you don't bet the farm yeah that's some great investment advice Michael and lots of interesting biotech stocks to look into I know our viewers I'm sure are interested to hear what those are again we will link to Michael and Weiss ratings report that will be coming out soon naming some of those stocks he just previewed for us Michael thank you again for this great conversation on biotech stocks

AI industry for weeks months maybe even years but there's a silent industry that's really starting to make a big [Music] comeback here to talk a little bit more about the Biotech Industry is Weiss ratings technology editor Michael a Robinson Michael you do a monthly newsletter all about this right right we're talking about uh my monthly newsletter is called disruptors and dominators and what we're looking at and those are disruptive uh areas which obviously biotech is a disruptive area especially when you put biotech and AI together that's disruptive or someone who's a dominant player in their field and in fact you mentioned I'm working on a special report we'll talk a little bit about this one stock but they dominate a particular type of Biotech franchise I mean they totally own the segment of the market and we talk a little bit more about the disease area so they're using disruptive science and they're also a dominant player in in their in their in their sector which is which is which is great to have those two together I love the symmetry of that yeah and we are going to get to that information in those picks in just a little bit but first let's do an a general overview of where the Biotech Industry is right now in the stock market how is this industry trading right now it's had quite a comeback but sort of uh very quietly sort of almost under the r radar because as you mentioned you know AI is getting a lot of attention and specifically nvidia's like sucked all the oxygen out of the room right it's was like all the market was like oh they're going to report on August 28th they was like holding their breath but how's it going to be but biotech has really kind of come back if you think about Bridget why uh there was an overreaction we went into a postco tail spin for a lot of these stocks people felt there was no more upside left that all the all the money that could be made uh sort of like biotech at that time sort of like going out for the low hanging fruit but they've made quite a bit quite a bit of comeback all results oriented of course some of these guys have been really just killing it with earnings and sales growth and so a couple of a couple of names that pop out at me is arus Biotherapeutics and they had Peak gains recently of 212% which is you know apple apple investors would like to have that in the same amount of time right speaking as an apple investor and then um the other one was janx and this one's up like almost 275% for its peak gains just just a very short amount of time so what we've seen is that biotech kind of went like this and some of these leaders have just just really broken out and you know that's like you know a bunch of years of the S&amp;P gains all in one all in one and so what's been going on behind the scenes and I think not that many investors really realized what's going on but the FDA has a program let me use a metaphor you know what a first class passenger is at an airport right they get front of the line they get the good seats they get the good drinks they get the best food they get the best service the FDA is doing something similar because it wants us the the Americans to have to be healthier and a lot of these drugs uh uh they want to get them faster to Market so what they do is they give you they give these companies what amounts to a first class ticket they give them special treatment they do what they can to encourage them and what's really fascinating from an investment standpoint is I actually couldn't believe this I had a team go through this we spent quite a bit of time going through all of the data 97% of the time it's almost like pretty close to 100% the stock goes up when they get this and the FDA doesn't say anything it's just a very quiet signal FDA doesn't put out a press release the companies typically put out a press release and then when they do that their their their stocks can go up pretty dramatically uh one was up 845 per in the first six months after it got this first class ticket and another one I'm just of I want I want to give you the accurate data here one of them was up 119% two days wow what is that 15 years the S&amp;P return or something like that in two days that's pretty amazing it's incredible I want to talk about that a little bit about the Biotech Industry for investors if you are getting in on any biotech stock I feel like it is all a reaction to FDA approval advancements or announcements in a in a new breakthrough or even just a news event I feel like this industry and the sector specifically are really impacted by these potentially volatile announcements yeah um it is true you don't want to be on the receiving end of a FDA say no that that hurts the stock so what we're always looking for as investors is where that we want the Dex act in our favor so that's why we're looking at companies that have a really good relationship with the FDA and have a good track record uh of getting of getting these things approved and in fact um I've just prepared a special report on this very topic uh and it looks at the signal that we've been talking about where 97% of the time the stocks go up that's there's no such thing as a sure thing in investing but with a 97% win rate that that's as close as you're going to get uh to doing that so that's one of the things we want that we monitor um and there three companies in particular that I think kind of exemplify that if if you'd like can kind of give you some of the high high points of each one of these players and and kind of what makes them so exciting yeah let's see some examples of what this looks like because I think for investors the real value comes in they want to take advantage of that 800% growth but they need to get in before it happens are these stocks kind of examples of that well what they are examples of is these are got these are all three of these players one's a moonshot one's a low pric moonshot stock we like you know I like the moonshot stocks you don't bet the farm on them I'll get to that in a second but one one of one of them is I think gets to your point and I think it does it very well this company has the best of both worlds so they have a lot of experimental science stuff in the gene therapy but they also have a lot of drugs on the market right now that are cash cows they basically own the cystic fibrosis Market there have several drugs out there right now generating you know hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Revenue every year and so we got the stability but then they also have joint ventures where they're working with gene therapy again you're going in and fixing things at the genetic level so that you don't have to keep taking drugs and you don't have to have a chemotherapy or operations or a series of both um and and the first two that they have going on right now is one has to deal with CLE cell anemia that's a you don't want that it's it's a genetically related disease it affects about 100,000 people in the United States at any point in time often fatal so these guys have a therapy out for that and the other one that they have which is a larger patient population is type one diabetes and that affects around just just shy let's it's like around 3.8 million so just shy of four million peoples so that's a pretty large uh uh patient population and this company and this is the other thing we're looking for because we have our moonshot stock but you have something very stable here that these guys have done a really good job of growing earnings faster than sales so as somebody who analyzes technology Investments all day I really like to see that um so well that tells me it's a very efficient firm it tells me it's an extremely well-run firm it tells me that the that the drugs that are on the market are really generating a lot of cash that falls to the bottom line with investors that's what we want and so they've been growing their earnings the earnings over the last three years have averaged per share profits have grown 30% a year on average over the last three years but even better uh Bridget is that they're growing their earnings five times faster than sales ah man that is that you know I want that I want that stock I mean that's that's something I I get both I get stability a lot of drugs on the market they've got 18 drugs in their pipeline they've got these joint ventures go going on in in gene therapy so that that that that's kind of the number one right there that gives as I said I love I love the double play here we it's a twofer we get Cutting Edge science but if something doesn't go right it's not going to bring the firm down they've got a really good moat for us as investors they can take a flyer and invest you know hundreds of millions of dollars potentially if they want to and it's not going to kill them if if the if if the thing doesn't eventually pay out but what they're doing is they joint venturing with stuff that they can get on the market right away as or as fast as possible that sounds like a great company and a great first stock pick in the Biotech Industry for those looking for a a pretty solid stock to get

mentioned you know AI is getting a lot of attention and specifically nvidia's like sucked all the oxygen out of the room right it's was like all the market was like oh they're going to report on August 28th they was like holding their breath but how's it going to be but biotech has really kind of come back if you think about Bridget why uh there was an overreaction we went into a postco tail spin for a lot of these stocks people felt there was no more upside left that all the all the money that could be made uh sort of like biotech at that time sort of like going out for the low hanging fruit but they've made quite a bit quite a bit of comeback all results oriented of course some of these guys have been really just killing it with earnings and sales growth and so a couple of a couple of names that pop out at me is arus Biotherapeutics and they had Peak gains recently of 212% which is you know apple apple investors would like to have that in the same amount of time right speaking as an apple investor and then um the other one was janx and this one's up like almost 275% for its peak gains just just a very short amount of time so what we've seen is that biotech kind of went like this and some of these leaders have just just really broken out and you know that's like you know a bunch of years of the S&amp;P gains all in one all in one and so what's been going on behind the scenes and I think not that many investors really realized what's going on but the FDA has a program let me use a metaphor you know what a first class passenger is at an airport right they get front of the line they get the good seats they get the good drinks they get the best food they get the best service the FDA is doing something similar because it wants us the the Americans to have to be healthier and a lot of these drugs uh uh they want to get them faster to Market so what they do is they give you they give these companies what amounts to a first class ticket they give them special treatment they do what they can to encourage them and what's really fascinating from an investment standpoint is I actually couldn't believe this I had a team go through this we spent quite a bit of time going through all of the data 97% of the time it's almost like pretty close to 100% the stock goes up when they get this and the FDA doesn't say anything it's just a very quiet signal FDA doesn't put out a press release the companies typically put out a press release and then when they do that their their their stocks can go up pretty dramatically uh one was up 845 per in the first six months after it got this first class ticket and another one I'm just of I want I want to give you the accurate data here one of them was up 119% two days wow what is that 15 years the S&amp;P return or something like that in two days that's pretty amazing it's incredible I want to talk about that a little bit about the Biotech Industry for investors if you are getting in on any biotech stock I feel like it is all a reaction to FDA approval advancements or announcements in a in a new breakthrough or even just a news event I feel like this industry and the sector specifically are really impacted by these potentially volatile announcements yeah um it is true you don't want to be on the receiving end of a FDA say no that that hurts the stock so what we're always looking for as investors is where that we want the Dex act in our favor so that's why we're looking at companies that have a really good relationship with the FDA and have a good track record uh of getting of getting these things approved and in fact um I've just prepared a special report on this very topic uh and it looks at the signal that we've been talking about where 97% of the time the stocks go up that's there's no such thing as a sure thing in investing but with a 97% win rate that that's as close as you're going to get uh to doing that so that's one of the things we want that we monitor um and there three companies in particular that I think kind of exemplify that if if you'd like can kind of give you some of the high high points of each one of these players and and kind of what makes them so exciting yeah let's see some examples of what this looks like because I think for investors the real value comes in they want to take advantage of that 800% growth but they need to get in before it happens are these stocks kind of examples of that well what they are examples of is these are got these are all three of these players one's a moonshot one's a low pric moonshot stock we like you know I like the moonshot stocks you don't bet the farm on them I'll get to that in a second but one one of one of them is I think gets to your point and I think it does it very well this company has the best of both worlds so they have a lot of experimental science stuff in the gene therapy but they also have a lot of drugs on the market right now that are cash cows they basically own the cystic fibrosis Market there have several drugs out there right now generating you know hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Revenue every year and so we got the stability but then they also have joint ventures where they're working with gene therapy again you're going in and fixing things at the genetic level so that you don't have to keep taking drugs and you don't have to have a chemotherapy or operations or a series of both um and and the first two that they have going on right now is one has to deal with CLE cell anemia that's a you don't want that it's it's a genetically related disease it affects about 100,000 people in the United States at any point in time often fatal so these guys have a therapy out for that and the other one that they have which is a larger patient population is type one diabetes and that affects around just just shy let's it's like around 3.8 million so just shy of four million peoples so that's a pretty large uh uh patient population and this company and this is the other thing we're looking for because we have our moonshot stock but you have something very stable here that these guys have done a really good job of growing earnings faster than sales so as somebody who analyzes technology Investments all day I really like to see that um so well that tells me it's a very efficient firm it tells me it's an extremely well-run firm it tells me that the that the drugs that are on the market are really generating a lot of cash that falls to the bottom line with investors that's what we want and so they've been growing their earnings the earnings over the last three years have averaged per share profits have grown 30% a year on average over the last three years but even better uh Bridget is that they're growing their earnings five times faster than sales ah man that is that you know I want that I want that stock I mean that's that's something I I get both I get stability a lot of drugs on the market they've got 18 drugs in their pipeline they've got these joint ventures go going on in in gene therapy so that that that that's kind of the number one right there that gives as I said I love I love the double play here we it's a twofer we get Cutting Edge science but if something doesn't go right it's not going to bring the firm down they've got a really good moat for us as investors they can take a flyer and invest you know hundreds of millions of dollars potentially if they want to and it's not going to kill them if if the if if the thing doesn't eventually pay out but what they're doing is they joint venturing with stuff that they can get on the market right away as or as fast as possible that sounds like a great company and a great first stock pick in the Biotech Industry for those looking for a a pretty solid stock to get into this industry uh what's the second stock that you're looking at in the biotech sector it's also a large a larger stock you know we're looking at quality that the first two are are are quality plays CU talk about the moonshot in the second but what one of the things I I really like about these these guys is that they have we talked about Ai and the marriage of AI and biotech they actually have a joint venture going on with Microsoft they're using Microsoft's AI model or their AI platform to help accelerate drug Discovery and they've also moved into some interesting areas of cutting egg science they recently struck a deal with a company called Voyager Therapeutics and this thing covers this this pack covers Huntington's disease and muscular distrophy spinal muscular distrophy yet I want either one of these diseases they're they're bad news all right um but this could be worth 1.2 billion dollars in the next few years in in extra sales so again what we have is an established player that's that's joining forces with somebody a little bit more on The Cutting Edge and we we as investors get access to The Cutting Edge science but without we're not betting the farm on that like a lot of these smaller biotech companies do uh these guys have been around for a long time and they're on paage to double their earnings bridging in the next three years so I that's something I like to see I like to see an earnings double it tells me you know kind of where out where we going to be three years six years if they keep that pace up doubling your earnings every three years or so is pretty good that also sounds like a great biotech stock but I do notice you haven't named it yet how can people find out what you're talking about here well you have to get a copy of my special report and the title of it is the next FDA signal how to profit off of first class drugs and we we lay all this stuff out in that report I know you wanted to preview one more of that's going to be in that report and this one's kind of more of a long shot right I mean this is a this is a stock that trades under $10 a share um and so it's not yet invest investor grade so what that means is that you're not going to find a lot of institutional investors backing the stock it's going to be mostly smaller players uh the $460 million market cap uh it's small for a lot of even even hedge funds it's a little bit on the small side um but what's really interesting about is what makes this a great there's two things really is they're involved in this Cutting Edge signs we've been talking about here today Bridget with genetic therapy and and looking at solving disease at the at the genetic level but these guys have a CEO who used to be at Biogen Biogen is a major player in the industry and has been for quite some time now and what's interesting about that is he was there when they were building out their franchise he was involved in another a number of uh drugs that made it to Market so that so he's got to track where you're getting drugs to Market and then what's also interesting just from a just from a almost an intuitive standpoint the company when he was at Biogen it's it's now a $33 billion market cap company so it's a it's at the upper end of the of the midcap his cap right now is $460 million but if he just got to 10% of Biogen market cap you'd go from let's call it 450 to make the math easy 450 billion 450 million to about 3.3 so let's just say 450 to 3.5 billion that's a pretty substantial increase and that's why I think it's just a it defines a moonshot stock If he if he lives up to just 10% of the potential that he that he that he helped bring to Biogen we can see some pretty uh pretty big move in the market cap which the stock has to follow the market cap right the two are are closely interrelated so just getting that up there is going to push the stock price up and this is one that we call it a moonshot I think this is one that you know I always tell people the same thing on on a on a play like this shouldn't put in more than you can afford to lose personally I I I like I like having some Moon shots in there it's just it's an exciting way to do it and you don't bet the farm yeah that's some great investment advice Michael and lots of interesting biotech stocks to look into I know our viewers I'm sure are interested to hear what those are again we will link to Michael and Weiss ratings report that will be coming out soon naming some of those stocks he just previewed for us Michael thank you again for this great conversation on biotech stocks and the industry as a whole we'll continue to follow this and much more right here on Market beat happy investing [Music]",Voyager Therapeutics,1.0,0.5

AI industry for weeks months maybe even years but there's a silent industry that's really starting to make a big [Music] comeback here to talk a little bit more about the Biotech Industry is Weiss ratings technology editor Michael a Robinson Michael you do a monthly newsletter all about this right right we're talking about uh my monthly newsletter is called disruptors and dominators and what we're looking at and those are disruptive uh areas which obviously biotech is a disruptive area especially when you put biotech and AI together that's disruptive or someone who's a dominant player in their field and in fact you mentioned I'm working on a special report we'll talk a little bit about this one stock but they dominate a particular type of Biotech franchise I mean they totally own the segment of the market and we talk a little bit more about the disease area so they're using disruptive science and they're also a dominant player in in their in their in their sector which is which is

the drugs that are on the market are really generating a lot of cash that falls to the bottom line with investors that's what we want and so they've been growing their earnings the earnings over the last three years have averaged per share profits have grown 30% a year on average over the last three years but even better uh Bridget is that they're growing their earnings five times faster than sales ah man that is that you know I want that I want that stock I mean that's that's something I I get both I get stability a lot of drugs on the market they've got 18 drugs in their pipeline they've got these joint ventures go going on in in gene therapy so that that that that's kind of the number one right there that gives as I said I love I love the double play here we it's a twofer we get Cutting Edge science but if something doesn't go right it's not going to bring the firm down they've got a really good moat for us as investors they can take a flyer and invest you know hundreds of millions of dollars potentially if they want to and it's not going to kill them if if the if if the thing doesn't eventually pay out but what they're doing is they joint venturing with stuff that they can get on the market right away as or as fast as possible that sounds like a great company and a great first stock pick in the Biotech Industry for those looking for a a pretty solid stock to get into this industry uh what's the second stock that you're looking at in the biotech sector it's also a large a larger stock you know we're looking at quality that the first two are are are quality plays CU talk about the moonshot in the second but what one of the things I I really like about these these guys is that they have we talked about Ai and the marriage of AI and biotech they actually have a joint venture going on with Microsoft they're using Microsoft's AI model or their AI platform to help accelerate drug Discovery and they've also moved into some interesting areas of cutting egg science they recently struck a deal with a company called Voyager Therapeutics and this thing covers this this pack covers Huntington's disease and muscular distrophy spinal muscular distrophy yet I want either one of these diseases they're they're bad news all right um but this could be worth 1.2 billion dollars in the next few years in in extra sales so again what we have is an established player that's that's joining forces with somebody a little bit more on The Cutting Edge and we we as investors get access to The Cutting Edge science but without we're not betting the farm on that like a lot of these smaller biotech companies do uh these guys have been around for a long time and they're on paage to double their earnings bridging in the next three years so I that's something I like to see I like to see an earnings double it tells me you know kind of where out where we going to be three years six years if they keep that pace up doubling your earnings every three years or so is pretty good that also sounds like a great biotech stock but I do notice you haven't named it yet how can people find out what you're talking about here well you have to get a copy of my special report and the title of it is the next FDA signal how to profit off of first class drugs and we we lay all this stuff out in that report I know you wanted to preview one more of that's going to be in that report and this one's kind of more of a long shot right I mean this is a this is a stock that trades under $10 a share um and so it's not yet invest investor grade so what that means is that you're not going to find a lot of institutional investors backing the stock it's going to be mostly smaller players uh the $460 million market cap uh it's small for a lot of even even hedge funds it's a little bit on the small side um but what's really interesting about is what makes this a great there's two things really is they're involved in this Cutting Edge signs we've been talking about here today Bridget with genetic therapy and and looking at solving disease at the at the genetic level but these guys have a CEO who used to be at Biogen Biogen is a major player in the industry and has been for quite some time now and what's interesting about that is he was there when they were building out their franchise he was involved in another a number of uh drugs that made it to Market so that so he's got to track where you're getting drugs to Market and then what's also interesting just from a just from a almost an intuitive standpoint the company when he was at Biogen it's it's now a $33 billion market cap company so it's a it's at the upper end of the of the midcap his cap right now is $460 million but if he just got to 10% of Biogen market cap you'd go from let's call it 450 to make the math easy 450 billion 450 million to about 3.3 so let's just say 450 to 3.5 billion that's a pretty substantial increase and that's why I think it's just a it defines a moonshot stock If he if he lives up to just 10% of the potential that he that he that he helped bring to Biogen we can see some pretty uh pretty big move in the market cap which the stock has to follow the market cap right the two are are closely interrelated so just getting that up there is going to push the stock price up and this is one that we call it a moonshot I think this is one that you know I always tell people the same thing on on a on a play like this shouldn't put in more than you can afford to lose personally I I I like I like having some Moon shots in there it's just it's an exciting way to do it and you don't bet the farm yeah that's some great investment advice Michael and lots of interesting biotech stocks to look into I know our viewers I'm sure are interested to hear what those are again we will link to Michael and Weiss ratings report that will be coming out soon naming some of those stocks he just previewed for us Michael thank you again for this great conversation on biotech stocks

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,W6SjHKofBUE,MarketBeat,2024-09-11 13:37:48+00:00,3 Potential Short Squeezes: Stocks to Watch Now,Kind: captions Language: en it's been two years since a historic short squeeze took over Wall Street could another stock be poised to do the [Music] same here to talk about three stocks that could make good short squeeze candidates is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris let's start off by just talking about what is a short squeeze a short squeeze is it's an event that happens s when you have a stock that's being heavily shorted uh which you can usually notice by the short interest ratio on a stock so when it's being heavily shorted but the price goes up instead of down and it usually goes up very quickly instead of going down so that's creates the conditions for the short squeeze the short buyers have to um or the short sellers I should say have to buy the stock at a higher price to cover their short positions and that's exactly what we saw a couple of years ago with that historic GameStop short squeeze I'll walk people through exactly what happened in that situation so you had many people that were shorting GameStop which means they were making a bet that GameStop was going to go lower but instead of going lower through a Confluence of a lot of circumstances which don't have to be talked about here the stock shot up and it shot up high and then what happened was the short sellers had to start chasing the stock higher and more people kept buying it which meant more short sellers had to keep buying it and it just just took on a life of its own and the momentum Bill and it was again it was yeah it was an epic short squeeze right there for some people a very profitable one too very much talk about what these short squeezes can mean for investors if you are on the the buy side of the trade these can be enormously profitable because again um if you bought GameStop let's say when it was at I don't I don't even know I think it started when it was like at $18 and if you bought it and it was at 20 $25 and you just let it ride and it rode all the way up to wherever it got up to yeah you could you could stand to make a lot of money as long as you could get out of the stock before the stock price came back down and that was the issue with GameStop is some people didn't get out of the stock early enough and then they wound up losing all of the gains that they had that's where the risk comes in with the short squeeze so what makes a stock like GameStop poised to do this kind of short squeeze again in the future well you would like to say that there's something that you can pinpoint and say this is why a short squeeze is going to happen ultimately we're in an age where there's a lot of high-speed trading so really it becomes almost a trading event and if Traders decide as happens a lot of times in some of these investing communities like Reddit and Wall Street Bank that's if you get a lot of people who are actively trading in a stock at one period of time it can cause a short squeeze but sometimes it can happen because of events that happened for example a stock could get an unexpected upgrade or you could see a stock that um beats on earnings when it wasn't expected to or they might have had um a settlement of a lawsuit that went in their favor that wasn't supposed to happen and all of those could have been creating interest on the short side but now because the because the outcome was positive it can cause people to jump in and buy the stock instead which can then Force those short sellers to buy the stock you have three stocks that you think could be in this situation we're going to get to those picks in just a minute but first here's a tool you can use to track any stock in your portfolio want to keep your finger on the pulse of the market text the word YouTube to 68 285 that 6 8285 and get free breaking news alerts from Market beat for the stocks that matter most to you don't miss out on crucial updates stay informed and stay ahead all right Chris let's get to your first pick of a stock that you think could potentially see a short squeeze so the first one I had in my article was C3 AI this is a name that's familiar to a lot of investors in the AI space um it's going through a similar issue to Nvidia and I'm not comparing it to Nvidia but I'm saying it's going through a similar issue in that it has delivered good quarterly earnings but not as good as some analysts would like and they've been cautious on their Guidance the issue with C3 AI is they're moving from a subscription-based revenue model which analysts have tended to love over the past few years because it guarantees that predictable Revenue stream that everybody loves to more of a consumption-based approach and right now that's still in the early Innings it's still very tough to gauge how that's going to play out however the company is also taking some some efficiency efforts to try to to make themselves a profitable company because they're not a profitable company yet but all of this is which to say if you have a few profitable quarters coming or if they continue to beat Revenue estimates analysts still have a price Target on the stock that's about 29% higher than where it's at right now and this could be one that has the potential to go much higher and could be something where you don't want to be caught short on it is there enough of a following for this AI stock there's so many out there yeah is there kind of that fan following for this one um I I don't know right now it seems right now that there's more bearish sentiment on it than there's bullish sentiment there seems to be some sort of I would call it maybe an AI fatigue going on right now and some investors are choosing there are one or two stocks that they're going to invest in the AI Circle C3 AI may may be on the outside of that right now but for all the reasons I just said it's one that investors may want to be looking at very carefully especially since analysts have about a 29% upside on the stock NOW your second pck for a stock that could be a good short squeeze candidate is not in the AI realm but it's a brand many people are familiar with right it's RH now the company the the stock ticker RH in the name of theany as RH but many investors may know it better as Restoration Hardware it's a um premium supplier and manufacturer of Home Furnishings so obviously as you would expect uh in 2020 and 2021 the company was doing very well the stock was doing very well as people were buying houses they were relocating they were renovating the houses they did have in fact at one point RH stock went up over $700 a here well yeah it's at 241 right now so it's gone down significantly since then and you would expect that for all of the reasons that we talked about now the housing market is is tighter people who have looked to do Renovations on their home have already done it others that might be looking to do larger Renovations might be holding off waiting for more favorable interest rates waiting for inflation pressures to come down that's where the opportunity May lie we have a we have a federal Federal Reserve that is likely to cut interest rates when they meet next week that may not trickle down to Consumers right away but it is expected that if that happens you might start seeing some loosening up in the housing markets in any event the stocks tend to precede the overall Market by 6 to nine months so now might be an interesting time to get in on RH and if that stock does if the company does happen to improve their earnings Outlook because right now revenue is about at 2019 levels so it's not too bad and it's about where investors might expect to see it the problem is that right now the company their earnings have been negative because the as a company they're facing the pricing pressures that are coming from Supply chains and inflation and all that if that turns around you could see the stock start moving up higher and again it might be an interesting short squeeze candidate now does every short squeeze have to happen with that fan following like we saw in gain stop or can it happen by the kind of economic factors you just talked about yeah I think it can be it can be either one in fact I think what made GameStop so unique was the fact that the short squeeze happened in absence of any real fundamental reason for it happening it was sort of a Mania and again that's that's not to judge it one way or the other it's just to say it did happen without any fundamentals many short squeeze happen because of some fundamental Catalyst and it's also important to note that many short squeezes never get to the level where GameStop as which is again what made GameStop so unique let's get on to your third pick of a good short squeeze candidate what's your final stock okay so the third one I'm not necessarily going to say is my is a good short squeeze candidate in terms of a stock that I would like to own but it's one that I think investors might want to take a look at and it's beyond beyond meat now beyond meat has had a terrible year I think the stock is down 30% this year it's down about 45% in the last 12 months short interest on this stock is a whopping 42% that's a lot of people betting that the stock is going to go lower and they could be right the one of the reasons for that this isn't a critique of the plant-based meat industry plant-based foods are here to stay plant-based products are here to stay and it's and in fact that's the actual issue that's going on with beyond meat was when they came into the market they didn't have a lot of competition now unfortunately even as plant-based products are getting more popularity there's also a lot more competition in the space for Beyond me and it's hard for them to Stand Out Among that competition however the reason why I think it might be a short squeeze candidate is again you've got 42% short interest so you got a lot lot of people that are betting the stocks going to go down however what is what it's looking like is in the next four quarters the companies going to have a lot easier comparisons on the top line they just went through a year where they were having very difficult comparisons where it was going to be very tough for them to beat Revenue expectations from the prior year this year should be a lot easier that being said the company's not profitable I don't expect it to turn a profit this year but just the fact that it could beat those Topline estimates could be enough to convince people to jump in on the stock and again with that high of short interest there could be a squeeze here with beyond meat how big of a squeeze would you think with the short interest you're talking about well I wouldn't if I were an investor in beyond meat right now it's it's trading around $6 a share so it's just over penny stock territory actually the analyst forecasts on Market beat are actually suggesting that stock could still go lower I don't think investors should be looking at this as being like a a $55 $20 stock here but I think if you were looking at the stock and said you could get it to7 8 $9 you're still looking at a very nice profit on that stock and that's what I might be looking at if I were an investor some great information and good stocks to look into thank you so much for the list Chris and thank you for joining us here at Market beat stay with us for more information on all the stocks in your portfolio and

actually the analyst forecasts on Market beat are actually suggesting that stock could still go lower I don't think investors should be looking at this as being like a a $55 $20 stock here but I think if you were looking at the stock and said you could get it to7 8 $9 you're still looking at a very nice profit on that stock and that's what I might be looking at if I were an investor some great information and good stocks to look into thank you so much for the list Chris and thank you for joining us here at Market beat stay with us for more information on all the stocks in your portfolio and

since a historic short squeeze took over Wall Street could another stock be poised to do the [Music] same here to talk about three stocks that could make good short squeeze candidates is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris let's start off by just talking about what is a short squeeze a short squeeze is it's an event that happens s when you have a stock that's being heavily shorted uh which you can usually notice by the short interest ratio on a stock so when it's being heavily shorted but the price goes up instead of down and it usually goes up very quickly instead of going down so that's creates the conditions for the short squeeze the short buyers have to um or the short sellers I should say have to buy the stock at a higher price to cover their short positions and that's exactly what we saw a couple of years ago with that historic GameStop short squeeze I'll walk people through exactly what happened in that situation so you had many people that were shorting GameStop which means they were making a bet that GameStop was going to go lower but instead of going lower through a Confluence of a lot of circumstances which don't have to be talked about here the stock shot up and it shot up high and then what happened was the short sellers had to start chasing the stock higher and more people kept buying it which meant more short sellers had to keep buying it and it just just took on a life of its own and the momentum Bill and it was again it was yeah it was an epic short squeeze right there for some people a very profitable one too very much talk about what these short squeezes can mean for investors if you are on the the buy side of the trade these can be enormously profitable because again um if you bought GameStop let's say when it was at I don't I don't even know I think it started when it was like at $18 and if you bought it and it was at 20 $25 and you just let it ride and it rode all the way up to wherever it got up to yeah you could you could stand to make a lot of money as long as you could get out of the stock before the stock price came back down and that was the issue with GameStop is some people didn't get out of the stock early enough and then they wound up losing all of the gains that they had that's where the risk comes in with the short squeeze so what makes a stock like GameStop poised to do this kind of short squeeze again in the future well you would like to say that there's something that you can pinpoint and say this is why a short squeeze is going to happen ultimately we're in an age where there's a lot of high-speed trading so really it becomes almost a trading event and if Traders decide as happens a lot of times in some of these investing communities like Reddit and Wall Street Bank that's if you get a lot of people who are actively trading in a stock at one period of time it can cause a short squeeze but sometimes it can happen because of events that happened for example a stock could get an unexpected upgrade or you could see a stock that um beats on earnings when it wasn't expected to or they might have had um a settlement of a lawsuit that went in their favor that wasn't supposed to happen and all of those could have been creating interest on the short side but now because the because the outcome was positive it can cause people to jump in and buy the stock instead which can then Force those short sellers to buy the stock you have three stocks that you think could be in this situation we're going to get to those picks in just a minute but first here's a tool you can use to track any stock in your portfolio want to keep your finger on the pulse of the market text the word YouTube to 68 285 that 6 8285 and get free breaking news alerts from Market beat for the stocks that matter most to you don't miss out on crucial updates stay informed and stay ahead all right Chris let's get to your first pick of a stock that you think could potentially see a short squeeze so the first one I had in my article was C3 AI this is a name that's familiar to a lot of investors in the AI space um it's going through a similar issue to Nvidia and I'm not comparing it to Nvidia but I'm saying it's going through a similar issue in that it has delivered good quarterly earnings but not as good as some analysts would like and they've been cautious on their Guidance the issue with C3 AI is they're moving from a subscription-based revenue model which analysts have tended to love over the past few years because it guarantees that predictable Revenue stream that everybody loves to more of a consumption-based approach and right now that's still in the early Innings it's still very tough to gauge how that's going to play out however the company is also taking some some efficiency efforts to try to to make themselves a profitable company because they're not a profitable company yet but all of this is which to say if you have a few profitable quarters coming or if they continue to beat Revenue estimates analysts still have a price Target on the stock that's about 29% higher than where it's at right now and this could be one that has the potential to go much higher and could be something where you don't want to be caught short on it is there enough of a following for this AI stock there's so many out there yeah is there kind of that fan following for this one um I I don't know right now it seems right now that there's more bearish sentiment on it than there's bullish sentiment there seems to be some sort of I would call it maybe an AI fatigue going on right now and some investors are choosing there are one or two stocks that they're going to invest in the AI Circle C3 AI may may be on the outside of that right now but for all the reasons I just said it's one that investors may want to be looking at very carefully especially since analysts have about a 29% upside on the stock NOW your second pck for a stock that could be a good short squeeze candidate is not in the AI realm but it's a brand many people are familiar with right it's RH now the company the the stock ticker RH in the name of theany as RH but many investors may know it better as Restoration Hardware it's a um premium supplier and manufacturer of Home Furnishings so obviously as you would expect uh in 2020 and 2021 the company was doing very well the stock was doing very well as people were buying houses they were relocating they were renovating the houses they did have in fact at one point RH stock went up over $700 a here well yeah it's at 241 right now so it's gone down significantly since then and you would expect that for all of the reasons that we talked about now the housing market is is tighter people who have looked to do Renovations on their home have already done it others that might be looking to do larger Renovations might be holding off waiting for more favorable interest rates waiting for inflation pressures to come down that's where the opportunity May lie we have a we have a federal Federal Reserve that is likely to cut interest rates when they meet next week that may not trickle down to Consumers right away but it is expected that if that happens you might start seeing some loosening up in the housing markets in any event the stocks tend to precede the overall Market by 6 to nine months so now might be an interesting time to get in on RH and if that stock does if the company does happen to improve their earnings Outlook because right now revenue is about at 2019 levels so it's not too bad and it's about where investors might expect to see it the problem is that right now the company their earnings have been negative because the as a company they're facing the pricing pressures that are coming from Supply chains and inflation and all that if that turns around you could see the stock start moving up higher and again it might be an interesting short squeeze candidate now does every short squeeze have to happen with that fan following like we saw in gain stop or can it happen by the kind of economic factors you just talked about yeah I think it can be it can be either one in fact I think what made GameStop so unique was the fact that the short squeeze happened in absence of any real fundamental reason for it happening it was sort of a Mania and again that's that's not to judge it one way or the other it's just to say it did happen without any fundamentals many short squeeze happen because of some fundamental Catalyst and it's also important to note that many short squeezes never get to the level where GameStop as which is again what made GameStop so unique let's get on to your third pick of a good short squeeze candidate what's your final stock okay so the third one I'm not necessarily going to say is my is a good short squeeze candidate in terms of a stock that I would like to own but it's one that I think investors might want to take a look at and it's beyond beyond meat now beyond meat has had a terrible year I think the stock is down 30% this year it's down about 45% in the last 12 months short interest on this stock is a whopping 42% that's a lot of people betting that the stock is going to go lower and they could be right the one of the reasons for that this isn't a critique of the plant-based meat industry plant-based foods are here to stay plant-based products are here to stay and it's and in fact that's the actual issue that's going on with beyond meat was when they came into the market they didn't have a lot of competition now unfortunately even as plant-based products are getting more popularity there's also a lot more competition in the space for Beyond me and it's hard for them to Stand Out Among that competition however the reason why I think it might be a short squeeze candidate is again you've got 42% short interest so you got a lot lot of people that are betting the stocks going to go down however what is what it's looking like is in the next four quarters the companies going to have a lot easier comparisons on the top line they just went through a year where they were having very difficult comparisons where it was going to be very tough for them to beat Revenue expectations from the prior year this year should be a lot easier that being said the company's not profitable I don't expect it to turn a profit this year but just the fact that it could beat those Topline estimates could be enough to convince people to jump in on the stock and again with that high of short interest there could be a squeeze here with beyond meat how big of a squeeze would you think with the short interest you're talking about well I wouldn't if I were an investor in beyond meat right now it's it's trading around $6 a share so it's just over penny stock territory actually the analyst forecasts on Market beat are actually suggesting that stock could still go lower I don't think investors should be looking at this as being like a a $55 $20 stock here but I think

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,W6SjHKofBUE,MarketBeat,2024-09-11 13:37:48+00:00,3 Potential Short Squeezes: Stocks to Watch Now,Kind: captions Language: en it's been two years since a historic short squeeze took over Wall Street could another stock be poised to do the [Music] same here to talk about three stocks that could make good short squeeze candidates is Market beat analyst Chris marot Chris let's start off by just talking about what is a short squeeze a short squeeze is it's an event that happens s when you have a stock that's being heavily shorted uh which you can usually notice by the short interest ratio on a stock so when it's being heavily shorted but the price goes up instead of down and it usually goes up very quickly instead of going down so that's creates the conditions for the short squeeze the short buyers have to um or the short sellers I should say have to buy the stock at a higher price to cover their short positions and that's exactly what we saw a couple of years ago with that historic GameStop short squeeze I'll walk people through exactly what happened in that situation so you had many people that were shorting GameStop which means they were making a bet that GameStop was going to go lower but instead of going lower through a Confluence of a lot of circumstances which don't have to be talked about here the stock shot up and it shot up high and then what happened was the short sellers had to start chasing the stock higher and more people kept buying it which meant more short sellers had to keep buying it and it just just took on a life of its own and the momentum Bill and it was again it was yeah it was an epic short squeeze right there for some people a very profitable one too very much talk about what these short squeezes can mean for investors if you are on the the buy side of the trade these can be enormously profitable because again um if you bought GameStop let's say when it was at I don't I don't even know I think it started when it was like at $18 and if you bought it and it was at 20 $25 and you just let it ride and it rode all the way up to wherever it got up to yeah you could you could stand to make a lot of money as long as you could get out of the stock before the stock price came back down and that was the issue with GameStop is some people didn't get out of the stock early enough and then they wound up losing all of the gains that they had that's where the risk comes in with the short squeeze so what makes a stock like GameStop poised to do this kind of short squeeze again in the future well you would like to say that there's something that you can pinpoint and say this is why a short squeeze is going to happen ultimately we're in an age where there's a lot of high-speed trading so really it becomes almost a trading event and if Traders decide as happens a lot of times in some of these investing communities like Reddit and Wall Street Bank that's if you get a lot of people who are actively trading in a stock at one period of time it can cause a short squeeze but sometimes it can happen because of events that happened for example a stock could get an unexpected upgrade or you could see a stock that um beats on earnings when it wasn't expected to or they might have had um a settlement of a lawsuit that went in their favor that wasn't supposed to happen and all of those could have been creating interest on the short side but now because the because the outcome was positive it can cause people to jump in and buy the stock instead which can then Force those short sellers to buy the stock you have three stocks that you think could be in this situation we're going to get to those picks in just a minute but first here's a tool you can use to track any stock in your portfolio want to keep your finger on the pulse of the market text the word YouTube to 68 285 that 6 8285 and get free breaking news alerts from Market beat for the stocks that matter most to you don't miss out on crucial updates stay informed and stay ahead all right Chris let's get to your first pick of a stock that you think could potentially see a short squeeze so the first one I had in my article was C3 AI this is a name that's familiar to a lot of investors in the AI space um it's going through a similar issue to Nvidia and I'm not comparing it to Nvidia but I'm saying it's going through a similar issue in that it has delivered good quarterly earnings but not as good as some analysts would like and they've been cautious on their Guidance the issue with C3 AI is they're moving from a subscription-based revenue model which analysts have tended to love over the past few years because it guarantees that predictable Revenue stream that everybody loves to more of a consumption-based approach and right now that's still in the early Innings it's still very tough to gauge how that's going to play out however the company is also taking some some efficiency efforts to try to to make themselves a profitable company because they're not a profitable company yet but all of this is which to say if you have a few profitable quarters coming or if they continue to beat Revenue estimates analysts still have a price Target on the stock that's about 29% higher than where it's at right now and this could be one that has the potential to go much higher and could be something where you don't want to be caught short on it is there enough of a following for this AI stock there's so many out there yeah is there kind of that fan following for this one um I I don't know right now it seems right now that there's more bearish sentiment on it than there's bullish sentiment there seems to be some sort of I would call it maybe an AI fatigue going on right now and some investors are choosing there are one or two stocks that they're going to invest in the AI Circle C3 AI may may be on the outside of that right now but for all the reasons I just said it's one that investors may want to be looking at very carefully especially since analysts have about a 29% upside on the stock NOW your second pck for a stock that could be a good short squeeze candidate is not in the AI realm but it's a brand many people are familiar with right it's RH now the company the the stock ticker RH in the name of theany as RH but many investors may know it better as Restoration Hardware it's a um premium supplier and manufacturer of Home Furnishings so obviously as you would expect uh in 2020 and 2021 the company was doing very well the stock was doing very well as people were buying houses they were relocating they were renovating the houses they did have in fact at one point RH stock went up over $700 a here well yeah it's at 241 right now so it's gone down significantly since then and you would expect that for all of the reasons that we talked about now the housing market is is tighter people who have looked to do Renovations on their home have already done it others that might be looking to do larger Renovations might be holding off waiting for more favorable interest rates waiting for inflation pressures to come down that's where the opportunity May lie we have a we have a federal Federal Reserve that is likely to cut interest rates when they meet next week that may not trickle down to Consumers right away but it is expected that if that happens you might start seeing some loosening up in the housing markets in any event the stocks tend to precede the overall Market by 6 to nine months so now might be an interesting time to get in on RH and if that stock does if the company does happen to improve their earnings Outlook because right now revenue is about at 2019 levels so it's not too bad and it's about where investors might expect to see it the problem is that right now the company their earnings have been negative because the as a company they're facing the pricing pressures that are coming from Supply chains and inflation and all that if that turns around you could see the stock start moving up higher and again it might be an interesting short squeeze candidate now does every short squeeze have to happen with that fan following like we saw in gain stop or can it happen by the kind of economic factors you just talked about yeah I think it can be it can be either one in fact I think what made GameStop so unique was the fact that the short squeeze happened in absence of any real fundamental reason for it happening it was sort of a Mania and again that's that's not to judge it one way or the other it's just to say it did happen without any fundamentals many short squeeze happen because of some fundamental Catalyst and it's also important to note that many short squeezes never get to the level where GameStop as which is again what made GameStop so unique let's get on to your third pick of a good short squeeze candidate what's your final stock okay so the third one I'm not necessarily going to say is my is a good short squeeze candidate in terms of a stock that I would like to own but it's one that I think investors might want to take a look at and it's beyond beyond meat now beyond meat has had a terrible year I think the stock is down 30% this year it's down about 45% in the last 12 months short interest on this stock is a whopping 42% that's a lot of people betting that the stock is going to go lower and they could be right the one of the reasons for that this isn't a critique of the plant-based meat industry plant-based foods are here to stay plant-based products are here to stay and it's and in fact that's the actual issue that's going on with beyond meat was when they came into the market they didn't have a lot of competition now unfortunately even as plant-based products are getting more popularity there's also a lot more competition in the space for Beyond me and it's hard for them to Stand Out Among that competition however the reason why I think it might be a short squeeze candidate is again you've got 42% short interest so you got a lot lot of people that are betting the stocks going to go down however what is what it's looking like is in the next four quarters the companies going to have a lot easier comparisons on the top line they just went through a year where they were having very difficult comparisons where it was going to be very tough for them to beat Revenue expectations from the prior year this year should be a lot easier that being said the company's not profitable I don't expect it to turn a profit this year but just the fact that it could beat those Topline estimates could be enough to convince people to jump in on the stock and again with that high of short interest there could be a squeeze here with beyond meat how big of a squeeze would you think with the short interest you're talking about well I wouldn't if I were an investor in beyond meat right now it's it's trading around $6 a share so it's just over penny stock territory actually the analyst forecasts on Market beat are actually suggesting that stock could still go lower I don't think investors should be looking at this as being like a a $55 $20 stock here but I think if you were looking at the stock and said you could get it to7 8 $9 you're still looking at a very nice profit on that stock and that's what I might be looking at if I were an investor some great information and good stocks to look into thank you so much for the list Chris and thank you for joining us here at Market beat stay with us for more information on all the stocks in your portfolio and

into Netflix's latest growth drivers is Market beat analyst jayu Jay commercials are kind of a thing of the past but they seem to be making comeback on Netflix ad supported revenues is basically a game Cher for Netflix for the longest time they've held out from having commercials on their service but once they embrac the uh ad supported programming that's when their growth resumed again they uh were able to basically add 40 million new subscribers in less than a year and it's continuing to grow yeah what is that new advertising model meant for Revenue right so basically with with the ad supported tiers um they are able to do conversion they don't have a free tier anymore so the lowest tier is $6.99 and you have commercials um if you want to get rid of the commercials that's when you can get on a standard tier an upgrade to the 15 uh 45 45 level or the price your premium level it's added new Revenue a new Revenue stream to the company um it's obviously a conversion tool and it's also been able to uh help Netflix expand its reach by bundling its service with basically competitors there are packages out there now where you can get uh adree or or an ad tier Netflix along with Disney plus and Hulu or peacock with Netflix Etc almost like the Cable packages um and this allows Netflix to basically bring new people into their ecosystem yeah as consumers have been noticing these new package deals that yes reminds you a lot of the old cable system for sure of course this new program is designed to bring in those new users at that lower cost of Entry everyone was so upset when Netflix was Raising its rate so much but this is a great point of entry for a lot of new users especially in other countries talk about how Netflix is planning to use this advertising supported content to help get some more of those International viewers right so basically their growth is in in international um they've already almost saturated uh you know North America and Canada uh so they're uh thinking of even putting out an ad free tier overseas now they haven't made any announcements but that would definitely boost user engagement uh and would definitely open open the floodgates for uh people to try Netflix and in the lat quarter they have said that 45% of their new subscribers came in through the uh ad supported tier lowest tier uh where it was available yeah the international growth was one of the growth drivers you mentioned along with the advertising but the third point you mentioned in your article about four growth drivers for Netflix was also about margins talk about how you know the user numbers and the advertising has really impacted their margins right 2017 Netflix only had 7% operating margins um this was before advertised uh now in 20124 uh in their second quarter they recorded a 27.2% operating margin that's come from obvious obviously price hikes uh CRA password crackdowns um operating efficiency and their fixed cost content licensing model uh basically they are buying new shows new programs new content uh at the cost of production plus a 30% premium and this is actually a lot cheaper than TV shows uh where the networks would actually you know buy TV shows uh content for uh production cost plus a 60 to 70% premium and that's all gone straight to the bottom line and obviously their uper margins now let's move on to your fourth point and this is is an area I haven't personally explored on Netflix yet but they're trying to get into video gaming people obviously spending a lot of time which would increase their time on the platform what's Netflix doing to get into that sector a little more so Netflix has been adding video games to their core Service uh this is pretty much meant to uh upgrade its core service and uh improve user engagement times ultimately I think Netflix wants their platform to be well an engagement Tool uh around the block all over uh so as far as these um interactive uh games um they're really focused on having uh mobile users actually um use play these games stay engaged uh with the platform it just means more eyeballs more eyeballs for advertising because they're they can have in-game advertising ultimately they want to have these games done inhouse um and we're not talking AAA rated Studio games we're not talking Final Fantasy or anything like that but you know on a mobile on a mobile app as long as you can keep users engaged um that's going to help their add revenues so what do all of these growth drivers mean for Netflix stock right so basically Netflix has uh been hovering around that 700 area that's actually been a resistance um so when you have a uh resistance area and and the the thing with Netflix is that it had peaked around 6 9749 and then sold off very hard down to the 592 area uh which is also the anchored vlop support and then shot right back up to two all-time highs and is again finding resistance right around that 700 area um and that's called a vbottom so investors looking for uh entry into Netflix should always wait for a pullback their Fibonacci uh price retracement levels that are in the article um and another way of basically being patient to wait for a pullback to enter is by using uh what's known as cash secured puts and uh if once you get assigned if you do have a position you can actually um have some uh income coming in uh

floodgates for uh people to try Netflix and in the lat quarter they have said that 45% of their new subscribers came in through the uh ad supported tier lowest tier uh where it was available yeah the international growth was one of the growth drivers you mentioned along with the advertising but the third point you mentioned in your article about four growth drivers for Netflix was also about margins talk about how you know the user numbers and the advertising has really impacted their margins right 2017 Netflix only had 7% operating margins um this was before advertised uh now in 20124 uh in their second quarter they recorded a 27.2% operating margin that's come from obvious obviously price hikes uh CRA password crackdowns um operating efficiency and their fixed cost content licensing model uh basically they are buying new shows new programs new content uh at the cost of production plus a 30% premium and this is actually a lot cheaper than TV shows uh where the networks would actually you know buy TV shows uh content for uh production cost plus a 60 to 70% premium and that's all gone straight to the bottom line and obviously their uper margins now let's move on to your fourth point and this is is an area I haven't personally explored on Netflix yet but they're trying to get into video gaming people obviously spending a lot of time which would increase their time on the platform what's Netflix doing to get into that sector a little more so Netflix has been adding video games to their core Service uh this is pretty much meant to uh upgrade its core service and uh improve user engagement times ultimately I think Netflix wants their platform to be well an engagement Tool uh around the block all over uh so as far as these um interactive uh games um they're really focused on having uh mobile users actually um use play these games stay engaged uh with the platform it just means more eyeballs more eyeballs for advertising because they're they can have in-game advertising ultimately they want to have these games done inhouse um and we're not talking AAA rated Studio games we're not talking Final Fantasy or anything like that but you know on a mobile on a mobile app as long as you can keep users engaged um that's going to help their add revenues so what do all of these growth drivers mean for Netflix stock right so basically Netflix has uh been hovering around that 700 area that's actually been a resistance um so when you have a uh resistance area and and the the thing with Netflix is that it had peaked around 6 9749 and then sold off very hard down to the 592 area uh which is also the anchored vlop support and then shot right back up to two all-time highs and is again finding resistance right around that 700 area um and that's called a vbottom so investors looking for uh entry into Netflix should always wait for a pullback their Fibonacci uh price retracement levels that are in the article um and another way of basically being patient to wait for a pullback to enter is by using uh what's known as cash secured puts and uh if once you get assigned if you do have a position you can actually um have some uh income coming in uh

volatility it's good to have a sure thing to hold on to or at least the closest thing to it here to talk about three no-brainer stocks to buy and hold long-term is Market beat analyst Thomas Hughes first off what are some fundamentals you look for in choosing a stock that's good to hold on to long term that you know is not going to be a problem well you want to start with the balance sheet you want it to be healthy and possibly in a fortress condition you want them to have strong cash flow you want to see them growing and to top it off some Capital return helps out a whole lot in the current economic conditions we're in is there such a thing as a sure thing is there is any company have some level of risk with it well all stocks come with risk it's impossible to know where the price is going to go from minute to minute or day to day but you want to look for these strong fundamentally sound companies because they provide steady returns over the long term which is critical for Buy and Hold portfolios should every portfolio have some of these solid stocks that you can hold for many years to come well I I can't say that because I don't know what each portfolio is targeting but investors that are looking to build their retirement income would do well to focus on some no-brainer stocks well let's get to your picks Thomas uh talk about the first company that you are looking at as a no brainer Buy and Hold long-term stock well that's Centos I've been covering Centos for over 12 years it hasn't been much of an exciting company and yet its stock price has increased by quadruple digits while it increases the dividend and buys back shares the dividend increases have the payment up high triple digits in that time um it really is a no-brainer stock it's a stock that you could buy when it's moving up or when it's moving down because you know over time it's going to pay you back so as cintos has been around for quite a while but what exactly does this company do and is their business model something that seems like it's going to hold long term all right the thing about the stocks on this list and I said this in the article they've all got these businesses that are really required by the economy and by Society kind of akin to like a dentist or a mortician everybody's going to have a cavity now and then just about and everybody's going to need to go to the graveyard sooner or later likewise Centos provides uniform servic is for a wide range of businesses these businesses which include a lot of restaurants and other service Industries don't have the time or the capability to wash their towels and wash their uniforms so they really require Centos and their business and Centos is adding value by acquiring ancillary businesses uh one of the more recent ones that happened a few years ago was zedal Z medal provides first aid supplies to the very same businesses that Centos was serving so that acquisition not only provided Cintas um an added growth opportunity but there was a lot of cross- selling opportunities Z clients that weren't using Centos are now using Centos Centos clients that weren't using Z are now using Z good Partnerships always make for good business for sure let's move on to your second stock pick it's one that my children love Casey's uh known for pizza in the Midwest for sure but what about this company makes a no-brainer hold well right it's got a lot of the same qualities as Centos starting with its business model it sells gas and snacks everybody needs gas for their cars and when you get the gas you got to have some snacks today uh Casey is also benefiting from a a downward Shi and consumer habits um it sells some some pretty good values in food and prepared foods and that's been seen in their results but we have a fundamentally strong company it's growing organically and through Acquisitions it's got Fortress balance sheet it's able to self fund its growth cash flow is robust and sustains Capital return which includes dividends and share BuyBacks which is part of the whole investment thesis if you look at the chart it's very similar to Centos the stock pric is up triple digits and trending upward over the very long term any dips in the price action have turned out to be very good buying opportunities gas and snacks aren't going anywhere anytime soon so we're going to need this company for a while but there are a lot of of gas and snack providers out there a lot of competitors what about Casey's business model really sets this stock apart well cases is doing the same thing that cintos has done and is doing and that is consolidating a highly fractured Market there's lots of gas stations but there are very few large gas station chains case's is buying gas stations in critical corridors or critical locations which is fueling its growth and widening its margin that's a solid second no-brainer pick to buy and hold forever but let's go on to your final pick this company may be a little less known than others Shopify I wouldn't put it quite in the same category as Centos and and Casey's it is a must need must have service for small business and even large businesses because it provides a digital footprint it helps them with their e-commerce and with crossb sales um Shopify right now is growing at a high double-digit Pace it's not yet returning Capital but it's Balan she is a fortress so I would expect to see Capital Returns come in time so right now what we're looking at is an outperforming grow story that's got its stock price in a reversal with an expectation for some Capital return to come in time which will be a very great cist for its share price and this stock seems like a little bit a lower point of entry than the other picks that you mentioned right Shopify really got a boost during the pandemic because of the whole e-commerce craze its valuation has come down since then but the real takeaway is that it has continued to outperform consensus even while its price targets were coming down so now it's set up to have a pretty nice rebound and that's being fueled by recent results which show it outperforming and growing and raising Guidance Do you see this company and their business plan really lasting long term much like the gas or the needs for businesses like cintos has does this company have a a business plan that is really a long term plan yes it does and you have to think about the internet and e-commerce the internet's not going anywhere it's only becoming more entrenched in our lives e-commerce is the same way businesses that want to compete and stay relevant today have to have e-commerce and their go-to sources Shopify these are some great no-brainer picks for our viewers to look at thanks for diving in

company do and is their business model something that seems like it's going to hold long term all right the thing about the stocks on this list and I said this in the article they've all got these businesses that are really required by the economy and by Society kind of akin to like a dentist or a mortician everybody's going to have a cavity now and then just about and everybody's going to need to go to the graveyard sooner or later likewise Centos provides uniform servic is for a wide range of businesses these businesses which include a lot of restaurants and other service Industries don't have the time or the capability to wash their towels and wash their uniforms so they really require Centos and their business and Centos is adding value by acquiring ancillary businesses uh one of the more recent ones that happened a few years ago was zedal Z medal provides first aid supplies to the very same businesses that Centos was serving so that acquisition not only provided Cintas um an added growth opportunity but there was a lot of cross- selling opportunities Z clients that weren't using Centos are now using Centos Centos clients that weren't using Z are now using Z good Partnerships always make for good business for sure let's move on to your second stock pick it's one that my children love Casey's uh known for pizza in the Midwest for sure but what about this company makes a no-brainer hold well right it's got a lot of the same qualities as Centos starting with its business model it sells gas and snacks everybody needs gas for their cars and when you get the gas you got to have some snacks today uh Casey is also benefiting from a a downward Shi and consumer habits um it sells some some pretty good values in food and prepared foods and that's been seen in their results but we have a fundamentally strong company it's growing organically and through Acquisitions it's got Fortress balance sheet it's able to self fund its growth cash flow is robust and sustains Capital return which includes dividends and share BuyBacks which is part of the whole investment thesis if you look at the chart it's very similar to Centos the stock pric is up triple digits and trending upward over the very long term any dips in the price action have turned out to be very good buying opportunities gas and snacks aren't going anywhere anytime soon so we're going to need this company for a while but there are a lot of of gas and snack providers out there a lot of competitors what about Casey's business model really sets this stock apart well cases is doing the same thing that cintos has done and is doing and that is consolidating a highly fractured Market there's lots of gas stations but there are very few large gas station chains case's is buying gas stations in critical corridors or critical locations which is fueling its growth and widening its margin that's a solid second no-brainer pick to buy and hold forever but let's go on to your final pick this company may be a little less known than others Shopify I wouldn't put it quite in the same category as Centos and and Casey's it is a must need must have service for small business and even large businesses because it provides a digital footprint it helps them with their e-commerce and with crossb sales um Shopify right now is growing at a high double-digit Pace it's not yet returning Capital but it's Balan she is a fortress so I would expect to see Capital Returns come in time so right now what we're looking at is an outperforming grow story that's got its stock price in a reversal with an expectation for some Capital return to come in time which will be a very great cist for its share price and this stock seems like a little bit a lower point of entry than the other picks that you mentioned right Shopify really got a boost during the pandemic because of the whole e-commerce craze its valuation has come down since then but the real takeaway is that it has continued to outperform consensus even while its price targets were coming down so now it's set up to have a pretty nice rebound and that's being fueled by recent results which show it outperforming and growing and raising Guidance Do you see this company and their business plan really lasting long term much like the gas or the needs for businesses like cintos has does this company have a a business plan that is really a long term plan yes it does and you have to think about the internet and e-commerce the internet's not going anywhere it's only becoming more entrenched in our lives e-commerce is the same way

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,TEBTikXVHoA,MarketBeat,2024-09-05 13:50:58+00:00,Racing to the Skies: Joby Aviation’s Air Taxi Future,"Kind: captions Language: en it may sound like science fiction but air taxis are no longer just an idea competition is already underway to get this industry off the ground here to talk about the air taxi race and a new leader in the program is Market beat analyst jayu Jay we talked last month about Archer Aviation and their plans to start manufacturing more air taxis this year building their own plant and then getting their Air Taxi program off the ground in 2026 but there is another market leader who has a plan to start even sooner than that yes job Aviation uh actually has a first mover Advantage they've been testing their prototype a lot longer uh they've already put in 33,000 miles uh they are in stage four of their five-stage certification process with the FAA they are looking to launch their Air Taxi Network in 2025 they want to start off with New York LA and Dubai that is not far off either that's next year already but I'm sure the certification process is really one of the things still up in the air about whether this program will take off on the timeline they're hoping absolutely the FAA certification is the wild card now they are in stage four right now of the five-stage certification process they're about 37% through uh the FAA is about 14% through uh it's takes both the uh eeve M maker and the FAA they both are uh involved in the process in stage five they're only about 2% through but once they get through the five stage certification then it's on to commercialization now let's talk about what commercialization is actually going to look like for consumers especially it sounds like this program is going to function just like taxis or ride share service in fact Joby is actually partnering with Uber for this project right in 2020 Joby actually acquired Uber Elevate which was uh Uber's own air taxi Division and by bringing on the Uber Elevate team they helped to program its software program called Elevate OS and this uh software uh infrastructure also has a rider app just like the Uber app and a pilot app and the engine will go ahead and match the riders with the pilots with the uh evall uh destination flights and in fact Uber has already integrated it into their uh their app that they've been testing uh where it will basically involve the whole travel sequence so you'll be able to order your Uber ride or a uh air taxi um to the airport you'll be able to actually book your flights or book your Delta flights um as well uh and then once you get to the airport once you land uh you'll once again be able to book your Uber Uber rides uh air taxis um you know or whatever destination you want to go to yeah it sounds like a very familiar process just like the Uber you might use right now the only difference with this Air Taxi program it would be a lot faster for consumers absolutely there uh as 4 prototype can go up to about 200 milph uh it's operated by One Pilot and it can accommodate up to four passengers and their goal is to get your travel time down quite a bit talk about that Jay sure they want to basically shrink maybe a 45 minute car ride down to a 7 minute air taxi ride that would be a big time save for a lot of people especially in those metropolitan areas but I think to make this program successful they really need to have a lot of air taxis available let's move into manufacturing what is Joby doing to get enough of these to start this program successfully so job's been uh partnered with Toyota who also happens to be their largest largest outside shareholder Toyota's already invested about $400 million um they will be providing a lot of the components the power Trin uh and also advising them on their whole manufacturing process joob wants to be a completely vertically integrated manufacturer of EV TOS now their current model that they're manufacturing right now this is the one that's for those shorter commutes you know getting you across New York to JFK Airport in a really quick time frame but talk about the future plans this company has for air taxis maybe going a little bit further than just those you know in City commutes well Electric aircraft EV ts are ideal for uh congested City traffic and uh the suburbs but job is actually looking to go even further than that and provide Regional flights Regional Air taxis uh so they've actually created a first of its kind a hydrogen EV tall uh which is outfitted with um a whole hydrogen fuel system and 40 kg of liquid hydrogen and they put it on a flight and they uh ran it for 523 mies which is a world record um just to prove that it is possible to be able to handle Regional flights uh when you have a hydrogen fuel system um and it's something that they're looking looking to uh to launch down the road so that you can take uh you know a an air taxi actually from um Boston to New York or from New York to Washington DC um Detroit to Nashville this is their long-term plan it's all exciting plans to hear but right now it's still just an idea this program hasn't taken off yet so talk about what that means for investors who might be looking into joby's stock as an investment opportunity what should they expect for this kind of a speculative buy as you call it yes this stock is absolutely speculative you should only be using risk Capital really money you could burn you can burn because this is a pre Revenue company so if you are interested uh you can keep take a look at the Candlestick chart and be aware of the descending triangle pattern which is comprised of lower highs after Joby made its recent swing high at 769 all the bounces have been smaller and smaller and smaller um so that's known as a descending trend line it's a descending upper trend line uh up meeting a flat bottom support it's a horizontal trend line so when you connect those lines it forms what's known as a descending triangle pattern uh Jo has found support pretty much around five area so uh if it breaks down under five then there's potential pullback support areas that are in the article that uh investors can look at to consider taking a position if they know that it is it is a high-risk speculation um they could also consider using an option strategy uh that will basically force them to wait for a pullback um a cash secured put can be used um if you want to limit your the amount of your investment you can always consider taking uh long calls uh for a fraction of the price of the stock um but the strategies are available some great tools for investors as always Jay and a really interesting dive into this speculative stock that I think everyone is excited to to see if they can actually pull it off it'll be a game changer for sure thanks again for this deep dive into Joby Aviation stick with Market be as we continue to follow this stock and many others as

consumers absolutely there uh as 4 prototype can go up to about 200 milph uh it's operated by One Pilot and it can accommodate up to four passengers and their goal is to get your travel time down quite a bit talk about that Jay sure they want to basically shrink maybe a 45 minute car ride down to a 7 minute air taxi ride that would be a big time save for a lot of people especially in those metropolitan areas but I think to make this program successful they really need to have a lot of air taxis available let's move into manufacturing what is Joby doing to get enough of these to start this program successfully so job's been uh partnered with Toyota who also happens to be their largest largest outside shareholder Toyota's already invested about $400 million um they will be providing a lot of the components the power Trin uh and also advising them on their whole manufacturing process joob wants to be a completely vertically integrated manufacturer of EV TOS now their current model that they're manufacturing right now this is the one that's for those shorter commutes you know getting you across New York to JFK Airport in a really quick time frame but talk about the future plans this company has for air taxis maybe going a little bit further than just those you know in City commutes well Electric aircraft EV ts are ideal for uh congested City traffic and uh the suburbs but job is actually looking to go even further than that and provide Regional flights Regional Air taxis uh so they've actually created a first of its kind a hydrogen EV tall uh which is outfitted with um a whole hydrogen fuel system and 40 kg of liquid hydrogen and they put it on a flight and they uh ran it for 523 mies which is a world record um just to prove that it is possible to be able to handle Regional flights uh when you have a hydrogen fuel system um and it's something that they're looking looking to uh to launch down the road so that you can take uh you know a an air taxi actually from um Boston to New York or from New York to Washington DC um Detroit to Nashville this is their long-term plan it's all exciting plans to hear but right now it's still just an idea this program hasn't taken off yet so talk about what that means for investors who might be looking into joby's stock as an investment opportunity what should they expect for this kind of a speculative buy as you call it yes this stock is absolutely speculative you should only be using risk Capital really money you could burn you can burn because this is a pre Revenue company so if you are interested uh you can keep take a look at the Candlestick chart and be aware of the descending triangle pattern which is comprised of lower highs after Joby made its recent swing high at 769 all the bounces have been smaller and smaller and smaller um so that's known as a descending trend line it's a descending upper trend line uh up meeting a flat bottom support it's a horizontal trend line so when you connect those lines it forms what's known as a descending triangle pattern uh Jo has found support pretty much around five area so uh if it breaks down under five then there's potential pullback support areas that are in the article that uh investors can look at to consider taking a position if they know that it is it is a high-risk speculation um they could also consider using an option strategy uh that will basically force them to wait for a pullback um a cash secured put can be used um if you want to limit your the amount of your investment you can always consider taking uh long calls uh for a fraction

this company has for air taxis maybe going a little bit further than just those you know in City commutes well Electric aircraft EV ts are ideal for uh congested City traffic and uh the suburbs but job is actually looking to go even further than that and provide Regional flights Regional Air taxis uh so they've actually created a first of its kind a hydrogen EV tall uh which is outfitted with um a whole hydrogen fuel system and 40 kg of liquid hydrogen and they put it on a flight and they uh ran it for 523 mies which is a world record um just to prove that it is possible to be able to handle Regional flights uh when you have a hydrogen fuel system um and it's something that they're looking looking to uh to launch down the road so that you can take uh you know a an air taxi actually from um Boston to New York or from New York to Washington DC um Detroit to Nashville this is their long-term plan it's all exciting plans to hear but right now it's still just an idea this program hasn't taken off yet so talk about what that means for investors who might be looking into joby's stock as an investment opportunity what should they expect for this kind of a speculative buy as you call it yes this stock is absolutely speculative you should only be using risk Capital really money you could burn you can burn because this is a pre Revenue company so if you are interested uh you can keep take a look at the Candlestick chart and be aware of the descending triangle pattern which is comprised of lower highs after Joby made its recent swing high at 769 all the bounces have been smaller and smaller and smaller um so that's known as a descending trend line it's a descending upper trend line uh up meeting a flat bottom support it's a horizontal trend line so when you connect those lines it forms what's known as a descending triangle pattern uh Jo has found support pretty much around five area so uh if it breaks down under five then there's potential pullback support areas that are in the article that uh investors can look at to consider taking a position if they know that it is it is a high-risk speculation um they could also consider using an option strategy uh that will basically force them to wait for a pullback um a cash secured put can be used um if you want to limit your the amount of your investment you can always consider taking uh long calls uh for a fraction of the price of the stock um but the strategies are available some great tools for investors as always Jay and a really interesting dive into this speculative stock that I think everyone is excited to to see if they can actually pull it off it'll be a game changer for sure thanks again for this deep dive into Joby Aviation stick with Market be as we continue to follow this stock and many others as always happy investing [Music]",Toyota,0.95,0.5

off with a market selloff with most stocks down two to 10% in just a day here to break down what's behind the dip is Market beat analyst Thomas Hughes Thomas I don't think anyone was hoping September or their return from Labor Day weekend would start out quite like this well I don't think anybody wanted it to happen but it's been pretty well telegraphed by the market we've been anticipating um at least a volatile September and right now it looks like it could be a significantly down month and just how down did we see stocks tumble yesterday well the S&amp;P 500 fell 2% so as an average so most S&amp;P 500 companies including the leaders like Nvidia fell much more than 2% let's talk about Nvidia they've had a really rough week since their earnings report which was actually pretty good right the report was great it was what the market wanted but the market was expecting it one thing the market pricing in the peak of AI growth but it's being compounded by sector rotation which is ultimately why the market sold off yesterday so how far has Nvidia Fallen since earnings yeah so Nvidia is down 25 to 30% since the earnings report and it could possibly move lower right now uh Nvidia is still amongst the most crowded trades on the market everybody's been buying that stock for the last two years and with seor rotation and play it's possible that the selloff could continue for many weeks until the last person has been able to get out of their shares let's get to what's behind this selloff why are people selling this strong company and and others too all right so let's back up uh the selloff on Monday is really an extension of the sell off that began in July with the CPI report now the CPI report was cooler than expected it aligned with the idea of the fomc cutting rates and since then the fomc has indicated that rate cuts are very likely they may not cut them this month but they are expected to cut rates before the end of the year which signals a shift in economic policy and fundamental quality for the market and what that means is easing headwinds which is expected to lead to growth in the small cap sector so back to sector rotation people need to sell out of the winners that have been winning for the last two years which includes Nvidia and most of the big AI names in order to prepare to buy small cap stocks so last month when we saw a similar dip there was a huge rise in the fear index what are we seeing right now this week yeah well right now the fear index looks pretty scary the fear index is confirming support at a higher level it made a significant rise along with the market selloff and my character my characterization of the move is that it looks more deliberate than the one before in July it was a run for the Hills and fear and right now what I'm seeing is the market kind of gearing up for a sustained move move higher which could lead to a significant correction in the market um in this environment the S&amp;P 500 could fall seven and a half to 10% easily and up to 20% before it's all said and done those are some scary numbers for investors to be looking at what can you do in an environment like this as an investor to try and protect your Investments but maybe also continue investing and and try to make a profit during this kind of economic time well you want to start with a good Diversified portfolio that includes some Buy and Hold no-brainer stocks uh right now you're going to want to look at fundamental quality and capital returns that include some uh possibly low beta stocks to kind of mitigate some of that downside risk But ultimately what I see happening is another buy the dip opportunity the difference between now and the last few is that this dip could be much larger than what we've seen over the last two years um but I think investors should just stay the course uh build up some Capital Target their favorite Buy and Hold stocks and and buy them when they present opportunities we are just about 10 days away from that Fed rate cut at least the one that's expected will whatever comes out of that announcement really impact the market again or is what we're seeing just a lead up to that decision I think it's just a lead up to the decision um the CPI report suggested that the shift and fomc policy was really a sell the news event the sell off yesterday kind of confirms that idea uh what we're going to want to see the fomc do uh this month is to cut rates more than the market expects which is probably not going to happen because there are still signs of fundamental strength in the market including the labor data uh the labor data has been very resilient gives the fomc really no reason to need to cut rates so with inflation still above their target rate and only falling ever so slowly it's possible they'll hold off for another month and they may not cut rates at all we will have to hold on and see what the market does if that is the case thank you Thomas for diving into this week's Market dip

All right. It is a good example of what we've been expecting for the second wave of AI. [Music] Want to hear your buy picks and I really want to know the why, too. Uh Thomas, let's get to your first buy pick. All right. My buy pick is monday.com. monday.com is a workflow automation platform. Um it's resonating with clients because it's easy to use and it scales well. It's got this plug-and-play quality where you can just kind of pick which segments of it you want to use. You build them together to create your own workflow. So, this past quarter was a beat and raise quarter. Revenue was up 35%. 300 basis points better than expected. That revenue strength was driven on new clients and penetration. Their net retention rate is 110% which means that existing clients are spending 10% more this year than last year with the addition of new clients which will also increase their spending over the next year provides some leverage for growth. Uh margins are widening with that leverage and the efficiency that the company is working towards. Um adjusted operating income was up 130%. That's a real good example of how that leverage can affect your investment quality. um adjusted earnings of 94 cents were 6 6,700 basis points better than expected 67%. That's huge. That's a huge outperformance. Um the company also raised guidance. This has raised guidance again. This is like the third time this year. Momentum is clearly building. Also the balance sheet is a super fortress. It's net cash. Total liability is less than 0.5 the cash position less compared to assets. Shareholder equity is rising. I think it's only a matter of time before capital returns come into play. And then there's the analyst response. All those things are great, but without the analyst, the upside potential is really limited. The analyst response is overwhelmingly bullish. They're leading the stock higher. It's got about 20% upside at consensus. We're going to expect it to go above consensus because of the revision trends. And what I see in the stock price right now is a retest of the all-time highs that may come as soon as this year. And that's a 35% upside at least. And where is the entry point right now if you are just looking at getting into monday.com? So right now, Monday.com stock is trending higher and it moved up to set a new multi-year high on this past this past report. So, not to chase the price higher, but you're going to want to get in probably pretty soon. Wait for any kind of pullback in the action as your entry point and then just start to slowly build a position with time. I would certainly expect to see this stock retest the all-time highs and within the next year or two, you set a new all-time high and then continue this trend um upward. Chris, have you followed monday.com? What do you think of that pick? I haven't followed it quite as closely as Thomas has, but it's a stock that's very intriguing to me. And I think one of the reasons why, and I'll just keep my answer a little bit shorter, Bridget, is just, you know, you're talk when you talk about looking for buy stocks, you're talking about, as the saying goes, you try to skate where the puck is moving. And Monday is certainly right in that sweet spot. You know, remote work is not something that's going away. uh it may not exist in the same form and fashion that it exists today over the next 10 years, but it's not going away. And that's exactly the type of business that monday.com is going to work for very well in terms of you need the tools that to make it easy for teams to collaborate with with each other no matter where they are. Yeah. One of the points that I forgot to hit on is that monday.com is monetizing AI today. All right. It is a good example of what we've been expecting for the second wave of AI where Nvidia and the chip makers are the the leading edge the first wave with infrastructure. Monday is actually using AI and they're monetizing it for themselves and for their clients which is huge because the monetization of services is going to be the largest fastest growing segment of AI which is saying something considering Nvidia's you know rapid rise over the last two years.

eyeses of the market are on Nvidia this week as the earnings came out strong but the stock is still dropping here to talk a little bit more about what's behind all the market movements on Nvidia is Weiss ratings technology editor Michael a Robinson thank you so much for joining us here today to break this stock down a little bit again everyone's talking about it today why is this earnings report such a big deal that's causing kind of that dip in the market everyone's as you just said it yourself I thought really well which is everybody if I have a concern about the stock market right now it has to do with like people who I know don't know that much about investing going ah Nvidia Nvidia it's like oh my God you know if if if my barber ever says buy Nvidia I'm like yeah maybe not right now but no it's this is H this is a stock that owns owns the AI processing space they can't build these things fast enough there's this story going on in Silicon Val that Cisco has these uh gpus coming in from Nvidia like being delivered in an armored car I don't know if it's true or not I just love the story I mean that's that kind of is a sign of the time so it's had an outsize impact on the market so no question everyone's watching it because 30% of the S&amp;P gains in the first six months of this year came uh on Nvidia Nvidia is now a three plus trillion uh a little less than three trillion as of today with a dip but let's just call it a three trillion doll uh market and people I think are putting too much emphasis is on like where AA is going to go based strictly on Nvidia it's not the right way to look at it but you can't control how people look at the world um I've been saying for some time now that if I have a concern about the market at all right now even though we're I'm pretty bullish and the market is really bearing that out it's that there's too much emphasis on one on on a single player and the thing we have to understand with Nvidia is that at some point it cannot continue to grow its earnings like this quarter the most recent quarter reporting uh 152% let's call it 150% growth in EPs and what do you that's like you're growing your you're growing your per share profits every doubling them every six months that's pretty phenomenal but I think what's going on with Wall Street is they like there are these whisper earnings that they really oh 152 I thought you know they didn't project 152 maybe they thought in their brain it was going to be 200 so you're dealing with a lot of expectations game I'll take 152% uh growth in earnings U per share any day of the week exactly it's still a really strong earnings report that would be celebrated just about every other company so the question is will investors will Wall Street ever really be satisfied with any future earnings reports because like you said it's not really sustainable to continue to grow at a rate of almost 300% every quarter uh what will it take for Wall Street to be satisfied with this more steady growth that Nvidia will no doubt continue to have uh that I can't answer uh they that that the Wall Street mentality is one that I don't actually fully understand it's a whole there's a whole weirdness about that stuff uh you know I I I tend to try to come up on my own conclusions but we can't we can't get around the fact that Wall Street has an outside's impact on the market in terms of the ratings and you know they play this game they gave it a new price Target too and you look at the new price Target it's like 3x extra dollars a share or something like that to put out a release like it's a big deal but nevertheless they are looking at AI I don't know that you can fully please Wall Street and I think what might actually happen would be if if earnings kind of earnings growth stays at like 150 or 150% or quarter that's pretty amazing at some point they it's just not going to grow as fast as that but they're I mean they're selling all they can build they're they're they don't have enough capacity to they could sell more if they could build more so that's going to continue for a while they have a lot like I said they own 90% more than 90% of the market in this area they're just killing it so for you it sounds like Nvidia is still a strong buy do you expect this stock to continue to be a leader and and continue to reach new all-time highs in the market well I do think it has the potential to reach alltime uh reach new highs in the market I'd like to see I'd like to see a few more days of trading I don't have enough data right now we're just reacting uh not quite in real time but you know because the earning came out yesterday but it's early in the as you and I are talking today it's still still early in the trading session we haven't gotten to the close yet I was just going to look if you don't mind yeah it's popping around um one thing I think is that's healthy about it today Bridget is the volume is substantially below it's its 50-day moving average so that tells me maybe some people are taking profits but I don't see any Panic selling uh some people may who got in a little bit late maybe they're up only 25 or 30% and they just want to they just want to take those and they're worried but it doesn't look like a particularly terrible just bu they had they've had worse days in the market and bounce back from those I'm just going to look here on my chart there was a day where volume was like 30% higher than average and the stock was down like 6% it's popped back since that time but as of right now when we're talking I don't know how the session will end but as of right now the average uh the number of shares trading hands around 255 million and it has been around 339 million dollars trading hand I'm sorry shares trading hands every day so I like to see a stock Retreat on lower volume that tells me that the U Bears aren't even close to getting control of this stock doesn't mean we won't have a couple of more tough sessions ahead but as of right now the Bears are not moving out with conviction well thank you so much for that analysis Michael I appreciate you again Michael a Robinson with rice ratings joining us here on

week exactly it's still a really strong earnings report that would be celebrated just about every other company so the question is will investors will Wall Street ever really be satisfied with any future earnings reports because like you said it's not really sustainable to continue to grow at a rate of almost 300% every quarter uh what will it take for Wall Street to be satisfied with this more steady growth that Nvidia will no doubt continue to have uh that I can't answer uh they that that the Wall Street mentality is one that I don't actually fully understand it's a whole there's a whole weirdness about that stuff uh you know I I I tend to try to come up on my own conclusions but we can't we can't get around the fact that Wall Street has an outside's impact on the market in terms of the ratings and you know they play this game they gave it a new price Target too and you look at the new price Target it's like 3x extra dollars a share or something like that to put out a release like it's a big deal but nevertheless they are looking at AI I don't know that you can fully please Wall Street and I think what might actually happen would be if if earnings kind of earnings growth stays at like 150 or 150% or quarter that's pretty amazing at some point they it's just not going to grow as fast as that but they're I mean they're selling all they can build they're they're they don't have enough capacity to they could sell more if they could build more so that's going to continue for a while they have a lot like I said they own 90% more than 90% of the market in this area they're just killing it so for you it sounds like Nvidia is still a strong buy do you expect this stock to continue to be a leader and and continue to reach new all-time highs in the market well I do think it has the potential to reach alltime uh reach new highs in the market I'd like to see I'd like to see a few more days of trading I don't have enough data right now we're just reacting uh not quite in real time but you know because the earning came out yesterday but it's early in the as you and I are talking today it's still still early in the trading session we haven't gotten to the close yet I was just going to look if you don't mind yeah it's popping around um one thing I think is that's healthy about it today Bridget is the volume is substantially below it's its 50-day moving average so that tells me maybe some people are taking profits but I don't see any Panic selling uh some people may who got in a little bit late maybe they're up only 25 or 30% and they just want to they just want to take those and they're worried but it doesn't look like a particularly terrible just bu they had they've had worse days in the market and bounce back from those I'm just going to look here on my chart there was a day where volume was like 30% higher than average and the stock was down like 6% it's popped back since that time but as of right now when we're talking I don't know how the session will end but as of right now the average uh the number of shares trading hands around 255 million and it has been around 339 million dollars trading hand I'm sorry shares trading hands every day so I like to see a stock Retreat on lower volume that tells me that the U Bears aren't even close to getting control of this stock doesn't mean we won't have a couple of more tough sessions ahead but as of right now the Bears are not moving out with conviction well thank you so much for that analysis Michael I appreciate you again Michael a Robinson with rice ratings joining us here on

eyeses of the market are on Nvidia this week as the earnings came out strong but the stock is still dropping here to talk a little bit more about what's behind all the market movements on Nvidia is Weiss ratings technology editor Michael a Robinson thank you so much for joining us here today to break this stock down a little bit again everyone's talking about it today why is this earnings report such a big deal that's causing kind of that dip in the market everyone's as you just said it yourself I thought really well which is everybody if I have a concern about the stock market right now it has to do with like people who I know don't know that much about investing going ah Nvidia Nvidia it's like oh my God you know if if if my barber ever says buy Nvidia I'm like yeah maybe not right now but no it's this is H this is a stock that owns owns the AI processing space they can't build these things fast enough there's this story going on in Silicon Val that Cisco has these uh gpus coming in from Nvidia like being delivered in an armored car I don't know if it's true or not I just love the story I mean that's that kind of is a sign of the time so it's had an outsize impact on the market so no question everyone's watching it because 30% of the S&amp;P gains in the first six months of this year came uh on Nvidia Nvidia is now a three plus trillion uh a little less than three trillion as of today with a dip but let's just call it a three trillion doll uh market and people I think are putting too much emphasis is on like where AA is going to go based strictly on Nvidia it's not the right way to look at it but you can't control how people look at the world um I've been saying for some time now that if I have a concern about the market at all right now even though we're I'm pretty bullish and the market is really bearing that out it's that there's too much emphasis on one on on a single player and the thing we have to understand with Nvidia is that at some point it cannot continue to grow its earnings like this quarter the most recent quarter reporting uh 152% let's call it 150% growth in EPs and what do you that's like you're growing your you're growing your per share profits every doubling them every six months that's pretty phenomenal but I think what's going on with Wall Street is they like there are these whisper earnings that they really oh 152 I thought you know they didn't project 152 maybe they thought in their brain it was going to be 200 so you're dealing with a lot of expectations game I'll take 152% uh growth in earnings U per share any day of the

world was watching for nvidia's earnings report and today the world is reacting here to break down the market movement after nvidia's earning report is Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys there has been a lot of movement on Nvidia Thomas break down what the market is doing this morning well the initial reaction was to move lower I think at the low of the post session move yesterday it was down about 10% when I was going to bed I think what I saw was down about 7% right now it's down about 32% but this is a a negative move considering how strong that report was yeah and it's not just Nvidia that's doing a lot of movement this morning it's kind of the whole industry right Chris right uh there was some news that came across uh I don't know if it was I it was probably like right around the time the market closed last night uh super micro is delaying the release of their 10K um there's a report that's coming out that there are some potential accounting Red Flags uh you never like to hear that it's kind of Weighing on the broader chip SL technology Market I noticed there was a broader Tech sell-off going on last night that wasn't just Nvidia Nvidia was just one of the ones that was the most obvious of that an obvious decline in a lot of volatility but it's coming at a time when Nvidia really had a stellar earnings report 122% growth year-over-year Thomas why is that growth not transl in to a runup in the stock right now well because with the trends and the forecast and the revision Trend and the expectations the report was really nothing but what the market wanted and the market is a front running forward-looking machine what we're seeing right now is a peak in Market sentiment which is going to be a pretty substantial headwind for the the price of the stock I think over the next month or two now last night in our video reacting to just the earnings report Chris you mentioned that they had a home run but the market was really expecting a grand slam and I do think that that's the case last earnings report Nvidia saw over 260% growth and even though 122% growth is still impressive it's not you know what they had last quarter right and so um the the fundamental argument against Nvidia is fundamentals it's the valuation people are just saying the stock is just unreasonably overvalued one of the uh principles I guess that's being used to justify that is something called The Law of large numbers uh this is a statistical concept that's based on probabilities and such this is a table that shows the last several years of nvidia's earnings reports and this is where we were last night the 30.4 billion 30.4 billion in Revenue that they generated in the last quarter and that compares as you can see very favorably 122% higher than the 13 .51 billion that they generated in the same quarter in the previous year now look at all of these numbers down here and those are significantly lower than that and now look at next quarter where it was 18.12 billion what would Nvidia have to hit to generate even 122% growth above and beyond that and I think that's where the so the law of large numbers is basically saying Nvidia is going to eventually they're going to regress to a mean now that mean is not necessarily going to be down at those six and seven billion dollar numbers that they once were but what they're saying is it's unrealistic to expect Nvidia to continue growing at the rate they're growing even at the 122% and so therefore it doesn't justify the price to earnings that they currently have or the price to sales that they have Bridget you and I were talking right before we came on I said it's like a batting average in baseball if you have a player who's never hit 350 before hitting 350 for an extended period of time eventually people are going to say well no eventually they're going to start hitting back to whatever their statistical average was that's what's going on here with Nvidia is people are just saying it's not necessarily that the stock had that the company had a bad report it's just that statistically it's almost impossible for them to keep doing what they're doing right like the run up in stock price over the last two years is because the earnings were growing they were outperform forming in a way that was above the market expectation and continued to accelerate this goes along with what I was saying with the peak in Market sentiment nvidia's business hasn't stopped growing but the market has stopped expecting it to grow at a wicked out pace and what we're looking forward to now is the industry normalization eventually all of these new data centers will be built out and all the orders to replace the old chips will have have been made in that scenario what will happen to Nvidia is that its business will normalize and the question is at what level will it normalize it's going to come back from the Peaks that it is now how far will it fall back and where will it stabilize investors still have to remember that Nvidia has 85% market share their profit margins are still over 70% and no there's no competitor that's immediately positioned to take over the premium Market that they have so even if companies are looking to Pivot away from Nvidia they're still going to be likely to pay the premium price for nvidia's premium products let's Shi to the earnings call that happened there was some pretty big news about Blackwell in that report yeah they announced that they shipped out the first of the sample models and they're planning to start ramping production in Q4 they didn't really say specifically when or how much production will ramp uh and there is still some concern about delays now this concern is showing up in in in the price action for stocks like Dell and super micro which rely on those chips to build out their servers so there is some concern that there will be some server buildout delay that could impact the construction of new data centers and the build out of AI infrastructure over the next year that will certainly impact the outlook for all of these stocks including Nvidia so all of that considered and all this growth on the horizon what will it take for investors to be impressed with nvidia's growth in the future if 122% growth isn't enough to to satisfy what can Nvidia do to satisfy the what the market would like to see I mean right now what it looks like is they'll need to make another revolutionary advance in technology to to reignite a new Revolution in technology uh because right now what's happened is that Revolution is underway and what we've seen over the last two years is just the ramp in the expectations and now what we're seeing is those expectations are kind of topping out and that's going to impact the price action I think earlier Chris mentioned the valuation of the stock NOW Nvidia is not exactly comparable to names like apple and Amazon and Microsoft because it's still younger has not quite matured the way that they have but looking forward its 2026 price multiple is about 33 or 34 times earnings which puts it right in alignment with the valuation for Blue Chip tech stocks today which means that all of its growth is probably priced in it will need to come up with something new in order to reinvigorate Market sentiment so unless they have another major Tech announcement coming I think we can expect what Chris had said which is that a little bit more normalized growth as they evolve as a company uh so is this a company that you want to get into if they're reaching that Peak and point in their lifespan investors kind of have to look at this like don't fight the trend and in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report we don't know what that trend is going to be I still tend to think that it's going to it's going to rise above where it closed yesterday um but right now the trend still seems to be that investors want to move it higher that's what analysts are saying so I I don't think I would fight that Trend right now it doesn't mean that the the Bears have a bad argument it's just that the trend isn't going in their Direction right now um as far as what this means for the broader Market I think there are other issues that are going on uh certainly the the FED potentially cutting rates next month and what that might mean for sector rotation that are to affect the market much more than nvidia's results right now though in terms of if I were an investor yes I would be looking to buy any dip in Nvidia I don't think I would be chasing it too much higher but I'd be looking to buy on dips right the analysts are responding favorably they're raising their price targets I do expect to see Nvidia move above 150 over the next 12 months but as Chris says there's lots of macroeconomic headwinds September's typically A bad month for for stocks and Chip stocks in particular and was slowing growth and growth priced into the market there's a lot of reasons to believe that Nvidia stock price will experience volatility if not a significant dip between now and the next new high yeah uh Thomas your article has exactly that headline Bu The Dip but expect the

and point in their lifespan investors kind of have to look at this like don't fight the trend and in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report we don't know what that trend is going to be I still tend to think that it's going to it's going to rise above where it closed yesterday um but right now the trend still seems to be that investors want to move it higher that's what analysts are saying so I I don't think I would fight that Trend right now it doesn't mean that the the Bears have a bad argument it's just that the trend isn't going in their Direction right now um as far as what this means for the broader Market I think there are other issues that are going on uh certainly the the FED potentially cutting rates next month and what that might mean for sector rotation that are to affect the market much more than nvidia's results right now though in terms of if I were an investor yes I would be looking to buy any dip in Nvidia I don't think I would be chasing it too much higher but I'd be looking to buy on dips right the analysts are responding favorably they're raising their price targets I do expect to see Nvidia move above 150 over the next 12 months but as Chris says there's lots of macroeconomic headwinds September's typically A bad month for for stocks and Chip stocks in particular and was slowing growth and growth priced into the market there's a lot of reasons to believe that Nvidia stock price will experience volatility if not a significant dip between now and the next new high yeah uh Thomas your article has exactly that headline Bu The Dip but expect the

world was watching for nvidia's earnings report and today the world is reacting here to break down the market movement after nvidia's earning report is Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys there has been a lot of movement on Nvidia Thomas break down what the market is doing this morning well the initial reaction was to move lower I think at the low of the post session move yesterday it was down about 10% when I was going to bed I think what I saw was down about 7% right now it's down about 32% but this is a a negative move considering how strong that report was yeah and it's not just Nvidia that's doing a lot of movement this morning it's kind of the whole industry right Chris right uh there was some news that came across uh I don't know if it was I it was probably like right around the time the market closed last night uh super micro is delaying the release of their 10K um there's a report that's coming out that there are some potential accounting Red Flags uh you never like to hear that it's kind of Weighing on the broader chip SL technology Market I noticed there was a broader Tech sell-off going on last night that wasn't just Nvidia Nvidia was just one of the ones that was the most obvious of that an obvious decline in a lot of volatility but it's coming at a time when Nvidia really had a stellar earnings report 122% growth year-over-year Thomas why is that growth not transl in to a runup in the stock right now well because with the trends and the forecast and the revision Trend and the expectations the report was really nothing but what the market wanted and the market is a front running forward-looking machine what we're seeing right now is a peak in Market sentiment which is going to be a pretty substantial headwind for the the price of the stock I think over the next month or two now last night in our video reacting to just the earnings report Chris you mentioned that they had a home run but the market was really expecting a grand slam and I do think that that's the case last earnings report Nvidia saw over 260% growth and even though 122% growth is still impressive it's not you know what they had last quarter right and so um the the fundamental argument against Nvidia is fundamentals it's the valuation people are just saying the stock is just unreasonably overvalued one of the uh principles I guess that's being used to justify that is something called The Law of large numbers uh this is a statistical concept that's based on probabilities and such this is a table that shows the last several years of nvidia's earnings reports and this is where we were last night the 30.4 billion 30.4 billion in Revenue that they generated in the last quarter and that compares as you can see very favorably 122% higher than the 13 .51 billion that they generated in the same quarter in the previous year now look at all of these numbers down here and those are significantly lower than that and now look at next quarter where it was 18.12 billion what would Nvidia have to hit to generate even 122% growth above and beyond that and I think that's where the so the law of large numbers is basically saying Nvidia is going to eventually they're going to regress to a mean now that mean is not necessarily going to be down at those six and seven billion dollar numbers that they once were but what they're saying is it's unrealistic to expect Nvidia to continue growing at the rate they're growing even at the 122% and so therefore it doesn't justify the price to earnings that they currently have or the price to sales that they have Bridget you and I were talking right before we came on I said it's like a batting average in baseball if you have a player who's never hit 350 before hitting 350 for an extended period of time eventually people are going to say well no eventually they're going to start hitting back to whatever their statistical average was that's what's going on here with Nvidia is people are just saying it's not necessarily that the stock had that the company had a bad report it's just that statistically it's almost impossible for them to keep doing what they're doing right like the run up in stock price over the last two years is because the earnings were growing they were outperform forming in a way that was above the market expectation and continued to accelerate this goes along with what I was saying with the peak in Market sentiment nvidia's business hasn't stopped growing but the market has stopped expecting it to grow at a wicked out pace and what we're looking forward to now is the industry normalization eventually all of these new data centers will be built out and all the orders to replace the old chips will have have been made in that scenario what will happen to Nvidia is that its business will normalize and the question is at what level will it normalize it's going to come back from the Peaks that it is now how far will it fall back and where will it stabilize investors still have to remember that Nvidia has 85% market share their profit margins are still over 70% and no there's no competitor that's immediately positioned to take over the premium Market that they have so even if companies are looking to Pivot away from Nvidia they're still going to be likely to pay the premium price for nvidia's premium products let's Shi to the earnings call that happened there was some pretty big news about Blackwell in that report yeah they announced that they shipped out the first of the sample models and they're planning to start ramping production in Q4 they didn't really say specifically when or how much production will ramp uh and there is still some concern about delays now this concern is showing up in in in the price action for stocks like Dell and super micro which rely on those chips to build out their servers so there is some concern that there will be some server buildout delay that could impact the construction of new data centers and the build out of AI infrastructure over the next year that will certainly impact the outlook for all of these stocks including Nvidia so all of that considered and all this growth on the horizon what will it take for investors to be impressed with nvidia's growth in the future if 122% growth isn't enough to to satisfy what can Nvidia do to satisfy the what the market would like to see I mean right now what it looks like is they'll need to make another revolutionary advance in technology to to reignite a new Revolution in technology uh because right now what's happened is that Revolution is underway and what we've seen over the last two years is just the ramp in the expectations and now what we're seeing is those expectations are kind of topping out and that's going to impact the price action I think earlier Chris mentioned the valuation of the stock NOW Nvidia is not exactly comparable to names like apple and Amazon and Microsoft because it's still younger has not quite matured the way that they have but looking forward its 2026 price multiple is about 33 or 34 times earnings which puts it right in alignment with the valuation for Blue Chip tech stocks today which means that all of its growth is probably priced in it will need to come up with something new in order to reinvigorate Market sentiment so unless they have another major Tech announcement coming I think we can expect what Chris had said which is that a little bit more normalized growth as they evolve as a company uh so is this a company that you want to get into if they're reaching that Peak

stabilize investors still have to remember that Nvidia has 85% market share their profit margins are still over 70% and no there's no competitor that's immediately positioned to take over the premium Market that they have so even if companies are looking to Pivot away from Nvidia they're still going to be likely to pay the premium price for nvidia's premium products let's Shi to the earnings call that happened there was some pretty big news about Blackwell in that report yeah they announced that they shipped out the first of the sample models and they're planning to start ramping production in Q4 they didn't really say specifically when or how much production will ramp uh and there is still some concern about delays now this concern is showing up in in in the price action for stocks like Dell and super micro which rely on those chips to build out their servers so there is some concern that there will be some server buildout delay that could impact the construction of new data centers and the build out of AI infrastructure over the next year that will certainly impact the outlook for all of these stocks including Nvidia so all of that considered and all this growth on the horizon what will it take for investors to be impressed with nvidia's growth in the future if 122% growth isn't enough to to satisfy what can Nvidia do to satisfy the what the market would like to see I mean right now what it looks like is they'll need to make another revolutionary advance in technology to to reignite a new Revolution in technology uh because right now what's happened is that Revolution is underway and what we've seen over the last two years is just the ramp in the expectations and now what we're seeing is those expectations are kind of topping out and that's going to impact the price action I think earlier Chris mentioned the valuation of the stock NOW Nvidia is not exactly comparable to names like apple and Amazon and Microsoft because it's still younger has not quite matured the way that they have but looking forward its 2026 price multiple is about 33 or 34 times earnings which puts it right in alignment with the valuation for Blue Chip tech stocks today which means that all of its growth is probably priced in it will need to come up with something new in order to reinvigorate Market sentiment so unless they have another major Tech announcement coming I think we can expect what Chris had said which is that a little bit more normalized growth as they evolve as a company uh so is this a company that you want to get into if they're reaching that Peak and point in their lifespan investors kind of have to look at this like don't fight the trend and in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report we don't know what that trend is going to be I still tend to think that it's going to it's going to rise above where it closed yesterday um but right now the trend still seems to be that investors want to move it higher that's what analysts are saying so I I don't think I would fight that Trend right now it doesn't mean that the the Bears have a bad argument it's just that the trend isn't going in their Direction right now um as far as what this means for the broader Market I think there are other issues that are going on uh certainly the the FED potentially cutting rates next month and what that might mean for sector rotation that are to affect the market much more than nvidia's results right now though in terms of if I were an investor yes I would be looking to buy any dip in Nvidia I don't think I would be chasing it too much higher but I'd be looking to buy on dips right the analysts are responding favorably they're raising their price targets I do expect to see Nvidia move above 150 over the next 12 months but as Chris says there's lots of macroeconomic headwinds September's typically A bad month for for stocks and Chip stocks in particular and was slowing growth and growth priced into the market there's a lot of reasons to believe that Nvidia stock price will experience volatility if not a significant dip between now and the next new high yeah uh Thomas your article has exactly that headline Bu The Dip but expect the

world was watching for nvidia's earnings report and today the world is reacting here to break down the market movement after nvidia's earning report is Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys there has been a lot of movement on Nvidia Thomas break down what the market is doing this morning well the initial reaction was to move lower I think at the low of the post session move yesterday it was down about 10% when I was going to bed I think what I saw was down about 7% right now it's down about 32% but this is a a negative move considering how strong that report was yeah and it's not just Nvidia that's doing a lot of movement this morning it's kind of the whole industry right Chris right uh there was some news that came across uh I don't know if it was I it was probably like right around the time the market closed last night uh super micro is delaying the release of their 10K um there's a report that's coming out that there are some potential accounting Red Flags uh you never like to hear that it's kind of Weighing on the broader chip SL technology Market I noticed there was a broader Tech sell-off going on last night that wasn't just Nvidia Nvidia was just one of the ones that was the most obvious of that an obvious decline in a lot of volatility but it's coming at a time when Nvidia really had a stellar earnings report 122% growth year-over-year Thomas why is that growth not transl in to a runup in the stock right now well because with the trends and the forecast and the revision Trend and the expectations the report was really nothing but what the market wanted and the market is a front running forward-looking machine what we're seeing right now is a peak in Market sentiment which is going to be a pretty substantial headwind for the the price of the stock I think over the next month or two now last night in our video reacting to just the earnings report Chris you mentioned that they had a home run but the market was really expecting a grand slam and I do think that that's the case last earnings report Nvidia saw over 260% growth and even though 122% growth is still impressive it's not you know what they had last quarter right and so um the the fundamental argument against Nvidia is fundamentals it's the valuation people are just saying the stock is just unreasonably overvalued one of the uh principles I guess that's being used to justify that is something called The Law of large numbers uh this is a statistical concept that's based on probabilities and such this is a table that shows the last several years of nvidia's earnings reports and this is where we were last night the 30.4 billion 30.4 billion in Revenue that they generated in the last quarter and that compares as you can see very favorably 122% higher than the 13 .51 billion that they generated in the same quarter in the previous year now look at all of these numbers down here and those are significantly lower than that and now look at next quarter where it was 18.12 billion what would Nvidia have to hit to generate even 122% growth above and beyond that and I think that's where the so the law of large numbers is basically saying Nvidia is going to eventually they're going to regress to a mean now that mean is not necessarily going to be down at those six and seven billion dollar numbers that they once were but what they're saying is it's unrealistic to expect Nvidia to continue growing at the rate they're growing even at the 122% and so therefore it doesn't justify the price to earnings that they currently have or the price to sales that they have Bridget you and I were talking right before we came on I said it's like a batting average in baseball if you have a player who's never hit 350 before hitting 350 for an extended period of time eventually people are going to say well no eventually they're going to start hitting back to whatever their statistical average was that's what's going on here with Nvidia is people are just saying it's not necessarily that the stock had that the company had a bad report it's just that statistically it's almost impossible for them to keep doing what they're doing right like the run up in stock price over the last two years is because the earnings were growing they were outperform forming in a way that was above the market expectation and continued to accelerate this goes along with what I was saying with the peak in Market sentiment nvidia's business hasn't stopped growing but the market has stopped expecting it to grow at a wicked out pace and what we're looking forward to now is the industry normalization eventually all of these new data centers will be built out and all the orders to replace the old chips will have have been made in that scenario what will happen to Nvidia is that its business will normalize and the question is at what level will it normalize it's going to come back from the Peaks that it is now how far will it fall back and where will it stabilize investors still have to remember that Nvidia has 85% market share their profit margins are still over 70% and no there's no competitor that's immediately positioned to take over the premium Market that they have so even if companies are looking to Pivot away from Nvidia they're still going to be likely to pay the premium price for nvidia's premium products let's Shi to the earnings call

Here's What's Ahead For The Stock,Kind: captions Language: en they've got some some big catalysts I think in the works that are going to help with results in the near term and set it up for some big leverage gains in the long term which stock are you looking to hold well I'm going to be holding Disney I'm holding Disney the stock price is down obviously it's been struggling for the last couple years but we're looking at a CEO that turnaround uh the return of Iger was huge news for this business that's been gaining traction ever since he got back on board uh they brought back the capital return turn that was a huge move um right now the parks are struggling but they're still growing entertainment is growing and streaming is turning profitable which is really the big story this year we're kind of in wait and SE mode to see how the next couple of quarters unfold because consumers are under pressure and there's certainly some pressure on the company's ability to grow and to profit but uh they've got some some big catalysts I think in the works that are going to help with results in the near term and set it up for some big leverage gains in the long term now among those uh The Wolverine and Deadpool movie did very very well so that's certainly going to show up in the next quarter's results um they've been opening a lot of new attractions and Parks send it around Avatar and Indiana Jones and some of the other hotter franchises that should help sustain activity if not growth in the Parks until the consumer rebound takes traction again and then there are also some new films in the work they've got Avatar and The Incredibles and Moana which are all going to be driving results for this company later on in the year now interest rates are supposed to fall soon and that will be a Tailwind I think for the business it may be a year or more before that impact starts to show up in Disney's results but again with prices where they are right now they're kind of at Rock Bottom we have Capital returns back in play I think it's a good stock to hold if you've been to Disney recently especially one of the theme parks it looks like they're doing quite well those lines are never short I do want to hear your opinion on that Chris do you have a different take on Disney well I price fund a little bit Bridget because Bri Disney was the stock that I put as my cell and I think that's where we're going next but I'll I'll just say I'm a little bit more bearish than Thomas's I I was excited or I should say I was optimistic about the return of Bob Iger as the CEO I even thought that maybe the earnings report we saw a couple of quarters ago was a signed that the company was turning the corner they may still be but right now I'm just I'm struggling to figure out what the company's long-term strategy really seems to be right now it just feels like a lot of it is they're relying on Iger and the idea of we're Disney and we've done it before and we'll do it again and I'm hearing a lot of things like well we think this is going to happen we hope this is going to happen the company struggling to get all the parts of the business firing on all cylinders and I think the theme park is a really good place to start profits right now are being used to help get that streaming business up to a level of profitability but there is concern and the company stated it in their last earnings report that demand for the theme parks is starting to show some cracks revenue from the division was only up about 2% and that was at about 8.3 billion and the operating income fell to about 2.2 billion this income that they drive from the park is about 53% of Disney's total revenue and Disney management reported that the next few quarters would be challenging for that division so I don't know it the stock sound slightly for the year it's trading down near fiveyear lows I understand that generally speaking that means that the stock doesn't have anywhere to go but up but it's more than likely that the company's going to figure it out but right now it looks like there's just a lot of faith trust and pixie dust going on and it's just a pass for me so Thomas why do you think Disney has a chance to come back this is the House of Mouse I mean they're struggling right now because there are some consumer pressures even with that warning they still reiterated their guidance they're still looking for growth it's going to be tepid you know so I think in a couple of quarters we'll start to see the company begin gaining Traction in all of its segments at once which will really help leverage its growth in its earnings we'll see if they can bring back that Disney Magic [Music],Disney,1.0,-0.4

moment the world has been waiting for NVIDIA earnings report is in and the results are pretty good here to break it all down for us are our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys let's get to it right away Thomas what are these results looking like right now well I would say from the initial glance that it was everything that market was hoping for and a little bit more I mean they grew by 122% year-over-year that outpaced the consensus by 1,000 basis points gross margin widened by 500 basis points operating income is up 175% EPS is up almost 170% it outperformed as well the guidance is strong calling for another quarter of 100% growth I think that's about 2500 basis points better than expected within all of this the cash flow is robust the cash on the balance sheet nearly doubled and they did a surprise $7.2 billion share by back which is going to be highly supportive of the stock over time because now we're going to expect that to happen from on a quarter to quarter basis they've got the cash flow they should be able to continue repurchasing shares and paying dividends at this same Pace yeah tellas that's exactly what you said Nvidia needed to do is really outperform everyone's expectations and it looks like they have in a pretty big way let's talk about Revenue first Chris it looks really impressive yeah I mean they everybody was looking to see if Nvidia was was going to not only beat but if they were going to beat by a large margin and they did um $30 billion in Revenue like Thomas said that's 122% higher than higher year-over-year earnings came in even better because at 67 cents per share they were estimated to come in at on on the market beat site we're saying the consensus estimate was 59 cents a share and year-over-year last year in the same quarter they were at 27 cents this year so they're just crushing it that way they were predicting um margins I see at 70 % uh they're projecting for the full year so they're not going to slow down as far as earnings growth goes and I also noticed that they're talking now that blackwall ship chips are going to ship in the fourth quarter so investors can look forward to that in the next quarter yeah right I would say that the results really are strong all the way through yeah all segments produce growth now obviously the computer and or the Computing and network segment did the best that's where the data center uh segment is data center is up 154% but even Automotive is up 37% and OEM is up 33% they've got double digit gains in the graphic section uh so yeah this is just a strong report all the way around I think everyone's breathing a little sigh of relief because this is what they were looking for but what happened at the or the end of the close today why did nvidia's stock drop right before this Stellar report came out well even saying that the results are all that the market wanted them more the market was kind of wanting that it was expecting that because that is the trend so this is turning into a little bit of a sell the news event but the question is are people selling the news because it's time to get out of the stock which I think is probably not the right thing to do but it's probably just this little near-term knee-jerk reaction to okay it wasn't like so mind-bendingly good right we're going to sell off a little bit the market will regroup a little bit but then I believe the rally will continue High I would be very surprised if this thing doesn't uh pop much higher in the pre-market tomorrow I think this is a this is a great place and then the highspeed algorithms are going to come in in the morning and clean up whatever dip this is I think they're going to eat that right up this is this this report was too good to ignore I mean this was like Thomas said this was everything the market was expecting and that may not have been enough to satisfy some investors but there's absolutely no reason for people to be selling Nvidia right now right some of this postmarket dip could be because Traders are waiting for the conference call the conference call will have lots of more details and insight than what the the initial release is going to give and SO waiting for that probably a good idea too right yeah we'll break that all down here on Market beat as well after that earnings call tomorrow um but what do we expect the market to do over the next few weeks I think we talked about we expected some kind of volatility with this earnings report just because everyone is watching it but with a solid report like this can they satisfy people enough to help lift the whole Market I think that Nvidia stock will be well supported there may be some volatility over the next month just because it is the end of the summer we're going into September um if you think about you know this idea of sell in May and go away September is when people come back and that's when they start getting back into the market so we may see some profit taking and some repositioning September is typically a bad month for stocks in general but especially so for the chip sector all that aside the underlying fundamentals with with Nvidia are more than robust so this stock really should continue to move higher once we get past what could be a little bit of volatility I think like Thomas said I think investors are waiting to hear what Jensen Wong has to say on the conference call I think one of the things that they want to hear is they want to hear the words come out of his mouth that demand for AI is strong because there's been some sentiment coming into this report that maybe companies were going to start um slowing down on their AI spend as as the economy might be getting weaker but I'm not sure that that is supported by nvidia's results but I think investors still want to hear the words they want to hear AI spending is strong and they expect that to be strong for their customers right also when the in the um the conference call we'll probably hear some more news at about deals and Partnerships the company has been making New Deals and Partnerships I mean seems like on a week- toe basis for the last two years soon it's going to have a deal with every important major company on the market today and just further cement its position as uh Central to the AI infrastructure y well thank you both for breaking down the earnings

up them and did 11. 1% year-over-year comp sales growth and then Cava came in and blew them away with 14.4% year-over-year comp comparable restaurant sales grow so they knocked it right out of the

they've seen a lot of success but what about kava's you know business plan really helps to set this restaurant apart and maybe lends to some of the success they're seeing well you know the thing about

their talent meaning that they hire from inside and they have this thing called The Academy GM program where basically they will go ahead and train their top employees to eventually become uh GMS general managers and by harnessing this talent pool from within it keeps employees uh loyal and happy and upbeat because once you graduate that program you Cava wants to Source 75% of their General Managers from this program and as you graduate or you get out of there um and you continue to have this upward Mobility they want to eventually get uh get you a garden which is a cluster of eight Cava restaurants on top of that last year they bumped up their wages 8% and beefed up their health care uh all that basically sets the tone for the employees like I said they're like the most upbeat happy uh fast casual employees that I've ever come to engage with it's always nice to eat somewhere where the workers are just as happy as you are to be there um let's talk about there's a lot of opportunities for those Cava employees to also grow because there's so many new stores coming on they have a lot of locations right now right well actually cabba is actually early in its growth stage they only have 341 restaurants uh compare that to Chipotle which has over 3,47 70 restaurants so there's a lot of upside as far as the growth story is concerned uh which also leads me to you know when when people say that oh Travis stock price is so expensive don't forget Chipotle St was Trad in the 3500s before they split 50 to1 um and at that point they had 3,300 restaurants same thing with uh you know Caba it's very early in the story so uh they're going to continue to grow their restaurants um as far as their uh uh internal metrics this 14.4% year-over-year comp sales growth is it's top of the industry at this point it's they're outd doing Chipotle that's impressive alone uh now let's talk about what this all means for investors and you see all this potential growth for this Restaurant Group if you're an investor looking to get in what advice do you have Jay well obviously you shouldn't really be chasing stocks you should wait for some pullbacks and I know uh stock expensive just because it did bounce 23% in the past two days um but there's always opportunity there there's always going to be pullbacks cabba had formed a what's known as a bull flag breakout uh when it broke through 79 then it gapped up to the 110 area and then proceeded to go higher from there um eventually kava will pull back I think if you can get a pull back back to that 110 Gap fill

of all this volatility many investors are wondering what to buy what to sell and what to hold on to well our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes are here to break it all down for us guys I'm excited to hear what your top picks are for stocks that you're looking to buy sell and hold right now we're going to get to your picks in just a minute but first I want to go over a little bit of kind of what you guys look at as analysts for how you decide what to rate a stock whether it's a buy sell or hold well I look at a a combination of factors I want to see the company growing I like to see it outperforming expectations I like to find some value in there somewhere whether it be versus other companies or versus its own history versus the analyst expectations I want to see firm analyst support really with uptrending sentiment and uptrending price targets and then if there's good free cash flow and capital returns that's just icing on the kick so Chris what kind of research are you doing before you make your decision on whether a stock is a buy sell or hold are you looking at other analysts opinions are you looking into the company what does that process look like for you yeah I do tend to look at some analysts opinions but um generally I try to do my own research and my own thinking about the company I try to look at where their earnings have been in the past where their earnings are likely to go in the future I tend to be more of a long-term investor in my own personal portfolio so I'm not as concerned about what the stock might be doing in terms of technical movements at any one given moment in time but I'm looking at fundamental drivers for the business like Thomas said I'm looking for where's the growth going to come from how soon is it going to get here and is it growth that's going to be sustainable over the long term both of you have done a lot of that research right now and have picked out your top buy sell and hold stocks in the market right now we're going to get to those picks in just one moment but first here's a look at a tool you can use to see what analysts are saying about any stock want to keep your finger on the pulse of the market text the word YouTube to 68 285 that's 68 285 and get free breaking news alerts from Market beat for the stocks that matter most to you don't miss out on crucial updates stay informed and stay ahead well like most people I am most interested in hearing what your buy pick is right now but let's save the best for last I think let's start with which company you are looking to hold right now and why uh Chris let's start with you sure uh for my pick on stocks to hold I'm choosing McDonald's um stocks up about 9% since it reported earnings in July and the report wasn't that good same store sales were down for the first time since 2020 and you'd have to go back a lot further than 20120 to find the last time that did it before then so this wasn't a great report and the stocks up 9% kind of feels to to me like most of the growth has been priced in I like McDonald's I like the company it pays an attractive and a growing dividend that I don't see being in any danger there's been a lot of talk about issues about demand and pricing and I don't think any of those issues are issues that a healthier economy and a healthier consumer won't fix it was investing in digital well before 2020 and that's paying off today all of that being said and going back to the rubric that you asked us to talk about at the beginning of how do we determine whether a Stock's a buy sell and a hold I think the next few quarters are going to be challenging for the company in terms of stock price growth it's trading at about 23 times forward earnings it was around 21 times forward earnings before the runup the analyst forecasts on Market beat are a little bit more bullish about McDonald's than I am they have it as a moderate buy but the 9% runup on a challenging earnings report ends me to think that most of the growth at least in the short term is already priced into the stock Thomas where do you sit on McDonald's are you a McDonald's fan and especially a fan of what the company is doing right now oh well according to McDonald's internal data I'm a super heavy user I I do like McDonald's um I'm probably part of why the stock price keeps going up but right now uh the earnings report was a bit of a concern we don't want to see this company Contracting we certainly don't want to see a negative comp but what I think the results really show is the Diversified nature of the business because us was weak Latin America was banging Latin America is crushing it for a lot of different companies so I would definitely look in that direction for some Investments but as far as McDonald's goes it's on the cusp of pivoting back to growth very soon the forecasts for next year are very bullish the analysts have trimmed their targets since the last report but they're still looking at about 10 to 15% upside which puts the market back at the all-time high um any kind of good news will push it to a new all-time high and I think that could come with the fomc Thomas let's move on to your hold pick which stock are you looking to hold well I'm going to be holding Disney I'm holding Disney the stock price is down obviously it's been struggling for the last couple years but we're looking at a CEO that turnaround uh the return of Iger was huge news for this business that's been gaining traction ever since he got back on board uh they brought back the capital return that was a huge move um right now the parks are struggling but they're still growing entertainment is growing streaming is turning profitable which is really the big story this year we're kind of in wait and C mode to see how the next couple of quarters unfold because consumers are under pressure and there's certainly some pressure on the company's ability to grow and to profit but uh they've got some some big catalysts I think in the works that are going to help with results in the near- term and set it up for some big leverage gains in the long term now among those uh The Wolverine and Deadpool movie did very very well so that's certainly going to show up in the next quarter's results um they've been opening a lot of new attractions and Parks s it around Avatar and Indiana Jones and some of the other hotter franchises that should help sustain activity if not growth in the Parks until the consumer rebound takes traction again and then there are also some new films in the work they've got Avatar and The Incredibles and Moana which are all going to be driving results for this company later on in the year now interest rates are supposed to fall soon and that will be a Tailwind I think for the business it may be a year or more before that impact starts to show up in Disney's results but again with prices where they are right now they're kind of at Rock Bottom we have Capital returns back in play I think it's a good stock to hold if you've been to Disney recently especially one of the theme parks it looks like they're doing quite well those lines are never short I do want to hear your opinion on that Chris do you have a different take on Disney well I probably steal your funder a little bit Bridget because Bri Disney was the stock that I put as my cell and I think that's where we're going next but I'll I'll just say I'm a little bit more bearish than Thomas is I I was excited or I should say I was optimistic about the return of Bob Iger as the CEO I even thought that maybe the earnings report we saw a couple of quarters ago was a signed that the company was turning the corner they may still be but right now I'm just I'm struggling to figure out what the company's long-term strategy really seems to be right now it just feels like a lot of it is they're relying on Iger and the idea of we're Disney and we've done it before and we'll do it again and I'm hearing a lot of things like well we think this is going to happen we hope this is going to happen the company's struggling to get all the parts of the business firing on all cylinders and I think the theme park is a really good place to start profits right now are being used to help get that streaming business up to a level of profitability but there is concern and the company stated it in their last earnings report that demand for the theme parks is starting to show some cracks revenue from the division was only up about 2% and that was at about 8.3 billion and the operating income fell to about 2.2 billion this income that they drive from the park is about 53% of Disney's total revenue and Disney management reported that the next few quarters would be challenging for that division so I don't know it the stock's down slightly for the year it's trading down near fiveyear lows I understand that generally speaking that means that the stock doesn't have anywhere to go but up but it's more than likely that the company's going to figure it out but right now it looks like there's just a lot of faith trust and pixie dust going on and it's just a pass for me so Thomas why do you think Disney has a chance to come back this is the House of Mouse I mean they're struggling right now because there are some consumer pressures even with that warning they still reiterated their guidance they're still looking for growth it's going to be tepid you know so I think in a couple quarters we'll start to see the company begin gaining Traction in all of its segments at once which will really help leverage its growth in its earnings we'll see if they can bring back that Disney magic all right well Thomas let's get to your sell pick now which stock are you looking at selling right now well this might be one that Chris won't agree with but I'm looking to sell Tesla all right it's still the leading evem it makes profits the balance sheet is healthy but the core business is Contracting the still deep in the price Wars margins are Contracting earnings are suffering the valuation is still very high I personally am a fan of Elon Musk but the Elon Musk factor is pricey it's expensive to buy the stock and right now the market is waiting and hoping for the next phase of growth that may come soon but I don't really expect to see any good news out of the EV segment without a groundbreaking development anytime soon because demand is just so poor and the price Wars are having a big impact on the revenue also they're spending more trying to invest in that next phase of growth it will likely pay off but again we're looking at two or three quarters probably before we start seeing it able to generate money from those advances if even then there's still no consensus among the analysts the analyst sentiment is very mixed there's a very wide range of sentiment targets from sell to buy and the price targets are equally wide so even if the stock doesn't move lower from here and stay lower I expect to see significant volatility and not much upward Trend in the in the action Chris do you think Tesla is a sell right now too you know I find it hard to to say it's a sell and I think there's I'll admit there's the Elon Musk Factor there for me he's been counted out so many times and he tends to come back from the dead all these times I think in the short term it's hard for me to get behind Tesla stock in the long term I think a lot of the growth that investors are counting on is going to come from autonomous driving and Tesla is Leaps and Bounds ahead of other companies in terms of getting that to Market but there's still a big if attached to that can they get that done it's a stock that's just it's always going to be very noisy it's always going to be very polarizing um I I can't say I disagree with Thomas asell but I would say to me it's probably one that you want to hold on to just in case right fear of never know all right well let's move on to the the moment we've all been waiting for we want to hear your byy picks and I really want to know the why too uh Thomas let's get to your first buy pick all right my by pick is monday.com monday.com is a workflow automation platform um it's resonating with clients because it's easy to use and it scales well it's got this plug-and playay quality where you can just kind of pick which segments of it you want to use you build them together to create your own workflow so this past quarter was a beaten raise quarter Revenue was up 35% 300 basis points better than expected that uh Revenue strength was driven on new clients in penetration their net retention rate is 110% which means that existing clients are spending 10% more this year than last year with the addition of new clients which will also increase their spending over the next year provides some leverage for growth uh margins are widening with that leverage and the efficiency that the company is working towards um adjusted operating income was up 130% that's a real good example of how that leverage can affect your investment quality um adjusted earnings at 94 cents were 6 6,700 basis points better than expected 67% that's huge that's a huge outperformance um the company also raised guidance this has raised guidance again this is like the third time this year momentum is clearly building also the balance sheet is a super Fortress it's net cash total liability is less than 0.5 to cash position less compared to assets shareholder Equity is rising I think it's only a matter of time before Capital Returns come into play and then there's the analyst response all those things are great but without the analyst the upside potential is really limited the analyst response is overwhelmingly bullish they're leading the stock higher it's got about 20% upside at consensus we're going to expect it to go above consensus because of the revision Trends and what I see in the stock price right now is a retest of all-time highs that may come as soon as this year and that's a 35% upside at least now where is the entry point right now if you are just looking at getting into monday.com so right now monday.com stock is trending higher and it moved up to set a new multi-year high on this past this past report so not to chase the price higher but you're going to want to get in probably pretty soon wait for any kind of pullback in the action as you're entry point and then just start to slowly build a position with time I would certainly expect to see this stock retest the all-time highs and within the next year or two to set a new all-time high and then continue this trend um upward Chris have you followed monday.com what do you think of that pick I haven't followed it quite as closely as Thomas has but it's a stock that's very intriguing to me and I think one of the reasons why and I'll just keep my answer a little bit shorter Bridget is just you know you're talk when you talk about looking for buy stocks you're talking about as the saying goes you try to skate where the puck is moving and Monday is certainly right in that sweet spot you know remote work is not something that's going away uh it may not exist in the same form and fashion that it exists today over the next 10 years but it's not going away and that's exactly the type of business that monday.com is going to work for very well in terms of you need the tools that to make it easy for teams to collaborate with with each other no matter where they are yeah one of the point that I forgot to hit on is that monday.com is monetizing AI today all right it is a good example of what we've been expecting for the second wave of AI where Nvidia and the chipmakers are the the Leading Edge the first wave with infrastructure Monday is actually using Ai and they're monetizing it for themselves and for their clients which is huge because the monetization of services is going to be the largest fastest growing segment of AI which is saying something considering nvidia's you know rapid rise over the last two years well thanks for your pick Thomas now Chris I'm excited to hear which stock you have for us as your top buy pick right now well I'm going to stay consistent with what I've been saying for the last several weeks Bridget my pick is Palante here uh Thomas actually gave me a nice place to jump off in terms of the monetization of AI because one of the things that paler really does well is it's helping other companies monetize Ai and in the process they're becoming the go-to provider for um not just the company's own proprietary llm but there are other platforms such as Foundry and Gotham that are allowing companies to actually make AI give them useful insights and that's you'll hear that from the CEO Alex karp a lot is the fact that paler is about making AI useful for other companies uh stock cracked the $30 Mark uh after it reported earnings in early August it's up about 81% year-to date it's got a high price earnings ratio there are all kinds of reasons to believe the stock is over revalued it seems like every week the company just keeps announcing new Partnerships New Deals it just suggests that there's a lot more growth coming for this company and not only are other companies starting to get wind of this but it seems like the analyst Community is starting to align as well on Market B the ensus is still reduced for palente here but the price targets have gone up so you know a year ago the price targets were still around $10 then they went up to around $516 now they're up around 21 $23 so analysts are grudgingly coming along with the stock we talked about this a couple of weeks ago on the channel there is the possibility that paler is going to get included into the s&amp;p500 this time around if so we'll find out about that in early September that would be another Catalyst for the stock because as we said at that point many institutions would have no choice but to include paler as part of their ETF and that's just going to drive the stock price higher and Thomas what do you think about trying to get into banteer right now yeah I'm on board with paner I think they've got a great growth trajectory I think they're doing a great job um implementing their services and growing their business um they certainly make money I do have some concerns with the valuation I think right now with the current out Outlook uh the valuation has pretty much priced in the next few years of growth so I'm really going to want to see um some strong outperformance and some accelerated momentum with with New Deals and with uh new clients as these new clients come on Chris how high do you think paler can go in its stock price especially well if we're talking about in the next in the next 12 months we we were um we were talking about this a little while ago the most bullish estimate I think is force the stock to get up somewhere around 38 in the next 12 months I'm not quite that bullish on it I think 33 34 is a really good uh is a good price Target in that time frame for some investors they if they're not in paler right now that may not excite them too much uh we're talking about 10% gain they can probably find that in other stocks but again I'm looking at this and saying if I'm looking at paler as a long-term hold where where might the stock be in five years in 10 years and I just think that right now it's okay to go ahead and buy at $30 if you believe that in five or 10 years it might be at $45 $50 or even higher well thank you both for the good

of all this volatility many investors are wondering what to buy what to sell and what to hold on to well our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes are here to break it all down for us guys I'm excited to hear what your top picks are for stocks that you're looking to buy sell and hold right now we're going to get to your picks in just a minute but first I want to go over a little bit of kind of what you guys look at as analysts for how you decide what to rate a stock whether it's a buy sell or hold well I look at a a combination of factors I want to see the company growing I like to see it outperforming expectations I like to find some value in there somewhere whether it be versus other companies or versus its own history versus the analyst expectations I want to see firm analyst support really with uptrending sentiment and uptrending price targets and then if there's good free cash flow and capital returns that's just icing on the kick so Chris what kind of research are you doing before you make your decision on whether a stock is a buy sell or hold are you looking at other analysts opinions are you looking into the company what does that process look like for you yeah I do tend to look at some analysts opinions but um generally I try to do my own research and my own thinking about the company I try to look at where their earnings have been in the past where their earnings are likely to go in the future I tend to be more of a long-term investor in my own personal portfolio so I'm not as concerned about what the stock might be doing in terms of technical movements at any one given moment in time but I'm looking at fundamental drivers for the business like Thomas said I'm looking for where's the growth going to come from how soon is it going to get here and is it growth that's going to be sustainable over the long term both of you have done a lot of that research right now and have picked out your top buy sell and hold stocks in the market right now we're going to get to those picks in just one moment but first here's a look at a tool you can use to see what analysts are saying about any stock want to keep your finger on the

informed and stay ahead well like most people I am most interested in hearing what your buy pick is right now but let's save the best for last I think let's start with which company you are looking to hold right now and why uh Chris let's start with you sure uh for my pick on stocks to hold I'm choosing McDonald's um stocks up about 9% since it reported earnings in July and the report wasn't that good same store sales were down for the first time since 2020 and you'd have to go back a lot further than 20120 to find the last time that did it before then so this wasn't a great report and the stocks up 9% kind of feels to to me like most of the growth has been priced in I like McDonald's I like the company it pays an attractive and a growing dividend that I don't see being in any danger there's been a lot of talk about issues about demand and pricing and I don't think any of those issues are issues that a healthier economy and a healthier consumer won't fix it was investing in digital well before 2020 and that's paying off today all of that being said and going back to the rubric that you asked us to talk about at the beginning of how do we determine whether a Stock's a buy sell and a hold I think the next few quarters are going to be challenging for the company in terms of stock price growth it's trading at about 23 times forward earnings it was around 21 times forward earnings before the runup the analyst forecasts on Market beat are a little bit more bullish about McDonald's than I am they have it as a moderate buy but the 9% runup on a challenging earnings report

earnings report was a bit of a concern we don't want to see this company Contracting we certainly don't want to see a negative comp but what I think the results really show is the Diversified nature of the business because us was weak Latin America was banging Latin America is crushing it for a lot of different companies so I would definitely look in that direction for some Investments but as far as McDonald's goes it's on the cusp of pivoting back to growth very soon the forecasts for next year are very bullish the analysts have trimmed their targets since the last report but they're still looking at about 10 to 15% upside which puts the market back at the all-time high um any kind of good news will push it to a new all-time high and I think that could come with the fomc Thomas let's move on to your hold pick which stock are you looking to hold well I'm going to be holding Disney I'm holding Disney the stock price is down obviously it's been struggling for the last couple years but we're looking at a CEO that turnaround uh the return of Iger was huge news for this business that's been gaining traction ever since he got back on board uh they brought back the capital return that was a huge move um right now the parks are struggling but they're still growing entertainment is growing streaming is turning profitable which is really the big story this year we're kind of in

Deadpool movie did very very well so that's certainly going to show up in the next quarter's results um they've been opening a lot of new attractions and Parks s it around Avatar and Indiana Jones and

move on to the the moment we've all been waiting for we want to hear your byy picks and I really want to know the why too uh Thomas let's get to your first buy pick all right my by pick is monday.com monday.com is a workflow automation platform um it's resonating with clients because it's easy to use and it scales well it's got this plug-and playay quality where you can just kind of pick which segments of it you want to use you build them together to create your own workflow so this past quarter was a beaten raise quarter Revenue was up 35% 300 basis points better than expected that uh Revenue strength was driven on new clients in penetration their net retention rate is 110% which means that existing clients are spending 10% more this year than last year with the addition of new

um adjusted operating income was up 130% that's a real good example of how that leverage can affect your investment quality um adjusted earnings at 94 cents were 6 6,700 basis points better than expected 67% that's huge that's a huge outperformance um the company also raised guidance this has raised guidance again this is like the third time this year momentum is clearly building also the balance sheet is a super Fortress it's net cash total liability is less than 0.5 to cash position less compared to assets shareholder Equity is rising I think it's only a matter of time before Capital Returns come into play and then there's the analyst response all those things are great but without the analyst the upside potential is really limited the analyst response is overwhelmingly bullish

the next in the next 12 months we we were um we were talking about this a little while ago the most bullish estimate I think is force the stock to get up somewhere around 38 in the next 12 months I'm not quite that bullish on it I think 33 34 is a really good uh is a good price Target in that time frame for some investors they if they're not in paler right now that may not excite them too much uh we're talking about 10% gain they can probably find that in other stocks but again I'm looking at this and saying if I'm looking at paler as a long-term hold where where might the stock be in five years in 10 years and I just think that right now it's okay to go ahead and buy at $30 if you believe that in five or 10 years it might be at $45 $50 or even higher well thank you both for the good

of all this volatility many investors are wondering what to buy what to sell and what to hold on to well our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes are here to break it all down for us guys I'm excited to hear what your top picks are for stocks that you're looking to buy sell and hold right now we're going to get to your picks in just a minute but first I want to go over a little bit of kind of what you guys look at as analysts for how you decide what to rate a stock whether it's a buy sell or hold well I look at a a combination of factors I want to see the company growing I like to see it outperforming expectations I like to find some value in there somewhere whether it be versus other companies or versus its own history versus the analyst expectations I want to see firm analyst support really with uptrending sentiment and uptrending price targets and then if there's good free cash flow and capital returns that's just icing on the kick so Chris what kind of research are you doing before you make your decision on whether a stock is a buy sell or hold are you looking at other analysts opinions are you looking into the company what does that process look like for you yeah I do tend to look at some analysts opinions but um generally I try to do my own research and my own thinking about the company I try to look at where their earnings have been in the past where their earnings are likely to go in the future I tend to be more of a long-term investor in my own personal portfolio so I'm not as concerned about what the stock might be doing in terms of technical movements at any one given moment in time but I'm looking at fundamental drivers for the business like Thomas said I'm looking for where's the growth going to come from how soon is it going to get here and is it growth that's going to be sustainable over the long term both of you have done a lot of that research right now and have picked out your top buy sell and hold stocks in the market right now we're going to get to those picks in just one moment but first here's a look at a tool you can use to see what analysts are saying about any stock want to keep your finger on the pulse of the market text the word YouTube to 68 285 that's 68 285 and get free breaking news alerts from Market beat for the stocks that matter most to you don't miss out on crucial updates stay informed and stay ahead well like most people I am most interested in hearing what your buy pick is right now but let's save the best for last I think let's start with which company you are looking to hold right now and why uh Chris let's start with you sure uh for my pick on stocks to hold I'm choosing McDonald's um stocks up about 9% since it reported earnings in July and the report wasn't that good same store sales were down for the first time since 2020 and you'd have to go back a lot further than 20120 to find the last time that did it before then so this wasn't a great report and the stocks up 9% kind of feels to to me like most of the growth has been priced in I like McDonald's I like the company it pays an attractive and a growing dividend that I don't see being in any danger there's been a lot of talk about issues about demand and pricing and I don't think any of those issues are issues that a healthier economy and a healthier consumer won't fix it was investing in digital well before 2020 and that's paying off today all of that being said and going back to the rubric that you asked us to talk about at the beginning of how do we determine whether a Stock's a buy sell and a hold I think the next few quarters are going to be challenging for the company in terms of stock price growth it's trading at about 23 times forward earnings it was around 21 times forward earnings before the runup the analyst forecasts on Market beat are a little bit more bullish about McDonald's than I am they have it as a moderate buy but the 9% runup on a challenging earnings report ends me to think that most of the growth at least in the short term is already priced into the stock Thomas where do you sit on McDonald's are you a McDonald's fan and especially a fan of what the company is doing right now oh well according to McDonald's internal data I'm a super heavy user I I do like McDonald's um I'm probably part of why the stock price keeps going up but right now uh the earnings report was a bit of a concern we don't want to see this company Contracting we certainly don't want to see a negative comp but what I think the results really show is the Diversified nature of the business because us was weak Latin America was banging Latin America is crushing it for a lot of different companies so I would definitely look in that direction for some Investments but as far as McDonald's goes it's on the cusp of pivoting back to growth very soon the forecasts for next year are very bullish the analysts have trimmed their targets since the last report but they're still looking at about 10 to 15% upside which puts the market back at the all-time high um any kind of good news will push it to a new all-time high and I think that could come with the fomc Thomas let's move on to your hold pick which stock are you looking to hold well I'm going to be holding Disney I'm holding Disney the stock price is down obviously it's been struggling for the last couple years but we're looking at a CEO that turnaround uh the return of Iger was huge news for this business that's been gaining traction ever since he got back on board uh they brought back the capital return that was a huge move um right now the parks are struggling but they're still growing entertainment is growing streaming is turning profitable which is really the big story this year we're kind of in wait and C mode to see how the next couple of quarters unfold because consumers are under pressure and there's certainly some pressure on the company's ability to grow and to profit but uh they've got some some big catalysts I think in the works that are going to help with results in the near- term and set it up for some big leverage gains in the long term now among those uh The Wolverine and Deadpool movie did very very well so that's certainly going to show up in the next quarter's results um they've been opening a lot of new attractions and Parks s it around Avatar and Indiana Jones and some of the other hotter franchises that should help sustain activity if not growth in the Parks until the consumer rebound takes traction again and then there are also some new films in the work they've got Avatar and The Incredibles and Moana which are all going to be driving results for this company later on in the year now interest rates are supposed to fall soon and that will be a Tailwind I think for the business it may be a year or more before that impact starts to show up in Disney's results but again with prices where they are right now they're kind of at Rock Bottom we have Capital returns back in play I think it's a good stock to hold if you've been to Disney recently especially one of the theme parks it looks like they're doing quite well those lines are never short I do want to hear your opinion on that Chris do you have a different take on Disney well I probably steal your funder a little bit Bridget because Bri Disney was the stock that I put as my cell and I think that's where we're going next but I'll I'll just say I'm a little bit more bearish than Thomas is I I was excited or I should say I was optimistic about the return of Bob Iger as the CEO I even thought that maybe the earnings report we saw a couple of quarters ago was a signed that the company was turning the corner they may still be but right now I'm just I'm struggling to figure out what the company's long-term strategy really seems to be right now it just feels like a lot of it is they're relying on Iger and the idea of we're Disney and we've done it before and we'll do it again and I'm hearing a lot of things like well we think this is going to happen we hope this is going to happen the company's struggling to get all the parts of the business firing on all cylinders and I think the theme park is a really good place to start profits right now are being used to help get that streaming business up to a level of profitability but there is concern and the company stated it in their last earnings report that demand for the theme parks is starting to show some cracks revenue from the division was only up about 2% and that was at about 8.3 billion and the operating income fell to about 2.2 billion this income that they drive from the park is about 53% of Disney's total revenue and Disney management reported that the next few quarters would be challenging for that division so I don't know it the stock's down slightly for the year it's trading down near fiveyear lows I understand that generally speaking that means that the stock doesn't have anywhere to go but up but it's more than likely that the company's going to figure it out but right now it looks like there's just a lot of faith trust and pixie dust going on and it's just a pass for me so Thomas why do you think Disney has a chance to come back this is the House of Mouse I mean they're struggling right now because there are some consumer pressures even with that warning they still reiterated their guidance they're still looking for growth it's going to be tepid you know so I think in a couple quarters we'll start to see the company begin gaining Traction in all of its segments at once which will really help leverage its growth in its earnings we'll see if they can bring back that Disney magic all right well Thomas let's get to your sell pick now which stock are you looking at selling right now well this might be one that Chris won't agree with but I'm looking to sell Tesla all right it's still the leading evem it makes profits the balance sheet is healthy but the core business is Contracting the still deep in the price Wars margins are Contracting earnings are suffering the valuation is still very high I personally am a fan of Elon Musk but the Elon Musk factor is pricey it's expensive to buy the stock and right now the market is waiting and hoping for the next phase of growth that may come soon but I don't really expect to see any good news out of the EV segment without a groundbreaking development anytime soon because demand is just so poor and the price Wars are having a big impact on the revenue also they're spending more trying to invest in that next phase of growth it will likely pay off but again we're looking at two or three quarters probably before we start seeing it able to generate money from those advances if even then there's still no consensus among the analysts the analyst sentiment is very mixed there's a very wide range of sentiment targets from sell to buy and the price targets are equally wide so even if the stock doesn't move lower from here and stay lower I expect to see significant volatility and not much upward Trend in the in the action Chris do you think Tesla is a sell right now too you know I find it hard to to say it's a sell and I think there's I'll admit there's the Elon Musk Factor there for me he's been counted out so many times and he tends to come back from the dead all these times I think in the short term it's hard for me to get behind Tesla stock in the long term I think a lot of the growth that investors are counting on is going to come from autonomous driving and Tesla is Leaps and Bounds ahead of other companies in terms of getting that to Market but there's still a big if attached to that can they get that done it's a stock that's just it's always going to be very noisy it's always going to be very polarizing um I I can't say I disagree with Thomas asell but I would say to me it's probably one that you want to hold on to just in case right fear of never know all right well let's move on to the the moment we've all been waiting for we want to hear your byy picks and I really want to know the why too uh Thomas let's get to your first buy pick all right my by pick is monday.com monday.com is a workflow automation platform um it's resonating with clients because it's easy to use and it scales well it's got this plug-and playay quality where you can just kind of pick which segments of it you want to use you build them together to create your own workflow so this past quarter was a beaten raise quarter Revenue was up 35% 300 basis points better than expected that uh Revenue strength was driven on new clients in penetration their net retention rate is 110% which means that existing clients are spending 10% more this year than last year with the addition of new clients which will also increase their spending over the next year provides some leverage for growth uh margins are widening with that leverage and the efficiency that the company is working towards um adjusted operating income was up 130% that's a real good example of how that leverage can affect your investment quality um adjusted earnings at 94 cents were 6 6,700 basis points better than expected 67% that's huge that's a huge outperformance um the company also raised guidance this has raised guidance again this is like the third time this year momentum is clearly building also the balance sheet is a super Fortress it's net cash total liability is less than 0.5 to cash position less compared to assets shareholder Equity is rising I think it's only a matter of time before Capital Returns come into play and then there's the analyst response all those things are great but without the analyst the upside potential is really limited the analyst response is overwhelmingly bullish they're leading the stock higher it's got about 20% upside at consensus we're going to expect it to go above consensus because of the revision Trends and what I see in the stock price right now is a retest of all-time highs that may come as soon as this year and that's a 35% upside at least now where is the entry point right now if you are just looking at getting into monday.com so right now monday.com stock is trending higher and it moved up to set a new multi-year high on this past this past report so not to chase the price higher but you're going to want to get in probably pretty soon wait for any kind of pullback in the action as you're entry point and then just start to slowly build a position with time I would certainly expect to see this stock retest the all-time highs and within the next year or two to set a new all-time high and then continue this trend um upward Chris have you followed monday.com what do you think of that pick I haven't followed it quite as closely as Thomas has but it's a stock that's very intriguing to me and I think one of the reasons why and I'll just keep my answer a little bit shorter Bridget is just you know you're talk when you talk about looking for buy stocks you're talking about as the saying goes you try to skate where the puck is moving and Monday is certainly right in that sweet spot you know remote work is not something that's going away uh it may not exist in the same form and fashion that it exists today over the next 10 years but it's not going away and that's exactly the type of business that monday.com is going to work for very well in terms of you need the tools that to make it easy for teams to collaborate with with each other no matter where they are yeah one of the point that I forgot to hit on is that monday.com is monetizing AI today all right it is a good example of what we've been expecting for the second wave of AI where Nvidia and the chipmakers are the the Leading Edge the first wave with infrastructure Monday is actually using Ai and they're monetizing it for themselves and for their clients which is huge because the monetization of services is going to be the largest fastest growing segment of AI which is saying something considering nvidia's you know rapid rise over the last two years well thanks for your pick Thomas now Chris I'm excited to hear which stock you have for us as your top buy pick right now well I'm going to stay consistent with what I've been saying for the last several weeks Bridget my pick is Palante here uh Thomas actually gave me a nice place to jump off in terms of the monetization of AI because one of the things that paler really does well is it's helping other companies monetize Ai and in the process they're becoming the go-to provider for um not just the company's own proprietary llm but there are other platforms such as Foundry and Gotham that are allowing companies to actually make AI give them useful insights and that's you'll hear that from the CEO Alex karp a lot is the fact that paler is about making AI useful for other companies uh stock cracked the $30 Mark uh after it reported earnings in early August it's up about 81% year-to date it's got a high price earnings ratio there are all kinds of reasons to believe the stock is over revalued it seems like every week the company just keeps announcing new Partnerships New Deals it just suggests that there's a lot more growth coming for this company and not only are other companies starting to get wind of this but it seems like the analyst Community is starting to align as well on Market B the ensus is still reduced for palente here but the price targets have gone up so you know a year ago the price targets were still around $10 then they went up to around $516 now they're up around 21 $23 so analysts are grudgingly coming along with the stock we talked about this a couple of weeks ago on the channel there is the possibility that paler is going to get included into the s&amp;p500 this time around if so we'll find out about that in early September that would be another Catalyst for the stock because as we said at that point many institutions would have no choice but to include paler as part of their ETF and that's just going to drive the stock price higher and Thomas what do you think about trying to get into banteer right now yeah I'm on board with paner I think they've got a great growth trajectory I think they're doing a great job um implementing their services and growing their business um they certainly make money I do have some concerns with the valuation I think right now with the current out Outlook uh the valuation has pretty much priced in the next few years of growth so I'm really going to want to see um some strong outperformance and some accelerated momentum with with New Deals and with uh new clients as these new clients come on Chris how high do you think paler can go in its stock price especially well if we're talking about in the next in the next 12 months we we were um we were talking about this a little while ago the most bullish estimate I think is force the stock to get up somewhere around 38 in the next 12 months I'm not quite that bullish on it I think 33 34 is a really good uh is a good price Target in that time frame for some investors they if they're not in paler right now that may not excite them too much uh we're talking about 10% gain they can probably find that in other stocks but again I'm looking at this and saying if I'm looking at paler as a long-term hold where where might the stock be in five years in 10 years and I just think that right now it's okay to go ahead and buy at $30 if you believe that in five or 10 years it might be at $45 $50 or even higher well thank you both for the good

move on to the the moment we've all been waiting for we want to hear your byy picks and I really want to know the why too uh Thomas let's get to your first buy pick all right my by pick is monday.com monday.com is a workflow automation platform um it's resonating with clients because it's easy to use and it scales well it's got this plug-and playay quality where you can just kind of pick which segments of it you want to use you build them together to create your own workflow so this past quarter was a beaten raise quarter Revenue was up 35% 300 basis points better than expected that uh

expected 67% that's huge that's a huge outperformance um the company also raised guidance this has raised guidance again this is like the third time this year momentum is clearly building also the balance sheet is a super Fortress it's net cash total liability is less than 0.5 to cash position less compared to assets shareholder Equity is rising I think it's only a matter of time before Capital Returns come into play and then there's the analyst response all those things are great but without the analyst the upside potential is really limited the analyst response is overwhelmingly bullish they're leading the stock higher it's got about 20% upside at consensus we're going to expect it to go above consensus because of the revision Trends and what I see in the stock price right now is a retest of all-time highs that may come as soon as this year and that's a 35% upside at least now where is the entry point right now if you are just looking at getting into monday.com so right now monday.com stock is trending higher and it moved up to set a new multi-year high on this past this past report so not to chase the price higher but you're going to want to get in probably pretty soon wait for any kind of pullback in the action as you're entry point and then just start to slowly build a position with time I would certainly expect to see this stock retest the all-time highs and within the next year or two to set a new all-time high and then continue this trend um upward Chris have you followed monday.com what do you think of that pick I haven't followed it quite as closely as Thomas has but it's a stock that's very intriguing to me and I think one of the reasons why and I'll just keep my answer a little bit shorter Bridget is just you know you're talk when you talk about looking for buy stocks you're talking about as the saying goes you try to skate where the puck is moving and Monday is certainly right in that sweet spot you know remote work is not something that's going away uh it may not exist in the same form and fashion that it exists today over the next 10 years but it's not going away and that's exactly the type of business that monday.com is going to work for very well in terms of you need the tools that to make it easy for teams to collaborate with with each other no matter where they are yeah one of the point that I forgot to hit on is that monday.com is monetizing AI today all right it is a good example of what we've been expecting for the second wave of AI where Nvidia and the chipmakers are the the Leading Edge the first wave with infrastructure Monday is actually using Ai and they're monetizing it for themselves and for their clients which is huge because the monetization of services is going to be the largest fastest growing segment of AI which is saying something considering nvidia's you know rapid rise over the last two years well thanks for your pick Thomas now Chris I'm excited to hear which stock you have for us as your top buy pick right now well I'm going to stay consistent with what I've been saying for the last several weeks Bridget my pick is Palante here uh Thomas actually gave me a nice place to jump off in terms of the monetization of AI because one of the things that paler really does well is it's helping other companies monetize Ai and in the process they're becoming the go-to provider for um not just the company's own proprietary llm but there are other platforms such as Foundry and Gotham that are allowing companies to actually make AI give them useful insights and that's you'll hear that from the CEO Alex karp a lot is the fact that paler is about making AI useful for other companies uh stock cracked the $30 Mark uh after it reported earnings in early August it's up about 81% year-to date it's got a high price earnings ratio there are all kinds of reasons to believe the stock is over revalued it seems like every week the company just keeps announcing new Partnerships New Deals it just suggests that there's a lot more growth coming for this company and not only are other companies starting to get wind of this but it seems like the analyst Community is starting to align as well on Market B the ensus is still reduced for palente here but the price targets have gone up so you know a year ago the price targets were still around $10 then they went up to around $516 now they're up around 21 $23 so analysts are grudgingly coming along with the stock we talked about this a couple of weeks ago on the channel there is the possibility that paler is going to get included into the s&amp;p500 this time around if so we'll find out about that in early September that would be another Catalyst for the stock because as we said at that point many institutions would have no choice but to include paler as part of their ETF and that's just going to drive the stock price higher and Thomas what do you think about trying to get into banteer right now yeah I'm on board with paner I think they've got a great growth trajectory I think they're doing a great job um implementing their services and growing their business um they certainly make money I do have some concerns with the valuation I think right now with the current out Outlook uh the valuation has pretty much priced in the next few years of growth so I'm really going to want to see um some strong outperformance and some accelerated momentum with with New Deals and with uh new clients as these new clients come on Chris how high do you think paler can go in its stock price especially well if we're talking about in the next in the next 12 months we we were um we were talking about this a little while ago the most bullish estimate I think is force the stock to get up somewhere around 38 in the next 12 months I'm not quite that bullish on it I think 33 34 is a really good uh is a good price Target in that time frame for some investors they if they're not in paler right now that may not excite them too much uh we're talking about 10% gain they can probably find that in other stocks but again I'm looking at this and saying if I'm looking at paler as a long-term hold where where might the stock be in five years in 10 years and I just think that right now it's okay to go ahead and buy at $30 if you believe that in five or 10 years it might be at $45 $50 or even higher well thank you both for the good

of all this volatility many investors are wondering what to buy what to sell and what to hold on to well our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes are here to break it all down for us guys I'm excited to hear what your top picks are for stocks that you're looking to buy sell and hold right now we're going to get to your picks in just a minute but first I want to go over a little bit of kind of what you guys look at as analysts for how you decide what to rate a stock whether it's a buy sell or hold well I look at a a combination of factors I want to see the company growing I like to see it outperforming expectations I like to find some value in there somewhere whether it be versus other companies or versus its own history versus the analyst expectations I want to see firm analyst support really with uptrending sentiment and uptrending price targets and then if there's good free cash flow and capital returns that's just icing on the kick so Chris what kind of research are you doing before you make your decision on whether a stock is a buy sell or hold are you looking at other analysts opinions are you looking into the company what does that process look like for you yeah I do tend to look at some analysts opinions but um generally I try to do my own research and my own thinking about the company I try to look at where their earnings have been in the past where their earnings are likely to go in the future I tend to be more of a long-term investor in my own personal portfolio so I'm not as concerned about what the stock might be doing in terms of technical movements at any one given moment in time but I'm looking at fundamental drivers for the business like Thomas said I'm looking for where's the growth going to come from how soon is it going to get here and is it growth that's going to be sustainable over the long term both of you have done a lot of that research right now and have picked out your top buy sell and hold stocks in the market right now we're going to get to those picks in just one moment but first here's a look at a tool you can use to see what analysts are saying about any stock want to keep your finger on the pulse of the market text the word YouTube to 68 285 that's 68 285 and get free breaking news alerts from Market beat for the stocks that matter most to you don't miss out on crucial updates stay informed and stay ahead well like most people I am most interested in hearing what your buy pick is right now but let's save the best for last I think let's start with which company you are looking to hold right now and why uh Chris let's start with you sure uh for my pick on stocks to hold I'm choosing McDonald's um stocks up about 9% since it reported earnings in July and the report wasn't that good same store sales were down for the first time since 2020 and you'd have to go back a lot further than 20120 to find the last time that did it before then so this wasn't a great report and the stocks up 9% kind of feels to to me like most of the growth has been priced in I like McDonald's I like the company it pays an attractive and a growing dividend that I don't see being in any danger there's been a lot of talk about issues about demand and pricing and I don't think any of those issues are issues that a healthier economy and a healthier consumer won't fix it was investing in digital well before 2020 and that's paying off today all of that being said and going back to the rubric that you asked us to talk about at the beginning of how do we determine whether a Stock's a buy sell and a hold I think the next few quarters are going to be challenging for the company in terms of stock price growth it's trading at about 23 times forward earnings it was around 21 times forward earnings before the runup the analyst forecasts on Market beat are a little bit more bullish about McDonald's than I am they have it as a moderate buy but the 9% runup on a challenging earnings report ends me to think that most of the growth at least in the short term is already priced into the stock Thomas where do you sit on McDonald's are you a McDonald's fan and especially a fan of what the company is doing right now oh well according to McDonald's internal data I'm a super heavy user I I do like McDonald's um I'm probably part of why the stock price keeps going up but right now uh the earnings report was a bit of a concern we don't want to see this company Contracting we certainly don't want to see a negative comp but what I think the results really show is the Diversified nature of the business because us was weak Latin America was banging Latin America is crushing it for a lot of different companies so I would definitely look in that direction for some Investments but as far as McDonald's goes it's on the cusp of pivoting back to growth very soon the forecasts for next year are very bullish the analysts have trimmed their targets since the last report but they're still looking at about 10 to 15% upside which puts the market back at the all-time high um any kind of good news will push it to a new all-time high and I think that could come with the fomc Thomas let's move on to your hold pick which stock are you looking to hold well I'm going to be holding Disney I'm holding Disney the stock price is down obviously it's been struggling for the last couple years but we're looking at a CEO that turnaround uh the return of Iger was huge news for this business that's been gaining traction ever since he got back on board uh they brought back the capital return that was a huge move um right now the parks are struggling but they're still growing entertainment is growing streaming is turning profitable which is really the big story this year we're kind of in wait and C mode to see how the next couple of quarters unfold because consumers are under pressure and there's certainly some pressure on the company's ability to grow and to profit but uh they've got some some big catalysts I think in the works that are going to help with results in the near- term and set it up for some big leverage gains in the long term now among those uh The Wolverine and Deadpool movie did very very well so that's certainly going to show up in the next quarter's results um they've been opening a lot of new attractions and Parks s it around Avatar and Indiana Jones and some of the other hotter franchises that should help sustain activity if not growth in the Parks until the consumer rebound takes traction again and then there are also some new films in the work they've got Avatar and The Incredibles and Moana which are all going to be driving results for this company later on in the year now interest rates are supposed to fall soon and that will be a Tailwind I think for the business it may be a year or more before that impact starts to show up in Disney's results but again with prices where they are right now they're kind of at Rock Bottom we have Capital returns back in play I think it's a good stock to hold if you've been to Disney recently especially one of the theme parks it looks like they're doing quite well those lines are never short I do want to hear your opinion on that Chris do you have a different take on Disney well I probably steal your funder a little bit Bridget because Bri Disney was the stock that I put as my cell and I think that's where we're going next but I'll I'll just say I'm a little bit more bearish than Thomas is I I was excited or I should say I was optimistic about the return of Bob Iger as the CEO I even thought that maybe the earnings report we saw a couple of quarters ago was a signed that the company was turning the corner they may still be but right now I'm just I'm struggling to figure out what the company's long-term strategy really seems to be right now it just feels like a lot of it is they're relying on Iger and the idea of we're Disney and we've done it before and we'll do it again and I'm hearing a lot of things like well we think this is going to happen we hope this is going to happen the company's struggling to get all the parts of the business firing on all cylinders and I think the theme park is a really good place to start profits right now are being used to help get that streaming business up to a level of profitability but there is concern and the company stated it in their last earnings report that demand for the theme parks is starting to show some cracks revenue from the division was only up about 2% and that was at about 8.3 billion and the operating income fell to about 2.2 billion this income that they drive from the park is about 53% of Disney's total revenue and Disney management reported that the next few quarters would be challenging for that division so I don't know it the stock's down slightly for the year it's trading down near fiveyear lows I understand that generally speaking that means that the stock doesn't have anywhere to go but up but it's more than likely that the company's going to figure it out but right now it looks like there's just a lot of faith trust and pixie dust going on and it's just a pass for me so Thomas why do you think Disney has a chance to come back this is the House of Mouse I mean they're struggling right now because there are some consumer pressures even with that warning they still reiterated their guidance they're still looking for growth it's going to be tepid you know so I think in a couple quarters we'll start to see the company begin gaining Traction in all of its segments at once which will really help leverage its growth in its earnings we'll see if they can bring back that Disney magic all right well Thomas let's get to your sell pick now which stock are you looking at selling right now well this might be one that Chris won't agree with but I'm looking to sell Tesla all right it's still the leading evem it makes profits the balance sheet is healthy but the core business is Contracting the still deep in the price Wars margins are Contracting earnings are suffering the valuation is still very high I personally am a fan of Elon Musk but the Elon Musk factor is pricey it's expensive to buy the stock and right now the market is waiting and hoping for the next phase of growth that may come soon but I don't really expect to see any good news out of the EV segment without a groundbreaking development anytime soon because demand is just so poor and the price Wars are having a big impact on the revenue also they're spending more trying to invest in that next phase of growth it will likely pay off but again we're looking at two or three quarters probably before we start seeing it able to generate money from those advances if even then there's still no consensus among the analysts the analyst sentiment is very mixed there's a very wide range of sentiment targets from sell to buy and the price targets are equally wide so even if the stock doesn't move lower from here and stay lower I expect to see significant volatility and not much upward Trend in the in the action Chris do you think Tesla is a sell right now too you know I find it hard to to say it's a sell and I think there's I'll admit there's the Elon Musk Factor there for me he's been counted out so many times and he tends to come back from the dead all these times I think in the short term it's hard for me to get behind Tesla stock in the long term I think a lot of the growth that investors are counting on is going to come from autonomous driving and Tesla is Leaps and Bounds ahead of other companies in terms of getting that to Market but there's still a big if attached to that can they get that done it's a stock that's just it's always going to be very noisy it's always going to be very polarizing um I I can't say I disagree with Thomas asell but I would say to me it's probably one that you want to hold on to just in case right fear of never know all right well let's move on to the the moment we've all been waiting for we want to hear your byy picks and I really want to know the why too uh Thomas let's get to your first buy pick all right my by pick is monday.com monday.com is a workflow automation platform um it's resonating with clients because it's easy to use and it scales well it's got this plug-and playay quality where you can just kind of pick which segments of it you want to use you build them together to create your own workflow so this past quarter was a beaten raise quarter Revenue was up 35% 300 basis points better than expected that uh Revenue strength was driven on new clients in penetration their net retention rate is 110% which means that existing clients are spending 10% more this year than last year with the addition of new clients which will also increase their spending over the next year provides some leverage for growth uh margins are widening with that leverage and the efficiency that the company is working towards um adjusted operating income was up 130% that's a real good example of how that leverage can affect your investment quality um adjusted earnings at 94 cents were 6 6,700 basis points better than expected 67% that's huge that's a huge outperformance um the company also raised guidance this has raised guidance again this is like the third time this year momentum is clearly building also the balance sheet is a super Fortress it's net cash total liability is less than 0.5 to cash position less compared to assets shareholder Equity is rising I think it's only a matter of time before Capital Returns come into play and then there's the analyst response all those things are great but without the analyst the upside potential is really limited the analyst response is overwhelmingly bullish they're leading the stock higher it's got about 20% upside at consensus we're going to expect it to go above consensus because of the revision Trends and what I see in the stock price right now is a retest of all-time highs that may come as soon as this year and that's a 35% upside at least now where is the entry point right now if you are just looking at getting into monday.com so right now monday.com stock is trending higher and it moved up to set a new multi-year high on this past this past report so not to chase the price higher but you're going to want to get in probably pretty soon wait for any kind of pullback in the action as you're entry point and then just start to slowly build a position with time I would certainly expect to see this stock retest the all-time highs and within the next year or two to set a new all-time high and then continue this trend um upward Chris have you followed monday.com what do you think of that pick I haven't followed it quite as closely as Thomas has but it's a stock that's very intriguing to me and I think one of the reasons why and I'll just keep my answer a little bit shorter Bridget is just you know you're talk when you talk about looking for buy stocks you're talking about as the saying goes you try to skate where the puck is moving and Monday is certainly right in that sweet spot you know remote work is not something that's going away uh it may not exist in the same form and fashion that it exists today over the next 10 years but it's not going away and that's exactly the type of business that monday.com is going to work for very well in terms of you need the tools that to make it easy for teams to collaborate with with each other no matter where they are yeah one of the point that I forgot to hit on is that monday.com is monetizing AI today all right it is a good example of what we've been expecting for the second wave of AI where Nvidia and the chipmakers are the the Leading Edge the first wave with

up but it's more than likely that the company's going to figure it out but right now it looks like there's just a lot of faith trust and pixie dust going on and it's just a pass for me so Thomas why do you think Disney has a chance to come back this is the House of Mouse I mean they're struggling right now because there are some consumer pressures even with that warning they still reiterated their guidance they're still looking for growth it's going to be tepid you know so I think in a couple quarters we'll start to see the company begin gaining Traction in all of its segments at once which will really help leverage its growth in its earnings we'll see if they can bring back that Disney magic all right well Thomas let's get to your sell pick now which stock are you looking at selling right now well this might be one that Chris won't agree with but I'm looking to sell Tesla all right it's still the leading evem it makes profits the balance sheet is healthy but the core business is Contracting the still deep in the price Wars margins are Contracting earnings are suffering the valuation is still very high I personally am a fan of Elon Musk but the Elon Musk factor is pricey it's expensive to buy the stock and right now the market is waiting and hoping for the next phase of growth that may come soon but I don't really expect to see any good news out of the EV segment without a groundbreaking development anytime soon because demand is just so poor and the price Wars are having a big impact on the revenue also they're spending more trying to invest in that next phase of growth it will likely pay off but again we're looking at two or three quarters probably before we start seeing it able to generate money from those advances if even then there's still no consensus among the analysts the analyst sentiment is very mixed there's a very wide range of sentiment targets from sell to buy and the price targets are equally wide so even if the stock doesn't move lower from here and stay lower I expect to see significant volatility and not much upward Trend in the in the action Chris do you think Tesla is a sell right now too you know I find it hard to to say it's a sell and I think there's I'll admit there's the Elon Musk Factor there for me he's been counted out so many times and he tends to come back from the dead all these times I think in the short term it's hard for me to get behind Tesla stock in the long term I think a lot of the growth that investors are counting on is going to come from autonomous driving and Tesla is Leaps and Bounds ahead of other companies in terms of getting that to Market but there's still a big if attached to that can they get that done it's a stock that's just it's always going to be very noisy it's always going to be very polarizing um I I can't say I disagree with Thomas asell but I would say to me it's probably one that you want to hold on to just in case right fear of never know all right well let's move on to the the moment we've all been waiting for we want to hear your byy picks and I really want to know the why too uh Thomas let's get to your first buy pick all right my by pick is monday.com monday.com is a workflow automation platform um it's resonating with clients because it's easy to use and it scales well it's got this plug-and playay quality where you can just kind of pick which segments of it you want to use you build them together to create your own workflow so this past quarter was a beaten raise quarter Revenue was up 35% 300 basis points better than expected that uh Revenue strength was driven on new clients in penetration their net retention rate is 110% which means that existing clients are spending 10% more this year than last year with the addition of new clients which will also increase their spending over the next year provides some leverage for growth uh margins are widening with that leverage and the efficiency that the company is working towards um adjusted operating income was up 130% that's a real good example of how that leverage can affect your investment quality um adjusted earnings at 94 cents were 6 6,700 basis points better than expected 67% that's huge that's a huge outperformance um the company also raised guidance this has raised guidance again this is like the third time this year momentum is clearly building also the balance sheet is a super Fortress it's net cash total liability is less than 0.5 to cash position less compared to assets shareholder Equity is rising I think it's only a matter of time before Capital Returns come into play and then there's the analyst response all those things are great but without the analyst the upside potential is really limited the analyst response is overwhelmingly bullish they're leading the stock higher it's got about 20% upside at consensus we're going to expect it to go above consensus because of the revision Trends and what I see in the stock price right now is a retest of all-time highs that may come as soon as this year and that's a 35% upside at least now where is the entry point right now if you are just looking at getting into monday.com so right now monday.com stock is trending higher and it moved up to set a new multi-year high on this past this past report so not to chase the price higher but you're going to want to get in probably pretty soon wait for any kind of pullback in the action as you're entry point and then just start to slowly build a position with time I would certainly expect to see this stock retest the all-time highs and within the next year or two to set a new all-time high and then continue this trend um upward Chris have you followed monday.com what do you think of that pick I haven't followed it quite as closely as Thomas has but it's a stock that's very intriguing to me and I think one of the reasons why and I'll just keep my answer a little bit shorter Bridget is just you know you're talk when you talk about looking for buy stocks you're talking about as the saying goes you try to skate where the puck is moving and Monday is certainly right in that sweet spot you know remote work is not something that's going away uh it may not exist in the same form and fashion that it exists today over the next 10 years but it's not going away and that's exactly the type of business that monday.com is going to work for very well in terms of you need the tools that to make it easy for teams to collaborate with with each other no matter where they are yeah one of the point that I forgot to hit on is that monday.com is monetizing AI today all right it is a good example of what we've been expecting for the second wave of AI where Nvidia and the chipmakers are the the Leading Edge the first wave with infrastructure Monday is actually using Ai and they're monetizing it for themselves and for their clients which is huge because the monetization of services is going to be the largest fastest growing segment of AI which is saying something considering nvidia's you know rapid rise over the last two years well thanks for your pick Thomas now Chris I'm excited to hear which stock you have for us as your top buy pick right now well I'm going to stay consistent with what I've been saying for the last several weeks Bridget my pick is Palante here uh Thomas actually gave me a nice place to jump off in terms of the monetization of AI because one of the things that paler really does well is it's helping other companies monetize Ai and in the process they're becoming the go-to provider for um not just the company's own proprietary llm but there are other platforms such as Foundry and Gotham that are allowing companies to actually make AI give them useful insights and that's you'll hear that from the CEO Alex karp a lot is the fact that paler is about making AI useful for other companies uh stock cracked the $30 Mark uh after it reported earnings in early August it's up about 81% year-to date it's got a high price earnings ratio there are all kinds of reasons to believe the stock is over revalued it seems like every week the company just keeps announcing new Partnerships New Deals it just suggests that there's a lot more growth coming for this company and not only are other companies starting to get wind of this but it seems like the analyst Community is starting to align as well on Market B the ensus is still reduced for palente here but the price targets have gone up so you know a year ago the price targets were still around $10 then they went up to around $516 now they're up around 21 $23 so analysts are grudgingly coming along with the stock we talked about this a couple of weeks ago on the channel there is the possibility that paler is going to get included into the s&amp;p500 this time around if so we'll find out about that in early September that would be another Catalyst for the stock because as we said at that point many institutions would have no choice but to include paler as part of their ETF and that's just going to drive the stock price higher and Thomas what do you think about trying to get into banteer right now yeah I'm on board with paner I think they've got a great growth trajectory I think they're doing a great job um implementing their services and growing their business um they certainly make money I do have some concerns with the valuation I think right now with the current out Outlook uh the valuation has pretty much priced in the next few years of growth so I'm really going to want to see um some strong outperformance and some accelerated momentum with with New Deals and with uh new clients as these new clients come on Chris how high do you think paler can go in its stock price especially well if we're talking about in the next in the next 12 months we we were um we were talking about this a little while ago the most bullish estimate I think is force the stock to get up somewhere around 38 in the next 12 months I'm not quite that bullish on it I think 33 34 is a really good uh is a good price Target in that time frame for some investors they if they're not in paler right now that may not excite them too much uh we're talking about 10% gain they can probably find that in other stocks but again I'm looking at this and saying if I'm looking at paler as a long-term hold where where might the stock be in five years in 10 years and I just think that right now it's okay to go ahead and buy at $30 if you believe that in five or 10 years it might be at $45 $50 or even higher well thank you both for the good

of all this volatility many investors are wondering what to buy what to sell and what to hold on to well our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes are here to break it all down for us guys I'm excited to hear what your top picks are for stocks that you're looking to buy sell and hold right now we're going to get to your picks in just a minute but first I want to go over a little bit of kind of what you guys look at as analysts for how you decide what to rate a stock whether it's a buy sell or hold well I look at a a combination of factors I want to see the company growing I like to see it outperforming expectations I like to find some value in there somewhere whether it be versus other companies or versus its own history versus the analyst expectations I want to see firm analyst support really with uptrending sentiment and uptrending price targets and then if there's good free cash flow and capital returns that's just icing on the kick so Chris what kind of research are you doing before you make your decision on whether a stock is a buy sell or hold are you looking at other analysts opinions are you looking into the company what does that process look like for you yeah I do tend to look at some analysts opinions but um generally I try to do my own research and my own thinking about the company I try to look at where their earnings have been in the past where their earnings are likely to go in the future I tend to be more of a long-term investor in my own personal portfolio so I'm not as concerned about what the stock might be doing in terms of technical movements at any one given moment in time but I'm looking at fundamental drivers for the business like Thomas said I'm looking for where's the growth going to come from how soon is it going to get here and is it growth that's going to be sustainable over the long term both of you have done a lot of that research right now and have picked out your top buy sell and hold stocks in the market right now we're going to get to those picks in just one moment but first here's a look at a tool you can use to see what analysts are saying about any stock want to keep your finger on the pulse of the market text the word YouTube to 68 285 that's 68 285 and get free breaking news alerts from Market beat for the stocks that matter most to you don't miss out on crucial updates stay informed and stay ahead well like most people I am most interested in hearing what your buy pick is right now but let's save the best for last I think let's start with which company you are looking to hold right now and why uh Chris let's start with you sure uh for my pick on stocks to hold I'm choosing McDonald's um stocks up about 9% since it reported earnings in July and the report wasn't that good same store sales were down for the first time since 2020 and you'd have to go back a lot further than 20120 to find the last time that did it before then so this wasn't a great report and the stocks up 9% kind of feels to to me like most of the growth has been priced in I like McDonald's I like the company it pays an attractive and a growing dividend that I don't see being in any danger there's been a lot of talk about issues about demand and pricing and I don't think any of those issues are issues that a healthier economy and a healthier consumer won't fix it was investing in digital well before 2020 and that's paying off today all of that being said and going back to the rubric that you asked us to talk about at the beginning of how do we determine whether a Stock's a buy sell and a hold I think the next few quarters are going to be challenging for the company in terms of stock price growth it's trading at about 23 times forward earnings it was around 21 times forward earnings before the runup the analyst forecasts on Market beat are a little bit more bullish about McDonald's than I am they have it as a moderate buy but the 9% runup on a challenging earnings report ends me to think that most of the growth at least in the short term is already priced into the stock Thomas where do you sit on McDonald's are you a McDonald's fan and especially a fan of what the company is doing right now oh well according to McDonald's internal data I'm a super heavy user I I do like McDonald's um I'm probably part of why the stock price keeps going up but right now uh the earnings report was a bit of a concern we don't want to see this company Contracting we certainly don't want to see a negative comp but what I think the results really show is the Diversified nature of the business because us was weak Latin America was banging Latin America is crushing it for a lot of different companies so I would definitely look in that direction for some Investments but as far as McDonald's goes it's on the cusp of pivoting back to growth very soon the forecasts for next year are very bullish the analysts have trimmed their targets since the last report but they're still looking at about 10 to 15% upside which puts the market back at the all-time high um any kind of good news will push it to a new all-time high and I think that could come with the fomc Thomas let's move on to your hold pick which stock are you looking to hold well I'm going to be holding Disney I'm holding Disney the stock price is down obviously it's been struggling for the last couple years but we're looking at a CEO that turnaround uh the return of Iger was huge news for this business that's been gaining traction ever since he got back on board uh they brought back the capital return that was a huge move um right now the parks are struggling but they're still growing entertainment is growing streaming is turning profitable which is really the big story this year we're kind of in wait and C mode to see how the next couple of quarters unfold because consumers are under pressure and there's certainly some pressure on the company's ability to grow and to profit but uh they've got some some big catalysts I think in the works that are going to help with results in the near- term and set it up for some big leverage gains in the long term now among those uh The Wolverine and Deadpool movie did very very well so that's certainly going to show up in the next quarter's results um they've been opening a lot of new attractions and Parks s it around Avatar and Indiana Jones and some of the other hotter franchises that should help sustain activity if not growth in the Parks until the consumer rebound takes traction again and then there are also some new films in the work they've got Avatar and The Incredibles and Moana which are all going to be driving results for this company later on in the year now interest rates are supposed to fall soon and that will be a Tailwind I think for the business it may be a year or more before that impact starts to show up in Disney's results but again with prices where they are right now they're kind of at Rock Bottom we have Capital returns back in play I think it's a good stock to hold if you've been to Disney recently especially one of the theme parks it looks like they're doing quite well those lines are never short I do want to hear your opinion on that Chris do you have a different take on Disney well I probably steal your funder a little bit Bridget because Bri Disney was the stock that I put as my cell and I think that's where we're going next but I'll I'll just say I'm a little bit more bearish than Thomas is I I was excited or I should say I was optimistic about the return of Bob Iger as the CEO I even thought that maybe the earnings report we saw a couple of quarters ago was a signed that the company was turning the corner they may still be but right now I'm just I'm struggling to figure out what the company's long-term strategy really seems to be right now it just feels like a lot of it is they're relying on Iger and the idea of we're Disney and we've done it before and we'll do it again and I'm hearing a lot of things like well we think this is going to happen we hope this is going to happen the company's struggling to get all the parts of the business firing on all cylinders and I think the theme park is a really good place to start profits right now are being used to help get that streaming business up to a level of profitability but there is concern and the company stated it in their last earnings report that demand for the theme parks is starting to show some cracks revenue from the division was only up about 2% and that was at about 8.3 billion and the operating income fell to about 2.2 billion this income that they drive from the park is about 53% of Disney's total revenue and Disney management reported that the next few quarters would be challenging for that division so I don't know it the stock's down slightly for the year it's trading down near fiveyear lows I understand that generally speaking that means that the stock doesn't have anywhere to go but up but it's more than likely that the company's going to figure it out but right now it looks like there's just a lot of faith trust and pixie dust going on and it's just a pass for me so Thomas why do you think Disney has a chance to come back this is the House of Mouse I mean they're struggling right now because there are some consumer pressures even with that warning they still reiterated their guidance they're still looking for growth it's going to be tepid you know so I think in a couple quarters we'll start to see the company begin gaining Traction in all of its segments at once which will really help leverage its growth in its earnings we'll see if they can bring back that Disney magic all right well Thomas let's get to your sell pick now which stock are you looking at selling right now well this might be one that Chris won't agree with but I'm looking to sell Tesla all right it's still the leading evem it makes profits the balance sheet is healthy but the core business is Contracting the still deep in the price Wars margins are Contracting earnings are suffering the valuation is still very high I personally am a fan of Elon Musk but the Elon Musk factor is pricey it's expensive to buy the stock and right now the market is waiting and hoping for the next phase of growth that may come soon but I don't really expect to see any good news out of the EV segment without a groundbreaking development anytime soon because demand is just so poor and the price Wars are having a big impact on the revenue also they're spending more trying to invest in that next phase of growth it will likely pay off but again we're looking at two or three quarters probably before we start seeing it able to generate money from those advances if even then there's still no consensus among the analysts the analyst sentiment is very mixed there's a very wide range of sentiment targets from sell to buy and the price targets are equally wide so even if the stock doesn't move lower from here and stay lower I expect to see significant volatility and not much upward Trend in the in the action Chris do you think Tesla is a sell right now too you know I find it hard to to say it's a sell and I think there's I'll admit there's the Elon Musk Factor there for me he's been counted out so many times and he tends to come back from the dead all these times I think in the short term it's hard for me to get behind Tesla stock in the long term I think a lot of the growth that investors are counting on is going to come from autonomous driving and Tesla is Leaps and Bounds ahead of other companies in terms of getting that to Market but there's still a big if attached to that can they get that done it's a stock that's just it's always going to be very noisy it's always going to be very polarizing um I I can't say I disagree with Thomas asell but I would say to me it's probably one that you want to hold on to just in case right fear of never know all right well let's move on to the the moment we've all been waiting for we want to hear your byy picks and I really want to know the why too uh Thomas let's get to your first buy pick all right my by pick is monday.com monday.com is a workflow automation platform um it's resonating with clients because it's easy to use and it scales well it's got this plug-and playay quality where you can just kind of pick which segments of it you want to use you build them together to create your own workflow so this past quarter was a beaten raise quarter Revenue was up 35% 300 basis points better than expected that uh Revenue strength was driven on new clients in penetration their net retention rate is 110% which means that existing clients are spending 10% more this year than last year with the addition of new clients which will also increase their spending over the next year provides some leverage for growth uh margins are widening with that leverage and the efficiency that the company is working towards um adjusted operating income was up 130% that's a real good example of how that leverage can affect your investment quality um adjusted earnings at 94 cents were 6 6,700 basis points better than expected 67% that's huge that's a huge outperformance um the company also raised guidance this has raised guidance again this is like the third time this year momentum is clearly building also the balance sheet is a super Fortress it's net cash total liability is less than 0.5 to cash position less compared to assets shareholder Equity is rising I think it's only a matter of time before Capital Returns come into play and then there's the analyst response all those things are great but without the analyst the upside potential is really limited the analyst response is overwhelmingly bullish they're leading the stock higher it's got about 20% upside at consensus we're going to expect it to go above consensus because of the revision Trends and what I see in the stock price right now is a

within the next year or two to set a new all-time high and then continue this trend um upward Chris have you followed monday.com what do you think of that pick I haven't followed it quite as closely

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,__Kch4uC0Vo,MarketBeat,2024-08-26 17:35:15+00:00,The Market is Watching: Why NVIDIA’s Earnings Are Key,Kind: captions Language: en it's a week where all eyes are on Nvidia earnings reports come out on Wednesday and it's not just about Nvidia it's really about the market as a whole here to break down the impact this earnings report we have on the market is our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys this is a really big week why is everyone so focused on this earnings report well Nvidia is the uh the central theme of the AI Revolution and the AI rally we've seen over the last two years it is amongst the most bought the most owned highly concentrated stocks in the S&amp;P 500 right now we need to see a really good report for us to sustain the rally uh without a good report it's possible the entire Market could start to fall um so that's the concern we've really been rallying all summer Chris do you think nvidia's last earning report really had an impact on that summer rally when Nvidia reported earnings back in May nvidia's stock went up immediately after the port but the market didn't really chase after Nvidia it kind of was chopping along um what I think is really driving the overall market performance right now is clearly the fact that the Federal Reserve is going to be lowering interest rates uh drone PW made that very clear in the Jackson Hole speech he gave on Friday a 25 basis point cut is coming in September the market might like it to be 50 but they know it's going to be 25 that's why the market really shot higher on Friday I think that probably has more to do in the short term with what the market performance is going to be that's not to say Nvidia is not important for all the reasons that Thomas said but I think right now that the market has other things they're concentrating on the price of oil actually this morning being one of them um so I think it it's going to be interesting to see Nvidia I don't know if Nvidia actually acts the broader Market as much as we might think well it's only been maybe a year or so since Nvidia has really been leading the market the way it has been in such a big way with all of the big growth uh Thomas can you walk us through past earnings reports for NVIDIA when did they really start seeing such impressive growth that the whole Market really started to pay attention well they've been seeing this impressive growth for about two years uh the story over the last year is that growth accelerated from 100% to over 200% in that same time the Market's raising their expectations Nvidia continues to outperform expectations now the trend and results is really ridiculously good they're not only outperforming the consensus for the current quarter by 500 basis points but they're raising their guidance by 500 basis points above the consensus so that's like a double shot of accelerating good news which is leading the market higher and right now there's a very very high expectation for NVIDIA to continue continue that Trend just in the last two or three days the analysts have increased their estimates the consensus estimates for revenue and for earnings by like a thousand basis points so there really is a high expectation going into this report it really really needs to be a blowout report for it to keep the market moving higher what do this report coming up mean for AI as in the tech industry as a whole invid is really been that leader for at least the last couple of years what will this earnings report mean for that industry in particular well it'll tell us if the the chip Market is still expanding and still in that Discovery phase for how big it's going to get what we're really waiting for now is for the second wave of AI to take hold which is the companies that actually use AI to produce results for businesses um with Nvidia as a business they've expanded from just being a chip Pure Play into being a full stack AI play so we should be able to see that in their result we should be able to see that second wave of AI spending show up in their results as more companies lean into their services to help boost their own AI potential now Chris we've heard some talk this summer about the potential of an AI bubble and are we in a bubble are we priced too high for where this industry really is at uh what will nvidia's report on Wednesday say about the possibility of a bubble or not I know some people are using the term AI bubble I think that's because there's a lot of people that just don't know where we're at at in the AI cycle and I can't say for sure I know where we're at but I would say I think we're still closer to the beginning of the cycle than we are the end and probably even but but I think we're also closer to the middle of that cycle we're now investors want to see what companies are going to do with AI other than just say okay we're using generative AI as a chat bot or we're going to use generative AI as this that sort of is the T Stakes now they want to see what are companies going to be doing that are going to actually be changing the way these companies make decisions that are going to be leading to efficiencies within corporations and we haven't seen that yet which doesn't mean it's not coming but it just I think that's where a lot of the uncertainty is is just exactly where we are with AI all right so let's talk about Blackwell now this is another announcement that everyone is really waiting on and watching closely Nvidia is kind of known for making these really big announcements at earnings time are we expecting anything like that this time around Thomas um I wouldn't be surprised but I think right now the story with Blackwell is the potential for delays now I don't think that's a big problem for NVIDIA per se unless of course AMD is able to get its next gen chip to Market first and in that scenario that would supercharge the uh the market share gain potential for AMD and then that stock would probably take off like a rocket it's a lot for every industry to be watching right now and really everyone is watching and waiting for this Nvidia earnings report just one more time let's go over again why are so many eyes on this right now why can you find hundreds of Articles and video videos all talking about what is coming up with this Nvidia earnings report well Nvidia with AI has sparked a new Evolution in technology that's going to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars over time now over the last two years Nvidia has pretty much been the sole recipient of all of the spending all the goodness it's doubled its size more than once in the last few years it's doubled last year doubled this year and we're expecting that again so it's the stock almost everybody owns it if not specifically as an individual holding that in a fund or an ETF so it's got an impact on everybody's portfolio that's a lot for everyone to be watching and of course we will be watching Nvidia earnings report this Wednesday right here on Market beat happy investing everyone [Music],NVIDIA,1.0,0.9

where all eyes are on Nvidia earnings reports come out on Wednesday and it's not just about Nvidia it's really about the market as a whole here to break down the impact this earnings report we have on the market is our Market beat analysts Chris marot and Thomas Hughes guys this is a really big week why is everyone so focused on this earnings report well Nvidia is the uh the central theme of the AI Revolution and the AI rally we've seen over the last two years it is amongst the most bought the most owned highly concentrated stocks in the S&amp;P 500 right now we need to see a really good report for us to sustain the rally uh without a good report it's possible the entire Market could start to fall um so that's the concern we've really been rallying all summer Chris do you think nvidia's last earning report really had an impact on that summer rally when Nvidia reported earnings back in May nvidia's stock went up immediately after the port but the market didn't really chase after Nvidia it kind of was chopping along um what I think is really driving the overall market performance right now is clearly the fact that the Federal Reserve is going to be lowering interest rates uh drone PW made that very clear in the Jackson Hole speech he gave on Friday a 25 basis point cut is coming in September the market might like it to be 50 but they know it's going to be 25 that's why the market really shot higher on Friday I think that probably has more to do in the short term with what the market performance is going to be that's not to say Nvidia is not important for all the reasons that Thomas said but I think right now that the market has other things they're concentrating on the price of oil actually this morning being one of them um so I think it it's going to be interesting to see Nvidia I don't know if Nvidia actually acts the broader Market as much as we might think well it's only been maybe a year or so since Nvidia has really been leading the market the way it has been in such a big way with all of the big growth uh Thomas can you walk us through past earnings reports for NVIDIA when did they really start seeing such impressive growth that the whole Market really started to pay attention well they've been seeing this impressive growth for about two years uh the story over the last year is that growth accelerated from 100% to over 200% in that same time the Market's raising their expectations Nvidia continues to outperform expectations now the trend and results is really ridiculously good they're not only outperforming the consensus for the current quarter by 500 basis points but they're raising their guidance by 500 basis points above the consensus so that's like a double shot of accelerating good news which is leading the market higher and right now there's a very very high expectation for NVIDIA to continue continue that Trend just in the last two or three days the analysts have increased their estimates the consensus estimates for revenue and for earnings by like a thousand basis points so there really is a high expectation going into this report it really really needs to be a blowout report for it to keep the market moving higher what do this report coming up mean for AI as in the tech industry as a whole invid is really been that leader for at least the last couple of years what will this earnings report mean for that industry in particular well it'll tell us if the the chip Market is still expanding and still in that Discovery phase for how big it's going to get what we're really waiting for now is for the second wave of AI to take hold which is the companies that actually use AI to produce results for businesses um with Nvidia as a business they've expanded from just being a chip Pure Play into being a full stack AI play so we should be able to see that in their result we should be able to see that second wave of AI spending show up in their results as more companies lean into their services to help boost their own AI potential now Chris we've heard some talk this summer about the potential of an AI bubble and are we in a bubble are we priced too high for where this industry really is at uh what

Why Investors Should Be Cautious Ahead of Earnings,Kind: captions Language: en [Music] so before the earnings what are we seeing the stock price do right now well right now what I think we're seeing is a pretty strong technical Trend following signal it's just a signal on the chart that shows the stock price has been trending higher it's dipped and now the market is buying that dip however this is a high volatility Market it's melting up now on the expectations for solid earnings but I think volatility is still very much in play I think that we would be lucky likely to see a stock price pullback before the earnings are released and there's certainly a chance of some volatility after the release so I wouldn't go chasing the price action now but wait for another one of those nice uh buying opportunities to develop yeah speaking of buying opportunities some investors got in on Nvidia at less than $100 a share uh just a little over a week ago what was behind that drop that was part of the uh the fear of of recession we got some some some weak employment data that led the market to fear recession and that caused the entire Market to sell off also we have um sector rotation in play because the fomc is supposed to be cutting rates so the market was already set up to fall when that fear spiked and I think this is just a natural market reaction to those forces and once again it's developed into a nice looking Trend following signal so earnings just a week away Chris uh why are we seeing this Spike right now is this pretty common just before earnings it can be like Thomas said the stock chart is showing a really nice Buy Signal for investors um it's had a nice dip so investors are trying to buy that dip it's also that would suggest that there's an expectation that Nvidia is going to put out a strong number and if they do you want to be in before the report because the stock will go up sharply after that and if you weren't in there at that Point you'll have missed out on those games [Music],NVIDIA,1.0,0.7
youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,zS3cxfbu2kE,MarketBeat,2024-08-22 15:55:00+00:00,Air Taxis by 2025? Archer Aviation’s Ambitious Plans and Stock Potential,Kind: captions Language: en well it's an idea straight out of a sci-fi movie but Archer Aviation is working to make air taxis a reality our Market be analyst jayu joins us to break down what's happening in this stock right now Jay I think everyone can get behind the idea of shortening your commute with an air taxi but just how close is Archer Aviation to actually making this a reality well they are basically looking to launch in 2025 um their key Flagship product is a an air taxi called the midnight technically called an avall electronic vertical takeoff and Landing aircraft it can carry four passengers and a pilot they can go 100 miles top speeds of 150 miles hour and they are actually setting up their networks as well setting up the LA Network and the San Francisco Network so they'll be ready to launch in 2025 and 2026 that is very soon and it all sounds exciting and fantastic but also very expensive just how much has Archer spent on developing this product in their last quarter they spent uh just over $92 million um now they have about 3 UH 60 million or so left in cash uh but they also have commitments uh from their Partners uh stantis for example these guys have already put up about $300 million and they've also committed to putting up another $39 to $400 million to get their manufacturing up and running these guys are the contract manufacturers so there's a lot of money pouring into pouring into this program yeah a lot of bigname investors coming behind this program but what does it mean for everyday investors who might be looking at Archer Aviation stock as a buy right now well Archer actually pulled back about 40% from last month so it offers a pretty decent opportunity to get in now keep in mind once again this is a speculative stock so this is a situation where you know they could run out of money even before they they launched their Network so it's very important to understand speculative but uh the $3 level is a very strong support $314 is basically where stellantis is in the stock a little over 17 million shares so if you get it in a pull on a pullback back to that area you know you're basically in the same position position as a Stant stellantis um and a lot cheaper than let's say your Kathy Wood uh of Arkin vest which owns 99.9% of the company with over 28 million shares at a higher price so what are analysts saying about the possible upside and some price targets for this stock moving forward right so basically it's hard to put an exact price Target on it right now it's just running on sentiment so this could hit double digits uh as we get close closer to the launch um there's going to be catalysts obviously so basically once they have their um FAA certification to actually start taking passengers that's going to make a big difference it's going to actually boost the stock up once they actually start uh you know having commercial commercial flights that's going to pump the stock up as well so there are stages where the stock should be able to continue to inch a little higher rally rally rally pull back you know hold based until it gets to the point where these guys are actually uh producing at full capacity but Jay what is this company mean for consumers who are looking for those quicker solutions for commuting in especially some of the largest cities like New York and La those are the people I'm thinking right now who are using helicopters to make that commute a lot shorter sure um so basically they want to shrink your commute time from 60 to 90 minutes by a car they want to shrink it down to about 10 minutes and you can imagine uh how many people would want to do that now it's cost prohibitive right now yes you could rent a helicopter in Manhattan you could use blade uh to travel from uh Manhattan to JFK in 10 minutes but it's going to cost you1 to2 a mile with air taxis they're trying to cut that down to $6 a mile by 202 2028 U they want to cut the price down to $2 a mile and then by 2030 and after they want to actually cut that price down to a dollar a mile so that's going to be a real benefit for consumers for everyday people who actually want to save on their commute times wow that's impressive it's also impressive to see some of the Catalyst already happening with this company with some of the big Partnerships they're already starting to get even before launching talk about those a little bit sure they so basically they've already collaborated with Southwest Airlines and United Airlines uh and putting together the Air Taxi Network um United has already committed conditional commitment to basically purchase a billion dollars the midnight aircraft uh future flight Global these guys have uh committed to buying well conditionally committed to buying about $580 Million worth the US Air Force has just taken delivery of their first aircraft so that they can basically test it out to see you know if they're going to order some more down the road there a lot of catalysts that are coming together almost to a perfect storm well we will no doubt continue to hear about this stock making headlines over the next few months and years as these new products are launched stick with marketbeat as we continue to follow what happens with archer Aviation and all stocks right at marketbeat.com

Archer Aviation’s Ambitious Plans and Stock Potential,Kind: captions Language: en well it's an idea straight out of a sci-fi movie but Archer Aviation is working to make air taxis a reality our Market be analyst jayu joins us to break down what's happening in this stock right now Jay I think everyone can get behind the idea of shortening your commute with an air taxi but just how close is Archer Aviation to actually making this a reality well they are basically looking to launch in 2025 um their key Flagship product is a an air taxi called the midnight technically called an avall electronic vertical takeoff and Landing aircraft it can carry four passengers and a pilot they can go 100 miles top speeds of 150 miles hour and they are actually setting up their networks as well setting up the LA Network and the San Francisco Network so they'll be ready to launch in 2025 and 2026 that is very soon and it all sounds exciting and fantastic but also very expensive just how much has Archer spent on developing this product in their last quarter they spent uh just over $92 million um now they have about 3 UH 60 million or so left in cash uh but they also have commitments uh from their Partners uh stantis for example these guys have already put up about $300 million and they've also committed to putting up another $39 to $400 million to get their manufacturing up and running these guys are the contract manufacturers so there's a lot of money pouring into pouring into this program yeah a lot of bigname investors coming behind this program but what does it mean for everyday investors who might be looking at Archer Aviation stock as a buy right now well Archer actually pulled back about 40% from last month so it offers a pretty decent opportunity to get in now keep in mind once again this is a speculative stock so this is a situation where you know they could run out of money even before they they launched their Network so it's very important to understand speculative but uh the $3 level is a very strong support $314 is basically where stellantis is in the stock a little over 17 million shares so if you get it in a pull on a pullback back to that area you know you're basically in the same position position as a Stant stellantis um and a lot cheaper than let's say your Kathy Wood uh of Arkin vest which owns 99.9% of the company with over 28 million shares at a higher price so what are analysts saying about the possible upside and some price targets for this stock moving forward right so basically it's hard to put an exact price Target on it right now it's just running on sentiment so this could hit double digits uh as we get close closer to the launch um there's going to be catalysts obviously so basically once they have their um FAA certification to actually start taking passengers that's going to make a big difference it's going to actually boost the stock up once they actually start uh you know having commercial commercial flights that's going to pump the stock up as well so there are stages where the stock should be able to continue to inch a little higher rally rally rally pull back you know hold based until it gets to the point where these guys are actually uh producing at full capacity but Jay what is this company mean for consumers who are looking for those quicker solutions for commuting in especially some of the largest cities like New York and La those are the people I'm thinking right now who are using helicopters to make that commute a lot shorter sure um so basically they want to shrink your commute time from 60 to 90 minutes by a car they want to shrink it down to about 10 minutes and you can imagine uh how many people would want to do that now it's cost prohibitive right now yes you could rent a helicopter in Manhattan you could use blade uh to travel from uh Manhattan to JFK in 10 minutes but it's going to cost you1 to2 a mile with air taxis they're trying to cut that down to $6 a mile by 202 2028 U they want to cut the price down to $2 a mile and then by 2030 and after they want to actually cut that price down to a dollar a mile so that's going to be a real benefit for consumers for everyday people who actually want to save on their commute times wow that's impressive it's also impressive to see some of the Catalyst already happening with this company with some of the big Partnerships they're already starting to get even before launching talk about those a little bit sure they so basically they've already collaborated with Southwest Airlines and United Airlines uh and putting together the Air Taxi Network um United has already committed conditional commitment to basically purchase a billion dollars the midnight aircraft uh future flight Global these guys have uh committed to buying well conditionally committed to buying about $580 Million worth the US Air Force has just taken delivery of their first aircraft so that they can basically test it out to see you know if they're going to order some more down the road there a lot of catalysts that are coming together almost to a perfect storm well we will no doubt continue to hear about this stock making
