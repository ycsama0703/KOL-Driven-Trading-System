three stocks selling near their 52- we low remember it's a great place to start looking for value stock number one good old nike guys nike had an all-time high of aund and basically $180 per share back on november 5th of 2021 that is almost three years ago and nike is a great company but now since this fall's happened guess what's coming out bad news bad news bad news bad news i just got a tweet the other day that nike is dead and it's a dying company oh boy must we repeat this over and over news follows the stock price mo do you think nike is dead no i think they're far from it far from dead couple attributes that make me obviously realize this $112 billion market cap versus $125 billion of enterprise value that difference of 12 billion is their net debt guys they did 6.2 bilon ion dollar in free cash flow last year come on they can pay off that debt very quickly one of the things and we'll get into one of the companies next is debt levels if a company has low debt levels relative to their free cash flow it's hard to go bankrupt next if i asked a 100 people who the best shoe and athletic apparel company is in the world in the world how many are going to say nike first off half of china is gonna say nike because they work in their factories right see what i did there i did and they're 12 years old too soon too soon okay i'm personally interested in nike i own nike now remember don't buy a company just because somebody on the internet has it i'm here to teach a process i want you to be able to apply that process and thinking to your own investments when you invest in things you know and understand you are going to do a lot better and more importantly you're going to sleep better at night so let's see what the eight pillar story is about this company all right 5year pe seems a little rich but remember this is the net income part and it's pretty consistent here but on the fiveyear price of free cash flow 25 versus 22.8 but a big increase in the last year on that free cash flow so you think that fiveyear pe is too rich so i meant in terms of um richer than the fiveyear p the fiveyear um which one did you say either one so nike is a premium company that's what i'm saying nike has a high return on invested capital this means they get a good return on the money invest in their business and a lot of investors a lot of great investors look at this from mo status you need to pay more money for great companies with a high return invested capital so what mo here is saying and he brings up a great point is is 25 too high a multiple on the five-year basis on the one-year basis they're selling for 18 times free cash flow 21 times earnings if the market average is 15 is that really too much to pay for nike i don't think so i don't think so either i mean i would pay a premium for them absolutely i think your the old paul would have not paid a premium and would have missed out on great companies at great prices this is if you look at warren buffett back in 1987 started buying coke at 30 times earnings and he's made with dividends about 11 and a half or 12% a year since then pretty solid he paid up significantly but he bought a great company at a premium price all right now nike's only bought back 4% of their shares which i'm happy about yeah really because the stock has been high for a while relative to value think about it this way if the stock is down basically 60% in the last three years what was this pe what was this price of free cash flow on pe back then way higher 35 40 45 and people would have said and back then nike is a great company it's not going anywhere yada yada yada yada right i look at that saying okay now um return invested capital like we said is awesome lower deb levels awesome revenue growth of 10.3 billion led to $2.8 billion in more free cash flow guys i like this company a lot i really do analyst estimates has 378 per share this year going to 636 again it's analysts but guys i want to remind everyone here that if you choose to buy nike there is pretty much a 0% chance that you're just going to go straight up from the time you buy what i'm trying to teach everybody is that the brain power power needed to buy a stock is very little the stomach needed is huge peter lynch always says that you've got to be ready for nike stock to fall i personally hope it falls to 35 or 40 bucks as a dollar cost average down but if you're going to determine your success by the short-term price movements in a stock you're probably not an investor and that's okay just stick to long-term etfs lowcost long-term etfs you'll do great doing that but if you want to pick individual stocks it's really important that you be able to buy a stock and watch it decrease and get rid of the noise out there all the negativity and make a fundamental decision on these these are the conversations we have in our community to support each other during those times what is this oh and by the way the dying company analysts have not big growth one and a half one and a half six six and a half 5 and a half six i have a hard time believing nike is not going to grow with the world economy in the very least everybody wants nike everyone wants nike so let's go to stock analyzer tool what the last time i did nike in our stock analyzer tool april 16th 2024 okay remember this is not include the balance sheet and i'm doing a 10-year analysis revenue growth mo i did three five and seven i did two four six okay so a little bit more conservative but i don't blame him for that all right profit margin i did 10 11 12 and same with free cash flow um i did 9 and a half 10 and 10 and a half and i oh because it's been so consistent yeah but here's what my reason for going a little bit higher was direct sales to consumers they're getting they're doing more direct to the consumer higher margin that's true that's the reason i did that now pe look at my pe i did 20 23 and 26 i put that premium in there wow i 18 21 and 24 i kind of like yours though i think and by the way i can understand 18 21 and 24 especially if they do 7% revenue growth yeah and i look at this going guys it is a great company i do think it has staying power i would be absolutely floored if this company i love what warren buffett says he says i think to myself if i had hundred billion dollars could i compete with this company under armour is barely competing with the company never has really i i look at the saying guys hundred billion dollars i don't think i'm putting it i don't think i'm competing heavily with i mean yeah you're probably gonna put something out there but it's gonna be very difficult to overtake nike even though a 100 billion dollar check to fight him withas and reebok have been trying forever and they're the ones that replace adidas and rebok desire return 9% it's the market 9 or 10% this is just to find intrinsic value you need to put a margin of safety that's where you apply it here with a higher desired return mo i assume you did the same thing yep hit the analyze button all right guys i have a low price of 60 high price of 120 middle price of 86 looks pretty attractive and this returns here at the bottom are based on buying at today's price and these different categories occurring and this does include the dividend so that's nike for you stock number two this one's a controversial one i got lucky on this one walgreens now guys how did i get lucky on walgreens a few years ago i liked walgreens i sat there and said yeah this is this is a company i want to own i bought it and after a while it's going up and down after a while i started to notice i didn't like some attributes of it what were those attributes let me show you for one thing the return on invested capital was crap five years was 0.28 and the second thing was the amount of debt here market cap is 10 10 billion dollar enterprise value 76 billion with 2.2 billion five year average free cash flow too much debt i got lucky by selling it by selling it for a profit for a profit now keep in mind here i'm not saying this as some sort of humble rag i'm sitting there saying just because a stock is sold for a profit does not make you right just like just because you sold a stock for a loss does not make you wrong what's correct i was wrong on walgreens that's a flat out what i believe to be true i was wrong on walgreens and now it's kind of maybe out to be the case that i was wrong on walgreens i just got lucky because the market shifted the price up okay so i look at this company profit margin negative fiveyear profit margin negative gross profit margin 18.4% they slashed 8,000 locations that's insane that's absolutely crazy now with all those i don't know now the question we had before we made this video was would we be surprised if walgreens was gone gone in 5 or 10 years i still think i'd be surprised i think this company's being priced for bankruptcy if you want to make a play on this company i think it's very interesting because the negativity around it is insane this is the lowest price since may 1st 1997 yeah and you see their uh dividend yield 14.7% what are the chances they keep this dividend going they can't i don't think they're going to be able to do that free cash flow they don't have the cash flow to do it i think before you make an investment in walgreens you really got to understand the balance sheet the company and what they're doing to turnaround you really have to believe in it i do not believe this is for the faint of heart mo what are analysts doing right now what are what are their assumptions on walgreens they're actually pricing in growth still so september 2024 $326 c per share end of 20 mid 2028 $433 c per share wow and then for revenue going from 146.760 a5 billion august of 20 28 if you believe this company's gna be around for the foreseeable future and eventually get the profitable again right now i think you got to take i think you got to really figure about this one yeah now guys if you want to look at walgreens i'm sure there are people in our community talking about it this might be worth it enough for you to take a look and i don't know if you guys notice if you've looked at our page on the before we have limited daily spots for the everything money community and software and the reason we did that is because a software as it is today includes everything having to do with retirement stocks and real estate all these tools right here now we're going to be making some of these changes behind the scenes so in the near future that offer is absolutely going to go away as we've been interviewing our users our community members the feedback we've been getting is that they want to focus themselves on specific aspects of everything money tools that apply to them at that moment in time they don't want too many options they don't want to be the cheesecake factory and we don't want to be the cheesecake factory of software and if you've been watching the channel for a while you'll remember that originally i built the software selfishly for myself and my team so that we could use it to constantly make the right and better decisions for stocks real estate and retirement but the channel has been fairly fortunate to grow very fast and our community has grown extremely fast so it has to become less about me and more about how i can better serve you and the community members the good news is we have not made those changes yet so if you join today if you click the link in the description below you will be grandfathered in for life with all of the tools all of these tools right here and this is absolutely going to be the best offer we're ever going to give ever i'm telling you this now because there's still time to get all of these tools if you click the link below join the em community today before we make these changes you'll be able to get all these tools even after the changes are made so click the link in the description below get the offer it'll be the best decision you've made all year so what's walgreens worth mo i think this is going to be incredible when was the last time we did wba um mine's definitely been a while so i'm going to change some things here i'm going to factor in -20 and 2% revenue growth because i want to go a little bit crazier here they've shut down 8,000 locations that's going to be a lot um profit margin i went back to 1.75 2.25 and 2.75 and since their free cash flow is higher i did 2.53 and 3.5 how does that sound good i'm about the same about the same now look at their pe i put 10 12 and a half and 15 because i do think if they can get back to this level they should be a market average kind of company but i think it's going to take time now i'm going to put my i mean this is before i didn't did 9% across the board actually i can understand somebody saying hey pe should be8 10 and 12 but i'm sitting here doing this with a 9% return across the board look at this low price of 26 to 38 a high price of 66 to middle price of 40 to 55 huge potential returns here but you've got to be right yeah but is this one of those situations where you put a little bit of money into it i don't know i have to think about that myself i'm actually gonna have dalton our inhouse analyst who's very active in the community and if you're in our community please go chat with him about this i might take a look at walgreens for no other reason then i do think they're being priced for bankruptcy i don't think this is a faint of heart deal though i think whatever money i'm going to put in this i'm just going to assume it's going to be gone if i do any money at all i even put 20% margin of safety 15 on the low 30 in the mid 50 on the high that's a 20% margin of safety that's incredible so these are the things that make software so much better because if you looked at this you'd be like oh i'm gonna ignore walgreens but then when you see this what does it tell you i need to do more research because this is too much to ignore does it mean this is going to work no this is a company that has a lot of problems right now and these problems are not fake problems they are acknowledging we're closing 8,000 stores that's an acknowledgement that we have issues they have a lot of debt but it might be something that i might even buy long-term calls on and say listen it's all or none let's say i buy these calls and if it hits awesome it doesn't doesn't but it's got to be part of your investment thesis stock number three starbucks now first now guys i did this twitter poll if you want to follow me at em paul g now at first we were talking about doing mcdonald's but as you can see people were most interested in nike not as many 7.3% won walgreens this is only a two-hour poll i got 275 votes thank you if you voted but 33% wanted mcdonald's but some of the comments made a comment about starbucks listen you should be looking at starbucks more at first i wasn't going to do that because we done a video about you know a few weeks ago on starbucks but when people commented i brought it up to tim tim said yeah let's do starbucks but look at this everybody's interested in nike why nike's down over 60% i want to give you guys a comment i don't think nike is done going down does that mean it will go down from here no but you there's a lot of negative sentiment that's growing on nike and as that price continues to fall the negative sentiment will probably grow with it just like we saw with walgreens as the stock continue to fall the negative sentiment keeps on going so starbucks another company that's off considerably from its all-time high 126 all-time high versus 72 today all right so it's not as big a drop as as nike but it's still sizable and was around the same time july of 2021 a few months before nike's high so we're looking at this going okay now what's the deal with starbucks now i had a great comment from somebody on twitter one of my great followers and he said paul my wife and i don't even like starbucks we have four kids they love starbucks i'm like what he goes yeah i have no idea how that happened he's like but they love starbucks and whenever we go out they're begging me for starbucks and i'm like oh that's pretty interesting interesting everybody i know loves starbucks i know people who have starbucks twice a day it's an incredible legalized drug it's awesome good for them 38,000 locations worldwide they have a dividend which i'm not a huge fan of because this dividend is 3% but it eats up two and a half billion of their four billion last year in free cash flow in the 5year average of 2.76 they're selling for about 20 times free cash flow and 20 times pe do i think starbucks is a premium company yep absolutely mo mo what do you think i'm not going to did you look don't what do you think their roic is oh i i didn't look um 20 53 last year 47 for the 5year average wow this is what we call a moe wow mo what's apples can you pull up apple in our software and see what the fiveyear um return invested capital is guys starbucks is a moat any how many coffee companies have come out in the last 40 years and they can't compete with starbucks 42.3 it's higher roic higher return on the money that's invested in the business than even apple than even apple that tells you a lot and i think that this is the kind of company that you want to pay attention to as it starts to fall because would you be shocked if starbucks was gone in five or 10 years absolutely absolutely absolutely so let's see what the eight pillars are saying about starbucks buy back a lot of shares okay a lot of debt here yeah why um leases yeah stores real estate leases stores exactly not buying back a lot of shares hopefully they turn that around if starbucks hypothetically fell 30 or 40% from here they wouldn't do this but i want them to cancel this dividend and buy back shares they would probably juice up the dividend but guys that's the key here we want if you're new to our channel the big key is we want companies using their cash to buy back cheap shares not any shares that's why i'm glad that they haven't bought back a ton of shares okay in the last 10 year last five years the revenue is up about 10 billion it's led to $3 billion in extra free cash flow and $800 $ million in extra net income okay so overall it just feels like it's probably a valuation issue but again this fiveyear number might not be the one we have to care about is it still growing are there attributes to this company that keep getting better same store sales at starbucks are declining same with home depot same with lows same with target i believe another indication the consumer is getting weaker this would be a luxury item for a lot of consumers a $7 coffee ain't cheap right so if you're going to cut something back what are you going to cut out you're going to start there i think you're going to start there that's an easy don't stop at the because you have to go to starbucks to get there you're gna just skip it and so i think to myself as this thing continues to go down if the consumer continues to get weaker as inflation has cut into people's budgets what are they going to cut out first those types of things that's why i see home depot lows target and starbucks having the same store st sale declines but is that going to be the future forever i know about that let's see what analysts are thinking eps 367 growing to 644 okay healthy double- digit growth every year again just analysts and revenue two and a half seven and a half eight and a half 10 and a half 8% pretty solid revenue growth pretty solid revenue growth all right so what is starbucks worth to us now guys beyond just doing the the stock analyzer tool one of the things i want to accentuate on these on these videos is that these videos are a great precursor by looking at the numbers the deeper dive happens in the community the deeper dive goes in there but i want to urge you i personally don't believe in peeling back every layer of a company if you think too much about a company as big as starbucks i think you're going to talk yourself out of there's always a bad reason and always a good reason and the more you think about it the more you fall in love with the company you're going to sit there and whatever data you see is going to be a positive or negative depending on which viewpoint you want to have about the company and also be careful if a stock continues to fall don't just believe every story out there i just did that recently on on twitter where i talked about this just because news point news comes out about a company does not mean that information is relevant that's very important to understand let me go to extreme ceo gets diarrhea that day does that matter no of course it doesn't matter i i look at this and i hear all the time people will say things well yeah but did you know this and i'm like what is how is that relevant to the future of the business and they'll make some random statement i'm like that's relevant to and to me as a person who runs several businesses i realize there are certain things that really do matter and certain things that do not and be ready for that for all of these companies we're looking at any company look at the future difficult part about investing is when the stock falls even after you bought it to sit because when you don't own a stock you see the stock fall opportunity when you own the stock and it falls fear right mo so these are the things you have to be very aware of so mo what were your assumptions on starbucks for the revenue growth for the next 10 years so i did four six and eight i like yours more i did five seven and a half and 10 yeah but i like yours more i'm gonna do four six and eight now profit margin what' you do 10 and a half 11 and a half and 12 and a half so i did 10 and a half 12 and 13 and a half because the last 10 years i did 12.3 okay and i did the same thing but i did a little bit higher free cash flow on the on the tail end okay i did a lower on the low side a higher on the high side i did 10 12 14 okay pe what' you do i did 20 23 and 26 so it's funny i'm looking at this pe here of 17 20 22 and a half and i'm like is that enough i don't think so yeah this is a premium company so i'm gna change m as much as it is yeah so i'm gonna go 20 23 i'm gonna do 20 22 and a half and 25 so guys all we did here was say what's the what's the pe and price of free cash flow in 10 years if this company continues to establish itself and build its mode have a higher return invested capital you need to pay a premium and it's growing substantially yes but this is what makes investing in art everybody looks at it a different way there's probably somebody out there who says starbucks is dying and it's should be a 12 pe okay i don't know what the right answer is this is what makes investing so difficult but if you apply this process to all the investments you make you're probably going to do pretty well with it i don't know how well but it's about sitting there and paying a premium for good companies and paying less for bad companies and again my 9% return across the board i'm going hit the analyze button stock's currently at 73 i have a low price of 66 high

three stocks selling near their 52- we low remember it's a great place to start looking for value stock number one good old nike guys nike had an all-time high of aund and basically $180 per share back on november 5th of 2021 that is almost three years ago and nike is a great company but now since this fall's happened guess what's coming out bad news bad news bad news bad news i just got a tweet the other day that nike is dead and it's a dying company oh boy must we repeat this over and over news follows the stock price mo do you think nike is dead no i think they're far from it far from dead couple attributes that make me obviously realize this $112 billion market cap versus $125 billion of enterprise value that difference of 12 billion is their net debt guys they did 6.2 bilon ion dollar in free cash flow last year come on they can pay off that debt very quickly one of the things and we'll get into one of the companies next is debt levels if a company has low debt levels relative to their free cash flow it's hard to go bankrupt next if i asked a 100 people who the best shoe and athletic apparel company is in the world in the world how many are going to say nike first off half of china is gonna say nike because they work in their factories right see what i did there i did and they're 12 years old too soon too soon okay i'm personally interested in nike i own nike now remember don't buy a company just because somebody on the internet has it i'm here to teach a process i want you to be able to apply that process and thinking to your own investments when you invest in things you know and understand you are going to do a lot better and more importantly you're going to sleep better at night so let's see what the eight pillar story is about this company all right 5year pe seems a little rich but remember this is the net income part and it's pretty consistent here but on the fiveyear price of free cash flow 25 versus 22.8 but a big increase in the last year on that free cash flow so you think that fiveyear pe is too rich so i meant in terms of um richer than the fiveyear p the fiveyear um which one did you say either one so nike is a premium company that's what i'm saying nike has a high return on invested capital this means they get a good return on the money invest in their business and a lot of investors a lot of great investors look at this from mo status you need to pay more money for great companies with a high return invested capital so what mo here is saying and he brings up a great point is is 25 too high a multiple on the five-year basis on the one-year basis they're selling for 18 times free cash flow 21 times earnings if the market average is 15 is that really too much to pay for nike i don't think so i don't think so either i mean i would pay a premium for them absolutely i think your the old paul would have not paid a premium and would have missed out on great companies at great prices this is if you look at warren buffett back in 1987 started buying coke at 30 times earnings and he's made with dividends about 11 and a half or 12% a year since then pretty solid he paid up significantly but he bought a great company at a premium price all right now nike's only bought back 4% of their shares which i'm happy about yeah really because the stock has been high for a while relative to value think about it this way if the stock is down basically 60% in the last three years what was this pe what was this price of free cash flow on pe back then way higher 35 40 45 and people would have said and back then nike is a great company it's not going anywhere yada yada yada yada right i look at that saying okay now um return invested capital like we said is awesome lower deb levels awesome revenue growth of 10.3 billion led to $2.8 billion in more free cash flow guys i like this company a lot i really do analyst estimates has 378 per share this year going to 636 again it's analysts but guys i want to remind everyone here that if you choose to buy nike there is pretty much a 0% chance that you're just going to go straight up from the time you buy what i'm trying to teach everybody is that the brain power power needed to buy a stock is very little the stomach needed is huge peter lynch always says that you've got to be ready for nike stock to fall i personally hope it falls to 35 or 40 bucks as a dollar cost average down but if you're going to determine your success by the short-term price movements in a stock you're probably not an investor and that's okay just stick to long-term etfs lowcost long-term etfs you'll do great doing that but if you want to pick individual stocks it's really important that you be able to buy a stock and watch it decrease and get rid of the noise out there all the negativity and make a fundamental decision on these these are the conversations we have in our community to support each other during those times what is this oh and by the way the dying company analysts have not big growth one and a half one and a half six six and a half 5 and a half six i have a hard time believing nike is not going to grow with the world economy in the very least everybody wants nike everyone wants nike so let's go to stock analyzer tool what the last time i did nike in our stock analyzer tool april 16th 2024 okay remember this is not include the balance sheet and i'm doing a 10-year analysis revenue growth mo i did three five and seven i did two four six okay so a little bit more conservative but i don't blame him for that all right profit margin i did 10 11 12 and same with free cash flow um i did 9 and a half 10 and 10 and a half and i oh because it's been so consistent yeah but here's what my reason for going a little bit higher was direct sales to consumers they're getting they're doing more direct to the consumer higher margin that's true that's the reason i did that now pe look at my pe i did 20 23 and 26 i put that premium in there wow i 18 21 and 24 i kind of like yours though i think and by the way i can understand 18 21 and 24 especially if they do 7% revenue growth yeah and i look at this going guys it is a great company i do think it has staying power i would be absolutely floored if this company i love what warren buffett says he says i think to myself if i had hundred billion dollars could i compete with this company under armour is barely competing with the company never has really i i look at the saying guys hundred billion dollars i don't think i'm putting it i don't think i'm competing heavily with i mean yeah you're probably gonna put something out there but it's gonna be very difficult to overtake nike even though a 100 billion dollar check to fight him withas and reebok have been trying forever and they're the ones that replace adidas and rebok desire return 9% it's the market 9 or 10% this is just to find intrinsic value you need to put a margin of safety that's where you apply it here with a higher desired return mo i assume you did the same thing yep hit the analyze button all right guys i have a low price of 60 high price of 120 middle price of 86 looks pretty attractive and this returns here at the bottom are based on buying at today's price and these different categories occurring and this does include the dividend so that's nike for you stock number two this one's a controversial one i got lucky on this one walgreens now guys how did i get lucky on walgreens a few years ago i liked walgreens i sat there and said yeah this is this is a company i want to own i bought it and after a while it's going up and down after a while i started to notice i didn't like some attributes of it what were those attributes let me show you for one thing the return on invested capital was crap five years was 0.28 and the second thing was the amount of debt here market cap is 10 10 billion dollar enterprise value 76 billion with 2.2 billion five year average free cash flow too much debt i got lucky by selling it by selling it for a profit for a profit now keep in mind here i'm not saying this as some sort of humble rag i'm sitting there saying just because a stock is sold for a profit does not make you right just like just because you sold a stock for a loss does not make you wrong what's correct i was wrong on walgreens that's a flat out what i believe to be true i was wrong on walgreens and now it's kind of maybe out to be the case that i was wrong on walgreens i just got lucky because the market shifted the price up okay so i look at this company profit margin negative fiveyear profit margin negative gross profit margin 18.4% they slashed 8,000 locations that's insane that's absolutely crazy now with all those i don't know now the question we had before we made this video was would we be surprised if walgreens was gone gone in 5 or 10 years i still think i'd be surprised i think this company's being priced for bankruptcy if you want to make a play on this company i think it's very interesting because the negativity around it is insane this is the lowest price since may 1st 1997 yeah and you see their uh dividend yield 14.7% what are the chances they keep this dividend going they can't i don't think they're going to be able to do that free cash flow they don't have the cash flow to do it i think before you make an investment in walgreens you really got to understand the balance sheet the company and what they're doing to turnaround you really have to believe in it i do not believe this is for the faint of heart mo what are analysts doing right now what are what are their assumptions on walgreens they're actually pricing in growth still so september 2024 $326 c per share end of 20 mid 2028 $433 c per share wow and then for revenue going from 146.760 a5 billion august of 20 28 if you believe this company's gna be around for the foreseeable future and eventually get the profitable again right now i think you got to take i think you got to really figure about this one yeah now guys if you want to look at walgreens i'm sure there are people in our community talking about it this might be worth it enough for you to take a look and i don't know if you guys notice if you've looked at our page on the before we have limited daily spots for the everything money community and software and the reason we did that is because a software as it is today includes everything having to do with retirement stocks and real estate all these tools right here now we're going to be making some of these changes behind the scenes so in the near future that offer is absolutely going to go away as we've been interviewing our users our community members the feedback we've been getting is that they want to focus themselves on specific aspects of everything money tools that apply to them at that moment in time they don't want too many options they don't want to be the cheesecake factory and we don't want to be the cheesecake factory of software and if you've been watching the channel for a while you'll remember that originally i built the software selfishly for myself and my team so that we could use it to constantly make the right and better decisions for stocks real estate and retirement but the channel has been fairly fortunate to grow very fast and our community has grown extremely fast so it has to become less about me and more about how i can better serve you and the community members the good news is we have not made those changes yet so if you join today if you click the link in the description below you will be grandfathered in for life with all of the tools all of these tools right here and this is absolutely going to be the best offer we're ever going to give ever i'm telling you this now because there's still time to get all of these tools if you click the link below join the em community today before we make these changes you'll be able to get all these tools even after the changes are made so click the link in the description below get the offer it'll be the best decision you've made all year so what's walgreens worth mo i think this is going to be incredible when was the last time we did wba um mine's definitely been a while so i'm going to change some things here i'm going to factor in -20 and 2% revenue growth because i want to go a little bit crazier here they've shut down 8,000 locations that's going to be a lot um profit margin i went back to 1.75 2.25 and 2.75 and since their free cash flow is higher i did 2.53 and 3.5 how does that sound good i'm about the same about the same now look at their pe i put 10 12 and a half and 15 because i do think if they can get back to this level they should be a market average kind of company but i think it's going to take time now i'm going to put my i mean this is before i didn't did 9% across the board actually i can understand somebody saying hey pe should be8 10 and 12 but i'm sitting here doing this with a 9% return across the board look at this low price of 26 to 38 a high price of 66 to middle price of 40 to 55 huge potential returns here but you've got to be right yeah but is this one of those situations where you put a little bit of money into it i don't know i have to think about that myself i'm actually gonna have dalton our inhouse analyst who's very active in the community and if you're in our community please go chat with him about this i might take a look at walgreens for no other reason then i do think they're being priced for bankruptcy i don't think this is a faint of heart deal though i think whatever money i'm going to put in this i'm just going to assume it's going to be gone if i do any money at all i even put 20% margin of safety 15 on the low 30 in the mid 50 on the high that's a 20% margin of safety that's incredible so these are the things that make software so much better because if you looked at this you'd be like oh i'm gonna ignore walgreens but then when you see this what does it tell you i need to do more research because this is too much to ignore does it mean this is going to work no this is a company that has a lot of problems right now and these problems are not fake problems they are acknowledging we're closing 8,000 stores that's an acknowledgement that we have issues they have a lot of debt but it might be something that i might even buy long-term calls on and say listen it's all or none let's say i buy these calls and if it hits awesome it doesn't doesn't but it's got to be part of your investment thesis stock number three starbucks now first now guys i did this twitter poll if you want to follow me at em paul g now at first we were talking about doing mcdonald's but as you can see people were most interested in nike not as many 7.3% won walgreens this is only a two-hour poll i got 275 votes thank you if you voted but 33% wanted mcdonald's but some of the comments made a comment about starbucks listen you should be looking at starbucks more at first i wasn't going to do that because we done a video about you know a few weeks ago on starbucks but when people commented i brought it up to tim tim said yeah let's do starbucks but look at this everybody's interested in nike why nike's down over 60% i want to give you guys a comment i don't think nike is done going down does that mean it will go down from here no but you there's a lot of negative sentiment that's growing on nike and as that price continues to fall the negative sentiment will probably grow with it just like we saw with walgreens as the stock continue to fall the negative sentiment keeps on going so starbucks another company that's off considerably from its all-time high 126 all-time high versus 72 today all right so it's not as big a drop as as nike but it's still sizable and was around the same time july of 2021 a few months before nike's high so we're looking at this going okay now what's the deal with starbucks now i had a great comment from somebody on twitter one of my great followers and he said paul my wife and i don't even like starbucks we have four kids they love starbucks i'm like what he goes yeah i have no idea how that happened he's like but they love starbucks and whenever we go out they're begging me for starbucks and i'm like oh that's pretty interesting interesting everybody i know loves starbucks i know people who have starbucks twice a day it's an incredible legalized drug it's awesome good for them 38,000 locations worldwide they have a dividend which i'm not a huge fan of because this dividend is 3% but it eats up two and a half billion of their four billion last year in free cash flow in the 5year average of 2.76 they're selling for about 20 times free cash flow and 20 times pe do i think starbucks is a premium company yep absolutely mo mo what do you think i'm not going to did you look don't what do you think their roic is oh i i didn't look um 20 53 last year 47 for the 5year average wow this is what we call a moe wow mo what's apples can you pull up apple in our software and see what the fiveyear um return invested capital is guys starbucks is a moat any how many coffee companies have come out in the last 40 years and they can't compete with starbucks 42.3 it's higher roic higher return on the money that's invested in the business than even apple than even apple that tells you a lot and i think that this is the kind of company that you want to pay attention to as it starts to fall because would you be shocked if starbucks was gone in five or 10 years absolutely absolutely absolutely so let's see what the eight pillars are saying about starbucks buy back a lot of shares okay a lot of debt here yeah why um leases yeah stores real estate leases stores exactly not buying back a lot of shares hopefully they turn that around if starbucks hypothetically fell 30 or 40% from here they wouldn't do this but i want them to cancel this dividend and buy back shares they would probably juice up the dividend but guys that's the key here we want if you're new to our channel the big key is we want companies using their cash to buy back cheap shares not any shares that's why i'm glad that they haven't bought back a ton of shares okay in the last 10 year last five years the revenue is up about 10 billion it's led to $3 billion in extra free cash flow and $800 $ million in extra net income okay so overall it just feels like it's probably a valuation issue but again this fiveyear number might not be the one we have to care about is it still growing are there attributes to this company that keep getting better same store sales at starbucks are declining same with home depot same with lows same with target i believe another indication the consumer is getting weaker this would be a luxury item for a lot of consumers a $7 coffee ain't cheap right so if you're going to cut something back what are you going to cut out you're going to start there i think you're going to start there that's an easy don't stop at the because you have to go to starbucks to get there you're gna just skip it and so i think to myself as this thing continues to go down if the consumer continues to get weaker as inflation has cut into people's budgets what are they going to cut out first those types of things that's why i see home depot lows target and starbucks having the same store st sale declines but is that going to be the future forever i know about that let's see what analysts are thinking eps 367 growing to 644 okay healthy double- digit growth every year again just analysts and revenue two and a half seven and a half eight and a half 10 and a half 8% pretty solid revenue growth pretty solid revenue growth all right so what is starbucks worth to us now guys beyond just doing the the stock analyzer tool one of the things i want to accentuate on these on these videos is that these videos are a great precursor by looking at the numbers the deeper dive happens in the community the deeper dive goes in there but i want to urge you i personally don't believe in peeling back every layer of a company if you think too much about a company as big as starbucks i think you're going to talk yourself out of there's always a bad reason and always a good reason and the more you think about it the more you fall in love with the company you're going to sit there and whatever data you see is going to be a positive or negative depending on which viewpoint you want to have about the company and also be careful if a stock continues to fall don't just believe every story out there i just did that recently on on twitter where i talked about this just because news point news comes out about a company does not mean that information is relevant that's very important to understand let me go to extreme ceo gets diarrhea that day does that matter no of course it doesn't matter i i look at this and i hear all the time people will say things well yeah but did you know this and i'm like what is how is that relevant to the future of the business and they'll make some random statement i'm like that's relevant to and to me as a person who runs several businesses i realize there are certain things that really do matter and certain things that do not and be ready for that for all of these companies we're looking at any company look at the future difficult part about investing is when the stock falls even after you bought it to sit because when you don't own a stock you see the stock fall opportunity when you own the stock and it falls fear right mo so these are the things you have to be very aware of so mo what were your assumptions on starbucks for the revenue growth for the next 10 years so i did four six and eight i like yours more i did five seven and a half and 10 yeah but i like yours more i'm gonna do four six and eight now profit margin what' you do 10 and a half 11 and a half and 12 and a half so i did 10 and a half 12 and 13 and a half because the last 10 years i did 12.3 okay and i did the same thing but i did a little bit higher free cash flow on the on the tail end okay i did a lower on the low side a higher on the high side i did 10 12 14 okay pe what' you do i did 20 23 and 26 so it's funny i'm looking at this pe here of 17 20 22 and a half and i'm like is that enough i don't think so yeah this is a premium company so i'm gna change m as much as it is yeah so i'm gonna go 20 23 i'm gonna do 20 22 and a half and 25 so guys all we did here was say what's the what's the pe and price of free cash flow in 10 years if this company continues to establish itself and build its mode have a higher return invested capital you need to pay a premium and it's growing substantially yes but this is what makes investing in art everybody looks at it a different way there's probably somebody out there who says starbucks is dying and it's should be a 12 pe okay i don't know what the right answer is this is what makes investing so difficult but if you apply this process to all the investments you make you're probably going to do pretty well with it i don't know how well but it's about sitting there and

three stocks selling near their 52- we low remember it's a great place to start looking for value stock number one good old nike guys nike had an all-time high of aund and basically $180 per share back on november 5th of 2021 that is almost three years ago and nike is a great company but now since this fall's happened guess what's coming out bad news bad news bad news bad news i just got a tweet the other day that nike is dead and it's a dying company oh boy must we repeat this over and over news follows the stock price mo do you think nike is dead no i think they're far from it far from dead couple attributes that make me obviously realize this $112 billion market cap versus $125 billion of enterprise value that difference of 12 billion is their net debt guys they did 6.2 bilon ion dollar in free cash flow last year come on they can pay off that debt very quickly one of the things and we'll get into one of the companies next is debt levels if a company has low debt levels relative to their free cash flow it's hard to go bankrupt next if i asked a 100 people who the best shoe and athletic apparel company is in the world in the world how many are going to say nike first off half of china is gonna say nike because they work in their factories right see what i did there i did and they're 12 years old too soon too soon okay i'm personally interested in nike i own nike now remember don't buy a company just because somebody on the internet has it i'm here to teach a process i want you to be able to apply that process and thinking to your own investments when you invest in things you know and understand you are going to do a lot better and more importantly you're going to sleep better at night so let's see what the eight pillar story is about this company all right 5year pe seems a little rich but remember this is the net income part and it's pretty consistent here but on the fiveyear price of free cash flow 25 versus 22.8 but a big increase in the last year on that free cash flow so you think that fiveyear pe is too rich so i meant in terms of um richer than the fiveyear p the fiveyear um which one did you say either one so nike is a premium company that's what i'm saying nike has a high return on invested capital this means they get a good return on the money invest in their business and a lot of investors a lot of great investors look at this from mo status you need to pay more money for great companies with a high return invested capital so what mo here is saying and he brings up a great point is is 25 too high a multiple on the five-year basis on the one-year basis they're selling for 18 times free cash flow 21 times earnings if the market average is 15 is that really too much to pay for nike i don't think so i don't think so either i mean i would pay a premium for them absolutely i think your the old paul would have not paid a premium and would have missed out on great companies at great prices this is if you look at warren buffett back in 1987 started buying coke at 30 times earnings and he's made with dividends about 11 and a half or 12% a year since then pretty solid he paid up significantly but he bought a great company at a premium price all right now nike's only bought back 4% of their shares which i'm happy about yeah really because the stock has been high for a while relative to value think about it this way if the stock is down basically 60% in the last three years what was this pe what was this price of free cash flow on pe back then way higher 35 40 45 and people would have said and back then nike is a great company it's not going anywhere yada yada yada yada right i look at that saying okay now um return invested capital like we said is awesome lower deb levels awesome revenue growth of 10.3 billion led to $2.8 billion in more free cash flow guys i like this company a lot i really do analyst estimates has 378 per share this year going to 636 again it's analysts but guys i want to remind everyone here that if you choose to buy nike there is pretty much a 0% chance that you're just going to go straight up from the time you buy what i'm trying to teach everybody is that the brain power power needed to buy a stock is very little the stomach needed is huge peter lynch always says that you've got to be ready for nike stock to fall i personally hope it falls to 35 or 40 bucks as a dollar cost average down but if you're going to determine your success by the short-term price movements in a stock you're probably not an investor and that's okay just stick to long-term etfs lowcost long-term etfs you'll do great doing that but if you want to pick individual stocks it's really important that you be able to buy a stock and watch it decrease and get rid of the noise out there all the negativity and make a fundamental decision on these these are the conversations we have in our community to support each other during those times what is this oh and by the way the dying company analysts have not big growth one and a half one and a half six six and a half 5 and a half six i have a hard time believing nike is not going to grow with the world economy in the very least everybody wants nike everyone wants nike so let's go to stock analyzer tool what the last time i did nike in our stock analyzer tool april 16th 2024 okay remember this is not include the balance sheet and i'm doing a 10-year analysis revenue growth mo i did three five and seven i did two four six okay so a little bit more conservative but i don't blame him for that all right profit margin i did 10 11 12 and same with free cash flow um i did 9 and a half 10 and 10 and a half and i oh because it's been so consistent yeah but here's what my reason for going a little bit higher was direct sales to consumers they're getting they're doing more direct to the consumer higher margin that's true that's the reason i did that now pe look at my pe i did 20 23 and 26 i put that premium in there wow i 18 21 and 24 i kind of like yours though i think and by the way i can understand 18 21 and 24 especially if they do 7% revenue growth yeah and i look at this going guys it is a great company i do think it has staying power i would be absolutely floored if this company i love what warren buffett says he says i think to myself if i had hundred billion dollars could i compete with this company under armour is barely competing with the company never has really i i look at the saying guys hundred billion dollars i don't think i'm putting it i don't think i'm competing heavily with i mean yeah you're probably gonna put something out there but it's gonna be very difficult to overtake nike even though a 100 billion dollar check to fight him withas and reebok have been trying forever and they're the ones that replace adidas and rebok desire return 9% it's the market 9 or 10% this is just to find intrinsic value you need to put a margin of safety that's where you apply it here with a higher desired return mo i assume you did the same thing yep hit the analyze button all right guys i have a low price of 60 high price of 120 middle price of 86 looks pretty attractive and this returns here at the bottom are based on buying at today's price and these different categories occurring and this does include the dividend so that's nike for you stock number two this one's a controversial one i got lucky on this one walgreens now guys how did i get lucky on walgreens a few years ago i liked walgreens i sat there and said yeah this is this is a company i want to own i bought it and after a while it's going up and down after a while i started to notice i didn't like some attributes of it what were those attributes let me show you for one thing the return on invested capital was crap five years was 0.28 and the second thing was the amount of debt here market cap is 10 10 billion dollar enterprise value 76 billion with 2.2 billion five year average free cash flow too much debt i got lucky by selling it by selling it for a profit for a profit now keep in mind here i'm not saying this as some sort of humble rag i'm sitting there saying just because a stock is sold for a profit does not make you right just like just because you sold a stock for a loss does not make you wrong what's correct i was wrong on walgreens that's a flat out what i believe to be true i was wrong on walgreens and now it's kind of maybe out to be the case that i was wrong on walgreens i just got lucky because the market shifted the price up okay so i look at this company profit margin negative fiveyear profit margin negative gross profit margin 18.4% they slashed 8,000 locations that's insane that's absolutely crazy now with all those i don't know now the question we had before we made this video was would we be surprised if walgreens was gone gone in 5 or 10 years i still think i'd be surprised i think this company's being priced for bankruptcy if you want to make a play on this company i think it's very interesting because the negativity around it is insane this is the lowest price since may 1st 1997 yeah and you see their uh dividend yield 14.7% what are the chances they keep this dividend going they can't i don't think they're going to be able to do that free cash flow they don't have the cash flow to do it i think before you make an investment in walgreens you really got to understand the balance sheet the company and what they're doing to turnaround you really have to believe in it i do not believe this is for the faint of heart mo what are analysts doing right now what are what are their assumptions on walgreens they're actually pricing in growth still so september 2024 $326 c per share end of 20 mid 2028 $433 c per share wow and then for revenue going from 146.760 a5 billion august of 20 28 if you believe this company's gna be around for the foreseeable future and eventually get the profitable again right now i think you got to take i think you got to really figure about this one yeah now guys if you want to look at walgreens i'm sure there are people in our community talking about it this might be worth it enough for you to take a look and i don't know if you guys notice if you've looked at our page on the before we have limited daily spots for the everything money community and software and the reason we did that is because a software as it is today includes everything having to do with retirement stocks and real estate all these tools right here now we're going to be making some of these changes behind the scenes so in the near future that offer is absolutely going to go away as we've been interviewing our users our community members the feedback we've been getting is that they want to focus themselves on specific aspects of everything money tools that apply to them at that moment in time they don't want too many options they don't want to be the cheesecake factory and we don't want to be the cheesecake factory of software and if you've been watching the channel for a while you'll remember that originally i built the software selfishly for myself and my team so that we could use it to constantly make the right and better decisions for stocks real estate and retirement but the channel has been fairly fortunate to grow very fast and our community has grown extremely fast so it has to become less about me and more about how i can better serve you and the community members the good news is we have not made those changes yet so if you join today if you click the link in the description below you will be grandfathered in for life with all of the tools all of these tools right here and this is absolutely going to be the best offer we're ever going to give ever i'm telling you this now because there's still time to get all of these tools if you click the link below join the em community today before we make these changes you'll be able to get all these tools even after the changes are made so click the link in the description below get the offer it'll be the best decision you've made all year so what's walgreens worth mo i think this is going to be incredible when was the last time we did wba um mine's definitely been a while so i'm going to change some things here i'm going to factor in -20 and 2% revenue growth because i want to go a little bit crazier here they've shut down 8,000 locations that's going to be a lot um profit margin i went back to 1.75 2.25 and 2.75 and since their free cash flow is higher i did 2.53 and 3.5 how does that sound good i'm about the same about the same now look at their pe i put 10 12 and a half and 15 because i do think if they can get back to this level they should be a market average kind of company but i think it's going to take time now i'm going to put my i mean this is before i didn't did 9% across the board actually i can understand somebody saying hey pe should be8 10 and 12 but i'm sitting here doing this with a 9% return across the board look at this low price of 26 to 38 a high price of 66 to middle price of 40 to 55 huge potential returns here but you've got to be right yeah but is this one of those situations where you put a little bit of money into it i don't know i have to think about that myself i'm actually gonna have dalton our inhouse analyst who's very active in the community and if you're in our community please go chat with him about this i might take a look at walgreens for no other reason then i do think they're being priced for bankruptcy i don't think this is a faint of heart deal though i think whatever money i'm going to put in this i'm just going to assume it's going to be gone if i do any money at all i even put 20% margin of safety 15 on the low 30 in the mid 50 on the high that's a 20% margin of safety that's incredible so these are the things that make software so much better because if you looked at this you'd be like oh i'm gonna ignore walgreens but then when you see this what does it tell you i need to do more research because this is too much to ignore does it mean this is going to work no this is a company that has a lot of problems right now and these problems are not fake problems they are acknowledging we're closing 8,000 stores that's an acknowledgement that we have issues they have a lot of debt but it might be something that i might even buy long-term calls on and say listen it's all or none let's say i buy these calls and if it hits awesome it doesn't doesn't but it's got to be part of your investment thesis stock number three starbucks now first now guys i did this twitter poll if you want to follow me at em paul g now at first we were talking about doing mcdonald's but as you can see people were most interested in nike not as many 7.3% won walgreens this is only a two-hour poll i got 275 votes thank you if you voted but 33% wanted mcdonald's but some of the comments made a comment about starbucks listen you should be looking at starbucks more at first i wasn't going to do that because we done a video about you know a few weeks ago on starbucks but when people commented i brought it up to tim tim said yeah let's do starbucks but look at this everybody's interested in nike why nike's down over 60% i want to give you guys a comment i don't think nike is done going down does that mean it will go down from here no but you there's a lot of negative sentiment that's growing on nike and as that price continues to fall the negative sentiment will probably grow with it just like we saw with walgreens as the stock continue to fall the negative sentiment keeps on going so starbucks another company that's off considerably from its all-time high 126 all-time high versus 72 today all right so it's not as big a drop as as nike but it's still sizable and was around the same time july of 2021 a few months before nike's high so we're looking at this going okay now what's the deal with starbucks now i had a great comment from somebody on twitter one of my great followers and he said paul my wife and i don't even like starbucks we have four kids they love starbucks i'm like what he goes yeah i have no idea how that happened he's like but they love starbucks and whenever we go out they're begging me for starbucks and i'm like oh that's pretty interesting interesting everybody i know loves starbucks i know people who have starbucks twice a day it's an incredible legalized drug it's awesome good for them 38,000 locations worldwide they have a dividend which i'm not a huge fan of because this dividend is 3% but it eats up two and a half billion of their four billion last year in free cash flow in the 5year average of 2.76 they're selling for about 20 times free cash flow and 20 times pe do i think starbucks is a premium company yep absolutely mo mo what do you think i'm not going to did you look don't what do you think their roic is oh i i didn't look um 20 53 last year 47 for the 5year average wow this is what we call a moe wow mo what's apples can you pull up apple in our software and see what the fiveyear um return invested capital is guys starbucks is a moat any how many coffee companies have come out in the last 40 years and they can't compete with starbucks 42.3 it's higher roic higher return on the money that's invested in the business than even apple than even apple that tells you a lot and i think that this is the kind of company that you want to pay attention to as it starts to fall because would you be shocked if starbucks was gone in five or 10 years absolutely absolutely absolutely so let's see what the eight pillars are saying about starbucks buy back a lot of shares okay a lot of debt here yeah why um leases yeah stores real estate leases stores exactly not buying back a lot of shares hopefully they turn that around if starbucks hypothetically fell 30 or 40% from here they wouldn't do this but i want them to cancel this dividend and buy back shares they would probably juice up the dividend but guys that's the key here we want if you're new to our channel the big key is we want companies using their cash to buy back cheap shares not any shares that's why i'm glad that they haven't bought back a ton of shares okay in the last 10 year last five years the revenue is up about 10 billion it's led to $3 billion in extra free cash flow and $800 $ million in extra net income okay so overall it just feels like it's probably a valuation issue but again this fiveyear number might not be the one we have to care about is it still growing are there attributes to this company that keep getting better same store sales at starbucks are declining same with home depot same with lows same with target i believe another indication the consumer is getting weaker this would be a luxury item for a lot of consumers a $7 coffee ain't cheap right so if you're going to cut something back what are you going to cut out you're going to start there i think you're going to start there that's an easy don't stop at the because you have to go to starbucks to get there you're gna just skip it and so i think to myself as this thing continues to go down if the consumer continues to get weaker as inflation has cut into people's budgets what are they going to cut out first those types of things that's why i see home depot lows target and starbucks having the same store st sale declines but is that going to be the future forever i know about that let's see what analysts are thinking eps 367 growing to 644 okay healthy double- digit growth every year again just analysts and revenue two and a half seven and a half eight and a half 10 and a half 8% pretty solid revenue growth pretty solid revenue growth all right so what is starbucks worth to us now guys beyond just doing the the stock analyzer tool one of the things i want to accentuate on these on these videos is that these videos are a great precursor by looking at the numbers the deeper dive happens in the community the deeper dive goes in there but i want to urge you i personally don't believe in peeling back every layer of a company if you think too much about a company as big as starbucks i think you're going to talk yourself out of there's always a bad reason and always a good reason and the more you think about it the more you fall in love with the company you're going to sit there and whatever data you see is going to be a positive or negative depending on which viewpoint you want to have about the company and also be careful if a stock continues to fall don't just believe every story out there i just did that recently on on twitter where i talked about this just because news point news comes out about a company does not mean that information is relevant that's very important to understand let me go to extreme ceo gets diarrhea that day does that matter no of course it doesn't matter i i look at this and i hear all the time people will say things well yeah but did you know this and i'm like what is how is that relevant to the future of the business and they'll make some random statement i'm like that's relevant to and to me as a person who runs several businesses i realize there are certain things that really do matter and certain things that do not and be ready for that for all of these companies we're looking at any company look at the future difficult part about investing is when the stock falls even after you bought it to sit because when you don't own a stock you see the stock fall opportunity when you own the stock and it falls fear right mo so these are the things you have to be very aware of so mo what were your assumptions on starbucks for the revenue growth for the next 10 years so i did four six and eight i like yours more i did five seven and a half and 10 yeah but i like yours more i'm gonna do four six and eight now profit margin what' you do 10 and a half 11 and a half and 12 and a half so i did 10 and a half 12 and 13 and a half because the last 10 years i did 12.3 okay and i did the same thing but i did a little bit higher free cash flow on the on the tail end okay i did a lower on the low side a higher on the high side i did 10 12 14 okay pe what' you do i did 20 23 and 26 so it's funny i'm looking at this pe here of 17 20 22 and a half and i'm like is that enough i don't think so yeah this is a premium company so i'm gna change m as much as it is yeah so i'm gonna go 20 23 i'm gonna do 20 22 and a half and 25 so guys all we did here was say what's the what's the pe and price of free cash flow in 10 years if this company continues to establish itself and build its mode have a higher return invested capital you need to pay a premium and it's growing substantially yes but this is what makes investing in art everybody looks at it a different way there's probably somebody out there who says starbucks is dying and it's should be a 12 pe okay i don't know what the right answer is this is what makes investing so difficult but if you apply this process to all the investments you make you're probably going to do pretty well with it i don't know how well but it's about sitting there and

three stocks selling near their 52- we low remember it's a great place to start looking for value stock number one good old nike guys nike had an all-time high of aund and basically $180 per share back on november 5th of 2021 that is almost three years ago and nike is a great company but now since this fall's happened guess what's coming out bad news bad news bad news bad news i just got a tweet the other day that nike is dead and it's a dying company oh boy must we repeat this over and over news follows the stock price mo do you think nike is dead no i think they're far from it far from dead couple attributes that make me obviously realize this $112 billion market cap versus $125 billion of enterprise value that difference of 12 billion is their net debt guys they did 6.2 bilon ion dollar in free cash flow last year come on they can pay off that debt very quickly one of the things and we'll get into one of the companies next is debt levels if a company has low debt levels relative to their free cash flow it's hard to go bankrupt next if i asked a 100 people who the best shoe and athletic apparel company is in the world in the world how many are going to say nike first off half of china is gonna say nike because they work in their factories right see what i did there i did and they're 12 years old too soon too soon okay i'm personally interested in nike i own nike now remember don't buy a company just because somebody on the internet has it i'm here to teach a process i want you to be able to apply that process and thinking to your own investments when you invest in things you know and understand you are going to do a lot better and more importantly you're going to sleep better at night so let's see what the eight pillar story is about this company all right 5year pe seems a little rich but remember this is the net income part and it's pretty consistent here but on the fiveyear price of free cash flow 25 versus 22.8 but a big increase in the last year on that free cash flow so you think that fiveyear pe is too rich so i meant in terms of um richer than the fiveyear p the fiveyear um which one did you say either one so nike is a premium company that's what i'm saying nike has a high return on invested capital this means they get a good return on the money invest in their business and a lot of investors a lot of great investors look at this from mo status you need to pay more money for great companies with a high return invested capital so what mo here is saying and he brings up a great point is is 25 too high a multiple on the five-year basis on the one-year basis they're selling for 18 times free cash flow 21 times earnings if the market average is 15 is that really too much to pay for nike i don't think so i don't think so either i mean i would pay a premium for them absolutely i think your the old paul would have not paid a premium and would have missed out on great companies at great prices this is if you look at warren buffett back in 1987 started buying coke at 30 times earnings and he's made with dividends about 11 and a half or 12% a year since then pretty solid he paid up significantly but he bought a great company at a premium price all right now nike's only bought back 4% of their shares which i'm happy about yeah really because the stock has been high for a while relative to value think about it this way if the stock is down basically 60% in the last three years what was this pe what was this price of free cash flow on pe back then way higher 35 40 45 and people would have said and back then nike is a great company it's not going anywhere yada yada yada yada right i look at that saying okay now um return invested capital like we said is awesome lower deb levels awesome revenue growth of 10.3 billion led to $2.8 billion in more free cash flow guys i like this company a lot i really do analyst estimates has 378 per share this year going to 636 again it's analysts but guys i want to remind everyone here that if you choose to buy nike there is pretty much a 0% chance that you're just going to go straight up from the time you buy what i'm trying to teach everybody is that the brain power power needed to buy a stock is very little the stomach needed is huge peter lynch always says that you've got to be ready for nike stock to fall i personally hope it falls to 35 or 40 bucks as a dollar cost average down but if you're going to determine your success by the short-term price movements in a stock you're probably not an investor and that's okay just stick to long-term etfs lowcost long-term etfs you'll do great doing that but if you want to pick individual stocks it's really important that you be able to buy a stock and watch it decrease and get rid of the noise out there all the negativity and make a fundamental decision on these these are the conversations we have in our community to support each other during those times what is this oh and by the way the dying company analysts have not big growth one and a half one and a half six six and a half 5 and a half six i have a hard time believing nike is not going to grow with the world economy in the very least everybody wants nike everyone wants nike so let's go to stock analyzer tool what the last time i did nike in our stock analyzer tool april 16th 2024 okay remember this is not include the balance sheet and i'm doing a 10-year analysis revenue growth mo i did three five and seven i did two four six okay so a little bit more conservative but i don't blame him for that all right profit margin i did 10 11 12 and same with free cash flow um i did 9 and a half 10 and 10 and a half and i oh because it's been so consistent yeah but here's what my reason for going a little bit higher was direct sales to consumers they're getting they're doing more direct to the consumer higher margin that's true that's the reason i did that now pe look at my pe i did 20 23 and 26 i put that premium in there wow i 18 21 and 24 i kind of like yours though i think and by the way i can understand 18 21 and 24 especially if they do 7% revenue growth yeah and i look at this going guys it is a great company i do think it has staying power i would be absolutely floored if this company i love what warren buffett says he says i think to myself if i had hundred billion dollars could i compete with this company under armour is barely competing with the company never has really i i look at the saying guys hundred billion dollars i don't think i'm putting it i don't think i'm competing heavily with i mean yeah you're probably gonna put something out there but it's gonna be very difficult to overtake nike even though a 100 billion dollar check to fight him withas and reebok have been trying forever and they're the ones that replace adidas and rebok desire return 9% it's the market 9 or 10% this is just to find intrinsic value you need to put a margin of safety that's where you apply it here with a higher desired return mo i assume you did the same thing yep hit the analyze button all right guys i have a low price of 60 high price of 120 middle price of 86 looks pretty attractive and this returns here at the bottom are based on buying at today's price and these different categories occurring and this does include the dividend so that's nike for you stock number two this one's a controversial one i got lucky on this one walgreens now guys how did i get lucky on walgreens a few years ago i liked walgreens i sat there and said yeah this is this is a company i want to own i bought it and after a while it's going up and down after a while i started to notice i didn't like some attributes of it what were those attributes let me show you for one thing the return on invested capital was crap five years was 0.28 and the second thing was the amount of debt here market cap is 10 10 billion dollar enterprise value 76 billion with 2.2 billion five year average free cash flow too much debt i got lucky by selling it by selling it for a profit for a profit now keep in mind here i'm not saying this as some sort of humble rag i'm sitting there saying just because a stock is sold for a profit does not make you right just like just because you sold a stock for a loss does not make you wrong what's correct i was wrong on walgreens that's a flat out what i believe to be true i was wrong on walgreens and now it's kind of maybe out to be the case that i was wrong on walgreens i just got lucky because the market shifted the price up okay so i look at this company profit margin negative fiveyear profit margin negative gross profit margin 18.4% they slashed 8,000 locations that's insane that's absolutely crazy now with all those i don't know now the question we had before we made this video was would we be surprised if walgreens was gone gone in 5 or 10 years i still think i'd be surprised i think this company's being priced for bankruptcy if you want to make a play on this company i think it's very interesting because the negativity around it is insane this is the lowest price since may 1st 1997 yeah and you see their uh dividend yield 14.7% what are the chances they keep this dividend going they can't i don't think they're going to be able to do that free cash flow they don't have the cash flow to do it i think before you make an investment in walgreens you really got to understand the balance sheet the company and what they're doing to turnaround you really have to believe in it i do not believe this is for the faint of heart mo what are analysts doing right now what are what are their assumptions on walgreens they're actually pricing in growth still so september 2024 $326 c per share end of 20 mid 2028 $433 c per share wow and then for revenue going from 146.760 a5 billion august of 20 28 if you believe this company's gna be around for the foreseeable future and eventually get the profitable again right now i think you got to take i think you got to really figure about this one yeah now guys if you want to look at walgreens i'm sure there are people in our community talking about it this might be worth it enough for you to take a look and i don't know if you guys notice if you've looked at our page on the before we have limited daily spots for the everything money community and software and the reason we did that is because a software as it is today includes everything having to do with retirement stocks and real estate all these tools right here now we're going to be making some of these changes behind the scenes so in the near future that offer is absolutely going to go away as we've been interviewing our users our community members the feedback we've been getting is that they want to focus themselves on specific aspects of everything money tools that apply to them at that moment in time they don't want too many options they don't want to be the cheesecake factory and we don't want to be the cheesecake factory of software and if you've been watching the channel for a while you'll remember that originally i built the software selfishly for myself and my team so that we could use it to constantly make the right and better decisions for stocks real estate and retirement but the channel has been fairly fortunate to grow very fast and our community has grown extremely fast so it has to become less about me and more about how i can better serve you and the community members the good news is we have not made those changes yet so if you join today if you click the link in the description below you will be grandfathered in for life with all of the tools all of these tools right here and this is absolutely going to be the best offer we're ever going to give ever i'm telling you this now because there's still time to get all of these tools if you click the link below join the em community today before we make these changes you'll be able to get all these tools even after the changes are made so click the link in the description below get the offer it'll be the best decision you've made all year so what's walgreens worth mo i think this is going to be incredible when was the last time we did wba um mine's definitely been a while so i'm going to change some things here i'm going to factor in -20 and 2% revenue growth because i want to go a little bit crazier here they've shut down 8,000 locations that's going to be a lot um profit margin i went back to 1.75 2.25 and 2.75 and since their free cash flow is higher i did 2.53 and 3.5 how does that sound good i'm about the same about the same now look at their pe i put 10 12 and a half and 15 because i do think if they can get back to this level they should be a market average kind of company but i think it's going to take time now i'm going to put my i mean this is before i didn't did 9% across the board actually i can understand somebody saying hey pe should be8 10 and 12 but i'm sitting here doing this with a 9% return across the board look at this low price of 26 to 38 a high price of 66 to middle price of 40 to 55 huge potential returns here but you've got to be right yeah but is this one of those situations where you put a little bit of money into it i don't know i have to think about that myself i'm actually gonna have dalton our inhouse analyst who's very active in the community and if you're in our community please go chat with him about this i might take a look at walgreens for no other reason then i do think they're being priced for bankruptcy i don't think this is a faint of heart deal though i think whatever money i'm going to put in this i'm just going to assume it's going to be gone if i do any money at all i even put 20% margin of safety 15 on the low 30 in the mid 50 on the high that's a 20% margin of safety that's incredible so these are the things that make software so much better because if you looked at this you'd be like oh i'm gonna ignore walgreens but then when you see this what does it tell you i need to do more research because this is too much to ignore does it mean this is going to work no this is a company that has a lot of problems right now and these problems are not fake problems they are acknowledging we're closing 8,000 stores that's an acknowledgement that we have issues they have a lot of debt but it might be something that i might even buy long-term calls on and say listen it's all or none let's say i buy these calls and if it hits awesome it doesn't doesn't but it's got to be part of your investment thesis stock number three starbucks now first now guys i did this twitter poll if you want to follow me at em paul g now at first we were talking about doing mcdonald's but as you can see people were most interested in nike not as many 7.3% won walgreens this is only a two-hour poll i got 275 votes thank you if you voted but 33% wanted mcdonald's but some of the comments made a comment about starbucks listen you should be looking at starbucks more at first i wasn't going to do that because we done a video about you know a few weeks ago on starbucks but when people commented i brought it up to tim tim said yeah let's do starbucks but look at this everybody's interested in nike why nike's down over 60% i want to give you guys a comment i don't think nike is done going down does that mean it will go down from here no but you there's a lot of negative sentiment that's growing on nike and as that price continues to fall the negative sentiment will probably grow with it just like we saw with walgreens as the stock continue to fall the negative sentiment keeps on going so starbucks another company that's off considerably from its all-time high 126 all-time high versus 72 today all right so it's not as big a drop as as nike but it's still sizable and was around the same time july of 2021 a few months before nike's high so we're looking at this going okay now what's the deal with starbucks now i had a great comment from somebody on twitter one of my great followers and he said paul my wife and i don't even like starbucks we have four kids they love starbucks i'm like what he goes yeah i have no idea how that happened he's like but they love starbucks and whenever we go out they're begging me for starbucks and i'm like oh that's pretty interesting interesting everybody i know loves starbucks i know people who have starbucks twice a day it's an incredible legalized drug it's awesome good for them 38,000 locations worldwide they have a dividend which i'm not a huge fan of because this dividend is 3% but it eats up two and a half billion of their four billion last year in free cash flow in the 5year average of 2.76 they're selling for about 20 times free cash flow and 20 times pe do i think starbucks is a premium company yep absolutely mo mo what do you think i'm not going to did you look don't what do you think their roic is oh i i didn't look um 20 53 last year 47 for the 5year average wow this is what we call a moe wow mo what's apples can you pull up apple in our software and see what the fiveyear um return invested capital is guys starbucks is a moat any how many coffee companies have come out in the last 40 years and they can't compete with starbucks 42.3 it's higher roic higher return on the money that's invested in the business than even apple than even apple that tells you a lot and i think that this is the kind of company that you want to pay attention to as it starts to fall because would you be shocked if starbucks was gone in five or 10 years absolutely absolutely absolutely so let's see what the eight pillars are saying about starbucks buy back a lot of shares okay a lot of debt here yeah why um leases yeah stores real estate leases stores exactly not buying back a lot of shares hopefully they turn that around if starbucks hypothetically fell 30 or 40% from here they wouldn't do this but i want them to cancel this dividend and buy back shares they would probably juice up the dividend but guys that's the key here we want if you're new to our channel the big key is we want companies using their cash to buy back cheap shares not any shares that's why i'm glad that they haven't bought back a ton of shares okay in the last 10 year last five years the revenue is up about 10 billion it's led to $3 billion in extra free cash flow and $800 $ million in extra net income okay so overall it just feels like it's probably a valuation issue but again this fiveyear number might not be the one we have to care about is it still growing are there attributes to this company that keep getting better same store sales at starbucks are declining same with home depot same with lows same with target i believe another indication the consumer is getting weaker this would be a luxury item for a lot of consumers a $7 coffee ain't cheap right so if you're going to cut something back what are you going to cut out you're going to start there i think you're going to start there that's an easy don't stop at the because you have to go to starbucks to get there you're gna just skip it and so i think to myself as this thing continues to go down if the consumer continues to get weaker as inflation has cut into people's budgets what are they going to cut out first those types of things that's why i see home depot lows target and starbucks having the same store st sale declines but is that going to be the future forever i know about that let's see what analysts are thinking eps 367 growing to 644 okay healthy double- digit growth every year again just analysts and revenue two and a half seven and a half eight and a half 10 and a half 8% pretty solid revenue growth pretty solid revenue growth all right so what is starbucks worth to us now guys beyond just doing the the stock analyzer tool one of the things i want to accentuate on these on these videos is that these videos are a great precursor by looking at the numbers the deeper dive happens in the community the deeper dive goes in there but i want to urge you i personally don't believe in peeling back every layer of a company if you think too much about a company as big as starbucks i think you're going to talk yourself out of there's always a bad reason and always a good reason and the more you think about it the more you fall in love with the company you're going to sit there and whatever data you see is going to be a positive or negative depending on which viewpoint you want to have about the company and also be careful if a stock continues to fall don't just believe every story out there i just did that recently on on twitter where i talked about this just because news point news comes out about a company does not mean that information is relevant that's very important to understand let me go to extreme ceo gets diarrhea that day does that matter no of course it doesn't matter i i look at this and i hear all the time people will say things well yeah but did you know this and i'm like what is how is that relevant to the future of the business and they'll make some random statement i'm like that's relevant to and to me as a person who runs several businesses i realize there are certain things that really do matter and certain things that do not and be ready for that for all of these companies we're looking at any company look at the future difficult part about investing is when the stock falls even after you bought it to sit because when you don't own a stock you see the stock fall opportunity when you own the stock and it falls fear right mo so these are the things you have to be very aware of so mo what were your assumptions on starbucks for the revenue growth for the next 10 years so i did four six and eight i like yours more i did five seven and a half and 10 yeah but i like yours more i'm gonna do four six and eight now profit margin what' you do 10 and a half 11 and a half and 12 and a half so i did 10 and a half 12 and 13 and a half because the last 10 years i did 12.3 okay and i did the same thing but i did a little bit higher free cash flow on the on the tail end okay i did a lower on the low side a higher on the high side i did 10 12 14 okay pe what' you do i did 20 23 and 26 so it's funny i'm looking at this pe here of 17 20 22 and a half and i'm like is that enough i don't think so yeah this is a premium company so i'm gna change m as much as it is yeah so i'm gonna go 20 23 i'm gonna do 20 22 and a half and 25 so guys all we did here was say what's the what's the pe and price of free cash flow in 10 years if this company continues to establish itself and build its mode have a higher return invested capital you need to pay a premium and it's growing substantially yes but this is what makes investing in art everybody looks at it a different way there's probably somebody out there who says starbucks is dying and it's should be a 12 pe okay i don't know what the right answer is this is what makes investing so difficult but if you apply this process to all the investments you make you're probably going to do pretty well with it i don't know how well but it's about sitting there and
