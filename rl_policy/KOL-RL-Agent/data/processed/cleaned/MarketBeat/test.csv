the stock market but could 2025 be even better here to talk about the year in review and a look ahead at what investors can expect in the new year is market beat analyst chris marot chris how is 2024 coming to a close for the market even with the slight pullback that we're seeing here in these last few trading days of the year the s&amp;p 500 is still up about 23% for the year uh the dow and the nasdaq are both positive so it's been a good year for stocks despite this volatility that we're seeing at the end of the year what were some of the reasons for all of the growth in 2024 what it really come down to as far as i was concerned is it came down to earnings growth companies in 2023 uh reacted to the interest rate hikes by the federal reserve and they made tactical decisions such as layoffs and other cost cutting measures and so many companies beat earnings estimates for the year the companies that beat the earnings estimates their stocks generally went up the stocks that didn't be thurning estimates their stocks generally were flat or went slightly down well two industries in particular had a really great 2024 one of course ai the other the gp1s ai performed in 20124 a lot like it did in 2023 um investors were a little bit more selective about these stocks but still generally anything that had an ai theme associated to it did very well and as far as the gop1 drugs we've se seen a little bit of weakness kind of coming towards the end of the year as um analysts are starting to look at the data that these companies are putting out on how effective these drugs are you're starting to see maybe a clear leader in eli lily but nova nordics is still a strong contender of this category and the reason why i think it still might be a strong sector going into 2025 is that you still see a lot of these biofarma companies making commitments to have gop1 drugs on the market so certainly they don't think this market's going away well that's a look back at 2024 which again a very strong year for the market but many analysts are expecting 2025 to be perhaps an even stronger year for investors since 1926 the s&amp;p 500 has delivered a positive return 73% of the time so that basically tells you 34s of the time you can bet that the s&amp;p 500 is going to have a a positive year um and over that time the index delivered a double digit return 60% of the time so again just based on that probability you would think the market's probably going to have a pretty good year next year but that math is also supported by the trend in the macroeconomic environment and that is instead of seeing inflation tick higher you're seeing the rate of inflation generally speaking moving lower and you're seeing interest rates move lower although maybe not as fast as some investors would like there's some indicators and some analysts are expecting maybe inflation and the economic factors to even improve more with a new administration starting next year we don't know specifically what the policies from the trump administration are going to be but we do have the broad strokes and the broad strokes is going to be lowering corporate taxes which would be bullish for stocks they're going to be pushing for less regulation which will be bullish for stocks and also potentially for m&amp;a activity and you know we you've also got this doge committee which is again we don't exactly know what the specifics of that committee are going to be but any steps that could be taken to reduce government spending would be bullish for stocks yeah chris you've put together a list of four sectors you expect to take off in 2025 before we get to your list take a look at this free report that lists 10 specific stocks expected to take off in 2025 scan the qr code or check out the link in the description to take a look at that free report on 10 stocks expected to take off in 2025 now chris let's get to your list of four sectors you expect to see a lot of growth this year so not surprisingly um technology stocks are going to i think still be very strong in 2025 ai is going to remain a hot theme although we may be starting to see a transition ition more into what i call ai 2.0 and that is you're going to start seeing it move maybe a little bit away from the hardware side like nvidia and towards the software side to companies that can actually show how to monetize ai however i also do think this is going to be a strong year for semiconductors because the build out of ai is still happening in terms of data centers and um just companies needing the hardware to do their own ai applications speaking of ai build outs i think that's another sector that you said to watch for and that's what it takes to run those centers you know utility stocks tend to be pretty boring investments for a lot of investors 2025 can be an exception that because we we're going to need a lot of power for these data centers and that just one reason to believe in addition to updating our own electrical grid and other factors that 2025 could be a strong year for utility stocks what are some other sectors that you're looking ahead for in 2025 two other picks be industrials now this is one that has a little bit of nuance to it because much of the infrastructure spending has gone out from the infrastructure bill signed in 2022 i believe however there are contracts that are in place and that those contracts run through 2025 so even though there might be a a push to curb government spending some of that money is contractually obligated i believe so i think 2025 is still going to be a good year for some of those industrial companies i that are tasked with rebuilding our nation's infrastructure so that might be one area for investors to look and another area would be energy uh the trump administration has made us energy independence a priority we talked about it being a strong sector in 20124 that didn't work out that way but i believe in 2025 um oil stocks energy stocks in general are going to be a strong part of the trade some good information for people to think about as they look towards their investment plans for 202 5 and looking back at celebrating a good year in 2024 thanks again for your time chris and we are hoping that all of you have a wonderful year in the stock market coming up in 2025 thanks again for joining us here on market beat we hope you'll stick with us throughout the new year as well as always happy investing [music] oh,eli lilly,0.9,0.8

insiders are buying these stocks going into the new year here with his list of three stocks insiders can't stop buying is market beed analyst thomas hughes thomas there are quite a few inside buys happening right now let's first talk about what are inside buys insider buys are buys by any person individual or institution that qualifies under sec rules that typically means executives ceo cfo vice presidents anybody with inside knowledge of the business's operations that might not be made public also institutions and analysts and even to a degree uh congress people because they do have some insight or knowledge not necessarily of the business but of conditions that the businesses are operating in but what we're looking at are the buys of people who have insider knowledge or knowledge that is not readily available to other portions of the investment community and how are you finding this information is there a tool on market beat that can help market beat has tons of tools to find information about these things uh the tool that i use specifically today was um the insider buying tracker and uh the tracking the tracking page will track um stocks that are being bought by insiders but also specifically stocks that are being bought just by ceos now that tool can also help you track which stocks insiders are abandoning we have a free special report right now that shows 12 stocks corporate insiders are abandoning scan the qr code or click the link in the description to check out that free report and see which 12 stocks corporate insiders are abandoning most right now let's start out with your first pick of 2025 which is the biggest insider by stock that you have right now vesus is the most bought by insiders for the last year vesus is a spin-off from aramark it's their uniform business um now it's a standalone company it's competing with unifirst and centos it's about the same size as unifirst it's about a sixth size of centos um one of the opportunities here is that it's a potential takeover candidate so what does that mean for the growth of the stock price some the chatter is that the stock is about 15 to 25% undervalued relative to a potential takeover price not counting that potential for takeover uh this company this industry is well positioned for cash and cash flow if you look at centos it's been producing really awesome cash flow for about three decades uses that money to pay dividends buy back shares that stock price has been going just pretty much straight up as as straight up as it possibly can be invest is in that that that group it's been improving its balance sheet and preparing itself for capital returns it already pays a nice dividend but what i see here is the potential for share buybacks to begin sometime soon if it's not taken over or taken private and what kind of insider buys are we seeing with vesus so vesus has nine insiders that have been buying for the last year they've made more than a dozen purchases they've been pretty regular throughout the year and they're pretty widespread it shows a pretty good amount of conviction within this group that the stock is worth buying i think you have put vesus as a pretty solid buy for investors right now but your second pick of a stock that insiders are buying is a little bit more of a wild card yeah it is opco health it has quite a few potential catalysts coming up one of them is potential for takeover it's also got a couple of candidates or um drug therapies that have been gaining traction they're making some revenue uh but the real problem with this stock is that it's not making money and even with these new positive developments it's going to be a while before it's profitable its balance sheet is not in the greatest condition it's had to sell a lot of shares over the last year to raise capital so ution is a real threat so in this case the insiders buying is a vote of confidence but it could also just be them trying to support the stock price in the interim until one of these other catalysts can start taking control of the market yeah that's definitely a risk sometime with these insider buys is is it just trying to support the stock more who are the insiders buying the stock well like with vest it's it's a wide range of insiders we're tracking seven insiders whove made 24 purchases in the last year so they've all made more than one buy they are certainly showing a high amount of conviction in the stock but there are some significant risks that investors need to keep in mind yeah let's talk about what kind of growth potential this stock could have what are analysts saying the analysts see um quite a bit of upside potential the stock could rise 30 to 40% if we get one of those catalysts uh but as i said it just depends on if it gains enough traction to start making money soon enough for the market to stay interested let's move on to your third pick of insider buys this is a company we haven't covered before no this is gri uh they're an indust industrial packaging company so they make things like jerry cans and plastic barrels and oil cans and other services involved with storing industrial products so who are the insiders buying this stock and why are they buying it a wide variety of insiders making numerous purchases over the past year um they are certainly helping to support the stock price um if you look at the chart you can see it's been range bound for about two years but it's got a pretty solid floor and that floor is put in place by the insiders but also by the institutions and the analyst who can be considered insiders uh they've both been buying the stock the analysts are pretty bullish on it and they see it rising about 30% uh that aligns with the trading range so it looks like this stock could hit a bottom fairly soon and start rebounding how can investors time this kind of a stock buy well you're going to want to watch the charts you're going to want to pick out some pretty good technical entry points and then wait for the market to reach those points and to start showing a signal that signal will be shown in the price action and the indicators and it should align with a bottom and a bit of a rebound you're going to want to see some volume also in this move to help solidify the the bottom and to help add some strength to the market and provide some more upside momentum once the the price starts to move higher and you've already mentioned some of the risk but let's talk to investors any of these three picks or looking at any stocks that insiders are buying right now what are the potential risks or benefits so there certainly are a lot of benefits to following the insider trades uh there's not a lot lot of reasons for an executive to want to buy a stock if the company's doing badly so even in the case where the insiders might be trying to support the price action there's is still a bit of a um an affirmation in the company's outlook for them to be buying uh so the real risk is that you look at companies with insiders buying that don't really have the fundamental outlook for growth or for business strength that uh that a good investment would have so like any indicator you're going to want to use the insider buying as a starting off point for your investment research but then go from there and look at the other fundamental factors that make a good investment and if those things um align then it's probably going to be a pretty good buy some good advice for investors as always thomas thank you so much for your time today and for sharing these three picks of big insider buy stocks right now thanks again for joining us here on market beat as always happy investing especially in the new year [music],vesus,1.0,0.8

make a good investment and if those things um align then it's probably going to be a pretty good buy some good advice for investors as always thomas thank you so much for your time today and for

insiders are buying these stocks going into the new year here with his list of three stocks insiders can't stop buying is market beed analyst thomas hughes thomas there are quite a few inside buys happening right now let's first talk about what are inside buys insider buys are buys by any person individual or institution that qualifies under sec rules that typically means executives ceo cfo vice presidents anybody with inside knowledge of the business's operations that might not be made public also institutions and analysts and even to a degree uh congress people because they do have some insight or knowledge not necessarily of the business but of conditions that the businesses are operating in but what we're looking at are the buys of people who have insider knowledge or knowledge that is not readily available to other portions of the investment community and how are you finding this information is there a tool on market beat that can help market beat has tons of tools to find information about these things uh the tool that i use specifically today was um the insider buying tracker and uh the tracking the tracking page will track um stocks that are being bought by insiders but also specifically stocks that are being bought just by ceos now that tool can also help you track which stocks insiders are abandoning we have a free special report right now that shows 12 stocks corporate insiders are abandoning scan the qr code or click the link in the description to check out that free report and see which 12 stocks corporate insiders are abandoning most right now let's start out with your first pick of 2025 which is the biggest insider by stock that you have right now vesus is the most bought by insiders for the last year vesus is a spin-off from aramark it's their uniform business um now it's a standalone company it's competing with unifirst and centos it's about the same size as unifirst it's about a sixth size of centos um one of the opportunities here is that it's a potential takeover candidate so what does that mean for the growth of the stock price some the chatter is that the stock is about 15 to 25% undervalued relative to a potential takeover price not counting that potential for takeover uh this company this industry is well positioned for cash and cash flow if you look at centos it's been producing really awesome cash flow for about three decades uses that money to pay dividends buy back shares that stock price has been going just pretty much straight up as as straight up as it possibly can be invest is in that that that group it's been improving its balance sheet and preparing itself for capital returns it already pays a nice dividend but what i see here is the potential for share buybacks to begin sometime soon if it's not taken over or taken private and what kind of insider buys are we seeing with vesus so vesus has nine insiders that have been buying for the last year they've made more than a dozen purchases they've been pretty regular throughout the year and they're pretty widespread it shows a pretty good amount of conviction within this group that the stock is worth buying i think you have put vesus as a pretty solid buy for investors right now but your second pick of a stock that insiders are buying is a little bit more of a wild card yeah it is opco health it has quite a few potential catalysts coming up one of them is potential for takeover it's also got a couple of candidates or um drug therapies that have been gaining traction they're making some revenue uh but the real problem with this stock is that it's not making money and even with these new positive developments it's going to be a while before it's profitable its balance sheet is not in the greatest condition it's had to sell a lot of shares over the last year to raise capital so ution is a real threat so in this case the insiders buying is a vote of confidence but it could also just be them trying to support the stock price in the interim until one of these other catalysts can start taking control of the market yeah that's definitely a risk sometime with these insider buys is is it just trying to support the stock more who are the insiders buying the stock well like with vest it's it's a wide range of insiders we're tracking seven insiders whove made 24 purchases in the last year so they've all made more than one buy they are certainly showing a high amount of conviction in the stock but there are some significant risks that investors need to keep in mind yeah let's talk about what kind of growth potential this stock could have what are analysts saying the analysts see um quite a bit of upside potential the stock could rise 30 to 40% if we get one of those catalysts uh but as i said it just depends on if it gains enough traction to start making money soon enough for the market to stay interested let's move on to your third pick of insider buys this is a company we haven't covered before no this is gri uh they're an indust industrial packaging company so they make things like jerry cans and plastic barrels and oil cans and other services involved with storing industrial products so who are the insiders buying this stock and why are they buying it a wide variety of insiders making numerous purchases over the past year um they are certainly helping to support the stock price um if you look at the chart you can see it's been range bound for about two years but it's got a pretty solid floor and that floor is put in place by the insiders but also by the institutions and the analyst who can be considered insiders uh they've both been buying the stock the analysts are pretty bullish on it and they see it rising about 30% uh that aligns with the trading range so it looks like this stock could hit a bottom fairly soon and start rebounding how can investors time this kind of a stock buy well you're going to want to watch the charts you're going to want to pick out some pretty good technical entry points and then wait for the market to reach those points and to start showing a signal that signal will be shown in the price action and the indicators and it should align with a bottom and a bit of a rebound you're going to want to see some volume also in this move to help solidify the the bottom and to help add some strength to the market and provide some more upside momentum once the the price starts to move higher and you've already mentioned some of the risk but let's talk to investors any of these three picks or looking at any stocks that insiders are buying right now what are the potential risks or benefits so there certainly are a lot of benefits to following the insider trades uh there's not a lot lot of reasons for an executive to want to buy a stock if the company's doing badly so even in the case where the insiders might be trying to support the price action there's is still a bit of a um an affirmation in the company's outlook for them to be buying uh so the real risk is that you look at companies with insiders buying that don't really have the fundamental outlook for growth or for business strength that uh that a good investment would have so like any indicator you're going to want to use the insider buying as a starting off point for your investment research but then go from there and look at the other fundamental factors that make a good investment and if those things um align then it's probably going to be a pretty good buy some good advice for investors as always thomas thank you so much for your time today and for

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,ccEoBKL8LN8,MarketBeat,2024-12-27 02:29:27+00:00,3 Underrated AI Stocks Set to Surge in 2025,kind: captions language: en ai stocks are seeing a big boom this week as 2024 comes to a close where could they go from here here to break it down for us is market beat analyst chris marot chris you are looking at some ai stocks that maybe aren't the big semiconductor stocks but this week we're really looking at some of these smaller ai related stocks that really serve a purpose you know we're getting into that area of the market where investors are moving beyond um just generative ai applications they're looking for companies that are going to be using ai and applications that are going to actually be things that businesses and individuals are looking for specifically because of those ai capabilities and i think there are a few companies especially in the robotics and automation area that are going to be interesting because they're putting ai on devices and that's where consumers are really going to be looking for that you know we've seen that in the market this week with soundhound an ai application that's been incredibly popular for different businesses joining in on this application um and that is really taking off but your list of three robotics and automation stocks are maybe a little bit newer that have some room for some big gains so let's go ahead and start off with your first pick so the first one is uip path uh this is a midcap stock market cap somewhere around i think 7 billion as i'm as as you and i are talking here bridget so uipath is probably closest to soundhound for people that want to put it in a bucket although it's not it doesn't do exactly what soundtown does but what it does it's a software company and it specializes is in what's known as robotic process automation technology rpa and what they do is they work with enterprise level customers to do your chatbots and other sorts of automated tasks some of the bigger nam clients that they have would be mongodb and flutter entertainment but one of the key things for investors to know is they work throughout a variety of sectors you're talking about banking you're talking about healthcare you're talking about manufacturing i mean they cover the gamut and right now the stock is down 44% for the year so there does look like there's room for some upside yeah that's the upside that a lot of investors are interested in what are analysts saying about how far this stock could grow in the next year the consensus uh price for the stock is about $17.50 that's from the analyst covered by market beat some of that is um from a couple of different analysts jp morgan chase being one of that gave it a price target of $18 um i'm seeing a lot of analysts looking at that $16 range but still when you look at a stock that's trading for around $13.86 as you and i are talking right now that's significant upside for a stock like this and what i've noticed is in the last month the stock's up about 11% short interest is up about 8% so i don't know how much of the price movement up is some short sellers trying to cover their positions or if this is organic interest in the stock but either either way now might be a really interesting time for investors to get in on the stock yeah any other factors that this company could see some more growth in the next year are there more businesses buying into what they offer i think that's that's what we're going to have to watch out for but certainly that's what analysts would seem to be dictating again this is not a this isn't a company that's that's super niche their their products uh the software that they have is useful for a variety of industries a variety of applications you're going to want to watch for strong growth in not only revenue but also in earnings the company now looks like there's um consistently turning a profit that's good that needs to continue a and you also want to be seeing that year-over-year revenue growth all right let's move on to your second pick and this is a stock we've talked about before on this channel yeah it's intuitive surgical the u ticker symbol is isrg this is a this is a large cap company that a lot of investors are familiar with in the area of robotics specifically the company's known for their da vinci system which is a robotic surgical assistant it's a variety of products that are make that that are used to make up this da vinci system the stock has not been a poor performer this year whatsoever the stock's up about 61.6% and the stock trades for over $500 a share so some people might say boy there's very little room for the stock to go up but that doesn't seem to be the case yeah so what can make this company see even more growth in in 2025 and what are the analysts expecting for this one the catalyst uh for growth is just simply the fact that the company is always expanding on the da vinci system so they're always fine-tuning it making it better it's sort of like a flywheel type of thing the more hospitals and and physicians start to use it the more there's other hospitals and physicians that want to use it so it becomes sort of that one of the other things that might help is the fact that interest rates are going down so it may be something that might fit into more budgets uh that maybe it didn't fit into when interest rates were going up and isrg at that time actually the stock suffered a little bit in 2022 and 2023 as interest rates were going up but that's pivoting a little bit sounds good well you can watch our other video if you want to learn a little bit more about this company what's behind it and why isrg continues to be a strong pick here on this channel all right let's move on to your final pick of the day chris this is what i haven't heard of before this is a company called rhythm technologies uh the stock the ticker symbol here is irtc now this is a company that it's got a market cap of just over about $2 billion as we're talking about this today so technically it's not a small cap company but i think it's small enough that we can still consider it in the small cap realm interesting thing about this company is they are designing mobile heart monitoring systems there's a huge market for it in terms of just checking for heart arhythmia now and the whole like idea is patients wear this the information is sent directly to their physician and it gives their physician actionable data to act on one of the things about the stock that's kept it sort of suppressed is the fact that currently it only tests for arhythmia and it's only in the united states but both of those things are changing in the coming years uh the company is trying to expand into international markets and they see potentially a $1 billion total addressable market overseas they're also trying to get their products certified to test for other conditions such as sleep apnea such as um hypertension and heart failure so if they can expand the useful indications for the product and also increase their the addressable market that should have a potentially strong impact on the stock yeah that's really really interesting company and exactly what you talked about in this article and in this video is taking ai and making it useful and making it accessible to everyone and so a mobile app that helps with a health solution uh sounds like a really great idea and i know you just mentioned a lot of different growth factors for the stock uh how much are analysts expecting this company to grow in 2025 the stock already trades for over $90 a share for a small cast stock that's pretty impressive but analysts still believe that it it's got about 19% growth ahead of it the consensus price is right around 107 and one of the things that i noted in my article uh because it was something that blew me away was just last week it got a price target increase from analysts at canic cord genuity group they raised their price target which was already at 125 and they raised it all the way up to 152 so that just shows that there are some analysts that believe that this stock has a much higher potential to move higher thank you for bringing it to our radar chris we really appreciate the analysis today uh again you can check out chris's full article

big boom this week as 2024 comes to a close where could they go from here here to break it down for us is market beat analyst chris marot chris you are looking at some ai stocks that maybe aren't the big semiconductor stocks but this week we're really looking at some of these smaller ai related stocks that really serve a purpose you know we're getting into that area of the market where investors are moving beyond um just generative ai applications they're looking for companies that are going to be using ai and applications that are going to actually be things that businesses and individuals are looking for specifically because of those ai capabilities and i think there are a few companies especially in the robotics and automation area that are going to be interesting because they're putting ai on devices and that's where consumers are really going to be looking for that you know we've seen that in the market this week with soundhound an ai application that's been incredibly popular for different businesses joining in on this application um and that is really taking off but your list of three robotics and automation stocks are maybe a little bit newer that have some room for some big gains so let's go ahead and start off with your first pick so the first one is uip path uh this is a midcap stock market cap somewhere around i think 7 billion as i'm as as you and i are talking here bridget so uipath is probably closest to soundhound for people that want to put it in a bucket although it's not it doesn't do exactly what soundtown does but what it does it's a software company and it specializes is in what's known as robotic process automation technology rpa and what they do is they work with enterprise level customers to do your chatbots and other sorts of automated tasks some of the bigger nam clients that they have would be mongodb and flutter entertainment but one of the key things for investors to know is they work throughout a variety of sectors you're talking about banking you're talking about healthcare you're talking about manufacturing i mean they cover the gamut and right now the stock is down 44% for the year so there does look like there's room for some upside yeah that's the upside that a lot of investors are interested in what are analysts saying about how far this stock could grow in the next year the consensus uh price for the stock is about $17.50 that's from the analyst covered by market beat some of that is um from a couple of different analysts jp morgan chase being one of that gave it a price target of $18 um i'm seeing a lot of analysts looking at that $16 range but still when you look at a stock that's trading for around $13.86 as you and i are talking right now that's significant upside for a stock like this and what i've noticed is in the last month the stock's up about 11% short interest is up about 8% so i don't know how much of the price movement up is some short sellers trying to cover their positions or if this is organic interest in the stock but either either way now might be a really interesting time for investors to get in on the stock yeah any other factors that this company could see some more growth in the next year are there more businesses buying into what they offer i think that's that's what we're going to have to watch out for but certainly that's what analysts would seem to be dictating again this is not a this isn't a company that's that's super niche their their products uh the software that they have is useful for a variety of industries a variety of applications you're going to want to watch for strong growth in not only revenue but also in earnings the company now looks like there's um consistently turning a profit that's good that needs to continue a and you also want to be seeing that year-over-year revenue growth all right let's move on to your second pick and this is a stock we've talked about before on this channel yeah it's

into more budgets uh that maybe it didn't fit into when interest rates were going up and isrg at that time actually the stock suffered a little bit in 2022 and 2023 as interest rates were going up but that's pivoting a little bit sounds good well you can watch our other video if you want to learn a little bit more about this company what's behind it and why isrg continues to be a strong pick here on this channel all right let's move on to your final pick of the day chris this is what i haven't heard of before this is a company called rhythm technologies uh the stock the ticker symbol here is irtc now this is a company that it's got a market cap of just over about $2 billion as we're talking about this today so technically it's not a small cap company but i think it's small enough that we can still consider it in the small cap realm interesting thing about this company is they are designing mobile heart monitoring systems there's a huge market for it in terms of just checking for heart arhythmia now and the whole like idea is patients wear this the information is sent directly to their physician and it gives their physician actionable data to act on one of the things about the stock that's kept it sort of suppressed is the fact that currently it only tests for arhythmia and it's only in the united states but both of those things are changing in the coming years uh the company is trying to expand into international markets and they see potentially a $1 billion total addressable market overseas they're also trying to get their products certified to test for other conditions such as sleep apnea such as um hypertension and heart failure so if they can expand the useful indications for the product and also increase their the addressable market that should have a potentially strong impact on the stock yeah that's really really interesting company and exactly what you talked about in this article and in this video is taking ai and making it useful and making it accessible to everyone and so a mobile app that helps with a health solution uh sounds like a really great idea and i know you just mentioned a lot of different growth factors for the stock uh how much are analysts expecting this company to grow in 2025 the stock already trades for over $90 a share for a small cast stock that's pretty impressive but analysts still believe that it it's got about 19% growth ahead of it the consensus price is right around 107 and one of the things that i noted in my article uh because it was something that blew me away was just last week it got a price target increase from analysts at canic cord genuity group they raised their price target which was already at 125 and they raised it all the way up to 152 so that just shows that there are some analysts that believe that this stock has a much higher potential to move higher thank you for bringing it to our radar chris we really appreciate the analysis today uh again you can check out chris's full article to read a little bit more about these companies and check out our free special report on 10 ai stocks set to take off in 2025 to find more of the list of ai stocks maybe you haven't heard of that

big boom this week as 2024 comes to a close where could they go from here here to break it down for us is market beat analyst chris marot chris you are looking at some ai stocks that maybe aren't the big semiconductor stocks but this week we're really looking at some of these smaller ai related stocks that really serve a purpose you know we're getting into that area of the market where investors are moving beyond um just generative ai applications they're looking for companies that are going to be using ai and applications that are going to actually be things that businesses and individuals are looking for specifically because of those ai capabilities and i think there are a few companies especially in the robotics and automation area that are going to be interesting because they're putting ai on devices and that's where consumers are really going to be looking for that you know we've seen that in the market this week with soundhound an ai application that's been incredibly popular for different businesses joining in on this application um and that is really taking off but your list of three robotics and automation stocks are maybe a little bit newer that have some room for some big gains so let's go ahead and start off with your first pick so the first one is uip path uh this is a midcap stock market cap somewhere around i think 7 billion as i'm as as you and i are talking here bridget so uipath is probably closest to soundhound for people that want to put it in a bucket although it's not it doesn't do exactly what soundtown does but what it does it's a software company and it specializes is in what's known as robotic process automation technology rpa and what they do is they work with enterprise level customers to do your chatbots and other sorts of automated tasks some of the bigger nam clients that they have would be mongodb and flutter entertainment but one of the key things for investors to know is they work throughout a variety of sectors you're talking about banking you're talking about healthcare you're talking about manufacturing i mean they cover the gamut and right now the stock is down 44% for the year so there does look like there's room for some upside yeah that's the upside that a lot of investors are interested in what are analysts saying about how far this stock could grow in the next year the consensus uh price for the stock is about $17.50 that's from the analyst covered by market beat some of that is um from a couple of different analysts jp morgan chase being one of that gave it a price target of $18 um i'm seeing a lot of analysts looking at that $16 range but still when you look at a stock that's trading for around $13.86 as you and i are talking right now that's significant upside for a stock like this and what i've noticed is in the last month the stock's up about 11% short interest is up about 8% so i don't know how much of the price movement up is some short sellers trying to cover their positions or if this is organic interest in the stock but either either way now might be a really interesting time for investors to get in on the stock yeah any other factors that this company could see some more growth in the next year are there more businesses buying into what they offer i think that's that's what we're going to have to watch out for but certainly that's what analysts would seem to be dictating again this is not a this isn't a company that's that's super niche their their products uh the software that they have is useful for a variety of industries a variety of applications you're going to want to watch for strong growth in not only revenue but also in earnings the company now looks like there's um consistently turning a profit that's good that needs to continue a and you also want to be seeing that year-over-year revenue growth all right let's move on to your second pick and this is a stock we've talked about before on this channel yeah it's intuitive surgical the u ticker symbol is isrg this is a this is a large cap company that a lot of investors are familiar with in the area of robotics specifically the company's known for their da vinci system which is a robotic surgical assistant it's a variety of products that are make that that are used to make up this da vinci system the stock has not been a poor performer this year whatsoever the stock's up about 61.6% and the stock trades for over $500 a share so some people might say boy there's very little room for the stock to go up but that doesn't seem to be the case yeah so what can make this company see even more growth in in 2025 and what are the analysts expecting for this one the catalyst uh for growth is just simply the fact that the company is always expanding on the da vinci system so they're always fine-tuning it making it better it's sort of like a flywheel type of thing the more hospitals and and physicians start to use it the more there's other hospitals and physicians that want to use it so it becomes sort of that one of the other things that might help is the fact that interest rates are going down so it may be something that might fit

are expecting a big year for energy stocks in 2025 as these companies work to keep up with all the growth in ai here to break down which three stocks to watch in this sector is market beat guest mark lickfeld he is the chief income strategist at the oxford club thank you so much for joining us today mark my pleasure thanks for having me so you just released a new report really talking about the one factor that could slow down all of the explosive growth we've been seeing in ai and that is energy and the demand on the system will you share a little bit about the research that you've done as you may know ai just requires enormous amounts of energy for example a simple chat gpt query requires 10 to 25 times more energy than a simple google search the draw on energy the requirements for energy from ai are astronomical elon musk has said that the next shortage in the united states is going to be electricity donald trump has said that because of ai we need twice the amount of electricity that we have in order to have electricity you need something to fuel it so uh so to me energy is is the very obvious story for 2025 yeah that's such a great point and you know we've been talking so much about all these ai stocks that are seeing tremendous growth but just recently we've started to have more analysts and more people talking about these kind of secondary groups that are really supporting ai and secondary industries supporting ai energy like you said an obvious one how much uh growth would you expect for some of these energy sector stocks in 2025 i think it's going to be tremendous i mean if you look at things like nuclear energy there are 444 nuclear reactors in the world right now that are operating there are plans for another 110 and those are just the the big reactors there are something called uh small modular reactors which are are just like it sounds smaller nuclear rea actors they take less time to to construct uh those are starting to to go up you've got major major industry major companies like microsoft and amazon uh google that are getting involved with these smr small modular reactors but that's a long-term solution i'm also looking at natural gas because that's a shorter term solution the united states has loads and loads of natural gas it's cheap it's cleaner than oil and to me that's the short to intermediate term solution for our energy needs whereas nuclear is going to be the intermediate to longer term solution yeah you've already mentioned a couple of sectors there energy is so widespread there's so many different forms of energy and new clean energy coming out as well are there any specific sectors you see supporting the ai growth more than others and i know again you just mentioned nuclear and natural gas but any other sectors to watch in the year ahead yeah data storage which also requires tremendous amounts of energy so this is an amazing statistic i just recently came across 90% of all the world's data throughout history has been created in the last 2 years so and that's only going to increase with ai so there needs to be a place to store all this data so you've got these data centers uh popping up all over the world there's a large concentration of them in northern virginia because it's close to washington and but but there it's happening all over the world and so these data centers require tremendous amount of electricity run the servers to cool the servers that's obviously very very important you know what i like about the the data center reits and and energy is you know these are the picks and shovels of the new gold rush uh you know when you you think back to the gold rush in the 1800s sure some people found a couple of nuggets in the river but really the the ones who made a lot of money were the ones who sold the tools the the shovels the piics the levi's jeans i want to be involved in the companies that are going to to make money no matter who wins so you know we may or may not be able to pick the next big ai winner just like some people may have gotten amazon right but a lot of people might have gone with pets.com back 25 years ago i want to be the in the companies that are serving all of them so that no matter who wins these companies that are providing all the tools are making money and that's definitely energy and it's definitely the data center rates that is such a great point thank you for sharing that with our viewers another thing our viewers love to see and some specific stock picks i know in your special report you have some really great picks and we're gonna share more about that in just a little bit but first let's start out with just some specific energy stocks that you can see doing really really well in 2025 so in the natural gas space i have i have two one is you're not supposed to have favorite stocks but this is is kind of one of my favorites it's been for a long time enterprise products partners ticker symbol is epd this is a master limited partnership and they transport uh natural gas throughout the country as long as companies are transporting natural gas uh much of it will have to go through enterprises pipelines and they just collect a fee along the way there's not a lot of uh you know capital that's required to uh to run the business uh basically they just have to maintain these pipelines and it pays uh almost a 7% yield they've been raising the dividend every year for i think about 24 25 years now uh and it's just a a real steady performer year after year the other natural gas company i really like is shenir energy partners so not shenir energy shenir energy is the ticker symbol is lng this is shener energy partners also uh master limited partnership and the ticker symbol is cqp and the reason i like it is they have one of the largest uh natural gas terminals in the country uh they stored gas they transport gas and they and they have uh shipping maritime terminals where they can export the gas which is going to be a bigger and bigger part of the natural gas business in the us going forward donald trump is is very much in favor of exporting gas and let's not forget europe has been importing a lot of gas from russia and i think they're kind of getting over that they they don't want to be held hostage by russia be able to import uh american natural gas is going to become more and more attractive to europe and and that should definitely benefit shenir partners shener partners also has about a 6% yield versus the regular shenir energy which has a much much lower yield uh and with a master limited partnership your dividends are tax deferred so uh you have the tax advantage along with the higher yield great now your third pick is not natural gas this is more of an etf what kind of stocks are included on the etf that's one of your picks for today it holds physical uranium if nuclear power progresses the way i and a lot of other people expected to there's going to be a huge amount of demand for physical uranium i expect uranium prices to rise strongly over the long term right now uh it actually has been coming down a little bit so you have the opportunity to buy it perhaps on the cheap but i think longterm it's a great investment so i really like the sprat physical uranium trust etf and the ticker symbol is sr uuf uh and uh this is one i think you you hold for a while and three five years from now i think uranium prices are going to be much much higher and so will this etf some great advice for our investors uh with either of these stock picks and really this whole industry do you expect to see the big returns coming in 2025 or are all of these gains potentially more long term as ai really starts to take hold across the country i'm extremely bullish on natural gas in the short term so definitely for 2025 and and beyond uh nuclear power i think the fundamentals um are a little bit further out i think it's going to take a little longer for for all the nuclear power plants to start getting operational for some of the the uranium and and nuclear related stocks to start seeing an increase in revenue that being said i do think nuclear is going to become a much bigger story so i think as we often see in the stock market the stocks will start to appreciate even before the businesses start to improve their fundamentals so i do think nuclear is is going to be a a a really good sector to be in in 2025 i think natural gas you you'll see those fundamentals in the companies uh really start to ramp a little bit sooner though mark you have a wealth of information and knowledge on this sector and you share even more of that on your special report that just came out tell folks a little bit more about what to expect in this new report and where they can find it we really dive into the the nuclear story because uh again that that's the long-term solution here for the united states and really for the world it's not just the us that's that's boosting its nuclear capabilities japan germany a lot of other countries are as well so this is a long-term story uh to me it's almost the lwh hanging fruit here for the market in 2025 you can click that link

are expecting a big year for energy stocks in 2025 as these companies work to keep up with all the growth in ai here to break down which three stocks to watch in this sector is market beat guest mark lickfeld he is the chief income strategist at the oxford club thank you so much for joining us today mark my pleasure thanks for having me so you just released a new report really talking about the one factor that could slow down all of the explosive growth we've been seeing in ai and that is energy and the demand on the system will you share a little bit about the research that you've done as you may know ai just requires enormous amounts of energy for example a simple chat gpt query requires 10 to 25 times more energy than a simple google search the draw on energy the requirements for energy from ai are astronomical elon musk has said that the next shortage in the united states is going to be electricity donald trump has said that because of ai we need twice the amount of electricity that we have in order to have electricity you need something to fuel it so uh so to me energy is is the very obvious story for 2025 yeah that's such a great point and you know we've been talking so much about all these ai stocks that are seeing tremendous growth but just recently we've started to have more analysts and more people talking about these kind of secondary groups that are really supporting ai and secondary industries supporting ai energy like you said an obvious one how much uh growth would you expect for some of these energy sector stocks in 2025 i think it's going to be tremendous i mean if you look at things like nuclear energy there are 444 nuclear reactors in the world right now that are operating there are plans for another 110 and those are just the the big reactors there are something called uh small modular reactors which are are just like it sounds smaller nuclear rea actors they take less time to to construct uh those are starting to to go up you've got major major industry major companies like microsoft and amazon uh google that are getting involved with these smr small modular reactors but that's a long-term solution i'm also looking at natural gas because that's a shorter term solution the united states has loads and loads of natural gas it's cheap it's cleaner than oil and to me that's the short to intermediate term solution for our energy needs whereas nuclear is going to be the intermediate to longer term solution yeah you've already mentioned a couple of sectors there energy is so widespread there's so many different forms of energy and new clean energy coming out as well are there any specific sectors you see supporting the ai growth more than others and i know again you just mentioned nuclear and natural gas but any other sectors to watch in the year ahead yeah data storage which also requires tremendous amounts of energy so this is an amazing statistic i just recently came across 90% of all the world's data throughout history has been created in the last 2 years so and that's only going to increase with ai so there needs to be a place to store all this data so you've got these data centers uh popping up all over the world there's a large concentration of them in northern virginia because it's close to washington and but but there it's happening all over the world and so these data centers require tremendous amount of electricity run the servers to cool the servers that's obviously very very important you know what i like about the the data center reits and and energy is you know these are the picks and shovels of the new gold rush uh you know when you you think back to the gold rush in the 1800s sure some people found a couple of nuggets in the river but really the the ones who made a lot of money were the ones who sold the tools the the shovels the piics the levi's jeans i want to be involved in the companies that are going to to make money no matter who wins so you know we may or may not be able to pick the next big ai winner just like some people may have gotten amazon right but a lot of people might have gone with pets.com back 25 years ago i want to be the in the companies that are serving all of them so that no matter who wins these companies that are providing all the tools are making money and that's definitely energy and it's definitely the data center rates that is such a great point thank you for sharing that with our viewers another thing our viewers love to see and some specific stock picks i know in your special report you have some really great picks and we're gonna share more about that in just a little bit but first let's start out with just some specific energy stocks that you can see doing really really well in 2025 so in the natural gas space i have i have two one is you're not supposed to have favorite stocks but this is is kind of one of my favorites it's been for a long time enterprise products partners ticker symbol is epd this is a master limited partnership and they transport uh natural gas throughout the country as long as companies are transporting natural gas uh much of it will have to go through enterprises pipelines and they just collect a fee along the way there's not a lot of uh you know capital that's required to uh to run the business uh basically they just have to maintain these pipelines and it pays uh almost a 7% yield they've been raising the dividend every year for i think about 24 25 years now uh and it's just a a real steady performer year after year the other natural gas company i really like is shenir energy partners so not shenir energy shenir energy is the ticker symbol is lng this is shener energy partners also uh master limited partnership and the ticker symbol is cqp and the reason i like it is they have one of the largest uh natural gas terminals in the country uh they stored gas they transport gas and they and they have uh shipping maritime terminals where they can export the gas which is going to be a bigger and bigger part of the natural gas business in the us going forward donald trump is is very much in favor of exporting gas and let's not forget europe has been importing a lot of gas from russia and i think they're kind of getting over that they they don't want to be held hostage by russia be able to import uh american natural gas is going to become more and more attractive to europe and and that should definitely benefit shenir partners shener partners also has about a 6% yield versus the regular shenir energy which has a much much lower yield uh and with a master limited partnership your dividends are tax deferred so uh you have the tax advantage along with the higher yield great now your third pick is not natural gas this is more of an etf what kind of stocks are included on the etf that's one of your picks for today it holds physical uranium if nuclear power progresses the way i and a lot of other people expected to there's going to be a huge amount of demand for physical uranium i expect uranium prices to rise strongly over the long term right now uh it actually has been coming down a little bit so you have the opportunity to buy it perhaps on the cheap but i think longterm it's a great investment so i really like the sprat physical uranium trust etf and the ticker symbol is sr uuf uh and uh this is one i think you you hold for a while and three five

you expect to see the big returns coming in 2025 or are all of these gains potentially more long term as ai really starts to take hold across the country i'm extremely bullish on natural gas in the

history has been created in the last 2 years so and that's only going to increase with ai so there needs to be a place to store all this data so you've got these data centers uh popping up all over the world there's a large concentration of them in northern virginia because it's close to washington and but but there it's happening all over the world and so these data centers require tremendous amount of electricity run the servers to cool the servers that's obviously very very important you know what i like about the the data center reits and and energy is you know these are the picks and shovels of the new gold rush uh you know when you you think back to the gold rush in the 1800s sure some people found a couple of nuggets in the river but really the the ones who made a lot of money were the ones who sold the tools the the shovels the piics the levi's jeans i want to be involved in the companies that are going to to make money no matter who wins so you know we may or may not be able to pick the next big ai winner just like some people may have gotten amazon right but a lot of people might have gone with pets.com back 25 years ago i want to be the in the companies that are serving all of them so that no matter who wins these companies that are providing all the tools are making money and that's definitely energy and it's definitely the data center rates that is such a great point thank you for sharing that with our viewers another thing our viewers love to see and some specific stock picks i know in your special report you have some really great picks and we're gonna share more about that in just a little bit but first let's start out with just some specific energy stocks that you can see doing really really well in 2025 so in the natural gas space i have i have two one is you're not supposed to have favorite stocks but this is is kind of one of my favorites it's been for a long time enterprise products partners ticker symbol is epd this is a master limited partnership and they transport uh natural gas throughout the country as long as companies are transporting natural gas uh much of it will have to go through enterprises pipelines and they just collect a fee along the way there's not a lot of uh you know capital that's required to uh to run the business uh basically they just have to maintain these pipelines and it pays uh almost a 7% yield they've been raising the dividend every year for i think about 24 25 years now uh and it's just a a real steady performer year after year the other natural gas company i really like is shenir energy partners so not shenir energy shenir energy is the ticker symbol is lng this is shener energy partners also uh master limited partnership and the ticker symbol is cqp and the reason i like it is they have one of the largest uh natural gas terminals in the country uh they stored gas they transport gas and they and they have uh shipping maritime terminals where they can export the gas which is going to be a bigger and bigger part of the natural gas business in the us going forward donald trump is is very much in favor of exporting gas and let's not forget europe has been importing a lot of gas from russia and i think they're kind of getting over that they they don't want to be held hostage by russia be able to import uh american natural gas is going to become more and more attractive to europe and and that should definitely benefit shenir partners shener partners also has about a 6% yield versus the regular shenir energy which has a much much lower yield uh and with a master limited partnership your dividends are tax deferred so uh you have the tax advantage along with the higher yield great now your third pick is not natural gas this is more of an etf what kind of stocks are included on the etf that's one of your picks for today it holds physical uranium if nuclear power progresses the way i and a lot of other people expected to there's going to be a huge amount of demand for physical uranium i expect uranium prices to rise strongly over the long term right now uh it actually has been coming down a little bit so you have the opportunity to buy it perhaps on the cheap but i think longterm it's a great investment so i really like the sprat physical uranium trust etf and the ticker symbol is sr uuf uh and uh this is one i think you you hold for a while and three five years from now i think uranium prices are going to be much much higher and so will this etf some great advice for our investors uh with either of these stock picks and really this whole industry do you expect to see the big returns coming in 2025 or are all of these gains potentially more long term as ai really starts to take hold across the country i'm extremely bullish on natural gas in the short term so definitely for 2025 and and beyond uh nuclear power i think the fundamentals um are a little bit further out i think it's going to take a little longer for for all the nuclear power plants to start getting operational for some of the the uranium and and nuclear related stocks to start seeing an increase in revenue that being said i do think nuclear is going to become a much bigger story so i think as we often see in the stock market the stocks will start to appreciate even before the businesses start to improve their fundamentals so i do think nuclear is is going to be a a a really good sector to be in in 2025 i think natural gas you you'll see those fundamentals in the companies uh really start to ramp a little bit sooner though mark you have a wealth of information and knowledge on this sector and you share even more of that on your special report that just came out tell folks a little bit more about what to expect in this new report and where they can find it we really dive into the the nuclear story because uh again that that's the long-term solution here for the united states and really for the world it's not just the us that's that's boosting its nuclear capabilities japan germany a lot of other countries are as well so this is a long-term story uh to me it's almost the lwh hanging fruit here for the market in 2025 you can click that link

are expecting a big year for energy stocks in 2025 as these companies work to keep up with all the growth in ai here to break down which three stocks to watch in this sector is market beat guest mark lickfeld he is the chief income strategist at the oxford club thank you so much for joining us today mark my pleasure thanks for having me so you just released a new report really talking about the one factor that could slow down all of the explosive growth we've been seeing in ai and that is energy and the demand on the system will you share a little bit about the research that you've done as you may know ai just requires enormous amounts of energy for example a simple chat gpt query requires 10 to 25 times more energy than a simple google search the draw on energy the requirements for energy from ai are astronomical elon musk has said that the next shortage in the united states is going to be electricity donald trump has said that because of ai we need twice the amount of electricity that we have in order to have electricity you need something to fuel it so uh so to me energy is is the very obvious story for 2025 yeah that's such a great point and you know we've been talking so much about all these ai stocks that are seeing tremendous growth but just recently we've started to have more analysts and more people talking about these kind of secondary groups that are really supporting ai and secondary industries supporting ai energy like you said an obvious one how much uh growth would you expect for some of these energy sector stocks in 2025 i think it's going to be tremendous i mean if you look at things like nuclear energy there are 444 nuclear reactors in the world right now that are operating there are plans for another 110 and those are just the the big reactors there are something called uh small modular reactors which are are just like it sounds smaller nuclear rea actors they take less time to to construct uh those are starting to to go up you've got major major industry major companies like microsoft and amazon uh google that are getting involved with these smr small modular reactors but that's a long-term solution i'm also looking at natural gas because that's a shorter term solution the united states has loads and loads of natural gas it's cheap it's cleaner than oil and to me that's the short to intermediate term solution for our energy needs whereas nuclear is going to be the intermediate to longer term solution yeah you've already mentioned a couple of sectors there energy is so widespread there's so many different forms of energy and new clean energy coming out as well are there any specific sectors you see supporting the ai growth more than others and i know again you just mentioned nuclear and natural gas but any other sectors to watch in the year ahead yeah data storage which also requires tremendous amounts of energy so this is an amazing statistic i just recently came across 90% of all the world's data throughout

shovels of the new gold rush uh you know when you you think back to the gold rush in the 1800s sure some people found a couple of nuggets in the river but really the the ones who made a lot of money were the ones who sold the tools the the shovels the piics the levi's jeans i want to be involved in the companies that are going to to make money no matter who wins so you know we may or may not be able to pick the next big ai winner just like some people may have gotten amazon right but a lot of people might have gone with pets.com back 25 years ago i want to be the in the companies that are

they've been raising the dividend every year for i think about 24 25 years now uh and it's just a a real steady performer year after year the other natural gas company i really like is shenir energy partners so not shenir energy shenir energy is the ticker symbol is lng this is shener energy partners also uh master limited partnership and the ticker symbol is cqp and the reason i like it is they have one of the largest uh natural gas terminals in the country uh they stored gas they transport gas and they and they have uh shipping maritime terminals where they can export the gas which is going to be a bigger and bigger part of the natural gas business in the us going forward donald trump is is very much in favor of exporting gas and let's not forget europe has been importing a lot of gas

but i think longterm it's a great investment so i really like the sprat physical uranium trust etf and the ticker symbol is sr uuf uh and uh this is one i think you you hold for a while and three five years from now i think uranium prices are going to be much much higher and so will this etf some great advice for our investors uh with either of these stock picks and really this whole industry do you expect to see the big returns coming in 2025 or are all of these gains potentially more long term as ai really starts to take hold across the country i'm extremely bullish on natural gas in the short term so definitely for 2025 and and beyond uh nuclear power i think the fundamentals um are a little bit further out i think it's going to take a little longer for for all the nuclear power plants to start getting operational for some of the the uranium and and nuclear related stocks to start seeing an increase in revenue that being said i do think nuclear is going to become a much

are expecting a big year for energy stocks in 2025 as these companies work to keep up with all the growth in ai here to break down which three stocks to watch in this sector is market beat guest mark lickfeld he is the chief income strategist at the oxford club thank you so much for joining us today mark my pleasure thanks for having me so you just released a new report really talking about the one factor that could slow down all of the explosive growth we've been seeing in ai and that is energy and the demand on the system will you share a little bit about the research that you've done as you may know ai just requires enormous amounts of energy for example a simple chat gpt query requires 10 to 25 times more energy than a simple google search the draw on energy the requirements for energy from ai are astronomical elon musk has said that the next shortage in the united states is going to be electricity donald trump has said that because of ai we need twice the amount of electricity that we have in order to have electricity you need something to fuel it so uh so to me energy is is the very obvious story for 2025 yeah that's such a great point and you know we've been talking so much about all these ai stocks that are seeing tremendous growth but just recently we've started to have more analysts and more people talking about these kind of secondary groups that are really supporting ai and secondary industries supporting ai energy like you said an obvious one how much uh growth would you expect for some of these energy sector stocks in 2025 i think it's going to be tremendous i mean if you look at things like nuclear energy there are 444 nuclear reactors in the world right now that are operating there are plans for another 110 and those are just the the big reactors there are something called uh small modular reactors which are are just like it sounds smaller nuclear rea actors they take less time to to construct uh those are starting to to go up you've got major major industry major companies like microsoft and amazon uh google that are getting involved with these smr small modular reactors but that's a long-term solution i'm also looking at natural gas because that's a shorter term solution the united states has loads and loads of natural gas it's cheap it's cleaner than oil and to me that's the short to intermediate term solution for our energy needs whereas nuclear is going to be the intermediate to longer term solution yeah you've already mentioned a couple of sectors there energy is so widespread there's so many different forms of energy and new clean energy coming out as well are there any specific sectors you see supporting the ai growth more than others and i know again you just mentioned nuclear and natural gas but any other sectors to watch in the year ahead yeah data storage which also requires tremendous amounts of energy so this is an amazing statistic i just recently came across 90% of all the world's data throughout history has been created in the last 2 years so and that's only going to increase with ai so there needs to be a place to store all this data so you've got these data centers uh popping up all over the world there's a large concentration of them in northern virginia because it's close to washington and but but there it's happening all over the world and so these data centers require tremendous amount of electricity run the servers to cool the servers that's obviously very very important you know what i like about the the data center reits and and energy is you know these are the picks and shovels of the new gold rush uh you know when you you think back to the gold rush in the 1800s sure some people found a couple of nuggets in the river but really the the ones who made a lot of money were the ones who sold the tools the the shovels the piics the levi's jeans i want to be involved in the companies that are going to to make money no matter who wins so you know we may or may not be able to pick the next big ai winner just like some people may have gotten amazon right but a lot of people might have gone with pets.com back 25 years ago i want to be the in the companies that are serving all of them so that no matter who wins these companies that are providing all the tools are making money and that's definitely energy and it's definitely the data center rates that is such a great point thank you for sharing that with our viewers another thing our viewers love to see and some specific stock picks i know in your special report you have some really great picks and we're gonna share more about that in just a little bit but first let's start out with just some specific energy stocks that you can see doing really really well in 2025 so in the natural gas space i have i have two one is you're not supposed to have favorite stocks but this is is kind of one of my favorites it's been for a long time enterprise products partners ticker symbol is epd this is a master limited partnership and they transport uh natural gas throughout the country as long as companies are transporting natural gas uh much of it will have to go through enterprises pipelines and they just collect a fee along the way there's not a lot of uh you know capital that's required to uh to run the business uh basically they just have to maintain these pipelines and it pays uh almost a 7% yield they've been raising the dividend every year for i think about 24 25 years now uh and it's just a a real steady performer year after year the other natural gas company i really like is shenir energy partners so not shenir energy shenir energy is the ticker symbol is lng this is shener energy partners also uh master limited partnership and the ticker symbol is cqp and the reason i like it is they have one of the largest uh natural gas terminals in the country uh they stored gas they transport gas and they and they have uh shipping maritime terminals where they can export the gas which is going to be a bigger and bigger part of the natural gas business in the us going forward donald trump is is very much in favor of exporting gas and let's not forget europe has been importing a lot of gas from russia and i think they're kind of getting over that they they don't want to be held hostage by russia be able to import uh american natural gas is going to become more and more attractive to europe and and that should definitely benefit shenir partners shener partners also has about a 6% yield versus the regular shenir energy which has a much much lower yield uh and with a master limited partnership your dividends are tax deferred so uh you have the tax advantage along with the higher yield great now your third pick is not natural gas this is more of an etf what kind of stocks are included on the etf that's one of your picks for today it holds physical uranium if nuclear power progresses the way i and a lot of other people expected to there's going to be a huge amount of demand for physical uranium i expect uranium prices to rise strongly over the long term right now uh it actually has been coming down a little bit so you have the opportunity to buy it perhaps on the cheap but i think longterm it's a great investment so i really like the sprat physical uranium trust etf and the ticker symbol is sr uuf uh and uh this is one i think you you hold for a while and three five years from now i think uranium prices are going to be much much higher and so will this etf some great advice for our investors uh with either of these stock picks and really this whole industry do you expect to see the big returns coming in 2025 or are all of these gains potentially more long term as ai really starts to take hold across the country i'm extremely bullish on natural gas in the short term so definitely for 2025 and and beyond uh nuclear power i think the fundamentals um are a little bit further out i think it's going to take a little longer for for all the nuclear power plants to start getting operational for some of the the uranium and and nuclear related stocks to start seeing an increase in revenue that being said i do think nuclear is going to become a much bigger story so i think as we often see in the stock market the stocks will start to appreciate even before the businesses start to improve their fundamentals so i do think nuclear is is going to be a a a really good sector to be in in 2025 i think natural gas you you'll see those fundamentals in the companies uh really start to ramp a little bit sooner though mark you have a wealth of information and knowledge on this sector and you share even more of that on your special report that just came out tell folks a little bit more about what to expect in this new report and where they can find it we really dive into the the nuclear story because uh again that that's the long-term solution here for the united states and really for the world it's not just the us that's that's boosting its nuclear capabilities japan germany a lot of other countries are as well so this is a long-term story uh to me it's almost the lwh hanging fruit here for the market in 2025 you can click that link right here to watch that full report i watched it myself very interesting again mark you are a wealth of knowledge thank you so much for sharing some of it with us today here at market beads my

captions language: en today we are excited to have opal fuels co-ceo john moore with us today thank you so much for joining us today john thank you i'm really pleased to be here and uh excited about sharing our business with you yeah opal fuels is an interesting industry one that's been growing quite a bit and that's really all about renewable fuels right yes what we do is we collect biofuels naturally occurring biofuel uh principally at landfills but it can be done with dairy manure or it be done with wastewater uh and other uh agricultural products as well we then upgrade that gas which is maybe 50% methane to a full methane product just like your fossil natural gas that uh is transported in the pipeline we'll we'll put that into the pipeline system and then that's our upstream business on the downstream side we build cng fueling stations so we take the gas we generate out of the pipeline and we use it to fuel heavyduty trucks that run on cng instead of on diesel so it's this kind of virtuous circle like many of our uh clients who fuel on cngg or renewable natural gas are garbage trucks and so the garbage trucks go around and collect the trash deposit in the landfills creates the biog gas that we collect we upgrade it to a pure rng product and then we put it back into vehicles at stations that we build and operate across the country yeah that's a great little circle of life of really truly being renewable and trying to help uh have less of a footprint as a company i love that you mentioned one of your customers and that's garbage trucks and those companies you have some other really bigname clients out there that use your services so on the upstream side of our business our partners are landfill um owners like republic services or gfl environmental some municipal landfills like um new river solid waste authority or p county down in florida or prince william county in virginia and other places so we have private companies and municipal counterparties who we work with on producing this gas we put it into pipelines so we work with large pipeline companies as well and then on the downstream side when we fuel one of our largest customers is ups uh and we also ups has converted a very large part of their heavyduty fleet to renewable natural gas and they're saving substantial amounts of money by using this renewable natural gas interestingly it's a lowc carbon product that is less expensive than diesel so uh they're saving money and saving um carbon as well so uh it's really a win-win for them and typical customers would be a fleet of trucks that return to base and when i say heavy duty or class 8 i'm talking about like semi trucks or large garbage trucks or cement mixers or other heavyduty equipment that it's really not practical to put batteries onto these uh vehicles batteries are very heavy and so um you would add to the weight of these trucks which might either limit their payload or limit their range depending on the total weight in the us we have weight restrictions on our roads and so uh this is really a technology that's available to decarbonize heavyduty trucking today uh and it's not the other technologies like battery or hydrogen are really not available today so this is really a great solution for heavyduty uh trucking companies and is a great um use for the biog gas that comes from landfills and other uh waste yeah i want to talk about this this option for companies i know you mentioned uh several large companies like ups are already converting a large portion of their fleet into rng renewable gases like like youell um let's talk about how much more room for growth is there where are we at in that adoption stage of kind of switching over fleets to this kind of fuel well there's a substantial growth right now in the renewable natural gas production and there's a little bit of a um let's say a slower growth in the adoption on the fleet side because there's a conversion now from a medium heavyduty engine a 12 l engine produced by cumins who is the only manufacturer in the us for engines for heavy duty trucks to a new 15 l truck uh engine i should say which will be uh competitive with the most heavyduty diesel engines out there so as the fleet starts converting over and adopting the 15 liter i think we'll see the curve bend back upwards we think that there's probably 40 billion gallons of diesel fuel and other fuels utilized in heavy duty trucking and uh we generate around a billion gallons or so so we're a little bit less than 2% or or or or 1% one and a half% somewhere in there and uh so we think that that could grow to four five 6 7 8x um but it'll take a lot of adoption for it to grow that way and it'll take growth um on the upstream side landfills manure waste other agricultural waste wastewater all going into this renewable natural gas product talk about some factors whether it's in the economy or regulatory issues that might help factor into that adoption um of more of these kinds of fuels this whole renewable fuel industry was created in 2005 2006 with the renewable fuel standard congress passed a law uh at that time that mandated the use of these renewable fuels we're familiar with ethanol when we go to fuel our gas tanks on our cars at home uh and ethanol uh made from corn principally is one of those renewable fuels there's other renewable fuels like renewable diesel uh that's made from soy beans and other fats oils and greases uh and and then we have our version of it which is called cellulosic one of the highest value because it really is a nonf food crop uh this waste uh in place whether it's from manure or whether it's from uh the landfills etc that creates this gas very interesting well let's talk about your company a little bit more when did you get into the renewable fuel seed bridget i've been doing this for 35 years wow and uh i would say we started in the mid90s and um back then it was purely taking the gas from landfills and using them in engines to create electricity we still have as a company 15 projects that create renewable electricity you're were talking a little bit about policy before we think one policy that could really help adoption is for the epa to um finalize rules on uh using renewable electricity from landfill gas to power electric vehicles so instead of creating gas that goes into a pipeline to fuel a truck we create electricity from the same landfill gas put it out over a power line and use that in vehicles you know the amount of electricity that electric vehicles use is tracked by all of the oem manufacturers of these uh cars and so the pathway is set up and ready to go and we think that the epa could really promote adoption uh through that mechanism interestingly you know landfills create this methane gas which is very harmful to the environment if not collected and burnt larger landfills are required by the epa to collect that gas and destroy it whether they destroy it just by burning it or making electricity or making renewable natural gas um you know is up to the landfills to do but it's being destroyed at the larger landfills smaller landfills are not necessarily destroying this gas or using it economically because it costs a lot of money to put that infrastructure in place right now electric prices don't really promote creating small electric projects but if the epa was to um put in place this renewable electric pathway um called erins then that would really um increase the amount of landfills that could be utilized in this manner very interesting you obviously know so much about this industry you've been in it for 35 years let's just go into some details about this stock and where how long you've been a public company and where your stock is right now we went public about two and a half years ago in july of 2022 uh and at that time um you know we were putting projects in place kind of one at a time and we are looking to supercharge our growth today we have a 11 projects in operation another six in construction and a good healthy pipeline of additional opportunities that we're uh developing so we see a lot of growth we've been guiding the market to 2 million mmbt per year of additional capacity we'll have uh right now somewhere around 9 million mmbt of capacity and uh and adding 2 million a year we combined kind of that renewable electricity business the rng fuel business and the downstream fueling infrastructure business into a single entity and uh launch that as opal fuels we're traded on the nasdaq and um uh you know we look for opportunities to continue to grow this business and our investor base as well excited about where we are excited about where we're headed um i personally believe we're a very cheap stock given uh the amount of gas that we have and the amount of growth that we have but uh it's for investors to determine for themselves obviously yeah i think analysts right now are especially bullish on oil and gas as an industry as a whole seeing a lot of growth in the future do you see some of that growth and are you expecting that as a company preparing for just more demand in this overall industry because you can get the carbon reduction on the fleet side at a discount to diesel it's a win-win scenario for trucking companies that have significant volumes of fuel and so we do see increased adoption particularly with this new uh engine that cumins is um now starting to um sell the 15 liter engine so we see growth there on the upstream side i think all the land fill owners now understand the inherent value of this biog gas that they have the bio gas is a naturally occurring um uh uh gas from waste in place that is going to generate uh energy uh and it's just a matter of how you capture and utilize that energy so uh yeah we see a lot of growth opal fuels has been um probably growing as fast as any company out there some of our competitors that are doing this are uh bp has a number of projects that they're building and waste management uh is a company who developed most of their projects internally themselves gfl our partner is a 5050 owner of the projects that we develop with them uh so they're getting um both the value into their garbage trucks as well is coming out of their landfills um republic services as in the past uh just entered into um contracts to give the biofuels or sell the biofuel to developers such as opel so you have different models across the board of companies that own generation of rng and dispensing like was management people who are 5050 like gfl or 0 100 uh um on the upper opposite side of the spectrum with republic services almost all of the municipal counterparties who do this really uh just enter into a contract to sell the biogas and uh then look for the private developer to be a long-term partner these projects have um very long-term lives to them they involve um no real um uh unpro in technology so the technology that we utilize on the upstream side is really um pumps compressors and blowers standard technology use across american and world industries um and then we push the gas through a membrane that physically separates the co2 from the methane uh product so it's it's a very straightforward um technology on the downstream side again all we're doing is compressing gas into a fuel tank um so again compressors is uh our our main technology so we have about 350 people as a company uh divided into our upstream renewable natural gas development construction and operations our downstream uh fueling infrastructure construction and service we have uh over 70 service personnel servicing stations across the country every day and then our um um call it headquarters finance and uh other staff uh kind of rounds out that 350 figure wonderful well thank you so much for the breakdown on your company today john it's something uh i think our investors will be interested in learning about we are providing the link if

we also ups has converted a very large part of their heavyduty fleet to renewable natural gas and they're saving substantial amounts of money by using this renewable natural gas interestingly it's a lowc carbon product that is less expensive than diesel so uh they're saving money and saving um carbon as well so uh it's really a win-win for them and typical customers would be a fleet of trucks that return to base and when i say heavy duty or class 8 i'm talking about like semi trucks or large garbage trucks or cement mixers or other heavyduty equipment that it's really not practical to put batteries onto these uh vehicles batteries are very heavy and so um you would add to the weight of these trucks which might either limit their payload or limit their range depending on the total weight in the us we have weight restrictions on our roads and so uh this is really a technology that's available to decarbonize heavyduty trucking today uh and it's not the other technologies like battery or hydrogen are really not available today so this is really a great solution for heavyduty uh trucking companies and is a great um use for the biog gas that comes from landfills and other uh waste yeah i want to talk about this this option for companies i know you mentioned uh several large companies like ups are already converting a large portion of their fleet into rng renewable gases like like youell um let's talk about how much more room for growth is there where are we at in that adoption stage of kind of switching over fleets to this kind of fuel well there's a substantial growth right now in the renewable natural gas production and there's a little bit of a um let's say a slower growth in the adoption on the fleet side because there's a conversion now from a medium heavyduty engine a 12 l engine produced by cumins who is the only manufacturer in the us for engines for heavy duty trucks to a new 15 l truck uh engine i should say which will be uh competitive with the most heavyduty diesel engines out there so as the fleet starts converting over and adopting the 15 liter i think we'll see the curve bend back upwards we think that there's probably 40 billion gallons of diesel fuel and other fuels utilized in heavy duty trucking and uh we generate around a billion gallons or so so we're a little bit less than 2% or or or or 1% one and a half% somewhere in there and uh so we think that that could grow to four five 6 7 8x um but it'll take a lot of adoption for it to grow that way and it'll take growth um on the upstream side landfills manure waste other agricultural waste wastewater all going into this renewable natural gas product talk about some factors whether it's in the economy or regulatory issues that might help factor into that adoption um of more of these kinds of fuels this whole renewable fuel industry was created in 2005 2006 with the renewable fuel standard congress passed a law uh at that time that mandated the use of these renewable fuels we're familiar with ethanol when we go to fuel our gas tanks on our cars at home uh and ethanol uh made from corn principally is one of those renewable fuels there's other renewable fuels like renewable diesel uh that's made from soy beans and other fats oils and greases uh and and then we have our version of it which is called cellulosic one of the highest value because it really is a nonf food crop uh this waste uh in place whether it's from manure or whether it's from uh the landfills etc that creates this gas very interesting well let's talk about your company a little bit more when did you get into the renewable fuel seed bridget i've been doing this for 35 years wow and uh i would say we started in the mid90s and um back then it was purely taking the gas from landfills and using them in engines to create electricity we still have as a company 15 projects that create renewable electricity you're were talking a little bit about policy before we think one policy that could really help adoption is for the epa to um finalize rules on uh using renewable electricity from landfill gas to power electric vehicles so instead of creating gas that goes into a pipeline to fuel a truck we create electricity from the same landfill gas put it out over a power line and use that in vehicles you know the amount of electricity that electric vehicles use is tracked by all of the oem manufacturers of these uh cars and so the pathway is set up and ready to go and we think that the epa could really promote adoption uh through that mechanism interestingly you know landfills create this methane gas which is very harmful to the environment if not collected and burnt larger landfills are required by the epa to collect that gas and destroy it whether they destroy it just by burning it or making electricity or making renewable natural gas um you know is up to the landfills to do but it's being destroyed at the larger landfills smaller landfills are not necessarily destroying this gas or using it economically because it costs a lot of money to put that infrastructure in place right now electric prices don't really promote creating small electric projects but if the epa was to um put in place this renewable electric pathway um called erins then that would really um increase the amount of landfills that could be utilized in this manner very interesting you obviously know so much about this industry you've been in it for 35 years let's just go into some details about this stock and where how long you've been a public company and where your stock is right now we went public about two and a half years ago in july of 2022 uh and at that time um you know we were putting projects in place kind of one at a time and we are looking to supercharge our growth today we have a 11 projects in operation another six in construction and a good healthy pipeline of additional opportunities that we're uh developing so we see a lot of growth we've been guiding the market to 2 million mmbt per year of additional capacity we'll have uh right now somewhere around 9 million mmbt of capacity and uh and adding 2 million a year we combined kind of that renewable electricity business the rng fuel business and the downstream fueling infrastructure business into a single entity and uh launch that as opal fuels we're traded on the nasdaq and um uh you know we look for opportunities to continue to grow this business and our investor base as well excited about where we are excited about where we're headed um i personally believe we're a very cheap stock given uh the amount of gas that we have and the amount of growth that we have but uh it's for investors to determine for themselves obviously yeah i think analysts right now are especially bullish on oil and gas as an industry as a whole seeing a lot of growth in the future do you see some of that growth and are you expecting that as a company preparing for just more demand in this overall industry because you can get the carbon reduction on the fleet side at a discount to diesel it's a win-win scenario for trucking companies that have significant volumes of fuel and so we do see increased adoption particularly with this new uh engine that cumins is um now starting to um sell the 15 liter engine so we see growth there on the upstream side i think all the land fill owners now understand the inherent value of this biog gas that they have the bio gas is a naturally occurring um uh uh gas from waste in place that is going to generate uh energy uh and it's just a matter of how you capture and utilize that energy so uh yeah we see a lot of growth opal fuels has been um probably growing as fast as any company out there some of our competitors that are doing this are uh bp has a number of projects that they're building and waste management uh is a company who developed most of their projects internally themselves gfl our partner is a 5050 owner of the projects that we develop with them uh so they're getting um both the value into their garbage trucks as well is coming out of their landfills um republic services as in the past uh just entered into um contracts to give the biofuels or sell the biofuel to developers such as opel so you have different models across the board of companies that own generation of rng and dispensing like was management people who are 5050 like gfl or 0 100 uh um on the upper opposite side of the spectrum with republic services almost all of the municipal counterparties who do this really uh just enter into a contract to sell the biogas and uh then look for the private developer to be a long-term partner these projects have um very long-term lives to them they involve um no real um uh unpro in technology so the technology that we utilize on the upstream side is really um pumps compressors and blowers standard technology use across american and world industries um and then we push the gas through a membrane that physically separates the co2 from the methane uh product so it's it's a very straightforward um technology on the downstream side again all we're doing is compressing gas into a fuel tank um so again compressors is uh our our main technology so we have about 350 people as a company uh divided into our upstream renewable natural gas development construction and operations our downstream uh fueling infrastructure construction and service we have uh over 70 service personnel servicing stations across the country every day and then our um um call it headquarters finance and uh other staff uh kind of rounds out that 350 figure wonderful well thank you so much for the breakdown on your company today john it's something uh i think our investors will be interested in learning about we are providing the link if

captions language: en today we are excited to have opal fuels co-ceo john moore with us today thank you so much for joining us today john thank you i'm really pleased to be here and uh excited about sharing our business with you yeah opal fuels is an interesting industry one that's been growing quite a bit and that's really all about renewable fuels right yes what we do is we collect biofuels naturally occurring biofuel uh principally at landfills but it can be done with dairy manure or it be done with wastewater uh and other uh agricultural products as well we then upgrade that gas which is maybe 50% methane to a full methane product just like your fossil natural gas that uh is transported in the pipeline we'll we'll put that into the pipeline system and then that's our upstream business on the downstream side we build cng fueling stations so we take the gas we generate out of the pipeline and we use it to fuel heavyduty trucks that run on cng instead of on diesel so it's this kind of virtuous circle like many of our uh clients who fuel on cngg or renewable natural gas are garbage trucks and so the garbage trucks go around and collect the trash deposit in the landfills creates the biog gas that we collect we upgrade it to a pure rng product and then we put it back into vehicles at stations that we build and operate across the country yeah that's a great little circle of life of really truly being renewable and trying to help uh have less of a footprint as a company i love that you mentioned one of your customers and that's garbage trucks and those companies you have some other really bigname clients out there that use your services so on the upstream side of our business our partners are landfill um owners like republic services or gfl environmental some

lowc carbon product that is less expensive than diesel so uh they're saving money and saving um carbon as well so uh it's really a win-win for them and typical customers would be a fleet of trucks that return to base and when i say heavy duty or class 8 i'm talking about like semi trucks or large garbage trucks or cement mixers or other heavyduty equipment that it's really not practical to put batteries onto these uh vehicles batteries are very heavy and so um you would add to the weight of these trucks which might either limit their payload or limit their range depending on the total weight in the us we have weight restrictions on our roads and so uh this is really a technology that's available to decarbonize heavyduty trucking today uh and it's not the other technologies like battery or hydrogen are really not available today so this is really a great solution for heavyduty uh trucking companies and is a great um use for the biog gas that comes from landfills and other uh waste yeah i want to talk about this this option for companies i know you mentioned uh several large companies like ups are already converting a large portion of their fleet into rng renewable gases like like youell um let's talk about how much more room for growth is there where are we at in that adoption stage of kind of switching over fleets to this kind of fuel well there's a substantial growth right now in the renewable natural gas production and there's a little bit of a um let's say a slower growth in the adoption on the fleet side because there's a conversion now from a medium heavyduty engine a 12 l engine produced by cumins who is the only manufacturer in the us for engines for heavy duty trucks to a new 15 l truck uh engine i should say which will be uh competitive with the most heavyduty diesel engines out there so as the fleet starts converting over and adopting the 15 liter i think we'll see the curve bend back upwards we think that there's probably 40 billion gallons of diesel fuel and other fuels utilized in heavy duty trucking and uh we generate around a billion gallons or so so we're a little bit less than 2% or or or or 1% one and a half% somewhere in there and uh so we think that that could grow to four five 6 7 8x um but it'll take a lot of adoption for it to grow that way and it'll take growth um on the upstream side landfills manure waste other agricultural waste wastewater all going into this renewable natural gas product talk about some factors whether it's in the economy or regulatory issues that might help factor into that adoption um of more of these kinds of fuels this whole renewable fuel industry was created in 2005 2006 with the renewable fuel standard congress passed a law uh at that time that mandated the use of these renewable fuels we're familiar with ethanol when we go to fuel our gas tanks on our cars at home uh and ethanol uh made from corn principally is one of those renewable fuels there's other renewable fuels like renewable diesel uh that's made from soy beans and other fats oils and greases uh and and then we have our version of it which is called cellulosic one of the highest value because it really is a nonf food crop uh this waste uh in place whether it's from manure or whether it's from uh the landfills etc that creates this gas very interesting well let's talk about your company a little bit more when did you get into the renewable fuel seed bridget i've been doing this for 35 years wow and uh i would say we started in the mid90s and um back then it was purely taking the gas from landfills and using them in engines to create electricity we still have as a company 15 projects that create renewable electricity you're were talking a little bit about policy before we think one policy that could really help adoption is for the epa to um finalize rules on uh using renewable electricity from landfill gas to power electric vehicles so instead of creating gas that goes into a pipeline to fuel a truck we create electricity from the same landfill gas put it out over a power line and use that in vehicles you know the amount of electricity that electric vehicles use is tracked by all of the oem manufacturers of these uh cars and so the pathway is set up and ready to go and we think that the epa could really promote adoption uh through that mechanism interestingly you know landfills create this methane gas which is very harmful to the environment if not collected and burnt larger landfills are required by the epa to collect that gas and destroy it whether they destroy it just by burning it or making electricity or making renewable natural gas um you know is up to the landfills to do but it's being destroyed at the larger landfills smaller landfills are not necessarily destroying this gas or using it economically because it costs a lot of money to put that infrastructure in place right now electric prices don't really promote creating small electric projects but if the epa was to um put in place this renewable electric pathway um called erins then that would really um increase the amount of landfills that could be utilized in this manner very interesting you obviously know so much about this industry you've been in it for 35 years let's just go into some details about this stock and where how long you've been a public company and where your stock is right now we went public about two and a half years ago in july of 2022 uh and at that time um you know we were putting projects in place kind of one at a time and we are looking to supercharge our growth today we have a 11 projects in operation another six in construction and a good healthy pipeline of additional opportunities that we're uh developing so we see a lot of growth we've been guiding the market to 2 million mmbt per year of additional capacity we'll have uh right now somewhere around 9 million mmbt of capacity and uh and adding 2 million a year we combined kind of that renewable electricity business the rng fuel business and the downstream fueling infrastructure business into a single entity and uh launch that as opal fuels we're traded on the nasdaq and um uh you know we look for opportunities to continue to grow this business and our investor base as well excited about where we are excited about where we're headed um i personally believe we're a very cheap stock given uh the amount of gas that we have and the amount of growth that we have but uh it's for investors to determine for themselves obviously yeah i think analysts right now are especially bullish on oil and gas as an industry as a whole seeing a lot of growth in the future do you see some of that growth and are you expecting that as a company preparing for just more demand in this overall industry because you can get the carbon reduction on the fleet side at a discount to diesel it's a win-win scenario for trucking companies that have significant volumes of fuel and so we do see increased adoption particularly with this new uh engine that cumins is um now starting to um sell the 15 liter engine so we see growth there on the upstream side i think all the land fill owners now understand the inherent value of this biog gas that they have the bio gas is a naturally occurring um uh uh gas from waste in place that is going to generate uh energy uh and it's just a matter of how you capture and utilize that energy so uh yeah we see a lot of growth opal fuels has been um probably growing as fast as any company out there some of our competitors that are doing this are uh bp has a number of projects that they're building and waste management uh is a company who developed most of their projects internally themselves gfl our partner is a 5050 owner of the projects that we develop with them uh so they're getting um both the value into their garbage trucks as well is coming out of their landfills um republic services as in the past uh just entered into um contracts to give the biofuels or sell the biofuel to developers such as opel so you have different models across the board of companies that own generation of rng and dispensing like was management people who are 5050 like gfl or 0 100 uh um on the upper opposite side of the spectrum with republic services almost all of the municipal counterparties who do this really uh just enter into a contract to sell the biogas and uh then look for the private developer to be a long-term partner these projects have um very long-term lives to them they involve um no real um uh unpro in technology so the technology that we utilize on the upstream side is really um pumps compressors and blowers standard technology use across american and world industries um and then we push the gas through a membrane that physically separates the co2 from the methane uh product so it's it's a very straightforward um technology on the downstream side again all we're doing is compressing gas into a fuel tank um so again compressors is uh our our main technology so we have about 350 people as a company uh divided into our upstream renewable natural gas development construction and operations our downstream uh fueling infrastructure construction and service we have uh over 70 service personnel servicing stations across the country every day and then our um um call it headquarters finance and uh other staff uh kind of rounds out that 350 figure wonderful well thank you so much for the breakdown on your company today john it's something uh i think our investors will be interested in learning about we are providing the link if

captions language: en today we are excited to have opal fuels co-ceo john moore with us today thank you so much for joining us today john thank you i'm really pleased to be here and uh excited about sharing our business with you yeah opal fuels is an interesting industry one that's been growing quite a bit and that's really all about renewable fuels right yes what we do is we collect biofuels naturally occurring biofuel uh principally at landfills but it can be done with dairy manure or it be done with wastewater uh and other uh agricultural products as well we then upgrade that gas which is maybe 50% methane to a full methane product just like your fossil natural gas that uh is transported in the pipeline we'll we'll put that into the pipeline system and then that's our upstream business on the downstream side we build cng fueling stations so we take the gas we generate out of the pipeline and we use it to fuel heavyduty trucks that run on cng instead of on diesel so it's this kind of virtuous circle like many of our uh clients who fuel on cngg or renewable natural gas are garbage trucks and so the garbage trucks go around and collect the trash deposit in the landfills creates the biog gas that we collect we upgrade it to a pure rng product and then we put it back into vehicles at stations that we build and operate across the country yeah that's a great little circle of life of really truly being renewable and trying to help uh have less of a footprint as a company i love that you mentioned one of your customers and that's garbage trucks and those companies you have some other really bigname clients out there that use your services so on the upstream side of our business our partners are landfill um owners like republic services or gfl environmental some

that return to base and when i say heavy duty or class 8 i'm talking about like semi trucks or large garbage trucks or cement mixers or other heavyduty equipment that it's really not practical to put batteries onto these uh vehicles batteries are very heavy and so um you would add to the weight of these trucks which might either limit their payload or limit their range depending on the total weight in the us we have weight restrictions on our roads and so uh this is really a technology that's available to decarbonize heavyduty trucking today uh and it's not the other technologies like battery or hydrogen are really not available today so this is really a great solution for heavyduty uh trucking companies and is a great um use for the biog gas that comes from landfills and other uh waste yeah i want to talk about this this option for companies i know you mentioned uh several large companies like ups are already converting a large portion of their fleet into rng renewable gases like like youell um let's talk about how much more room for growth is there where are we at in that adoption stage of kind of switching over fleets to this kind of fuel well there's a substantial growth right now in the renewable natural gas production and there's a little bit of a um let's say a slower growth in the adoption on the fleet side because there's a conversion now from a medium heavyduty engine a 12 l engine produced by cumins who is the only manufacturer in the us for engines for heavy duty trucks to a new 15 l truck uh engine i should say which will be uh competitive with the most heavyduty diesel engines out there so as the fleet starts converting over and adopting the 15 liter i think we'll see the curve bend back upwards we think that there's probably 40 billion gallons of diesel fuel and other fuels utilized in heavy duty trucking and uh we generate around a billion gallons or so so we're a little bit less than 2% or or or or 1% one and a half% somewhere in there and uh so we think that that could grow to four five 6 7 8x um but it'll take a lot of adoption for it to grow that way and it'll take growth um on the upstream side landfills manure waste other agricultural waste wastewater all going into this renewable natural gas product talk about some factors whether it's in the economy or regulatory issues that might help factor into that adoption um of more of these kinds of fuels this whole renewable fuel industry was created in 2005 2006 with the renewable fuel standard congress passed a law uh at that time that mandated the use of these renewable fuels we're familiar with ethanol when we go to fuel our gas tanks on our cars at home uh and ethanol uh made from corn principally is one of those renewable fuels there's other renewable fuels like renewable diesel uh that's made from soy beans and other fats oils and greases uh and and then we have our version of it which is called cellulosic one of the highest value because it really is a nonf food crop uh this waste uh in place whether it's from manure or whether it's from uh the landfills etc that creates this gas very interesting well let's talk about your company a little bit more when did you get into the renewable fuel seed bridget i've been doing this for 35 years wow and uh i would say we started in the mid90s and um back then it was purely taking the gas from landfills and using them in engines to create electricity we still have as a company 15 projects that create renewable electricity you're were talking a little bit about policy before we think one policy that could really help adoption is for the epa to um finalize rules on uh using renewable electricity from landfill gas to power electric vehicles so instead of creating gas that goes into a pipeline to fuel a truck we create electricity from the same landfill gas put it out over a power line and use that in vehicles you know the amount of electricity that electric vehicles use is tracked by all of the oem manufacturers of these uh cars and so the pathway is set up and ready to go and we think that the epa could really promote adoption uh through that mechanism interestingly you know landfills create this methane gas which is very harmful to the environment if not collected and burnt larger landfills are required by the epa to collect that gas and destroy it whether they destroy it just by burning it or making electricity or making renewable natural gas um you know is up to the landfills to do but it's being destroyed at the larger landfills smaller landfills are not necessarily destroying this gas or using it economically because it costs a lot of money to put that infrastructure in place right now electric prices don't really promote creating small electric projects but if the epa was to um put in place this renewable electric pathway um called erins then that would really um increase the amount of landfills that could be utilized in this manner very interesting you obviously know so much about this industry you've been in it for 35 years let's just go into some details about this stock and where how long you've been a public company and where your stock is right now we went public about two and a half years ago in july of 2022 uh and at that time um you know we were putting projects in place kind of one at a time and we are looking to supercharge our growth today we have a 11 projects in operation another six in construction and a good healthy pipeline of additional opportunities that we're uh developing so we see a lot of growth we've been guiding the market to 2 million mmbt per year of additional capacity we'll have uh right now somewhere around 9 million mmbt of capacity and uh and adding 2 million a year we combined kind of that renewable electricity business the rng fuel business and the downstream fueling infrastructure business into a single entity and uh launch that as opal fuels we're traded on the nasdaq and um uh you know we look for opportunities to continue to grow this business and our investor base as well excited about where we are excited about where we're headed um i personally believe we're a very cheap stock given uh the amount of gas that we have and the amount of growth that we have but uh it's for investors to determine for themselves obviously yeah i think analysts right now are especially bullish on oil and gas as an industry as a whole seeing a lot of growth in the future do you see some of that growth and are you expecting that as a company preparing for just more demand in this overall industry because you can get the carbon reduction on the fleet side at a discount to diesel it's a win-win scenario for trucking companies that have significant volumes of fuel and so we do see increased adoption particularly with this new uh engine that cumins is um now starting to um sell the 15 liter engine so we see growth there on the upstream side i think all the land fill owners now understand the inherent value of this biog gas that they have the bio gas is a naturally occurring um uh uh gas from waste in place that is going to generate uh energy uh and it's just a matter of how you capture and utilize that energy so uh yeah we see a lot of growth opal fuels has been um probably growing as fast as any company out there some of our competitors that are doing this are uh bp has a number of projects that they're building and waste management uh is a company who developed most of their projects internally themselves gfl our partner is a 5050 owner of the projects that we develop with them uh so they're getting um both the value into their garbage trucks as well is coming out of their landfills um republic services as in the past uh just entered into um contracts to give the biofuels or sell the biofuel to developers such as opel so you have different models across the board of companies that own generation of rng and dispensing like was management people who are 5050 like gfl or 0 100 uh um on the upper opposite side of the spectrum with republic services almost all of the municipal counterparties who do this really uh just enter into a contract to sell the biogas and uh then look for the private developer to be a long-term partner these projects have um very long-term lives to them they involve um no real um uh unpro in technology so the technology that we utilize on the upstream side is really um pumps compressors and blowers standard technology use across american and world industries um and then we push the gas through a membrane that physically separates the co2 from the methane uh product so it's it's a very straightforward um technology on the downstream side again all we're doing is compressing gas into a fuel tank um so again compressors is uh our our main technology so we have about 350 people as a company uh divided into our upstream renewable natural gas development construction and operations our downstream uh fueling infrastructure construction and service we have uh over 70 service personnel servicing stations across the country every day and then our um um call it headquarters finance and uh other staff uh kind of rounds out that 350 figure wonderful well thank you so much for the breakdown on your company today john it's something uh i think our investors will be interested in learning about we are providing the link if

captions language: en today we are excited to have opal fuels co-ceo john moore with us today thank you so much for joining us today john thank you i'm really pleased to be here and uh excited about sharing our business with you yeah opal fuels is an interesting industry one that's been growing quite a bit and that's really all about renewable fuels right yes what we do is we collect biofuels naturally occurring biofuel uh principally at landfills but it can be done with dairy manure or it be done with wastewater uh and other uh agricultural products as well we then upgrade that gas which is maybe 50% methane to a full methane product just like your fossil natural gas that uh is transported in the pipeline we'll we'll put that into the pipeline system and then that's our upstream business on the downstream side we build cng fueling stations so we take the gas we generate out of the pipeline and we use it to fuel heavyduty trucks that run on cng instead of on diesel so it's this kind of virtuous circle like many of our uh clients who fuel on cngg or renewable natural gas are garbage trucks and so the garbage trucks go around and collect the trash deposit in the landfills creates the biog gas that we collect we upgrade it to a pure rng product and then we put it back into vehicles at stations that we build and operate across the country yeah that's a great little circle of life of really truly being renewable and trying to help uh have less of a footprint as a company i love that you mentioned one of your customers and that's garbage trucks and those companies you have some other really bigname clients out there that use your services so on the upstream side of our business our partners are landfill um owners like republic services or gfl environmental some municipal landfills like um new river solid waste authority or p county down in florida or prince william county in virginia and other places so we have private companies and municipal counterparties who we work with on producing this gas we put it into pipelines so we work with large pipeline companies as well and then on the downstream side when we fuel one of our largest customers is ups uh and

batteries onto these uh vehicles batteries are very heavy and so um you would add to the weight of these trucks which might either limit their payload or limit their range depending on the total weight in the us we have weight restrictions on our roads and so uh this is really a technology that's available to decarbonize heavyduty trucking today uh and it's not the other technologies like battery or hydrogen are really not available today so this is really a great solution for heavyduty uh trucking companies and is a great um use for the biog gas that comes from landfills and other uh waste yeah i want to talk about this this option for companies i know you mentioned uh several large companies like ups are already converting a large portion of their fleet into rng renewable gases like like youell um let's talk about how much more room for growth is there where are we at in that adoption stage of kind of switching over fleets to this kind of fuel well there's a substantial growth right now in the renewable natural gas production and there's a little bit of a um let's say a slower growth in the adoption on the fleet side because there's a conversion now from a medium heavyduty engine a 12 l engine produced by cumins who is the only manufacturer in the us for engines for heavy duty trucks to a new 15 l truck uh engine i should say which will be uh competitive with the most heavyduty diesel engines out there so as the fleet starts converting over and adopting the 15 liter i think we'll see the curve bend back upwards we think that there's probably 40 billion gallons of diesel fuel and other fuels utilized in heavy duty trucking and uh we generate around a billion gallons or so so we're a little bit less than 2% or or or or 1% one and a half% somewhere in there and uh so we think that that could grow to four five 6 7 8x um but it'll take a lot of adoption for it to grow that way and it'll take growth um on the upstream side landfills manure waste other agricultural waste wastewater all going into this renewable natural gas product talk about some factors whether it's in the economy or regulatory issues that might help factor into that adoption um of more of these kinds of fuels this whole renewable fuel industry was created in 2005 2006 with the renewable fuel standard congress passed a law uh at that time that mandated the use of these renewable fuels we're familiar with ethanol when we go to fuel our gas tanks on our cars at home uh and ethanol uh made from corn principally is one of those renewable fuels there's other renewable fuels like renewable diesel uh that's made from soy beans and other fats oils and greases uh and and then we have our version of it which is called cellulosic one of the highest value because it really is a nonf food crop uh this waste uh in place whether it's from manure or whether it's from uh the landfills etc that creates this gas very interesting well let's talk about your company a little bit more when did you get into the renewable fuel seed bridget i've been doing this for 35 years wow and uh i would say we started in the mid90s and um back then it was purely taking the gas from landfills and using them in engines to create electricity we still have as a company 15 projects that create renewable electricity you're were talking a little bit about policy before we think one policy that could really help adoption is for the epa to um finalize rules on uh using renewable electricity from landfill gas to power electric vehicles so instead of creating gas that goes into a pipeline to fuel a truck we create electricity from the same landfill gas put it out over a power line and use that in vehicles you know the amount of electricity that electric vehicles use is tracked by all of the oem manufacturers of these uh cars and so the pathway is set up and ready to go and we think that the epa could really promote adoption uh through that mechanism interestingly you know landfills create this methane gas which is very harmful to the environment if not collected and burnt larger landfills are required by the epa to collect that gas and destroy it whether they destroy it just by burning it or making electricity or making renewable natural gas um you know is up to the landfills to do but it's being destroyed at the larger landfills smaller landfills are not necessarily destroying this gas or using it economically because it costs a lot of money to put that infrastructure in place right now electric prices don't really promote creating small electric projects but if the epa was to um put in place this renewable electric pathway um called erins then that would really um increase the amount of landfills that could be utilized in this manner very interesting you obviously know so much about this industry you've been in it for 35 years let's just go into some details about this stock and where how long you've been a public company and where your stock is right now we went public about two and a half years ago in july of 2022 uh and at that time um you know we were putting projects in place kind of one at a time and we are looking to supercharge our growth today we have a 11 projects in operation another six in construction and a good healthy pipeline of additional opportunities that we're uh developing so we see a lot of growth we've been guiding the market to 2 million mmbt per year of additional capacity we'll have uh right now somewhere around 9 million mmbt of capacity and uh and adding 2 million a year we combined kind of that renewable electricity business the rng fuel business and the downstream fueling infrastructure business into a single entity and uh launch that as opal fuels we're traded on the nasdaq and um uh you know we look for opportunities to continue to grow this business and our investor base as well excited about where we are excited about where we're headed um i personally believe we're a very cheap stock given uh the amount of gas that we have and the amount of growth that we have but uh it's for investors to determine for themselves obviously yeah i think analysts right now are especially bullish on oil and gas as an industry as a whole seeing a lot of growth in the future do you see some of that growth and are you expecting that as a company preparing for just more demand in this overall industry because you can get the carbon reduction on the fleet side at a discount to diesel it's a win-win scenario for trucking companies that have significant volumes of fuel and so we do see increased adoption particularly with this new uh engine that cumins is um now starting to um sell the 15 liter engine so we see growth there on the upstream side i think all the land fill owners now understand the inherent value of this biog gas that they have the bio gas is a naturally occurring um uh uh gas from waste in place that is going to generate uh energy uh and it's just a matter of how you capture and utilize that energy so uh yeah we see a lot of growth opal fuels has been um probably growing as fast as any company out there some of our competitors that are doing this are uh bp has a number of projects that they're building and waste management uh is a company who developed most of their projects internally themselves gfl our partner is a 5050 owner of the projects that we develop with them uh so they're getting um both the value into their garbage trucks as well is coming out of their landfills um republic services as in the past uh just entered into um contracts to give the biofuels or sell the biofuel to developers such as opel so you have different models across the board of companies that own generation of rng and dispensing like was management people who are 5050 like gfl or 0 100 uh um on the upper opposite side of the spectrum with republic services almost all of the municipal counterparties who do this really uh just enter into a contract to sell the biogas and uh then look for the private developer to be a long-term partner these projects have um very long-term lives to them they involve um no real um uh unpro in technology so the technology that we utilize on the upstream side is really um pumps compressors and blowers standard technology use across american and world industries um and then we push the gas through a membrane that physically separates the co2 from the methane uh product so it's it's a very straightforward um technology on the downstream side again all we're doing is compressing gas into a fuel tank um so again compressors is uh our our main technology so we have about 350 people as a company uh divided into our upstream renewable natural gas development construction and operations our downstream uh fueling infrastructure construction and service we have uh over 70 service personnel servicing stations across the country every day and then our um um call it headquarters finance and uh other staff uh kind of rounds out that 350 figure wonderful well thank you so much for the breakdown on your company today john it's something uh i think our investors will be interested in learning about we are providing the link if you want to follow this stock and learn more about the company right here on on this channel as well thanks again for your time today john and thank you everyone for joining us here on market beat as

language: en tesla stock is taking off yet again here to talk about what's behind this recent runup is a special guest this week we have jeff brown with brownstone research with us today so glad that you could be here you have been a big supporter and fan of tesla for quite a few years now that's right i uh you know i first uh formerly recommended tesla back in april of 2018 and if you think back to that time it was a very very contentious stock some people were claiming it was a fraud that the accounting was off that they were uh losing money on every car that they sold that it was destined to go bankrupt i mean it was there was so much negativity about tesla back at that time and the reason was the the framework that they were looking at tesla the the general thought was this is a car company and so they were trying to measure the performance of tesla in the same way that they were looking at you know ford or general motors it it was just the wrong framework and to you know to me tesla at that time had some material advantages over the rest of the industry you know they completely designed new manufacturing processes their efficiencies were very different than the traditional automotive industry but the architecture of their cars their vehicles was different you know they they designed a software system around which which they built essentially a robot actually it was a car or you know now it's actually a truck but you know it was a computer architecture and it was one that could be updated just like we update our pcs or laptops today with with regular software updates you didn't have to bring them into the dealer anymore tesla also had um some real breakthroughs in terms of their lithium ion uh battery chemistries in particular which gave them also another advantage over the rest of the electric vehicle makers so not just the automotive the rest of the automotive industry but ev makers but really the center at the very center of my investment thesis around tesla was all about artificial intelligence and the point i made back in 2018 which no one was talking about was that tesla was at that time one of the world's most successful artificial intelligence companies and that ai development was going to be the secret to its future growth and that was april 2018 well it's certainly paying off today they are like you said a major ai leader and their stock price is absolutely going through the roof right now ever since the election tesla has seen incredible growth yeah uh what's behind some of this recent growth and this resurgence in their stock price well you you know it's really interesting because up until i would say six weeks ago uh generally speaking the industry wall street was really looking at tesla as still an ev manufacturer and they actually quite negative because on as a whole uh electric vehicle sales were declining so not not tesla in particular but there was this sentiment in the market that the electric vehicle industry was kind of suffering and slowing down a bit and and they were kind of projecting that would continue over the next few years and then um we really turned a corner i think a lot of people are suggesting that it was because of what the outcome of the elections and because of mus role in uh the trump administration that's why the stock's running but that's not really what's happening what's happening is this series of announcements that tesla's had regarding its artificial intelligence so specifically it's autonomous driving technology which is an artificial neural netor nwor that they've been developing over a number of years and what's been extraordinary is what's uh happened in the next or in the last i would say three or four months so uh tesla had been releasing a series of new uh full self-driving they call it full self-driving it's uh autonomous driving technology fsd new versions of its fsd software on his teslas and i have a tesla which i uh have just to test every new software release so i can track these things very closely anyway what happened was um there were very uh rapid improvements in the self-driving software over these three or four months and in fact on november 30th it released its latest version which is uh version 13.2 and 13 was the version that um uh had been spoken of as the solution to essentially fully autonomous software so level five which has the capability of what we would refer to as unsupervised self-driving so what does unsupervised mean it means literally you can get into the car sit back take a nap and basically be transported to your destination without having to do a thing and so you know what's happened since version 13 came out is it is is phenomenal its performance is really unbelievable i mean it was fabulous 3 months ago but where version 13 is is truly remarkable it's it's incredibly human in terms of the way that it drives you know it's just aggressive enough it's can get through very complex situations very naturally it's extremely smooth and anyone any analyst who has actually experienced it can know when they experience what that looks like that something very special is happening and so the the kind of importance the importance of this particular event is that um you know tesla is planning on getting approval for unsupervised self-driving technology in at least two states next year and the front runners are texas and california and once that happens he's planning on announcing his robo tax network and so any tesla unit any tesla owner or even someone that's leads to tesla can opt in their car into tesla's future robo taxi network so when you're not using your car you hit your smartphone you tell your tesla to go out and work for you and it generates income every day if your tesla is generating enough income for you on a monthly basis to pay for your monthly car loan or monthly lease do you think more teslas will be sold it it's pretty simple it pays for itself and so that's what's happening with this stock right now they've recognized more broadly what the implications of this technology are for tesla as a company not only will this increase sales of its own evs by the way not other companies evs but tesla evs right because they have both the hardware and software to enable this level five unsupervised driving but it's also the foundation for what it recently announced i'm sure you saw the cyber cab announcement right pretty futuristic absolutely looking car self-driving car no brake no accelerator no steering wheel just a screen two seats that's it phenomenal right but now that you see how version 13 is working you can see that those cars will in fact work people are starting to really see what the long-term strategy is for tesla and now that they can see that technology is very real the rest the future revenues that are forecasted from things like the cyber cab you can also believe are coming as well and that's why the stock is running so high yeah this seems like just the beginning of the move for tesla with all of this future growth on the horizon i think this is such an interesting point about ai in general where the first versions of ai were not good on on any part whether it was image generation video generation the first versions everyone almost laughed at is this is never going to be good and now we're seeing it's phenomenal and i think that's the same thing with this tesla's version of ai and using it to make these self-driving vehicles you have really found some other companies that are really going to start taking off thanks to the self-driving technology correct yes so you know one of the things that i specialize in my own research and analysis is identifying these large technological trends and then of course uh the companies that will benefit from it um you know the tailwind here in this case is the ability to enable fully autonomous driving so you know where i spend my time researching is first understanding the technology like i said that's why i have a tesla uh and what was really interesting in um with with that technology is it it it wasn't a state of the technology at any given point in time it was the rate of improvement and that's what i think most people missed over the last few years you know yes it wasn't perfect to the point that you made but how rapidly was it improving so if you're watching that you could see that the rate of improvements was accelerating which is why i knew this was happening this year and so understanding the impact that um tesla is going to have on the industry and then understanding those other companies that contribute to this trend that might even enable tesla for example companies that provide specialized components into tesla vehicles and potentially future tesla products like the cyber cab or like optimus their humanoid robot which has uh generated so much excitement as well you clearly speak from a place of knowledge on so much of this what's your background a little bit and give us a background on your company as well uh well um i i uh am a technologist uh at heart uh my uh undergraduate degree was in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from pur university so i have a very technical engineering background i worked in industry for about um 25 years as a corporate high-tech executive uh for a variety of companies that were in wireless and wireline communications internet technology routers switches i work for a couple major uh semiconductor companies like qualcomm and nxp semiconductors uh have a lot of experience in software and cyber security as well and so a wide range of experience through many different uh technology verticals um as a business executive as a technologist and um uh really managing running uh large uh operating businesses for technology companies and i you know did that up until about uh 2014 and then made a change in my career um to become uh an investment analyst a technology analyst uh to focus on high-tech and biotechnology uh which is what i've been doing for about uh the last 10 years so all that time in the field uh customer facing understanding how products are bought and sold uh you know what makes a product compelling in terms of uh market adoption uh is a really important part of my analysis and i bring all that to brownstone research which is one of the uh largest and most successful uh investment research u companies in the world over the last 10 years and uh all i can say is um i can't imagine a more exciting time to be doing this kind of work uh with what's coming around the corner over the next few years it's really a remarkable period in history it really is and it's paying off in huge ways in the stock market as well we continue to see company after company anything to do with ai seeing some major payoffs and i think understanding that technology is why you have such a advantage in understanding how to invest in that as well um your latest video is a wealth of information again talking a lot about tesla and also talking about the companies that can benefit alongside tesla and so we have that link here if you want

fabulous 3 months ago but where version 13 is is truly remarkable it's it's incredibly human in terms of the way that it drives you know it's just aggressive enough it's can get through very complex situations very naturally it's extremely smooth and anyone any analyst who has actually experienced it can know when they experience what that looks like that something very special is happening and so the the kind of importance the importance of this particular event is that um you know tesla is planning on getting approval for unsupervised self-driving technology in at least two states next year and the front runners are texas and california and once that happens he's planning on announcing his robo tax network and so any tesla unit any tesla owner or even someone that's leads to tesla can opt in their car into tesla's future robo taxi network so when you're not using your car you hit your smartphone you tell your tesla to go out and work for you and it generates income every day if your tesla is generating enough income for you on a monthly basis to pay for your monthly car loan or monthly lease do you think more teslas will be sold it it's pretty simple it pays for itself and so that's what's happening with this stock right now they've recognized more broadly what the implications of this technology are for tesla as a company not only will this increase sales of its own evs by the way not other companies evs but tesla evs right because they have both the hardware and software to enable this level five unsupervised driving but it's also the foundation for what it recently announced i'm sure you saw the cyber cab announcement right pretty futuristic absolutely looking car self-driving car no brake no accelerator no steering wheel just a screen two seats that's it phenomenal right but now that you see how version 13 is working you can see that those cars will in fact work people are starting to really see what the long-term strategy is for tesla and now that they can see that technology is very real the rest the future revenues that are forecasted from things like the cyber cab you can also believe are coming as well and that's why the stock is running so high yeah this seems like just the beginning of the move for tesla with all of this future growth on the horizon i think this is such an interesting point about ai in general where the first versions of ai were not good on on any part whether it was image generation video generation the first versions everyone almost laughed at is this is never going to be good and now we're seeing it's phenomenal and i think that's the same thing with this tesla's version of ai and using it to make these self-driving vehicles you have really found some other companies that are really going to start taking off thanks to the self-driving technology correct yes so you know one of the things that i specialize in my own research and analysis is identifying these large technological trends and then of course uh the companies that will benefit from it um you know the tailwind here in this case is the ability to enable fully autonomous driving so you know where i spend my time researching is first understanding the technology like i said that's why i have a tesla uh and what was really interesting in um with with that technology is it it it wasn't a state of the technology at any given point in time it was the rate of improvement and that's what i think most people missed over the last few years you know yes it wasn't perfect to the point that you made but how rapidly was it improving so if you're watching that you could see that the rate of improvements was accelerating which is why i knew this was happening this year and so understanding the impact that um tesla is going to have on the industry and then understanding those other companies that contribute to this trend that might even enable tesla for example companies that provide specialized components into tesla vehicles and potentially future tesla products like the cyber cab or like optimus their humanoid robot which has uh generated so much excitement as well you clearly speak from a place of knowledge on so much of this what's your background a little bit and give us a background on your company as well uh well um i i uh am a technologist uh at heart uh my uh undergraduate degree was in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from pur university so i have a very technical engineering background i worked in industry for about um 25 years as a corporate high-tech executive uh for a variety of companies that were in wireless and wireline communications internet technology routers switches i work for a couple major uh semiconductor companies like qualcomm and nxp semiconductors uh have a lot of experience in software and cyber security as well and so a wide range of experience through many different uh technology verticals um as a business executive as a technologist and um uh really managing running uh large uh operating businesses for technology companies and i you know did that up until about uh 2014 and then made a change in my career um to become uh an investment analyst a technology analyst uh to focus on high-tech and biotechnology uh which is what i've been doing for about uh the last 10 years so all that time in the field uh customer facing understanding how products are bought and sold uh you know what makes a product compelling in terms of uh market adoption uh is a really important part of my analysis and i bring all that to brownstone research which is one of the uh largest and most successful uh investment research u companies in the world over the last 10 years and uh all i can say is um i can't imagine a more exciting time to be doing this kind of work uh with what's coming around the corner over the next few years it's really a remarkable period in history it really is and it's paying off in huge ways in the stock market as well we continue to see company after company anything to do with ai seeing some major payoffs and i think understanding that technology is why you have such a advantage in understanding how to invest in that as well um your latest video is a wealth of information again talking a lot about tesla and also talking about the companies that can benefit alongside tesla and so we have that link here if you want to check out jeff's latest video uh while watch the full thing because it's very very very interesting and informative you again so much knowledge thank you for sharing that with us and with our viewers here on market beads thank you so much for joining us today everyone again check out the description for that link to jeff's latest video thanks again for watching everyone and as always happy

language: en tesla stock is taking off yet again here to talk about what's behind this recent runup is a special guest this week we have jeff brown with brownstone research with us today so glad that you could be here you have been a big supporter and fan of tesla for quite a few years now that's right i uh you know i first uh formerly recommended tesla back in april of 2018 and if you think back to that time it was a very very contentious stock some people were claiming it was a fraud that the accounting was off that they were uh losing money on every car that they sold that it was destined to go bankrupt i mean it was there was so much negativity about tesla back at that time and the reason was the the framework that they were looking at tesla the the general thought was this is a car company and so they were trying to measure the performance of tesla in the same way that they were looking at you know ford or general motors it it was just the wrong framework and to you know to me tesla at that time had some material advantages over the rest of the industry you know they completely designed new manufacturing processes their efficiencies were very different than the traditional automotive industry but the architecture of their cars their vehicles was different you know they they designed a software system around which which they built essentially a robot actually it was a car or you know now it's actually a truck but you know it was a computer architecture and it was one that could be updated just like we update our pcs or laptops today with with regular software updates you didn't have to bring them into the dealer anymore tesla also had um some real breakthroughs in terms of their lithium ion uh battery chemistries in particular which gave them also another advantage over the rest of the electric vehicle makers so not just the automotive the rest of the automotive industry but ev makers but really the center at the very center of my investment thesis around tesla was all about artificial intelligence and the point i made back in 2018 which no one was talking about was that tesla was at that time one of the world's most successful artificial intelligence companies and that ai development was going to be the secret to its future growth and that was april 2018 well it's certainly paying off today they are like you said a major ai leader and their stock price is absolutely going through the roof right now ever since the election tesla has seen incredible growth yeah uh what's behind some of this recent growth and this resurgence in their stock price well you you know it's really interesting because up until i would say six weeks ago uh generally speaking the industry wall street was really looking at tesla as still an ev manufacturer and they actually quite negative because on as a whole uh electric vehicle sales were declining so not not tesla in particular but there was this sentiment in the market that the electric vehicle industry was kind of suffering and slowing down a bit and and they were kind of projecting that would continue over the next few years and then um we really turned a corner i think a lot of people are suggesting that it was because of what the outcome of the elections and because of mus role in uh the trump administration that's why the stock's running but that's not really what's happening what's happening is this series of announcements that tesla's had regarding its artificial intelligence so specifically it's autonomous driving technology which is an artificial neural netor nwor that they've been developing over a number of years and what's been extraordinary is what's uh happened in the next or in the last i would say three or four months so uh tesla had been releasing a series of new uh full self-driving they call it full self-driving it's uh autonomous driving technology fsd new versions of its fsd software on his teslas and i have a tesla which i uh have just to test every new software release so i can track these things very closely anyway what happened was um there were very uh rapid improvements in the self-driving software over these three or four months and in fact on november 30th it released its latest version which is uh version 13.2 and 13 was the version that um uh had been spoken of as the solution to essentially fully autonomous software so level five which has the capability of what we would refer to as unsupervised self-driving so what does unsupervised mean it means literally you can get into the car sit back take a nap and basically be transported to your destination without having to do a thing and so you know what's happened since version 13 came out is it is is phenomenal its performance is really unbelievable i mean it was

the companies that will benefit from it um you know the tailwind here in this case is the ability to enable fully autonomous driving so you know where i spend my time researching is first understanding the technology like i said that's why i have a tesla uh and what was really interesting in um with with that technology is it it it wasn't a state of the technology at any given point in time it was the rate of improvement and that's what i think most people missed over the last few years you know yes it wasn't perfect to the point that you made but how rapidly was it improving so if you're watching that you could see that the rate of improvements was accelerating which is why i knew this was happening this year and so understanding the impact that um tesla is going to have on the industry and then understanding those other companies that contribute to this trend that might even enable tesla for example companies that provide specialized components into tesla vehicles and potentially future tesla products like the cyber cab or like optimus their humanoid robot which has uh generated so much excitement as well you clearly speak from a place of knowledge on so much of this what's your background a little bit and give us a background on your company as well uh well um i i uh am a technologist uh at heart uh my uh undergraduate degree was in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from pur university so i have a very technical engineering background i worked in industry for about um 25 years as a corporate high-tech executive uh for a variety of companies that were in wireless and wireline communications internet technology routers switches i work for a couple major uh semiconductor companies like qualcomm and nxp semiconductors uh have a lot of experience in software and cyber security as well and so a wide range of experience through many different uh technology verticals um as a business executive as a technologist and um uh really managing running uh large uh operating businesses for technology companies and i you know did that up until about uh 2014 and then made a change in my career um to become uh an investment analyst a technology analyst uh to focus on high-tech and biotechnology uh which is what i've been doing for about uh the last 10 years so all that time in the field uh customer facing understanding how products are bought and sold uh you know what makes a product compelling in terms of uh market adoption uh is a really important part of my analysis and i bring all that to brownstone research which is one of the uh largest and most successful uh investment research u companies in the world over the last 10 years and uh all i can say is um i can't imagine a more exciting time to be doing this kind of work uh with what's coming around the corner over the next few years it's really a remarkable period in history it really is and it's paying off in huge ways in the stock market as well we continue to see company after company anything to do with ai seeing some major payoffs and i think understanding that technology is why you have such a advantage in understanding how to invest in that as well um your latest video is a wealth of information again talking a lot about tesla and also talking about the companies that can benefit alongside tesla and so we have that link here if you want to check out jeff's latest video uh while watch the full thing because it's very very very interesting and informative you again so much knowledge thank you for sharing that with us and with our

language: en tesla stock is taking off yet again here to talk about what's behind this recent runup is a special guest this week we have jeff brown with brownstone research with us today so glad that you could be here you have been a big supporter and fan of tesla for quite a few years now that's right i uh you know i first uh formerly recommended tesla back in april of 2018 and if you think back to that time it was a very very contentious stock some people were claiming it was a fraud that the accounting was off that they were uh losing money on every car that they sold that it was destined to go bankrupt i mean it was there was so much negativity about tesla back at that time and the reason was the the framework that they were looking at tesla the the general thought was this is a car company and so they were trying to measure the performance of tesla in the same way that they were looking at you know ford or general motors it it was just the wrong framework and to you know to me tesla at that time had some material advantages over the rest of the industry you know they completely designed new manufacturing processes their efficiencies were very different than the traditional automotive industry but the architecture of their cars their vehicles was different you know they they designed a software system around which which they built essentially a robot actually it was a car or you know now it's actually a truck but you know it was a computer architecture and it was one that could be updated just like we update our pcs or laptops today with with regular software updates you didn't have to bring them into the dealer anymore tesla also had um some real breakthroughs in terms of their lithium ion uh battery chemistries in particular which gave them also another advantage over the rest of the electric vehicle makers so not just the automotive the rest of the automotive industry but ev makers but really the center at the very center of my investment thesis around tesla was all about artificial intelligence and the point i made back in 2018 which no one was talking about was that tesla was at that time one of the world's most successful artificial intelligence companies and that ai development was going to be the secret to its future growth and that was april 2018 well it's certainly paying off today they are like you said a major ai leader and their stock price is absolutely going through the roof right now ever since the election tesla has seen incredible growth yeah uh what's behind some of this recent growth and this resurgence in their stock price well you you know it's really interesting because up until i would say six weeks ago uh generally speaking the industry wall street was really looking at tesla as still an ev manufacturer and they actually quite negative because on as a whole uh electric vehicle sales were declining so not not tesla in particular but there was this sentiment in the market that the electric vehicle industry was kind of suffering and slowing down a bit and and they were kind of projecting that would continue over the next few years and then um we really turned a corner i think a lot of people are suggesting that it was because of what the outcome of the elections and because of mus role in uh the trump administration that's why the stock's running but that's not really what's happening what's happening is this series of announcements that tesla's had regarding its artificial intelligence so specifically it's autonomous driving technology which is an artificial neural netor nwor that they've been developing over a number of years and what's been extraordinary is what's uh happened in the next or in the last i would say three or four months so uh tesla had been releasing a series of new uh full self-driving they call it full self-driving it's uh autonomous driving technology fsd new versions of its fsd software on his teslas and i have a tesla which i uh have just to test every new software release so i can track these things very closely anyway what happened was um there were very uh rapid improvements in the self-driving software over these three or four months and in fact on november 30th it released its latest version which is uh version 13.2 and 13 was the version that um uh had been spoken of as the solution to essentially fully autonomous software so level five which has the capability of what we would refer to as unsupervised self-driving so what does unsupervised mean it means literally you can get into the car sit back take a nap and basically be transported to your destination without having to do a thing and so you know what's happened since version 13 came out is it is is phenomenal its performance is really unbelievable i mean it was fabulous 3 months ago but where version 13 is is truly remarkable it's it's incredibly human in terms of the way that it drives you know it's just aggressive enough it's can get through very complex situations very naturally it's extremely smooth and anyone any analyst who has actually experienced it can know when they experience what that looks like that something very special is happening and so the the kind of importance the importance of this particular event is that um you know tesla is planning on getting approval for unsupervised self-driving technology in at least two states next year and the front runners are texas and california and once that happens he's planning on announcing his robo tax network and so any tesla unit any tesla owner or even someone that's leads to tesla can opt in their car into tesla's future robo taxi network so when you're not using your car you hit your smartphone you tell your tesla to go out and work for you and it generates income every day if your tesla is generating enough income for you on a monthly basis to pay for your monthly car loan or monthly lease do you think more teslas will be sold it it's pretty simple it pays for itself and so that's what's happening with this stock right now they've recognized more broadly what the implications of this technology are for tesla as a company not only will this increase sales of its own evs by the way not other companies evs but tesla evs right because they have both the hardware and software to enable this level five unsupervised driving but it's also the foundation for what it recently announced i'm sure you saw the cyber cab announcement right pretty futuristic absolutely looking car self-driving car no brake no accelerator no steering wheel just a screen two seats that's it phenomenal right but now that you see how version 13 is working you can see that those cars will in fact work people are starting to really see what the long-term strategy is for tesla and now that they can see that technology is very real the rest the future revenues that are forecasted from things like the cyber cab you can also believe are coming as well and that's why the stock is running so high yeah this seems like just the beginning of the move for tesla with all of this future growth on the horizon i think this is such an interesting point about ai in general where the first versions of ai were not good on on any part whether it was image generation video generation the first versions everyone almost laughed at is this is never going to be good and now we're seeing it's phenomenal and i think that's the same thing with this tesla's version of ai and using it to make these self-driving vehicles you have really found some other companies that are really going to start taking off thanks to the self-driving technology correct yes so you know one of the things that i specialize in my own research and analysis is identifying these large technological trends and then of course uh

looking to invest in etfs in 2025 here's three picks that are set to take off this year here to break it all down for us is market beat analyst chris marut chris there are so many etfs out there it feels like there's new ones coming onto the market every day how do you narrow down which etfs to to invest in for many investors it might come down to whoever their fund manager is of choice whether that's vanguard or fidelity or whatever but even once you get into a specific company your choice of etf is largely going to depend on what your investment goal is so for many investors you could invest in an etf like the spy etf that tracks the s&amp;p 500 and call it a day and say okay well you know what it's going to the performance of that going to closely approximate the s&amp;p 500 and this year you would have come out with a gain of around you know 28% and you're doing really well and that's great some investors however like to use etfs to supplement individual stocks and so maybe they say well i'm i'm really happy with the performance of my portfolio overall but i'm hearing about a theme like ai i really think i want to get exposure to that but i really don't want to pick individual stocks an etf is a great way of getting involved in that and as you said there's more and more coming up almost every day it seems like there's almost as many etfs right now as there are individual stocks that you can choose from well you have been looking through some different etfs out there and have three picks for us today that you think are going to be really successful f in the new year let's start out with your first pick okay so my first one um it's it's probably the the the one that's got the funnest name to say it's called the the pacer us cash cows 100 etf and the ticker symbol is cows cz um so the thing about this etf bridget is the fund selects it's holding based on a company's free cash flow yield and so free cash flow is how much money a company has left after paying out all of their expenses including dividends and share buybacks and the companies in the cow's etf have more than double the market average fcf yield another reason why investors may want to get involved with this aside from just choosing companies that have a great cash position is that this fund specifically targets a lot of midcap stocks and if you look at a lot of investing portfolios they may cover large caps very well recently a lot of investors have been very interested in small caps but the midcap area that's i'm talking between 2 billion and 10 billion in market cap those aren't covered very well by most portfolios this etf does that so you're getting companies that have a strong cap position but are also in that midcap sector that are expected to do well in 2025 yeah i think this is an interesting uh etf out there because it's not like a specific industry this could be a company in any industry that just has this specific area of their books that's doing really really well what is the potential advantage for growth when you pick just companies that have such a good cash flow i would say you're probably going to be looking at performance that might be a little bit less than the market average because again these the companies in the cow's etf are not necessarily all heavy growth oriented companies but what you're lacking in that growth you're getting back in companies that are rock solid they're probably paying dividends and you're going to be getting probably a a very solid total return over time all right so your first pick is the safe bet uh what is your second etf pick like okay so the second one um is the global x us infrastructure development etf the ticker symbol is pave p a the focus of this etf is as the name implies it's looking at us manufacturing companies that are involved in building up the infrastructure of the country uh you'll recall that back in 2021 the us infrastructure act was signed into law that was followed up by the chips act in 2022 and so all of that money is starting to flow into the economy there's been some concern that infrastructure spending is going to slow as the incoming administration looks to maybe curb government spending a little bit but some of the spending in most of the spending in the infrastructure bill is already committed contractually into 2026 so 2025 looks like a year when it's still going to be very good for infrastructure spending and i think that's really what makes the bull case for the pavf in 2025 yeah this feels like it hs um a number of different industries and companies that could be impacted by helping to build up infrastructure right you're looking at um not just manufacturing companies but you're looking at utility companies you're looking at even probably some technology companies building out data centers in addition to things like roads and bridges and things like that so what kind of growth can investors expect from this etf the fund is up over 26% in 2024 and that's in line with the return from the s&amp;p 500 um again considering that the money for a lot of these projects is contractually obligated through 2025 i think that investors should expect performance that's pretty much in line with the s&amp;p 500 for next year and it's expected to be a good year for the s&amp;p 500 yeah i think everyone's excited about this good year ahead there's a lot of etfs you can pick with just a a good year anticipating ahead that are going to see some success but i'm excited to see your third pick and see if we have a little bit more of a growth etf in our picks absolutely so my last pick um is the ishar semiconductor etf and the ticker symbol is socks uh that's sxx we're still in the early stages of ai and i know that there's some investors that are kind of getting to the point of well maybe maybe ai is a bubble and all this but i i really don't believe that i think we're still in the very early stages of it in fact we're probably getting ready to pivot from what we would call ai 1.0 to maybe a 2.0 which is going to be focusing more on software and things no matter where we are though it we're going to need semiconductors 2024 has been a uneven year let's just say for semiconductor stocks some have done well some haven't done as well but i think you could say all of them even companies like nvidia and advanced micro devices the performance has been choppy it's been up and down that's expected to change in 201 25 we're supposed to be seeing more significant growth and more consistent growth the socks etf is a good way to play that you don't have to worry about picking any one individual stock it's a basket of stocks and it's all focused on the chip sector yeah the chip sector especially with the news that we might bring some of that chip manufacturing to the us yes constant demand and growth in this industry um does that make this a really high growth etf and how much growth are they expecting in 2025 it's actually underperformed the the s&amp;p 500 this year the growth in this fund's only been 11% but that's consistent with what i was saying it's it's been kind of an uneven year for chip stocks i would expect next year with chip stocks taking off i would expect this fund to outperform the s&amp;p 500 especially since stocks in this sector are supposed to be growing their earnings per share by 32% next year earnings growth is the biggest predictor of stock price growth so i think right now you want to front run this growth and that's why you want to get on the socks etf now yeah what's another potential benefit of choosing the etf over individual semiconductor stocks out there is the price point of entry a little bit less using the etf you know is it easier to get into some different pieces of these companies through the etf style for a lot of investors the best benefit of an etf is it smooths out your risk tolerance so instead of worrying about what nvidia might be doing doing or amd might be doing or qualcomm might be doing or micron might be doing for any one individual quarter you're spreading your risk out and over time you're going to find that everything balances out and you should be getting a return that's close to what the industry averages now again last year that was a little bit down compared to the s&amp;p 500 but i believe next year you're going to see that outpace the s&amp;p 500 awesome well thank you so much for three great etf picks for 2025 always appreciate having you on the channel chris and thank you for watching everyone

ticker symbol is cows cz um so the thing about this etf bridget is the fund selects it's holding based on a company's free cash flow yield and so free cash flow is how much money a company has left after paying out all of their expenses including dividends and share buybacks and the companies in the cow's etf have more than double the market average fcf yield another reason why investors may want to get involved with this aside from just choosing companies that have a great cash position is that this fund specifically targets a lot of midcap stocks and if you look at a lot of investing portfolios they may cover large caps very well recently a lot of investors have been very interested in small caps but the midcap area that's i'm talking between 2 billion and 10 billion in market cap those aren't covered very well by most portfolios this etf does that so you're getting companies that have a strong cap position but are also in that midcap sector that are expected to do well in 2025 yeah i think this is an interesting uh etf out there because it's not like a specific industry this could be a company in any industry that just has this specific area of their books that's doing really really well what is the potential advantage for growth when you pick just companies that have such a good cash flow i would say you're probably going to be looking at performance that might be a little bit less than the market average because again these the companies in the cow's etf are not necessarily all heavy growth oriented companies but what you're lacking in that growth you're getting back in companies that are rock solid they're probably paying dividends and you're going to be getting probably a a very solid total return over time all right so your first pick is the safe bet uh what is your second etf pick like okay so the second one um is the global x us infrastructure development etf the ticker symbol is pave p a the focus of this etf is as the name implies it's looking at us manufacturing companies that are involved in building up the infrastructure of the country uh you'll recall that back in 2021 the us infrastructure act was signed into law that was followed up by the chips act in 2022 and so all of that money is starting to flow into the economy there's been some concern that infrastructure spending is going to slow as the incoming administration looks to maybe curb government spending a little bit but some of the spending in most of the spending in the infrastructure bill is already committed contractually into 2026 so 2025 looks like a year when it's still going to be very good for infrastructure spending and i think that's really what makes the bull case for the pavf in 2025 yeah this feels like it hs um a number of different industries and companies that could be impacted by helping to build up infrastructure right you're looking at um not just manufacturing companies but you're looking at utility companies you're looking at even probably some technology companies building out data centers in addition to things like roads and bridges and things like that so what kind of growth can investors expect from this etf the fund is up over 26% in 2024 and that's in line with the return from the s&amp;p 500 um again considering that the money for a lot of these projects is contractually obligated through 2025 i think that investors should expect performance that's pretty much in line with the s&amp;p 500 for next year and it's expected to be a good year for the s&amp;p 500 yeah i think everyone's excited about this good year ahead there's a lot of etfs you can pick with just a a good year anticipating ahead that are going to see some success but i'm excited to see your third pick and see if we have a little bit more of a growth etf in our picks absolutely so my last pick um is the ishar semiconductor etf and the ticker symbol is socks uh that's sxx we're still in the early stages of ai and i know that there's some investors that are kind of getting to the point of well maybe maybe ai is a bubble and all this but i i really don't believe that i think we're still in the very early stages of it in fact we're probably getting ready to pivot from what we would call ai 1.0 to maybe a 2.0 which is going to be focusing more on software and things no matter where we are though it we're going to need semiconductors 2024 has been a uneven year let's just say for semiconductor stocks some have done well some haven't done as well but i think you could say all of them even companies like nvidia and advanced micro devices the performance has been choppy it's been up and down that's expected to change in 201 25 we're supposed to be seeing more significant growth and more consistent growth the socks etf is a good way to play that you don't have to worry about picking any one individual stock it's a basket of stocks and it's all focused on the chip sector yeah the chip sector especially with the news that we might bring some of that chip manufacturing to the us yes constant demand and growth in this industry um does that make this a really high growth etf and how much growth are they expecting in 2025 it's actually underperformed the the s&amp;p 500 this year the growth in this fund's only been 11% but that's consistent with what i was saying it's it's been kind of an uneven year for chip stocks i would expect next year with chip stocks taking off i would expect this fund to outperform the s&amp;p 500 especially since stocks in this sector are supposed to be growing their earnings per share by 32% next year earnings growth is the biggest predictor of stock price growth so i think right now you want to front run this growth and that's why you want to get on the socks etf now yeah what's another potential benefit of choosing the etf over individual semiconductor stocks out there is the price point of entry a little bit less using the etf you know is it easier to get into some different pieces of these companies through the etf style for a lot of investors the best benefit of an etf is it smooths out your risk tolerance so instead of worrying about what nvidia might be doing doing or amd might be doing or qualcomm might be doing or micron might be doing for any one individual quarter you're spreading your risk out and over time you're going to find that everything balances out and you should be getting a return that's close to what the industry averages now again last year that was a little bit down compared to the s&amp;p 500 but i believe next year you're going to see that outpace the s&amp;p 500 awesome well thank you so much for three great etf picks for 2025 always appreciate having you on the channel chris and thank you for watching everyone

looking to invest in etfs in 2025 here's three picks that are set to take off this year here to break it all down for us is market beat analyst chris marut chris there are so many etfs out there it feels like there's new ones coming onto the market every day how do you narrow down which etfs to to invest in for many investors it might come down to whoever their fund manager is of choice whether that's vanguard or fidelity or whatever but even once you get into a specific company your choice of etf is largely going to depend on what your investment goal is so for many investors you could invest in an etf like the spy etf that tracks the s&amp;p 500 and call it a day and say okay well you know what it's going to the performance of that going to closely approximate the s&amp;p 500 and this year you would have come out with a gain of around you know 28% and you're doing really well and that's great some investors however like to use etfs to supplement individual stocks and so maybe they say well i'm i'm really happy with the performance of my portfolio overall but i'm hearing about a theme like ai i really think i want to get exposure to that but i really don't want to pick individual stocks an etf is a great way of getting involved in that and as you said there's more and more coming up almost every day it seems like there's almost as many etfs right now as there are individual stocks that you can choose from well you have been looking through some different etfs out there and have three picks for us today that you think are going to be really successful f in the new year let's start out with your first pick okay so my first one um it's it's probably the the the one that's got the funnest name to say it's called the the pacer us cash cows 100 etf and the ticker symbol is cows cz um so the thing about this etf bridget is the fund selects it's holding based on a company's free cash flow yield and so free cash flow is how much money a company has left after paying out all of their expenses including dividends and share buybacks and the companies in the cow's etf have more than double the market average fcf yield another reason why investors may want to get involved with this aside from just choosing companies that have a great cash position is that this fund specifically targets a lot of midcap stocks and if you look at a lot of investing portfolios they may cover large caps very well recently a lot of investors have been very interested in small caps but the midcap area that's i'm talking between 2 billion and 10 billion in market cap those aren't covered very well by most portfolios this etf does that so you're getting companies that have a strong cap position but are also in that midcap sector that are expected to do well in 2025 yeah i think this is an interesting uh etf out there because it's not like a specific industry this could be a company in any industry that just has this specific area of their books that's doing really really well what is the potential advantage for growth when you pick just companies that have such a good cash flow i would say you're probably going to be looking at performance that might be a little bit less than the market average because again these the companies in the cow's etf are not necessarily all heavy growth oriented companies but what you're lacking in that growth you're getting back in companies that are rock solid they're probably paying dividends and you're going to be getting probably a a very solid total return over time all right so your first pick is the safe bet uh what is your second etf pick like okay so the second one um is the global x us infrastructure development etf the ticker symbol is pave p a the focus of this etf is as the name implies it's looking at us manufacturing companies that are involved in building up the infrastructure of the country uh you'll recall that back in 2021 the us infrastructure act was signed into law that was followed up by the chips act in 2022 and so all of that money is starting to flow into the economy there's been some concern that infrastructure spending is going to slow as the incoming administration looks to maybe curb government spending a little bit but some of the spending in most of the spending in the infrastructure bill is already committed contractually into 2026 so 2025 looks like a year when it's still going to be very good for infrastructure spending and i think that's really what makes the bull case for the pavf in 2025 yeah this feels like it hs um a number of different industries and companies that could be impacted by helping to build up infrastructure right you're looking at um not just manufacturing companies but you're looking at utility companies you're looking at even probably some technology companies building out data centers in addition to things like roads and bridges and things like that so what kind of growth can investors expect from this etf the fund is up over 26% in 2024 and that's in line with the return from the s&amp;p 500 um again considering that the money for a lot of these projects is contractually obligated through 2025 i think that investors should expect performance that's pretty much in line with the s&amp;p 500 for next year and it's expected to be a good year for the s&amp;p 500 yeah i think everyone's excited about this good year ahead there's a lot of etfs you can pick with just a a good year anticipating ahead that are going to see some success but i'm excited to see your third pick and see if we have a little bit more of a growth etf in our picks absolutely so my last pick um is the ishar semiconductor etf and the ticker symbol is socks uh that's sxx we're still in the early stages of ai and i know that there's some investors that are kind of getting to the point of well maybe maybe ai is a bubble and all this but i i really don't believe that i think we're still in the very early stages of it in fact we're probably getting ready to pivot from what we would call ai 1.0 to maybe a 2.0 which is going to be focusing more on software and things no matter where we are though it we're going to need semiconductors 2024 has been a uneven year let's just say for semiconductor stocks some have done well some haven't done as well but i think you could say all of them even companies like nvidia and advanced micro devices the performance has been choppy it's been up and down that's expected to change in 201 25 we're supposed to be seeing more significant growth and more consistent growth the socks etf is a good way to play that you don't have to worry about picking any one individual stock it's a basket of stocks and it's all focused on the chip sector yeah the chip sector especially with the news that we might bring some of that chip manufacturing to the us yes constant demand and growth in this industry um does that make this a really high growth etf and how much growth are they expecting in 2025 it's actually underperformed the the s&amp;p 500 this year the growth in this fund's only been 11% but that's consistent with what i was saying it's it's been kind of an uneven year for chip stocks i would expect next year with chip stocks taking off i would expect this fund to outperform the s&amp;p 500 especially since stocks in this sector are supposed to be growing their earnings per share by 32% next year earnings growth is the biggest predictor of stock price growth so i think right now you want to front run this growth and that's why you want to get on the socks etf now yeah what's another potential benefit of choosing the etf over individual semiconductor stocks out there is the price point of entry a little bit less using the etf you know is it easier to get into some different pieces of these companies through the etf style for a lot of investors the best benefit of an etf is it smooths out your risk tolerance so instead of worrying about what nvidia might be doing doing or amd might be doing or qualcomm might be doing or micron might be doing for any one individual quarter you're spreading your risk out and over time you're going to find that everything balances out and you should be getting a return that's close to what the industry averages now again last year that was a little bit down compared to the s&amp;p 500 but i believe next year you're going to see that outpace the s&amp;p 500 awesome well thank you so much for three great etf picks for 2025 always appreciate having you on the channel chris and thank you for watching everyone

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,vaDn0YWJRgI,MarketBeat,2024-12-17 21:15:15+00:00,Broadcom’s Stock Surge: AI Growth and Custom Chips Drive 30% Gains,kind: captions language: en broadcom up 30% since last week's earnings report here to break it all down for us is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas this is a really exciting time for broadcom fans yeah it is um the earnings report was pretty good it was mixed relative to the analyst sentiment or the analyst expectations but they set the bar very high and despite having mixed results revenue grew 50% that's pretty big that's pretty good and earnings grew by 30% earnings growth lagged a little bit but there are some one-off factors that were impacting this this quarter's earnings um but really what it is is the forward outlook the forward outlook for revenue growth is pretty robust and margins are expected to rewi yeah i think that is what we're seeing in this stock surge right now is people just excited investors excited about the future of this company right so the results kind of gave us some more confidence in the existing growth outlook and then the company compounded that by giving a growth outlook or um a forecast for an addressable maret market growth for custom chips so that's just one small part of their business but the forecast for custom chips is that the addressable market might reach 75 billion within the next three years now if that's true and they capture that market they're going to more than double their business in the next three years which is a pretty good driver for stock prices yeah absolutely we like to hear doubling i think every investor likes that thomas it's been a couple of months since we've even covered broadcom on this channel uh why has this stock been kind kind of quiet for the past few months it's in position to capture some ai business but it was kind of slow to get traction um unlike nvidia which has been the real story for the last couple years but right now what we're seeing is the the ai spending ai traction is starting to move outside from nvidia where you need nvidia's chips in your data centers but you need broadcom's chips and broadcom's software to run the data centers and to help scale your ai so the two things kind of go hand inand now that companies have secured their supply or their future supplies of nvidia chips now they're securing their supplies of broadcom products to make those chips work and we talk a lot about competition in this ai field where everyone is growing so so fast is broadcom becoming a real competitor um as much as nvidia right so part of the broadcom story is their purchase of vmware last year uh vmware is a software company they specialize in the cloud they're important for cloud infrastructure and for scaling ai and for implementing ai and so that's where a lot of the growth is coming from and that's where a lot of the forward outlook is coming from and you've said a lot of different factors about ai where just investing in ai can be a little confusing but market be has a free special report out there right now it's called seven ai stocks to invest in and really how to invest in the whole ai industry check out our free special report by scanning the qr code or look in the comment for the link to that free report right now uh thomas you talk about ai stocks and ai investing all the time we talk about it quite a bit on this channel and broadcom is no exception this is a company that we are going to continue to see a lot of growth but i want to know just how much growth are analysts expecting for broadcom well we're looking at a sustained high double digigit growth rate for the next couple years i think the forecast for next year is for another 50% growth and one of the things that's really got the market excited with this long-term outlook for custom chip growth is that right now broadcom only sells to like two or three of the five or six major hyperscalers so that's about half the hyperscale half the data center market and they could acquire the others over the next couple years and if they did that that would significantly increase what is already a very robust market outlook yeah absolutely and you just wrote an article talking about could the magnificent seven really become a magnificent eight do you think broadcom has the capacity to potentially get to that major level yeah i think it did that on monday i think it gained another five or six% just that day and has now reached the trillion dollar mark i think that uh the acquisition of vmware and the lean into the software side of ai along with the semiconductors kind of establishes it along the lines of nvidia which is also a full stack ai company i think that broadcom has established itself as central to ai important to ai infrastructure and a major player that will be significant for the next 5 10 15 years yeah well broadcom might already already be trading at a new premium just how high are analysts expecting this stock to go well the analyst response has been pretty robust since the report came out we've tracked at least a dozen revisions on market beats website uh the consensus price target right now is lagging the market but the revisions lifted the consensus by 15% overnight and the high-end range is pointed to 250 255 which is another 10 to 15% upside and i think that the way that momentum is building with the business and the expectation for future results we should expect the revision trend to remain positive through next year and continue lifting the stock uh because one of the things that i've taken from the analyst chatter is that they're expecting more of the good news to come out in the second half of next year which just sets us up for a really long and sustained analyst upgrade cycle that could last well into 2026 and when we're talking about so much excitement over future outlook and future growth for this company does that mean a lot of the moves behind the stock price surge right now are really those long-term investors jumping in or is there still some short-term gains coming in on this stock right now i would say it's some of both it's there's definitely an uptrend in play that short-term traders were able to capture they're probably going to start taking profits pretty soon um the long-term investors are also in this stock i would assume that the long-term investors would wait for the stock price to pull back a little bit from these new highs before they start putting in more money do you think that pullback is really just inevitable when we see a surge this big well well yeah it's part of market mechanics um when it happens where it happens how deep it gets is the question in in that regard but a pullback will happen it's just a matter of uh when it happens what causes it and if you're ready for it when it happens all right thanks so much for the analysis today thomas and thank you for

broadcom up 30% since last week's earnings report here to break it all down for us is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas this is a really exciting time for broadcom fans yeah it is um the earnings report was pretty good it was mixed relative to the analyst sentiment or the analyst expectations but they set the bar very high and despite having mixed results revenue grew 50% that's pretty big that's pretty good and earnings grew by 30% earnings growth lagged a little bit but there are some one-off factors that were impacting this this quarter's earnings um but really what it is is the forward outlook the forward outlook for revenue growth is pretty robust and margins are expected to rewi yeah i think that is what we're seeing in this stock surge right now is people just excited investors excited about the future of this company right so the results kind of gave us some more confidence in the existing growth outlook and then the company compounded that by giving a growth outlook or um a forecast for an addressable maret market growth for custom chips so that's just one small part of their business but the forecast for custom chips is that the addressable market might reach 75 billion within the next three years now if that's true and they capture that market they're going to more than double their business in the next three years which is a pretty good driver for stock prices yeah absolutely we like to hear doubling i think every investor likes that thomas it's been a couple of months since we've even covered broadcom on this channel uh why has this stock been kind kind of quiet for the past few months it's in position to capture some ai business but it was kind of slow to get traction um unlike nvidia which has been the real story for the last couple years but right now what we're seeing is the the ai spending ai traction is starting to move outside from nvidia where you need nvidia's chips in your data centers but you need broadcom's chips and broadcom's software to run the data centers and to help scale your ai so the two things kind of go hand inand now that companies have secured their supply or their future supplies of nvidia chips now they're securing their supplies of broadcom products to make those chips work and we talk a lot about competition in this ai field where everyone is growing so so fast is broadcom becoming a real competitor um as much as nvidia right so part of the broadcom story is their purchase of vmware last year uh vmware is a software company they specialize in the cloud they're important for cloud infrastructure and for scaling ai and for implementing ai and so that's where a lot of the growth is coming from and that's where a lot of the forward outlook is coming from and you've said a lot of different factors about ai where just investing in ai can be a little confusing but market be has a free special report out there right now it's called seven ai stocks to invest in and really how to invest in the whole ai industry check out our free special report by scanning the qr code or look in the comment for the link to that free report right now uh thomas you talk about ai stocks and ai investing all the time we talk about it quite a bit on this channel and broadcom is no exception this is a company that we are going to continue to see a lot of growth but i want to know just how much growth are analysts expecting for broadcom well we're looking at a sustained high double digigit growth rate for the next couple years i think the forecast for next year is for another 50% growth and one of the things that's really got the market excited with this long-term outlook for custom chip growth is that right now broadcom only sells to like two or three of the five or six major hyperscalers so that's about half the hyperscale half the data center market and they could acquire the others over the next couple years and if they did that that would significantly increase what is already a very robust market outlook yeah absolutely and you just wrote an article talking about could the magnificent seven really become a magnificent eight do you think broadcom has the capacity to potentially get to that major level yeah i think it did that on monday i think it gained another five or six% just that day and has now reached the trillion dollar mark i think that uh the acquisition of vmware and the lean into the software side of ai along with the semiconductors kind of establishes it along the lines of nvidia which is also a full stack ai company i think that broadcom has established itself as central to ai important to ai infrastructure and a major player that will be significant for the next 5 10 15 years yeah well broadcom might already already be trading at a new premium just how high are analysts expecting this stock to go well the analyst response has been pretty robust since the report came out we've tracked at least a dozen revisions on market beats website uh the consensus price target right now is lagging the market but the revisions lifted the consensus by 15% overnight and the high-end range is pointed to 250 255 which is another 10 to 15% upside and i think that the way that momentum is building with the business and the expectation for future results we should expect the revision trend to remain positive through next year and continue lifting the stock uh because one of the things that i've taken from the analyst chatter is that they're expecting more of the good news to come out in the second half of next year which just sets us up for a really long and sustained analyst upgrade cycle that could last well into 2026 and when we're talking about so much excitement over future outlook and future growth for this company does that mean a lot of the moves behind the stock price surge right now are really those long-term investors jumping in or is there still some short-term gains coming in on this stock right now i would say it's some of both it's there's definitely an uptrend in play that short-term traders were able to capture they're probably going to start taking profits pretty soon um the long-term investors are also in this stock i would assume that the long-term investors would wait for the stock price to pull back a little bit from these new highs before they start putting in more money do you think that pullback is really just inevitable when we see a surge this big well well yeah it's part of market mechanics um when it happens where it happens how deep it gets is the question in in that regard but a pullback will happen it's just a matter of uh when it happens what causes it and if you're ready for it when it happens all right thanks so much for the analysis today thomas and thank you for

here to break it down for us is marketbeat analyst thomas hughes. thomas, we were talking about this stock just one week ago, but then it started surging yet again on friday. it did. this market is is really um almost out of control. it's really surging to to new high levels. and i see it right now on monday. it's opened up. it gapped open to trade just below the previous all-time high. and i see the market at a pretty important turning point. and when you say turning point, where do you think this stock could go? well, that's kind of the question right now. um, if we can get above the previous all-time high and set a new all-time high, i see the stock moving up to $36, doubling from 18. that's very possible. however, there's a chance that it could be cath at $18 and remain rangebound for the next few weeks, months, or quarters. let's talk about some of those factors that could keep this stock rangebound. i know one of them is all that short interest the stock has seen over the past few months, right? uh we just got the short report for the end of november and short interest at the end of november was 25%. so that's more than doubled the previous month. short interest ramped higher over the course of the last few months to a new high. so part of the uh the stock surge is short covering and the question right now is if the shorts are going to stay out of the market or if they're going to reposition now that the stock is back at those all-time highs. yeah, that is very high short interest for this stock right now. and if you are new to figuring out how to trade these kinds of high short interest stocks, check out this free report from marketbeat. you can scan the qr code or click the link in the description to read our report, how to play high short interest stocks. do you think there's real value behind the big growth in this stock price right now? or is it really a lot of that short interest? i think a lot of it is a short interest. that's why the stock price got up so high so quickly. you can see in the analyst sentiment they've been upgrading the stock and lifting their price targets, but their prices had this stock pegged around eight or nine $10. now, very recently, we've gotten an upgrade, an update from wed bush. that's dan ies. he's big in tech. we like to follow him. he more than doubled his price target to $22. that puts us at a new all-time high. so, it looks like the analysts are leading us to to new highs. uh the question is if the market will cooperate. yeah, i think that really is the question, thomas. the stock up 80% in the past month, up almost 200% just in the last quarter. that attracts a lot of traders looking to to make a profit off of such a big surge that it's hard to know if the surge is really going to be sustainable. do you think there's enough long-term fans of this stock to keep this stock rising? i think that the long-term fans are growing. you can also see that in the stock price action. if you look on the chart, especially the weekly bars, you can see that over the course of the last year, 18 months, we've had two major stock price upswings. both of them marked by wickedly high volume. that high volume is in part short covering, but it's also new interest, new investors getting into the market. uh, and one of the things you kind of alluded to this that might also cap the gains. people have made a lot of money the last few weeks in the last few months. and so, it's possible that profit taking will also cap gains. and again, the question is, what is the long-term outlook and if it can continue to lift the stock price? and i think that answer is yes. yeah, we heard that from some of our viewers this last week when you and i were talking about soundtown again just one week ago when the stock had surged and now it's doing it again. but we had a few people, a few viewers thinking this stock would easily hit 36 in the next year. do you think that's a reasonable price target? i think it is because right now the stock is in a hyperrowth phase. it's a revenues about a hundred million a year i think. um hyper growth growth phase where it's supposed to grow by 100% next year. um it is one of the leading implementers of ai services. it's been gaining traction. its voice recognition and automation services are really helping businesses. so i think that it's really going to start uh to build on its on its traction and to gain momentum with the business over the next year. all right. so is there any chance in a week we're going to be talking about another surge with this stock? oh, i think it's totally possible. yeah, i think plenty of our viewers would love to see that happen. thanks, thomas, again for breaking down this stock for us this week. we'd love to hear what you think. are you in sound for the long term, and how high do you think it could go? or are you more of those short-term investors looking to make some profit off of sound's big surge right now? let us know your thoughts in the comments. and if you're wondering more about this company, we've talked about it plenty on this channel. check out some of our previous videos on sound hound and why this company is growing so much right now and some of the reasons behind this current stock surge. thanks again for watching marketbeat and as always, happy investing.

language: en a financial technology company up 78% in the last 6 months let's dive into this week's ceo [music] series today we are excited to have kent landvatter the ceo of finwise borp with us today thank you so much for coming on our channel it's great to be here bridget um i'm excited to do this podcast and i've been watching your stuff for a while and it's it's really fun to be here today oh wonderful f love that let's talk about what is finwise and how long have you guys been around well the company actually started in 2000 i came in 2010 and i have always been interested in the nexus between technology and banking and i thought there would be a real interesting play for this company to move in more of a fintech side of the business and that's what we did standing it up fully in 2016 and been doing it for eight years now yeah that's great and you went public just a couple of years ago is that right three years ago uh last month actually your stock has seen quite a lot of success in the last year we're going to get to that in just a little bit but first let's talk more about uh what your company does so who are some of the customers that you serve one of our primary focuses as i mentioned is fintech business where we provide fintechs with banking solutions they could be lending payments deposits what have you and uh we also have traditional lines of business sba we have a national sba 7a program we have national commercial leasing point of sell but our main focus right now is on the fintech side there seems to be a lot of uh growing competitors in this space too uh talk about that a little bit like what's the market like for fintech financing that's a really good question there have been a few banks in the space that have fallen out lately because of regulatory oversight uh concerns that they may have seen uh it's quite difficult to stand up a bank in this environment uh to appropriately manage the fintech uh in a way that's safe for the customers and compliant with all the regulations and so forth so we started in 2016 building out a real strong system and a scalable apid driven infrastructure that collects all the data that we need to properly oversee these partners and we have a significant staff in fact about 40% of our staff is devoted focus completely focused on the management of these relation ship when i think of the competitor space out there i really think of those banks that are really doing a significant focus and dedicating the appropriate resources the exciting thing for us is there isn't a lot of competition right now because this is a difficult uh product to stand up so competition for us um we actually almost look more at some of the other banks in the space as collegial uh participants in the space because we're trying to all do it right and make certain um we're providing the right services in the right way yeah let's talk about that a little bit more what about finwise uh makes you really proud to be the ceo of this company what kind of sets your business practices apart from others in this field from a strategic positioning i think it was our early focus on let's make certain if we're getting into space to invest appropriately and make certain that the tools are in um in place and working to oversee these fintech partnerships in a way that makes the banking regulators happy and serves the customer well for us that's been a strategic thing that's uh contributed to this success that i'm very proud of but i think what i'm most proud of is the team that we've been able to assemble we've got i would say hundreds of years of experience in this space from people all over the country who are part of the finwise team and it's their success really that has stood up these strategies and visions of the company and uh done so in a very very profitable way for us yeah absolutely and it's been profitable for your investors too especially this past year your stock price went from trading around $8 earlier in the year to now up around $18 uh really good payoffs again a good investment for investors out there what's behind the success in your stock price there are a few things and i i can't pretend to guess them all but i think what it is is we've been telling the same story for uh since we've been public and uh we continue to execute on that story so we do what we say uh we're going to do and i think um because of some of the uncertainty around the regulatory oversights of the the some of the banks that have not um been able to navigate the waters uh as well you know there there's been some uncertainty but as you know we've been in the space for eight years now and uh we we kind of know we're doing and we're very very focused and on on regulatory compliance i think that message is getting out to stockholders another thing too that we're very excited about so over the last couple years we have been building out infrastructure to uh further expand our fintech offerings you know offering basically a payment we've developed a payments hub which uh we call money rails but it basically will move money on all the different platforms ac fed now rtp and so forth it will move money for our fintech partners and it's apid driven so that they can customize things on their side to optimize it so we think that's going to be uh an exciting ad for 2025 we've also added card sponsorships where we do debit cards credit cards and so forth for our fintech partners and finally we're expanding our balance sheet by adding what we call credit enhanced balance sheet but it's basically a way for us to provide some of our balance sheet or more of our balance sheet to some of our fintech partners that want to put loans or deposits here in a safe way let's talk about the books just a little bit more still considered i guess a small cap company but doing well in revenue let's talk about some of those logistics that our investors care about so much since we've gone public the tangible book value has grown significantly every year and um when compared to our bank peers and when compared to fintech brands we've uh done really well and so our tangible book value continues to grow even over the last year or two where we've been focused on building out these additional products and and the people to support those products we've been uh very profitable we have very respectable return on assets compared to other banks and and uh net interest margins so those key factors i think are really building some excitement around the the stock yeah and i think uh economically as well it feels like right now is a time when people are really into the financial sector i think we saw right after the election um that whole industry the financial industry kind of see a little bit of a boost in the market as well does that make you excited about the future in any way oh yes well even with uh before the change in the administration i i felt very excited about the future because there are really two sides of banking there's a traditional that you everybody knows about and have tr have done a great job of serving communities and so forth but there's been this evolution i believe over the last 10 15 years where people have moved more and more to online banking to be part of that wave is very exciting and so i think as people investors look more and more at banks you know they can almost put them in two categories or traditional banks that they are used to seeing but then these new fintech or technology enabled banks that are delivering products to consumers and businesses um in a much more convenient way a much more useful way and actually providing greater access to banking services i think we've had a really good conversation about your company but i do want to end today by just talking about what are you most excited about in the next year ahead and the future of your company even beyond the next year uh do you see the growth trajectory still continuing for finwise i am so excited about it you know these new products that we're adding are going to um add different profit drivers that diversify the c revenue streams we have and uh build our balance sheet out so we can grow more effectively on the balance sheet but once again just writing the wave of this innovative uh space to me right now is is very exciting and

en if you are looking to add real estate investing to your portfolio reits are a great way to get started today we're excited to have renowned reit expert brad thomas with us he's the founder of wide mode research and has actually authored three books all about real estate investing brad it's so great to have you on our channel today we're excited to share some of your top reate stock picks with our viewers here on market beats sure well i'll say you know obviously if i were going to rec in one re i'll tell you which one it is but i'm also going to give you a disclaimer i would never own just one reit i think diversification is extremely important uh for for any investor but there's one company that i'm very very bullish about today and i do on the shares full disclosure uh this company's called reality income and their ticker symbol is o uh just one one letter uh they're based in in california they're they're net lease landlord and net lease means they own pro individual properties freestanding properties lease to companies like dollar general or walgreens are 711 um and they've got a massive portfolio they are the largest net lease landlord in the world um so they have you know uh thousands and thousands of properties scattered across all 50 states as well as europe they've expanded over the last few years into europe there are two kind of competitive advantage that i'll site again our company's called wide mode research so we like to to talk about you know competitive advantages one of those is scale i just mentioned the the enormous size of the company uh they got a large footprint which means their exposure to one individual tenant is is very small uh their their exposure to one tenant is about three and a half% of the portfolio give an example how that how that's effective during covid they had uh they have exposure to theaters and gyms and of course those two categories were really hurt hard during co people wouldn't go to couldn't go to the gym uh and obviously people didn't go to the theaters during co but but this still continue to deliver uh not only um u you know consistent earnings but they were able to grow their earnings during even during co and they were grow they grew their dividend uh during co so that demonstrates that they have a very broad diversification which uh when some companies don't pay rent or they do have you know problems within their portfolio they're able to continue to deliver on pro their promises to investors which is to pay dividends by the way this company they're they're actually trademarked the monthly div div company so they pay monthly dividends and they also increase very consistently their are dividend aristocrat they they've increased dividends every year as a public company for 30 years in a row so i think scale is is one that i mentioned the other uh advantage competitive advantage is their cost of capital they work very hard to to achieve an a-rated balance sheet um so they have a very low uh cost of of debt they're also able to utilize currency in europe which is actually lower cost debt than they have in the us in terms of valuation which is arguably the most important part of our research at wide moot research is to study and really understand you know what is the margin of safety in the words of benjamin graham and so we looked at the company's valuation what they're trading at currently based on multiple valuation metrics and then we look at you know kind of how they've been traded historically how they've traded with a peer group uh and and we find them extremely extremely cheap right now a lot of that is just simp it's overhang due to um you know rising rates it's it's it's it's it's an over overhang due to the fact we've seen a lot of these headlines with with um loans that are becoming due uh again real estate income has no problem with with debt maturities hence the you know a rated balance sheet i mentioned and so um you know i think that in terms of a value perspective we think there's a really good op total return set up in place right now for real income to generate not only consistent dividends uh and growing dividends but a really nice and attractive total return uh setup going forward so that's kind of my probably one of my number one picks right now and i'm happy to touch on some more if you' like yeah why don't you give us a quick list of maybe another top three reats that people can look into um i really appreciate the big in-depth analysis and i think you can find a lot more analysis just like this on uh wide mode research i know you do this for a lot of different companies and stocks and reads out there u but why don't you give us your quick list of your your other top three picks of rats to look into yeah another one that that is is kind of a close peer to reala income is a company called vich vici vich is also a freestanding property landlord but but very different from reality income the average size of their their properties are are massive they own you know as i mentioned casinos the caesar's palace in las vegas a number of property another number of casinos uh on the strip there in las vegas they've also expanded beyond casinos into other kind of experiential type properties investing in amusement parks and bowling alleys and things like that so um again this is a newer company they haven't been around as long their their their track record is not as impressive as the one i just mentioned with reality income um but but we think that opportunity is really in in good place you we interview management teams of all the companies we research we think they got a really good management team u they've been able to reduce their cost of capital u they were the at the quickest reate to obtain s&amp;p 500 status than any re ever in the history so they're growing at a massive rate they're also undervalued and again that's a way to have access to some of these very iconic properties um um so i think beachi would be one that i would consider the other one i like a lot is pagis pagis again looking at kind of the compet pagis plld is the ticker there uh pagis is one of the largest warehous or logistics landlords uh in in the world uh they own properties all over us and and many other other countries uh again look at citing some of those same competitive advantages that i just spoke about realage income they also have an a-rated balance sheet they have massive scale and they're also trading at a discount one of the things i like about pris as well as the other industrial companies is their growth prospects are are much higher um real income is only projected to grow by around 4% per year um and um and and peris is going to grow by u smaller uh double digits so maybe 10 11 12% uh per year so youve got more growth opportunity but you don't have that the dividend is not going to be as high as it is with with real income so i like i think those companies are really attractive the shopping center space is really attractive um i like the mall sector is kind of an interesting place to play simon is the big u you know the big you know thousand pound gorilla if you will they they are uh also a-rated great management team and again they're the leading mall owner in the in the world they also own the outlets as well so ticker symbols spg i like tanger uh that's the pure play uh outlet center re ticker skt but they're extremely expensive right now so i would wait for a pullback with tanger again they've done a great job getting that share price up but uh i would not recommend owning shares in tanger today just given the what i think is the lofty valuation well those are all some really great stock tips for our viewers to look into thank you again for the great picks today and the anal is of more of what's going on in the sector uh where can people find more of information from you and get more info from wide moe research absolutely our website is right there widot research.com and um you know we're really excited about 2025 i think there's going to be some really good opportunities and again our our our our mantra for the firm is protecting principle at all costs we like to talk about swan investing that's sleeping well at night so i think you know by looking at our research at white research i think that's definitely a way to sleep well at night and we we try to avoid the volatility and again uh principal preservation is really important so valuation and i can't under underestimate the importance of valuation great well thank you

en if you are looking to add real estate investing to your portfolio reits are a great way to get started today we're excited to have renowned reit expert brad thomas with us he's the founder of wide mode research and has actually authored three books all about real estate investing brad it's so great to have you on our channel today we're excited to share some of your top reate stock picks with our viewers here on market beats sure well i'll say you know obviously if i were going to rec in one re i'll tell you which one it is but i'm also going to give you a disclaimer i would never own just one reit i think diversification is extremely important uh for for any investor but there's one company that i'm very very bullish about today and i do on the shares full disclosure uh this company's called reality income and their ticker symbol is o uh just one one letter uh they're based in in california they're they're net lease landlord and net lease means they own pro individual properties freestanding properties lease to companies like dollar general or walgreens are 711 um and they've got a massive portfolio they are the largest net lease landlord in the world um so they have you know uh thousands and thousands of properties scattered across all 50 states as well as europe they've expanded over the last few years into europe there are two kind of competitive advantage that i'll site again our company's called wide mode research so we like to to talk about you know competitive advantages one of those is scale i just mentioned the the enormous size of the company uh they got a large footprint which means their exposure to one individual tenant is is very small uh their their exposure to one tenant is about three and a half% of the portfolio give an example how that how that's effective during covid they had uh they have exposure to theaters and gyms and of course those two categories were really hurt hard during co people wouldn't go to couldn't go to the gym uh and obviously people didn't go to the theaters during co but but this still continue to deliver uh not only um u you know consistent earnings but they were able to grow their earnings during even during co and they were grow they grew their dividend uh during co so that demonstrates that they have a very broad diversification which uh when some companies don't pay rent or they do have you know problems within their portfolio they're able to continue to deliver on pro their promises to investors which is to pay dividends by the way this company they're they're actually trademarked the monthly div div company so they pay monthly dividends and they also increase very consistently their are dividend aristocrat they they've increased dividends every year as a public company for 30 years in a row so i think scale is is one that i mentioned the other uh advantage competitive advantage is their cost of capital they work very hard to to achieve an a-rated balance sheet um so they have a very low uh cost of of debt they're also able to utilize currency in europe which is actually lower cost debt than they have in the us in terms of valuation which is arguably the most important part of our research at wide moot research is to study and really understand you know what is the margin of safety in the words of benjamin graham and so we looked at the company's valuation what they're trading at currently based on multiple valuation metrics and then we look at you know kind of how they've been traded historically how they've traded with a peer group uh and and we find them extremely extremely cheap right now a lot of that is just simp it's overhang due to um you know rising rates it's it's it's it's it's an over overhang due to the fact we've seen a lot of these headlines with with um loans that are becoming due uh again real estate income has no problem with with debt maturities hence the you know a rated balance sheet i mentioned and so um you know i think that in terms of a value perspective we think there's a really good op total return set up in place right now for real income to generate not only consistent dividends uh and growing dividends but a really nice and attractive total return uh setup going forward so that's kind of my probably one of my number one picks right now and i'm happy to touch on some more if you' like yeah why don't you give us a quick list of maybe another top three reats that people can look into um i really appreciate the big in-depth analysis and i think you can find a lot more analysis just like this on uh wide mode research i know you do this for a lot of different companies and stocks and reads out there u but why don't you give us your quick list of your your other top three picks of rats to look into yeah another one that that is is kind of a close peer to reala income is a company called vich vici vich is also a freestanding property landlord but but very different from reality income the average size of their their properties are are massive they own you know as i mentioned casinos the caesar's palace in las vegas a number of property another number of casinos uh on the strip there in las vegas they've also expanded beyond casinos into other kind of experiential type properties investing in amusement parks and bowling alleys and things like that so um again this is a newer company they haven't been around as long their their their track record is not as impressive as the one i just mentioned with reality income um but but we think that opportunity is really in in good place you we interview management teams of all the companies we research we think they got a really good management team u they've been able to reduce their cost of capital u they were the at the quickest reate to obtain s&amp;p 500 status than any re ever in the history so they're growing at a massive rate they're also undervalued and again that's a way to have access to some of these very iconic properties um um so i think beachi would be one that i would consider the other one i like a lot is pagis pagis again looking at kind of the compet pagis plld is the ticker there uh pagis is one of the largest warehous or logistics landlords uh in in the world uh they own properties all over us and and many other other countries uh again look at citing some of those same competitive advantages that i just spoke about realage income they also have an a-rated balance sheet they have massive scale and they're also trading at a discount one of the things i like about pris as well as the other industrial companies is their growth prospects are are much higher um real income is only projected to grow by around 4% per year um and um and and peris is going to grow by u smaller uh double digits so maybe 10 11 12% uh per year so youve got more growth opportunity but you don't have that the dividend is not going to be as high as it is with with real income so i like i think those companies are really attractive the shopping center space is really attractive um i like the mall sector is kind of an interesting place to play simon is the big u you know the big you know thousand pound gorilla if you will they they are uh also a-rated great management team and again they're the leading mall owner in the in the world they also own the outlets as well so ticker symbols spg i like tanger uh that's the pure play uh outlet center re ticker skt but they're extremely expensive right now so i would wait for a pullback with tanger again they've done a great job getting that share price up but uh i would not recommend owning shares in tanger today just given the what i think is the lofty valuation well those are all some really great stock tips for our viewers to look into thank you again for the great picks today and the anal is of more of what's going on in the sector uh where can people find more of information from you and get more info from wide moe research absolutely our website is right there widot research.com and um you know we're really excited about 2025 i think there's going to be some really good opportunities and again our our our our mantra for the firm is protecting

en if you are looking to add real estate investing to your portfolio reits are a great way to get started today we're excited to have renowned reit expert brad thomas with us he's the founder of wide mode research and has actually authored three books all about real estate investing brad it's so great to have you on our channel today we're excited to share some of your top reate stock picks with our viewers here on market beats sure well i'll say you know obviously if i were going to rec in one re i'll tell you which one it is but i'm also going to give you a disclaimer i would never own just one reit i think diversification is extremely important uh for for any investor but there's one company that i'm very very bullish about today and i do on the shares full disclosure uh this company's called reality income and their ticker symbol is o uh just one one letter uh they're based in in california they're they're net lease landlord and net lease means they own pro individual properties freestanding properties lease to companies like dollar general or walgreens are 711 um and they've got a massive portfolio they are the largest net lease landlord in the world um so they have you know uh thousands and thousands of properties scattered across all 50 states as well as europe they've expanded over the last few years into europe there are two kind of competitive advantage that i'll site again our company's called wide mode research so we like to to talk about you know competitive advantages one of those is scale i just mentioned the the enormous size of the company uh they got a large footprint which means their exposure to one individual tenant is is very small uh their their exposure to one tenant is about three and a half% of the portfolio give an example how that how that's effective during covid they had uh they have exposure to theaters and gyms and of course those two categories were really hurt hard during co people wouldn't go to couldn't go to the gym uh and obviously people didn't go to the theaters during co but but this still continue to deliver uh not only um u you know consistent earnings but they were able to grow their earnings during even during co and they were grow they grew their dividend uh during co so that demonstrates that they have a very broad diversification which uh when some companies don't pay rent or they do have you know problems within their portfolio they're able to continue to deliver on pro their promises to investors which is to pay dividends by the way this company they're they're actually trademarked the monthly div div company so they pay monthly dividends and they also increase very consistently their are dividend aristocrat they they've increased dividends every year as a public company for 30 years in a row so i think scale is is one that i mentioned the other uh advantage competitive advantage is their cost of capital they work very hard to to achieve an a-rated balance sheet um so they have a very low uh cost of of debt they're also able to utilize currency in europe which is actually lower cost debt than they have in the us in terms of valuation which is arguably the most important part of our research at wide moot research is to study and really understand you know what is the margin of safety in the words of benjamin graham and so we looked at the company's valuation what they're trading at currently based on multiple valuation metrics and then we look at you know kind of how they've been traded historically how they've traded with a peer group uh and and we find them extremely extremely cheap right now a lot of that is just simp it's overhang due to um you know rising rates it's it's it's it's it's an over overhang due to the fact we've seen a lot of these headlines with with um loans that are becoming due uh again real estate income has no problem with with debt maturities hence the you know a rated balance sheet i mentioned and so um you know i think that in terms of a value perspective we think there's a really good op total return set up in place right now for real income to generate not only consistent dividends uh and growing dividends but a really nice and attractive total return uh setup going forward so that's kind of my probably one of my number one picks right now and i'm happy to touch on some more if you' like yeah why don't you give us a quick list of maybe another top three reats that people can look into um i really appreciate the big in-depth analysis and i think you can find a lot more analysis just like this on uh wide mode research i know you do this for a lot of different companies and stocks and reads out there u but why don't you give us your quick list of your your other top three picks of rats to look into yeah another one that that is is kind of a close peer to reala income is a company called vich vici vich is also a freestanding property landlord but but very different from reality income the average size of their their properties are are massive they own you know as i mentioned casinos the caesar's palace in las vegas a number of property another number of casinos uh on the strip there in las vegas they've also expanded beyond casinos into other kind of experiential type properties investing in amusement parks and bowling alleys and things like that so um again this is a newer company they haven't been around as long their their their track record is not as impressive as the one i just mentioned with reality income um but but we think that opportunity is really in in good place you we interview management teams of all the companies we research we think they got a really good management team u they've been able to reduce their cost of capital u they were the at the quickest reate to obtain s&amp;p 500 status than any re ever in the history so they're growing at a massive rate they're also undervalued and again that's a way to have access to some of these very iconic properties um um so i think beachi would be one that i would consider the other one i like a lot is pagis pagis again looking at kind of the compet pagis plld is the ticker there uh pagis is one of the largest warehous or logistics landlords uh in in the world uh they own properties all over us and and many other other countries uh again look at citing some of those same competitive advantages that i just spoke about realage income they also have an a-rated balance sheet they have massive scale and they're also trading at a discount one of the things i like about pris as well as the other industrial companies is their growth prospects are are much higher um real income is only projected to grow by around 4% per year um and um and and peris is going to grow by u smaller uh double digits so maybe 10 11 12% uh per year so youve got more growth opportunity but you don't have that the dividend is not going to be as high as it is with with real income so i like i think those companies are really attractive the shopping center space is really attractive um i like the mall sector is kind of an interesting place to play simon is the big u you know the big you know thousand pound gorilla if you will they they are uh also a-rated great management team and again they're the leading mall owner in the in the world they also own the outlets as well so ticker symbols spg i like tanger uh that's the pure play uh outlet center re ticker skt but they're extremely expensive right now so i would wait for a pullback with tanger again they've done a great job getting that share price up but uh i would not recommend owning shares in tanger today just given the what i think is the lofty valuation well those are all some really great stock tips for our viewers to look into thank you again for the great picks today and the anal is of more of what's going on in the sector uh where can people find more of information from you and get more info from wide moe research absolutely our website is

gamestop stock is rising again after last night's earnings report what's behind these numbers let's break it down with our market beat analyst thomas hughes and chris marut guys great to have you both back on the channel today let's start off with what's happening with gamestock stock price today you're right the stock is moving up it's about you know 5 and a half percent right now i think it was up about 7% a little while ago um on this earnings report it's showing some support at a fairly critical level in on the charts and it could be setting up for a bigger move yeah chris let's give a little context we've been following gamestop really since 2020 where does the price today compared to that all-time high that stock hit a few years ago so i mean if you're looking at the all-time high back in i think it was 2021 it was all the way up to around $80 a share so the the price at around $28 this morning is still well below that all-time high but gamestop's had a good year it's up 50% in 2024 so it's been having a strong year this is a stock we really been following on this channel uh for a while that this really the whole stock market's been following since 2020 so let's break down a little bit about did we think we'd still be covering this stock in 2024 the way we are today i really didn't think so i mean you can go back and look at the history of my articles i've not been very fond of the company not because it's a bad company per se but just because it's losing money and it's it's in contraction it's burning its cash it's eating itself to death there's just not a lot of reasons to expect it's value to go up yeah i kind of suspected we might still be talking about it it's it's one of these stocks that's become um you're going to get out of the report whatever you want to get out of the report if you are if you're bullish on the company there's reasons why you're going to still be bullish on the company after the report and if you're bearish on the company there's nothing that the report gave you that would change your opinion one way or the other yeah let's dive into the report a little bit uh what came out of the earnings report this week well so the good news is that it produced a surprising profit all right it hasn't been able to produce much profits for a while so profit is good and profit is helping to support the stock price it also increased its cash balance by 500% so it's pretty well capitalized right now and that's part of why um the bulls are still so encouraged because they believe this cash pile will lead to some business transformation that we really haven't seen any glimmers of yet one of the problems in the report is that revenue is declining in every category of the business so hardware is down software is down uh their their collectibles businesses down i think that's something that should be more concerning if you're um if you're a retail investor that's actually thinking about getting involved in the stock is the company's business is in the gaming sector which is exploding at this time and gamestops losing money in that sector right and kind of in between those two opinions you know they made this surprising profit the business is contracting the profit is only because of the cash balance it's because interest income the operating results are negative it burned money and its operations and the business is contracting there's really no expectations for that to change so right now the company's kind of in a holding pattern so given all those details why do you think the stock price is still rising this morning people want to believe you know and and the 4.5 billion in cash is a big number you know people think that even if the stock were to you know go out of business or whatever there's still going to be some value there and there's also hope for the turnaround but there's just there's no evidence of it yet and right now what we're looking at is just a persistent continual burning of cash eventually that cash balance will get whitted down and then where will the market be left the retail investors love the ceo they believe that there's a plan everybody seems to have an opinion about what that plan might be but the company itself hasn't really outlined a plan and that's what makes me very dubious i mean you don't even have an earnings call after your report that doesn't give me a lot of confidence as investor that there's a bigger plan going forward it tells me that there's no plan i mean if they had a plan they hey we've got a plan they should be beating the the drunk we have a plan you know right but there there's no plan so that leads me to wonder how long will we be talking about gamestop what do you think will take to kind of get those uh hopeful people to finally get out of this stock or is this something that we're going to be talking about for years to come yet i think that we could be talking about this stock for years to come yet um one of the takeaways from this report is that with the interest income and producing profits they really have entered a holding pattern so technically speaking they can sustain operations indefinitely while the business slowly turns into nothing they'll be left over with some money but there'll be no business left and then what do they do so gamestock stock is still rising which means people are buying it who are the people buying the stock right now i mean i think for the most part it's it's retail investors but there is a that's got me scratching my head and that's the institutional activity the institutions have been buying this stock on balance all year um the holdings are still pretty low they don't own more than 50% it's like 25 or 30% i think not very much but they're buying on balance and that provides a tailwind for the market you can see it in the stock price and i'm just wondering what it is that they're buying into are they speculating on this cash balance or a turnaround um are they just buying some shares so they can have them lend them out for being shorted um it's just it's a question i want to have answered do you feel that the movement in this stock is a true investment in this company or is it just an investment in a hope to make some money off of a short squeeze again gamestop's certainly a trade more than it is an investment and you can look at that in the options chain um i mean there's just a ton of option contracts out on the stock this is an option traders dream right now i'm not so sure though that it's a short play because the short interest on the stock is really down something else i'm concerned about is the the the valuation and you my math could be wrong reported balance sheet shareholder equity and the number of shares outstanding puts the book value at like $11 so that's more than 50% lower than where it's trading right now to me that means sooner or later there will be a detail that comes out that just causes the bottom to fall right out of the market this stock certainly has a strong following so i know there's got to be some viewers out there that strongly disagree with this point what do you say to the the believers on gamestop you could be right i could wrong good luck yeah i mean it's it's a trade it's it's to me it's not a it's not a long-term investment but there's probably money to be made guys thank you so much for the time today and breaking down this stock that again we're still talking about four years later and will still be talking about for a few years to come thank you for watching market beat we hope that you can check out some of our other videos on other content including some past videos we've done on gamestop stock as well have a great day everyone and as always happy investing [music],gamestop,1.0,-0.8

against these three popular stocks are they in your portfolio here to walk us through these three high short interest stocks is market beat analyst chris marot chris first let's show people how you take a look at which stocks are having some of the highest short interest right now market beat has a free tool i'm going to share my screen with you right now bridget so under the um market data tab you can see this column that says short interest and just click on that and it'll take you to a screen that looks like this and this is updated every day and you can see which stocks have um a high percentage of short interest in terms of percent of total shares shorted or the percent of the float or days to cover however people might want to look at that now i know you've picked three stocks off of that list first let's take a look at why investors would want to look at the short interest of a stock if you were interested in shorting a stock those stocks would be good candidates the ones that have high short interest but you would also might want to be looking at stocks that might be a candidate for a short squeeze that means you might want to be buying a stock that a lot of people are shorting you've got three picks where traders are doing just that with and these are some pretty popular names start with your first pick so the first one um i have on my list is soundhound and i know we've covered that extensively on this channel it popped up on the screener and i was interested because this is a stock that's shot higher over the last couple of months and and one of the reasons for that is what we just talked about bridget it's been a short squeeze stock trades about maybe a 38 million share average volume that's not a whole lot and what investors saw especially those mem stock investors is high short interest possibility of a short squeeze that's exactly what they've gotten i like soundhound i'd expect the stock to pull back a little bit and that's when buyers might want to be looking to jump in absolutely yeah talk about longterm for this stock do you think there some growth potential here taking that short interest out this is a company that's on sort of the forefront of where ai is pushing things especially in terms of sound recognition has contracts already with a lot of major companies and a lot of major brands it's just right now the stock's been squeezed a little bit it's trading again at a at a very high premium i would expect the stock to pull back a little bit and that's what investors should look to get in all right so let's talk about the cycle of this short squeeze what this really start going up you know you'd probably say right after the election when a lot of this bare market rally started that's when you started seeing the the significant movement here on on soundhound as far as the when it might fizzle out my guess would be it might happen sometime this month as investors look to take profit before the end of the year and that might be a good time for investors to maybe go looking to shop during the santa claus rally between christmas and new year's or even after the new year itself if you are looking looking to start trading with some high short interest stocks market bead has a free premium report out there right now that can help walk you through stepbystep how to get into these kinds of stocks click the link below or scan the qr code to check out this free premium report to help you get started investing in high short interest stocks so let's move on to your second pick and again this is a stock a lot of people been talking about especially recently yeah that would be rocket lab and we talked about it on the channel just a couple weeks ago it's got even lower average daily volume than soundhound which surprised me a little bit but good news about rocket lab this is a company that has a billion dollar backlog in total business that's not just their launch business but it's also their space services business it's been in the middle of this short squeeze over the last month or so i would expect investors to see a pullback on this stock and again that would be a good entry point for for investors if you're already holding on to rocket lab uh is this a time where you could takes some profit share you know nobody ever got broke taking a profit and right now again rocket labs just shot up so much higher in the past few months it might be a very good opportunity to sell some of your stock take a little bit of profit for the holidays and then buy back in when the stock's a little bit lower yeah with the stock like this one that's seen such a backlog of orders and that's seeing this kind of growth how much of a pullback do you think a rocket lab could see you could easily see it it pulling back about 10% from where it is right now it's it's not hard to see that at all again this is just a stock that's it's again it's it's not a bad stock it and it's got a lot of growth ahead of it but the market's just gotten a little ahead of itself we're in a very uh bullish market in general right now the market's moving higher you've got a big name stock like this one is it possible that the bull market could just prevent any future pullbacks the market's just in one of those cycles right now where it wants to run higher there's no question about that that's why it's difficult to be a person that's trying to short a stock especially a stock like rocket lab right now because there could be just a lot of bulls that just keep jumping in and pushing the stock higher and so if you're looking at rocket lab as a trade that's something you want to consider if you're looking at it as a long-term investment i would still strongly recommend you look for just a little bit of a pullback on the stock for a better entry point some good advice for investors there chris all right let's get on to your third and final pick of high short interest stocks right now that would be sofi technologies this is a stock brid just that i boy it's been on my watch list for a long time um i just haven't been able to pull the trigger on it but i'm really i i'm interested in this company this is a company that uh most investors may know it as the company that started out as they did student loans they were the student loan company and they've become so much more especially over the past couple of years they got their banking license the company was basically starting at zero in terms of an asset base for being a bank two years ago and they've grown significantly since then but there's always been a high short interest on the stock a lot of investors who just don't believe that this company is um is going to deliver on their promises there is reason to believe that the stock maybe a little bit expensive right now um expensive doesn't necessarily mean it's overvalued but it is expensive right now this is another one i think the company's got a bright future i also think the stock's a little bit overextended yeah some good point especially with this list that we've had so far all three of these companies seem to have good future potential but just a little bit higher sentiment than maybe what the true value is right now right and that happens with short interest stocks it's just it's very easy for these stocks to kind of take on a life of their own during one of these little squeezes the trick for investors is you have to know when to get out of that trade before it drops rapidly unless you're planning on really holding on for a long time in which case this doesn't really matter but if you're looking to trade in and out of the stock it's really important to watch when these stocks get a little bit toppy because the because the pullback can be sharp and it can be quick and you don't want to be on the wrong side of that trade well thanks for putting these three stocks on the watch list for some high short interest right now and you can find more information about all of these stocks we've covered them right here on this channel thanks again for watching and as always happy investing [music],soundhound,1.0,0.4

off of that list first let's take a look at why investors would want to look at the short interest of a stock if you were interested in shorting a stock those stocks would be good candidates the ones that have high short interest but you would also might want to be looking at stocks that might be a candidate for a short squeeze that means you might want to be buying a stock that a lot of people are shorting you've got three picks where traders are doing just that with and these are some pretty popular names start with your first pick so the first one um i have on my list is soundhound and i know we've covered that extensively on this channel it popped up on the screener and i was interested because this is a stock that's shot higher over the last couple of months and and one of the reasons for that is what we just talked about bridget it's been a short squeeze stock trades about maybe a 38 million share average volume that's not a whole lot and what investors saw especially those mem stock investors is high short interest possibility of a short squeeze that's exactly what they've gotten i like soundhound i'd expect the stock to pull back a little bit and that's when buyers might want to be looking to jump in absolutely yeah talk about longterm for this stock do you think there some growth potential here taking that short interest out this is a company that's on sort of the forefront of where ai is pushing things especially in terms of sound recognition has contracts already with a lot of major companies and a lot of major brands it's just right now the stock's been squeezed a little bit it's trading again at a at a very high premium i would expect the stock to pull back a little bit and that's what investors should look to get in all right so let's talk about the cycle of this short squeeze what this really start going up you know you'd probably say right after the election when a lot of this bare market rally started that's when you started seeing the the significant movement here on on soundhound as far as the when it might fizzle out my guess would be it might happen sometime this month as investors look to take profit before the end of the year and that might be a good time for investors to maybe go looking to shop during the santa claus rally between christmas and new year's or even after the new year itself if you are looking looking to start trading with some high short interest stocks market bead has a free premium report out there right now that can help walk you through stepbystep how to get into these kinds of stocks click the link below or scan the qr code to check out this free premium report to help you get started investing in high short interest stocks so let's move on to your second pick and again this is a stock a lot of people been talking about especially recently yeah that would be rocket lab and we talked about it on the channel just a couple weeks ago it's got even lower average daily volume than soundhound which surprised me a little bit but good news about rocket lab this is a company that has a billion dollar backlog in total business that's not just their launch business but it's also their space services business it's been in the middle of this short squeeze over the last month or so i would expect investors to see a pullback on this stock and again that would be a good entry point for for investors if you're already holding on to rocket lab uh is this a time where you could takes some profit share you know nobody ever got broke taking a profit and right now again rocket labs just shot up so much higher in the past few months it might be a very good opportunity to sell some of your stock take a little bit of profit for the holidays and then buy back in when the stock's a little bit lower yeah with the stock like this one that's seen such a backlog of orders and that's seeing this kind of growth how much of a pullback do you think a rocket lab could see you could easily see it it pulling back about 10% from where it is right now it's it's not hard to see that at all again this is just a stock that's it's again it's it's not a bad stock it and it's got a lot of growth ahead of it but the market's just gotten a little ahead of itself we're in a very uh bullish market in general right now the market's moving higher you've got a big name stock like this one is it possible that the bull market could just prevent any future pullbacks the market's just in one of those cycles right now where it wants to run higher there's no question about that that's why it's difficult to be a person that's trying to short a stock especially a stock like rocket lab right now because there could be just a lot of bulls that just keep jumping in and pushing the stock higher and so if you're looking at rocket lab as a trade that's something you want to consider if you're looking at it as a long-term investment i would still strongly recommend you look for just a little bit of a pullback on the stock for a better entry point some good advice for investors there chris all right let's get on to your third and final pick of high short interest stocks right now that would be sofi technologies this is a stock brid just that i boy it's been on my watch list for a long time um i just haven't been able to pull the trigger on it but i'm really i i'm interested in this company this is a company that uh most investors may know it as the company that started out as they did student loans they were the student loan company and they've become so much more especially over the past couple of years they got their banking license the company was basically starting at zero in terms of an asset base for being a bank two years ago and they've grown significantly since then but there's always been a high short interest on the stock a lot of investors who just don't believe that this company is um is going to deliver on their promises there is reason to believe that the stock maybe a little bit expensive right now um expensive doesn't necessarily mean it's overvalued but it is expensive right now this is another one i think the company's got a bright future i also think the stock's a little bit overextended yeah some good point especially with this list that we've had so far all three of these companies seem to have good future potential but just a little bit higher sentiment than maybe what the true value is right now right and that happens with short interest stocks it's just it's very easy for these stocks to kind of take on a life of their own during one of these little squeezes the trick for investors is you have to know when to get out of that trade before it drops rapidly unless you're planning on really holding on for a long time in which case this doesn't really matter but if you're looking to trade in and out of the stock it's really important to watch when these stocks get a little bit toppy because the because the pullback can be sharp and it can be quick and you don't want to be on the wrong side of that trade well thanks for putting these three stocks on the watch list for some high short interest right now and you can find more information about all of these stocks we've covered them right here on this channel thanks again for watching and as always happy investing [music],rocket lab,1.0,0.5

en soundtown up 100% since last month's earnings reports but now the volatility is already underway here to break it all down for us is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas this has been a great month for soundhound yeah it really has been and what we have here is kind of a perfect storm of factors driving the stock price it starts with the results the company's uh growing and it's accelerating it's gaining traction the forecasts for next year are for this hyper growth to accelerate and continue again so another 100 % growth in the in the revenue next year uh the forecast may be cautious because of the investor day conference the investor day conference left the market feeling very confident about the future also revealed some new deals in a deal pipeline that kind of reinforces all this outlook for how good the next year is going to be and on top of that there's the short interest the short interest was nearly 30% at the beginning of the month and so a lot of this upward movement in the stock price is short covering let's talk about that movement in the stock price what have we seen this stock to since earnings last month well like you said it's it's up more than 100% but technically speaking what we're looking at is a break above um a significant resistance point so it suggests the upward momentum can continue uh the last week's big surge was also on pretty high volume again part of that was short covering but the high volume kind of shows a lot of market support for the stock at the price level that it's at now so uh we're looking at higher prices to come over over the next year now we've talked about soundhound on this channel before what came out during earnings report and that investor call this month that has investors even more excited about the future of sound hounds well it just shows that the company is gaining traction it technology really is good it works the investor day conference you know the market walked away thinking wow this stuff really does work it sounds good it's kind of seamless providing a good service for businesses uh this new deal that they announc is with torches tacos that's for 130 stores it's not a lot of stores they've got about 10,000 restaurants using the software but they're talking about for torches the software is handling 100% of their calls it's taking orders it can take more than one order at a time it's answering questions so it's really helping the the the business uh become more efficient and that just plays into the outlook for not only for revenue growth but for earnings potential yeah it's really one of the great usage of ai is to really take away something that's timeconsuming that takes a lot of human power and make it faster and i think that's why the idea behind soundhound is taking off so quickly well right broadly speaking the services and automation is what um the current you know evolution of ai is best for handling data writing the data where it needs to go and then responding to queries and requests let's talk about uh what are analysts saying about sound hound's future well so the analysts are pretty bullish but i would say the stock price has uh kind of front run their sentiment they're lifting their price targets but i think right now the stock price is about 40% overvalued relative to consensus uh so that plus the short covering element leads me to think that there could be some volatility we might expect a pretty sharp price pullback before we see new high set but ultimately the trend is positive and i would expect the analyst to catch up with the market given time and sometimes it can be hard to play these short interest stocks but if you want to learn more about how to play high short interest stocks check out this free market bait report it'll break down everything you need to know about playing stocks just like this one that have a lot of high short interest right now so thomas what would be a really good trading play on a stock like soundhound that's seen such a big runup so quickly well right so looking at this from the bull case and you know assuming that this this bull fundamental situation scenario really is playing out the way that i've described um you would want to wait for some price pullbacks and the price pullbacks will probably result in pretty clear u demarcations of support levels and then use those for entry points um if you have an opposite viewpoint you're probably going to want to look for some of these um recognizable resistance points and use those as possible places to short the stock with rapid growth stocks like this one you always wonder about what kind of factors could potentially slow down all of these really quick gains is it competition are there competitors out there that might come take away some of sound hound's market share um are there other economic factors are just things that could impact this growth trajectory for this company well right now soundhound is is the leader in its field but i would say that most other ai companies are working towards similar ends um salesforce in particular is a company that's going to want to use ai to automate its its workflows for businesses um and it is a potential you know buyer for soundhound but again we got to remember that soundhound is being backed by nvidia so it's a good chance that soundhound will remain a standalone company for a very long time that was a question question for the bears that might be out there but for the bulls what could lead to even more growth for soundhound i'm sure there's plenty of companies that are really just starting to explore how ai applications like this one could help their business well i think that the growth trajectory for this company is is pretty robust businesses in general need to be efficient they need automation um so the the more businesses within one industry take on software like this the more the competition will need to follow suit so i think that this story is one that could continue to gain traction over the next couple of years um and right now sound hounds revenue is it's less than 100 million a year this company is going to be worth billions pretty soon so i would expect to see it grow by 100% or more over the next few years like each year annually um ai services are going to be the largest and fastest growing segment of the ai market so right now if you think that the nvidia bubble is a is a big bubble wait until the services bubble gets inflated and we'll see how how big the market gets then yeah the rapid growth we're seeing in the whole ai sector is really incredible and soundhound is absolutely a part of that story thank you so much thomas for the breakdown on what's happening with soundhound

suit so i think that this story is one that could continue to gain traction over the next couple of years um and right now sound hounds revenue is it's less than 100 million a year this company is going to be worth billions pretty soon so i would expect to see it grow by 100% or more over the next few years like each year annually um ai services are going to be the largest and fastest growing segment of the ai market so right now if you think that the nvidia bubble is a is a big bubble wait until the services bubble gets inflated and we'll see how how big the market gets then yeah the rapid growth we're seeing in the whole ai sector is really incredible and soundhound is absolutely a part of that story thank you so much thomas for the breakdown on what's happening with soundhound right now and thank you for joining us check out some of our other videos we've done on soundhound in the past if you want to learn a little bit more about this company as always thank you so much for

en soundtown up 100% since last month's earnings reports but now the volatility is already underway here to break it all down for us is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas this has been a great month for soundhound yeah it really has been and what we have here is kind of a perfect storm of factors driving the stock price it starts with the results the company's uh growing and it's accelerating it's gaining traction the forecasts for next year are for this hyper growth to accelerate and continue again so another 100 % growth in the in the revenue next year uh the forecast may be cautious because of the investor day conference the investor day conference left the market feeling very confident about the future also revealed some new deals in a deal pipeline that kind of reinforces all this outlook for how good the next year is going to be and on top of that there's the short interest the short interest was nearly 30% at the beginning of the month and so a lot of this upward movement in the stock price is short covering let's talk about that movement in the stock price what have we seen this stock to since earnings last month well like you said it's it's up more than 100% but technically speaking what we're looking at is a break above um a significant resistance point so it suggests the upward momentum can continue uh the last week's big surge was also on pretty high volume again part of that was short covering but the high volume kind of shows a lot of market support for the stock at the price level that it's at now so uh we're looking at higher prices to come over over the next year now we've talked about soundhound on this channel before what came out during earnings report and that investor call this month that has investors even more excited about the future of sound hounds well it just shows that the company is gaining traction it technology really is good it works the investor day conference you know the market walked away thinking wow this stuff really does work it sounds good it's kind of seamless providing a good service for businesses uh this new deal that they announc is with torches tacos that's for 130 stores it's not a lot of stores they've got about 10,000 restaurants using the software but they're talking about for torches the software is handling 100% of their calls it's taking orders it can take more than one order at a time it's answering questions so it's really helping the the the business uh become more efficient and that just plays into the outlook for not only for revenue growth but for earnings potential yeah it's really one of the great usage of ai is to really take away something that's timeconsuming that takes a lot of human power and make it faster and i think that's why the idea behind soundhound is taking off so quickly well right broadly speaking the services and automation is what um the current you know evolution of ai is best for handling data writing the data where it needs to go and then responding to queries and requests let's talk about uh what are analysts saying about sound hound's future well so the analysts are pretty bullish but i would say the stock price has uh kind of front run their sentiment they're lifting their price targets but i think right now the stock price is about 40% overvalued relative to consensus uh so that plus the short covering element leads me to think that there could be some volatility we might expect a pretty sharp price pullback before we see new high set but ultimately the trend is positive and i would expect the analyst to catch up with the market given time and sometimes it can be hard to play these short interest stocks but if you want to learn more about how to play high short interest stocks check out this free market bait report it'll break down everything you need to know about playing stocks just like this one that have a lot of high short interest right now so thomas what would be a really good trading play on a stock like soundhound that's seen such a big runup so quickly well right so looking at this from the bull case and you know assuming that this this bull fundamental situation scenario really is playing out the way that i've described um you would want to wait for some price pullbacks and the price pullbacks will probably result in pretty clear u demarcations of support levels and then use those for entry points um if you have an opposite viewpoint you're probably going to want to look for some of these um recognizable resistance points and use those as possible places to short the stock with rapid growth stocks like this one you always wonder about what kind of factors could potentially slow down all of these really quick gains is it competition are there competitors out there that might come take away some of sound hound's market share um are there other economic factors are just things that could impact this growth trajectory for this company well right now soundhound is is the leader in its field but i would say that most other ai companies are working towards similar ends um salesforce in particular is a company that's going to want to use ai to automate its its workflows for businesses um and it is a potential you know buyer for soundhound but again we got to remember that soundhound is being backed by nvidia so it's a good chance that soundhound will remain a standalone company for a very long time that was a question question for the bears that might be out there but for the bulls what could lead to even more growth for soundhound i'm sure there's plenty of companies that are really just starting to explore how ai applications like this one could help their business well i think that the growth trajectory for this company is is pretty robust businesses in general need to be efficient they need automation um so the the more businesses within one industry take on software like this the more the competition will need to follow suit so i think that this story is one that could continue to gain traction over the next couple of years um and right now sound hounds revenue is it's less than 100 million a year this company is going to be worth billions pretty soon so i would expect to see it grow by 100% or more over the next few years like each year annually um ai services are going to be the largest and fastest growing segment of the ai market so right now if you think that the nvidia bubble is a is a big bubble wait until the services bubble gets inflated and we'll see how how big the market gets then yeah the rapid growth we're seeing in the whole ai sector is really incredible and soundhound is absolutely a part of that story thank you so much thomas for the breakdown on what's happening with soundhound

centers to aerospace and biotech this private credit company can help you invest in all of them let's dive [music] in today we are excited to have trinity capital ceo kyle brown with us thank you so much for joining us today kyle thanks bridget thanks for having me well let's start with uh a little bit about what trinity capital is sure so we are an internally managed business development company that is is a uh fancy way of saying we are a really an income play for investors we lend money to growth oriented businesses i think uh kind of late stage vcb companies into the lower middle market private equity back companies we provide kind of an array of products to those companies but generally speaking we're looking for companies that are growing at a 20 to 100% annual growth rate who can utilize our capital to extend their their runway as they achieve milestones and head towards a larger valuation but we are private credit very diversified across industries been at it since 2008 and providing great returns and really steady dividends uh during that time frame yeah let's talk about the growth of private credit over the past few years there's really been an uptick in usage yeah and we've uh we've always been private credit the the term private credit certainly has become more popular over the last few years uh companies are staying private longer uh you have that dynamic that exists you have banking volatility that really started a couple years ago has led banks to lend less there's more regulation forcing their kind of max check sizes to reduce along with just less deposits overall so you see banks lending less companies staying private longer the relevance of private credit is certainly uh increased because the demand for capital is there and so um you know we we think that uh this is a really exciting time to be in private credit we find ourselves in a really interesting niche uh that is different than i'd say the majority of private credit and alternative lenders out there who are focused on upper middle market kind of larger profile companies um we think the lower middle market is a is a really exciting place to be we think that baby boomers and that transfer of wealth and businesses that's occurring right now and over the next five years is going to create a lot of opportunities uh for investments in that space so it's strong uh certainly you know very exciting right now but the future is pretty bright i think for investors looking to invest in trinity capital it's a chance to invest in the future of many many different companies and industries looking at your portfolio like you said you have a lot of high growth potential companies from ai to aerospace uh to some uh medical companies as well talk about what kind of growth you're looking for and the people and companies that you're lending to sure so we come in really kind of late stage preo uh prema that's where we begin and uh these companies have raised tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a really inter interesting new product to attack an old archaic industry and uh they have real technology real ip patents enterprise value what they're doing is is really fundamentally kind of changing it's either they're able to create that product uh for less uh and it's twice as effective um and so we're coming in and typically you mentioned ai i that's a really exciting space too right now uh we're not really taking gambl or taking risks on ai or the operating companies that are trying to uh to build and create revenues in that space we do more of the pick and shovel financing so we started as an equipment financing business it's still a big part of what we do right now and so in the ai space what we're doing is we're going into the data centers we're providing financing for the gpus um the nvidia servers the amd servers uh we're providing uh financing for the other capex needs they have power generation cpus etc so we really kind of stay in the peripheral we don't take that direct uh risk associated with the industry but really focus on more the pix and shovel financing um space you mentioned that that's obviously uh you know very exciting right now we do a lot in um kind of that low lower orbit satellite um launching rocket lab is a big uh customer of ours borrow of ours and we're mostly providing equipment financing those industries as you can imagine have significant capex needs uh they're building things that require large tools machines manufacturing l lines and so we're doing a lot there and then you know i think the other thing that i'm i'm really excited about is just manufacturing in general um we're seeing a lot more manufacturing come back to the us this has been a trend for multiple years you have a lot of investment going into capex heavy companies and they require a lot of financing and so we're positioned really well to help build out manufacturing capacity here in the us let's talk about um the potential risk or benefits for investors who might be interested in investing in capital what's the risk of uh repayment and and how have you worked as a company to kind of lower and mitigate the risk on that so a couple things we we really do limit our exposure to any one credits uh less i don't think we have a credit right now over 3% of the uh portfolio we keep industry concentration uh limited we are senior secured on the vast majority of all of our our loans uh we're secured against all assets so we are pr prity in payment to those uh to those companies uh they've raised significant amount of equity they're sponsor backed either late stage vc or significant private equity backing we only lend money to companies that have uh sponsors around the table with capacity to continue supporting them uh these are short-term loans so anywhere from 24 to 48 month uh terms typically so we're getting off of off risk quickly from a company perspective we we sit at pretty low leverage we have cover around 1:1 leverage we have continued to over earn the dividends so for investors we have 19 straight quarters of keeping the dividend steady or growing while continuing to earn above and beyond rate exposure i think that we're really positioned well right now in the event that rates drop uh the majority of our debt is is floating and so we actually see some benefits if rates decrease our cost of capital will go down and then 90 plus% of our portfolio this is all you can find this in the schedule investments has floor rates that are above 12% so we we think we've positioned ourselves really well right now to continue to be a real consistent uh dividend and income play for investors i think right now the dividend yield is pretty high 14 15% that's really more of a reflection of just the stock being low and uh we think it's a great entry point for investors who are interested in in real consistent income and then and then maybe one of just kind of risk mitigator since 2008 we've continued to see uh 26 basis points annual loss rate that's a very low loss rate it's since 2008 and then we get warrants in more than half of the loans that we issue those warrants since 2008 have actually created realized gains that have offset losses and created some upside for investors so we actually have a net negative loss rate since 2008 so something else investors can look to and point to just to say hey you know of course the future is is not set based on what's happened in the past but we have a pretty good history of keeping losses very low in fact uh negative that's very good to hear and i think um your portfolio itself speaks for that success rate you have a lot of really bigname clients you've mentioned a few and also of keep increasing the the um amount of money that you're lending every year can you go through just a few of the stats u from your recent report of just how many uh loans you've got out there so we sit uh we've got a portfolio 100 companies a little over two billion in assets uh that continues to grow uh earnings have grown ever since we consolidated our business into a bdc in 2020 since then we've continued to increase earnings each quarter uh 19 straight quarters of of growing or keeping that dividend steady we saw net investment income continue to rise yet again uh we feel pretty good about where the portfolio is at right now we continue to see our portfolio strength uh we we do value the portfolio from a third party valuation perspective quarterly and that's continued to stay steady one of the main things i think i you know investors should know with our our company is we're not just a pool of assets when you're looking at bdcs business development companies the majority of them are a a pool of assets that trades publicly uh we are actually a management company and a pool of assets so we do not have a manage there's no management fee that's charged there's no incentive fee uh that's charged i own the same shares as any one of our shareholders and that makes us pretty unique we uh sought sec approval last year to get uh to have the ability to own an ra and so what that means for investors is we have this public company it's continued to perform very well uh we also have a an r where we can go out and we can raise thirdparty capital which we've done so we now our public company manages third party private capital and we can charge management fees and c fees so one of the reasons why you're seeing earnings grow while you're seeing our ability to increase uh earnings above and beyond the loans that we issue is that we actually are an asset management company as well and 100% of those management fee streams are owned by our public shareholders and so this is new this is newer for us over the last couple years you're starting to see the benefits of it flow to our shareholders most of the market doesn't get it yet they don't quite understand it there's not a lot of other bdcs doing it but what it does for us is it gives us the ability to not just be a consistent dividend play for investors but also to be a growth story in the stock as well so that's our goal long term we want to keep increasing the earnings for investors we want to be really steady yes but we actually want to continue to increase now we want to we want to continue to increase the dividend in earnings over time that's certainly helps to differentiate your company from other competitors out there kyle this has been a really great conversation is there anything else that you'd like to share about what makes you excited about the future of trinity capital i know you came on as ceo this year but you've been with the company for a long time again you've explained a lot of it already but anything else that just gets you excited about the future and where this company is headed yeah i mentioned it but you know our ability to continue to raise private capital and really grow the asset management side of our business is me it's meant to be a huge boom for investors who can get into a stock who can expect that great holy dividend and who can see their returns grow over time and that's going to be really unique to us uh and a big differentiator for us relative to our other bdc peers and so i hope investors see that i hope they get excited about that and i think the future is really bright the opportunity for growth is there and we're doing it in a way that's really creative and good for investors and so yeah thanks bridget appreciate you having me and uh to all your other stakeholders and investors out there we'd love your support thank you again kyle for your time today and thank you for watching market beat you can find more videos just like this one on our

those industries as you can imagine have significant capex needs uh they're building things that require large tools machines manufacturing l lines and so we're doing a lot there and then you know i think the other thing that i'm i'm really excited about is just manufacturing in general um we're seeing a lot more manufacturing come back to the us this has been a trend for multiple years you have a lot of investment going into capex heavy companies and they require a lot of financing and so we're positioned really well to help build out manufacturing capacity here in the us let's talk about um the potential risk or benefits for investors who might be interested in investing in capital what's the risk of uh repayment and and how have you worked as a company to kind of lower and mitigate the risk on that so a couple things we we really do limit our exposure to any one credits uh less i don't think we have a credit right now over 3% of the uh portfolio we keep industry concentration uh limited we are senior secured on the vast majority of all of our our loans uh we're secured against all assets so we are pr prity in payment to those uh to those companies uh they've raised significant amount of equity they're sponsor backed either late stage vc or significant private equity backing we only lend money to companies that have uh sponsors around the table with capacity to continue supporting them uh these are short-term loans so anywhere from 24 to 48 month uh terms typically so we're getting off of off risk quickly from a company perspective we we sit at pretty low leverage we have cover around 1:1 leverage we have continued to over earn the dividends so for investors we have 19 straight quarters of keeping the dividend steady or growing while continuing to earn above and beyond rate exposure i think that we're really positioned well right now in the event that rates drop uh the majority of our debt is is floating and so we actually see some benefits if rates decrease our cost of capital will go down and then 90 plus% of our portfolio this is all you can find this in the schedule investments has floor rates that are above 12% so we we think we've positioned ourselves really well right now to continue to be a real consistent uh dividend and income play for investors i think right now the dividend yield is pretty high 14 15% that's really more of a reflection of just the stock being low and uh we think it's a great entry point for investors who are interested in in real consistent income and then and then maybe one of just kind of risk mitigator since 2008 we've continued to see uh 26 basis points annual loss rate that's a very low loss rate it's since 2008 and then we get warrants in more than half of the loans that we issue those warrants since 2008 have actually created realized gains that have offset losses and created some upside for investors so we actually have a net negative loss rate since 2008 so something else investors can look to and point to just to say hey you know of course the future is is not set based on what's happened in the past but we have a pretty good history of keeping losses very low in fact uh negative that's very good to hear and i think um your portfolio itself speaks for that success rate you have a lot of really bigname clients you've mentioned a few and also of keep increasing the the um amount of money that you're lending every year can you go through just a few of the stats u from your recent report of just how many uh loans you've got out there so we sit uh we've got a portfolio 100 companies a little over two billion in assets uh that continues to grow uh earnings have grown ever since we consolidated our business into a bdc in 2020 since then we've continued to increase earnings each quarter uh 19 straight quarters of of growing or keeping that dividend steady we saw net investment income continue to rise yet again uh we feel pretty good about where the portfolio is at right now we continue to see our portfolio strength uh we we do value the portfolio from a third party valuation perspective quarterly and that's continued to stay steady one of the main things i think i you know investors should know with our our company is we're not just a pool of assets when you're looking at bdcs business development companies the majority of them are a a pool of assets that trades publicly uh we are actually a management company and a pool of assets so we do not have a manage there's no management fee that's charged there's no incentive fee uh that's charged i own the same shares as any one of our shareholders and that makes us pretty unique we uh sought sec approval last year to get uh to have the ability to own an ra and so what that means for investors is we have this public company it's continued to perform very well uh we also have a an r where we can go out and we can raise thirdparty capital which we've done so we now our public company manages third party private capital and we can charge management fees and c fees so one of the reasons why you're seeing earnings grow while you're seeing our ability to increase uh earnings above and beyond the loans that we issue is that we actually are an asset management company as well and 100% of those management fee streams are owned by our public shareholders and so this is new this is newer for us over the last couple years you're starting to see the benefits of it flow to our shareholders most of the market doesn't get it yet they don't quite understand it there's not a lot of other bdcs doing it but what it does for us is it gives us the ability to not just be a consistent dividend play for investors but also to be a growth story in the stock as well so that's our goal long term we want to keep increasing the earnings for investors we want to be really steady yes but we actually want to continue to increase now we want to we want to continue to increase the dividend in earnings over time that's certainly helps to differentiate your company from other competitors out there kyle this has been a really great conversation is there anything else that you'd like to share about what makes you excited about the future of trinity capital i know you came on as ceo this year but you've been with the company for a long time again you've explained a lot of it already but anything else that just gets you excited about the future and where this company is headed yeah i mentioned it but you know our ability to continue to raise private capital and really grow the asset management side of our business is me it's meant to be a huge boom for investors who can get into a stock who can expect that great holy dividend and who can see their returns grow over time and that's going to be really unique to us uh and a big differentiator for us relative to our other bdc peers and so i hope investors see that i hope they get excited about that and i think the future is really bright the opportunity for growth is there and we're doing it in a way that's really creative and good for investors and so yeah thanks bridget appreciate you having me and uh to all your other stakeholders and investors out there we'd love your support thank you again kyle for your time today and thank you for watching market beat you can find more videos just like this one on our

centers to aerospace and biotech this private credit company can help you invest in all of them let's dive [music] in today we are excited to have trinity capital ceo kyle brown with us thank you so much for joining us today kyle thanks bridget thanks for having me well let's start with uh a little bit about what trinity capital is sure so we are an internally managed business development company that is is a uh fancy way of saying we are a really an income play for investors we lend money to growth oriented businesses i think uh kind of late stage vcb companies into the lower middle market private equity back companies we provide kind of an array of products to those companies but generally speaking we're looking for companies that are growing at a 20 to 100% annual growth rate who can utilize our capital to extend their their runway as they achieve milestones and head towards a larger valuation but we are private credit very diversified across industries been at it since 2008 and providing great returns and really steady dividends uh during that time frame yeah let's talk about the growth of private credit over the past few years there's really been an uptick in usage yeah and we've uh we've always been private credit the the term private credit certainly has become more popular over the last few years uh companies are staying private longer uh you have that dynamic that exists you have banking volatility that really started a couple years ago has led banks to lend less there's more regulation forcing their kind of max check sizes to reduce along with just less deposits overall so you see banks lending less companies staying private longer the relevance of private credit is certainly uh increased because the demand for capital is there and so um you know we we think that uh this is a really exciting time to be in private credit we find ourselves in a really interesting niche uh that is different than i'd say the majority of private credit and alternative lenders out there who are focused on upper middle market kind of larger profile companies um we think the lower middle market is a is a really exciting place to be we think that baby boomers and that transfer of wealth and businesses that's occurring right now and over the next five years is going to create a lot of opportunities uh for investments in that space so it's strong uh certainly you know very exciting right now but the future is pretty bright i think for investors looking to invest in trinity capital it's a chance to invest in the future of many many different companies and industries looking at your portfolio like you said you have a lot of high growth potential companies from ai to aerospace uh to some uh medical companies as well talk about what kind of growth you're looking for and the people and companies that you're lending to sure so we come in really kind of late stage preo uh prema that's where we begin and uh these companies have raised tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a really inter interesting new product to attack an old archaic industry and uh they have real technology real ip patents enterprise value what they're doing is is really fundamentally kind of changing it's either they're able to create that product uh for less uh and it's twice as effective um and so we're coming in and typically you mentioned ai i that's a really exciting space too right now uh we're not really taking gambl or taking risks on ai or the operating companies that are trying to uh to build and create revenues in that space we do more of the pick and shovel financing so we started as an equipment financing business it's still a big part of what we do right now and so in the ai space what we're doing is we're going into the data centers we're providing financing for the gpus um the nvidia servers the amd servers uh we're providing uh financing for the other capex needs they have power generation cpus etc so we really kind of stay in the peripheral we don't take that direct uh risk associated with the industry but really focus on more the pix and shovel financing um space you mentioned that that's obviously uh you know very exciting right now we do a lot in um kind of that low lower orbit satellite um launching rocket lab is a big uh customer of ours borrow of ours and we're mostly providing equipment financing

blackwell production speeding up and moving to the us here to talk about the big nvidia news today is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas it's the news everyone is talking about today right uh we've got some unconfirmed reports coming from reuters that nvidia is talking to taiwan semiconductors to bring blackw production to the arizona facility that taiwan semiconductor was building and that's really good news kind of for a couple of reasons on shoring uh semiconductor production aligns with national interest um it's expanding production for nvidia uh to help them meet um unmet demand so it's really a good news but there are still some hurdles for them to to cross yeah let's talk about some of those hurdles again like you said bringing semiconductor production back to the us has been a goal of the country for quite a while but it's not quite the fix that everyone's looking for well well right so it's potentially a fix but right now taiwan semiconductor is not able to do 100% of the manufacturing process in arizona so right now the outlook is that they would be able to begin production of the front end early next year right but it could be up to three years or longer before they start doing the full the full production process which means that until then they're going to have to start they'll have to ship the chips back to taiwan which brings that risk back into the picture so yes this move can reduce the risk but right now it's it's not really doing it yeah i feel like the motivation for this we've been talking about blackwell for months now is just to really speed up that production so there's so much demand for this new chip out there this should at least help with that and that should help nvidia share prices as well right i i would think so if they can get that production to start going early next year they can improve the production outlook for next year and thereby meet the the unmet demand like you said the news today unconfirmed reports from reuters um let's talk about how the stock price is reacting for nvidia but also taiwan semiconductors well really both stocks are moving higher today um if you look at the charts they're kind of tied together i mean nvidia's growth is equal to taiwan semiconductor's growth because taiwan semiconductor makes most of the chips right now they're both moving higher they're both looking good showing support and it looks like their uptrends are intact yeah analysts have been excited about nvidia all this year and have really good reports and good trajectory for this stock for next year but this news uh and some other news that you have in an article for us today uh could also help move nvidia even even higher than what analysts are predicting next year well right uh some comments from ceo jensen wang has sparked some speculation in the market that the next iteration of the ai chips called ruben could come out six months or more earlier than anticipated uh so i think based on the comments the market was expecting it to be a late second half uh 2026 event but uh jensen wang's comments make it seem like it could be early 2026 or maybe even late 2025 uh which would just uh really boost the demand outlook and the outlook for revenue and bring forward the outlook for revenue growth based on those chips yeah i think this is a testament to just how quickly ai technology is advancing nvidia of course at the forefront of that but announcing the next generation of chips even before blackwell hits the market fully is just how fast this ai industry is advancing oh right i wouldn't be surprised at all if we don't hear about maybe two or three other new next generations of chips even before reuben's released that's still like at least 12 15 months away so yeah this there's a good amount of time for them to make some advances i think that you're you're exactly right this industry is moving by leaps and bounds really fast there's going to be some major advances over the next year and that's good news not only for nvidia but really a lot of different ai stocks check out the free market beat report on seven ai stocks to invest in it's an introduction to ai investing for self-direct investors there's a lot of potential in this market and you can check out which seven stocks are set to take off in the ai industry by checking out the free report just scan the qr code or look for the link in the comments let's talk about bringing that production back to the us of semiconductors there's really been a push for this within the us recently especially well well right it seems to be um an issue that both sides of the aisle can agree on uh because most of the most of the world's chips are made in taiwan and that's really not a good thing because of how close it is to china china kind of wants to take over taiwan so there is a lot of risk for the world's semiconductor supply so bringing chips back to the us uh would greatly improve the supply chain and improve security absolutely one more time you've mentioned it a little bit talking about the timeline of when that arizona plant for taiwan semiconductors could be ready to go right so taiwan semiconductors plant will be able to start making blackb chips early next year uh so it'll be i mean maybe five or 10 years for them to have their own plants available for doing the final packaging but there's another company called amcore who has made a deal with taiwan semiconductors to build um what's called it's coas c ws chip on wafer on substrate facility in arizona alongside these other facilities so that should be available with about three three years so we got about a threeyear window until this plan would bear fruit regarding you know fully nationalizing um blackw production into the us all right let's talk about how investors can play news like this as you just mentioned this is really news that's a long-term kind of news it's going to have a long-term impact on the company but we're seeing that short-term boost in stock prices today is today a big news day a good time to get into the stock or is it better to wait a little while will the the long-term payoff come no matter when you get in right now nvidia stock is kind of consolidating near new highs and above this critical support level so it is a pretty decent time to get into the market if you think it's going higher um like you said this news is more of of a long-term kind of a news it aligns with the outlook it helps to boler the outlook it doesn't really move the needle so much today or this coming quarter but it will over time and i think that nvidia stock price will continue to trend higher because of it all right thanks for the information thomas and thank you for joining us here on market

this news uh and some other news that you have in an article for us today uh could also help move nvidia even even higher than what analysts are predicting next year well right uh some comments from ceo jensen wang has sparked some speculation in the market that the next iteration of the ai chips called ruben could come out six months or more earlier than anticipated uh so i think based on the comments the market was expecting it to be a late second half uh 2026 event but uh jensen wang's comments make it seem like it could be early 2026 or maybe even late 2025 uh which would just uh really boost the demand outlook and the outlook for revenue and bring forward the outlook for revenue growth based on those chips yeah i think this is a testament to just how quickly ai technology is advancing nvidia of course at the forefront of that but announcing the next generation of chips even before blackwell hits the market fully is just how fast this ai industry is advancing oh right i wouldn't be surprised at all if we don't hear about maybe two or three other new next generations of chips even before reuben's released that's still like at least 12 15 months away so yeah this there's a good amount of time for them to make some advances i think that you're you're exactly right this industry is moving by leaps and bounds really fast there's going to be some major advances over the next year and that's good news not only for nvidia but really a lot of different ai stocks check out the free market beat report on seven ai stocks to invest in it's an introduction to ai investing for self-direct investors there's a lot of potential in this market and you can check out which seven stocks are set to take off in the ai industry by checking out the free report just scan the qr code or look for the link in the comments let's talk about bringing that production back to the us of semiconductors there's really been a push for this within the us recently especially well well right it seems to be um an issue that both sides of the aisle can agree on uh because most of the most of the world's chips are made in taiwan and that's really not a good thing because of how close it is to china china kind of wants to take over taiwan so there is a lot of risk for the world's semiconductor supply so bringing chips back to the us uh would greatly improve the supply chain and improve security absolutely one more time you've mentioned it a little bit talking about the timeline of when that arizona plant for taiwan semiconductors could be ready to go right so taiwan semiconductors plant will be able to start making blackb chips early next year uh so it'll be i mean maybe five or 10 years for them to have their own plants available for doing the final packaging but there's another company called amcore who has made a deal with taiwan semiconductors to build um what's called it's coas c ws chip on wafer on substrate facility in arizona alongside these other facilities so that should be available with about three three years so we got about a threeyear window until this plan would bear fruit regarding you know fully nationalizing um blackw production into the us all right let's talk about how investors can play news like this as you just mentioned this is really news that's a long-term kind of news it's going to have a long-term impact on the company but we're seeing that short-term boost in stock prices today is today a big news day a good time to get into the stock or is it better to wait a little while will the the long-term payoff come no matter when you get in right now nvidia stock is kind of consolidating near new highs and above this critical support level so it is a pretty decent time to get into the market if you think it's going higher um like you said this news is more of of a long-term kind of a news it aligns with the outlook it helps to boler the outlook it doesn't really move the needle so much today or this coming quarter but it will over time and i think that nvidia stock price will continue to trend higher because of it all right thanks for the information thomas and thank you for joining us here on market

blackwell production speeding up and moving to the us here to talk about the big nvidia news today is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas it's the news everyone is talking about today right uh we've got some unconfirmed reports coming from reuters that nvidia is talking to taiwan semiconductors to bring blackw production to the arizona facility that taiwan semiconductor was building and that's really good news kind of for a couple of reasons on shoring uh semiconductor production aligns with national interest um it's expanding production for nvidia uh to help them meet um unmet demand so it's really a good news but there are still some hurdles for them to to cross yeah let's talk about some of those hurdles again like you said bringing semiconductor production back to the us has been a goal of the country for quite a while but it's not quite the fix that everyone's looking for well well right so it's potentially a fix but right now taiwan semiconductor is not able to do 100% of the manufacturing process in arizona so right now the outlook is that they would be able to begin production of the front end early next year right but it could be up to three years or longer before they start doing the full the full production process which means that until then they're going to have to start they'll have to ship the chips back to taiwan which brings that risk back into the picture so yes this move can reduce the risk but right now it's it's not really doing it yeah i feel like the motivation for this we've been talking about blackwell for months now is just to really speed up that production so there's so much demand for this new chip out there this should at least help with that and that should help nvidia share prices as well right i i would think so if they can get that production to start going early next year they can improve the production outlook for next year and thereby meet the the unmet demand like you said the news today unconfirmed reports from reuters um let's talk about how the stock price is reacting for nvidia but also taiwan semiconductors well really both stocks are moving higher today um if you look at the charts they're kind of

back to a gold rush gold prices may have dropped after the election but they're back on the climb again here to break down what's happening in the gold market is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas the price of gold is really starting to climb back up yeah it's uh it corrected since the election um i think that correction was just some volatility associated with policy anticipation and monetary policy anticipation for next year with the fed but uh the trends are bullish and i think think the trends will support the gold price rise well through 2025 yeah gold prices this year have really reached new highs this market's been incredible this year uh yeah it is it really is i think that there's really a couple of factors in play one of it is market normalization in the wake of the pandemic all the pandemic stimulus and spending really increased the monetary supply so where the value of gold really remains the same and the amount of money is increasing so it takes more money to buy gold that's really a fundamental supporter of the price but also demand for gold from all of its major demand sectors is positive and pushing uh the price higher and those trends should sustain through the end of next year why do you think gold prices will continue to rise through 2025 well because demand is growing so the estimates for how much gold is left kind of vary but we're pretty sure that there's only about 20 to 30% of the world's gold supply left um two-thirds of all gold was mined since 1950 they think that gold supplies are going to run out 2050 not too much later than that as far as uh being able to go and mind new gold so decreasing supply limited supply and increasing demand um it's the it's the base case it's the recipe for higher prices when uh demand outstrips supply prices go higher yeah that definitely makes sense oh let's talk about who is into the gold market and and who as investors should get into this market if you're not yet well so as far as who's in the market right now and who's driving it there are four main vectors for demand that's jewelry retail investors central banks and industrial demand and right now all those are on the rise when it comes to jewelry and retail demand we have a growing world population and a growing middle class and so it's been proven that demand for gold increases as wealth increases and so with the population growing in the middle class also growing within that population we have a dual tailwind for demand from that sector and jewelry is the largest demand vector for gold on top of that we have central banks central banks particularly in the emerging markets have been buying gold for years they're expected to continue to buy gold because they're shoring up their balance sheets they're creating a back stop for their own currencies they're reducing market volatility and their own economies and they're hedging against geopolitical risk and there is ample risk in the market today and then the final vector is industrial it's really the smallest sector of demand but it's growing and it's tied to technology uh some technologies that are really dependent on gold include solar but also a lot of the microchip technologies that's tied to ai and the iot rely on gold gold doesn't corrode it's a good conductor so it's very very well suited to a wide range of industrial applications as far as individual retail investors i obviously you mentioned the big players in this industry but are more and more retail investors looking to invest in gold well based on the etf inflows i would say yes etf flows had been bearish for several years until 2024 but this year the inflows uh reverted to positive and now that there is actual retail demand flowing into the market let's talk about another area where retail investors can really invest in gold and that's in different gold related stocks beric is one we've talked about several different times on the channel right um talk about where those stocks are going as the price of gold continues to get higher well those stocks are trending higher too um they are literally digging money out of the ground right now the price of gold is rising and the price of oil is if not falling at steady near long-term lows so their margins are increasing and that's only expected to continue over the next year all right thomas let's get into the price of where gold could be headed right before the election hit gold really peaked at over 2700 $100 it's getting closer to that number now but how high could it go well the technicals are pretty strong especially on the monthly charts the monthly chart shows some pretty significant convergences that reveal a strong and strengthening market now technically speaking when gold broke to its new highs this year it uh broke out of a $700 $800 price target range of trading range so that magnitude is going to be our first target so 2,000 plus 800 puts it right about 2,800 which is almost where it is now that's a base case the bull case would be a percent move so the percentage move uh for that trading range is almost 100% it's about 90% so a 90% move from the 2000 level is totally possible so we're looking at gold in the $3,800 to $4,000 range probably within the next couple of years still room to grow all right thomas well thank you so much for breaking this down today don't forget about the free premium report market bead has out there you can scan this qr code or check the link in the description to check out the free premium report on why gold could be taking off more in 2025

four years trump's former advisor brad thomas is here to share his insights on the future of reits brad we are so glad to have you with us today brad is also the founder of wid mode research brad let's dive right into what you think this next trump presidency could mean for the next four years of investing in real estate sure well since we're talking about you know new presidential regime i'll you know we obviously have to discuss politics i will tell you for the record uh i was on trump president trump's advisory board in his last uh administration and also wrote a book uh before he was um elected in 2016 called the trump factor so i spent two years analyzing um all of his properties which uh was a great way of saying i got to visit and play golf every golf course that that donald trump owns so i know it pretty well i'm not a great golfer for the record in full disclosure but um but i will say i know a lot about president trump and his business mindset and how he created his wealth and i'm really looking forward with this new uh with this new president uh coming in this year in january really looking forward to to how he's going to help create wealth for average you know average uh american and so i think there are a number of ways that i think are going to benefit um real estate in specifically reachs there are certain sectors that i'm that we're more cautious in for example we'll start with kind of the caution flag and again not to say this is going to be a bad place to invest but i think the tariffs are really a question mark and what you know how those tariffs are going to impact um you know the us uh investor and and companies in the us now in general um i think i think this is going to be a good thing i think trump has always done a pretty good job of negotiating you know um uh for us uh we saw that in his first administration but again the tariffs could have an impa impact on inflation which of course is going to be could be problematic for some of the warehousing companies um i'm more specifically concerned about the risk in markets like california for example i think those are states um that i'm really more concerned about um than than some of the others but i think overall just broadly speaking in real estate i think the corporate ta extending the corporate taxes lowering corporate tax rate think it's going to have a significant impact on a lot of the tenants and a lot of the customers uh for for in reefs for example you kind of go sector by sector but if you look at the retail sector and we cover the shopping centers as well as the malls in addition to the outlet sector and i'm really excited because i think those companies are because of that lower tax rate are going to you know deliver more profits which is going to make their their certainly is is is they pay rent more sustainable business models for the landlords of companies like uh you know the shopping center re to the mall re and so forth so i think i think that's going to have a huge impact i think president trump will be able to generate more jobs i think that's going to be the really the foundation to the success of his business of of his administration is to deliver more jobs you know more american jobs and i think that's going to really help increase manufacturing um and really help strengthen the overall you know broader economy you know in terms of kind of more real estate focus you know within uh real estate investing we have this this we've had these laws on the books for a long time called 1031 exchanges that allows you to defer capital gains from one asset to another um that's survived many different um you know political uh changes over the years uh president biden actually did remove some of the 1031 laws as it relates to to non-real estate but i think that's going to really continue to to create value because those laws are not just for corporations they're more for individual investors as well so i think i think we'll see that the other thing i'll tell you with with president trump and again having analyzed his businesses pretty well i me he's actually a partner with uh one of the reits has a very large port of his part of his net worth uh tied to ownership being in partnership with with a very large re and he's actually owned shares in in reit as well uh so i know he's very bullish with with the reit sector he knows the sector pretty well and i think having some of the key people in place the new secretary of commerce uh who came you know the founder of caner fitzgerald howard lutnick i think that's going to be extremely important for the re industry uh going forward and again i think overall that the tax the tax laws are going to be extremely favorable lowering those corporate taxes and again trying to strengthen the um individual investor so he has more disposable he or she has more disposable income uh to invest in in re so i think i i do think that it's going to be a very good good four years for for president trump and again he's got a lot of work to do but i'm i'm certain he'll be able to perform this is definitely one sector a lot of investors are going to be looking at closely over the next few years of this next trump presidency thanks for sharing your insights today brad we'll be sharing more from brad over the coming weeks here on market beat he again is an expert in real estate

will the super micro rebound continue here to break it down for us is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas it has been a wild two weeks for smci yes it has been a wild two weeks the stock is up more than 100% since hitting its bottom a few weeks ago i think this rebound could continue because they're kind of rebuilding some confidence um in the stock price right now there are some risks still ahead but i think provided they're able to finalize their reports in a satisfactory manner this rebound will not only continue but it could turn into a sustained rally for next year yes we'll break down some of those delayed reports in a minute but first let's kind of back up and talk about where this stock has been even though it might be trading over 30 right now it's still a far cry from where this stock peaked earlier this year so last year there was a quite a bubble formed with ai that bubble peak well above $120 earlier this year now we're down around 40 um that big implosion is the ai bubble bursting but also compounded by those filing issues the market really lost its confidence in the stock uh right now what i see is the stock price is really disconnected from reality because trading in the mid-30s it's really in alignment to where it was at the end of last year before the bubble formed but we know that the business is more than 150% bigger so the stock certainly deserves more premium that the market is giving it right now right with that ai bubble bursting earlier this year investors might be a little bit wey about investing in ai i stocks while marketbeat has a free premium report that can help it's called seven ai stocks to invest in an introduction to ai investing for self-directed investors click the link below or scan the qr code to check out that free premium report that could help you dive into ai investing a little more yeah let's talk about some of that loss of trust and and distrust in the stock uh break down a little bit about what happened with earnings reports and financials for this company well it just started with some whistle blower testimony um earlier this year just kind of raising some questions about their practices and highlighting a problem they had in the past that was compounded by a short sale report kind of hit on the same the same subjects uh the company has since been unable to finalize its last year's fiscal year year-end report it lost its auditor because there was some misunderstanding in the numbers they couldn't get they couldn't get p um there has been a risk of delisting uh but the recent news is that they got a new auditor a trusted auditor bdo with the top five accounting firm globally um it's kind of restored some confidence in the market um the risk is that they won't be able to finalize their results but uh the general opinion right now is that boo will be able to do this in an expedited manner um and so whether it's good or bad we should know pretty soon i'm sure the new auditing firm is a part of the reason for the boost in stock price but why do you think the stock is starting to rise again after are voling so low partially it's the rebuilding of confidence but also over the holiday week they announced that they've uh prepaid some debt they closed out two different lines of credit they had which is really a big deal because they're reducing uh debt risk they're freeing up cash flow they're improving the balance sheet and again they're just instilling some more confidence in the company's ability to uh to progress as a going concern yeah and i think that's what a lot of uh investors are wondering right now is how far can this company progress the stock price has certainly seen a lot of movement but let's talk about the company itself how successful is this business well the business is pretty successful they're one of the leaders with uh direct liquid cooled servers which is really important for ai the ai microchips uh use so much power they create so much heat um that cooling them and keeping the data centers functioning is a big cost for the data center operators so these liquid cooled server racks are really important for not only the efficiency of the chips but for the efficiency of the operation the forecasts for next year are still pretty good the company's 150% bigger this year than last year the forecast for next year are for another 20% growth uh those maybe cautious estimates just given um the way things have gone this year the analysts certainly have not a lot of reasons to be really aggressive with those targets absolutely so there's demand for their services uh they expect to see growth for that continue they're also working with nvidia which has some consumer confidence as well correct indeed indeed one of the things that helped build the confidence over the last couple of weeks is that during nvidia's earnings report and conference call they gave super micro a shout out which just kind of um affirms the fact that nvidia is still working with them and that it's still important to the ai infrastructure great well let's move on to the stock price itself this is what investors are really wondering how far do we think this rebound could possibly go well i think the stock could gain a good 50 to 100% from these current levels just based on the way that the revenue and earnings are gr um but where it goes soon and how long it stays there really depends on the new cycle and and how quickly they're able to get these these results finalized now let's dive into the analyst uh predictions a little bit more uh where are the most recent analyst targets at for this stock right so the most recent targets have it fairly valued near its current levels in the mid-30s the consensus is down significantly from its peak and we expect the stock to trade below the consensus because the new the new revision trend is is low but even at consensus we're looking at more than 100% upside so i think that uh we're looking at a floor for the market and the low3s with a potential for a 50 to 100% upside over the next 12 months oh let's talk about any trading plays for this stock with all of the volatility happening with smci right now the best trading plays would be to wait for a price dip because we know it's going to happen there's still a lot of uncertainty and is a volatile market so price dips would be a good time to get in in a small speculative manner and anytime that it would rip or move higher would be a good time to get out well as we close out this video today thomas the final question for investors out there is do you think that the stock is fairly valued of where it's at right now i really don't i mean and there is a lot of um concern with the reports so we could be i could be proven wrong this stock could go to zero but i think that trading at 11 times earnings is fairly undervalued compared to its peers which are trading at you know 20 30 and 40 times their earnings so i think that provided a positive outcome this stock will rocket higher and could easily see a 50 to 100% upside that's some good news if people are looking for a stock with some big potential growth thank you again for breaking down everything going on with this stock right now thomas and thank you for watching check out more of our videos for more info just like this on market

will the super micro rebound continue here to break it down for us is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas it has been a wild two weeks for smci yes it has been a wild two weeks the stock is up more than 100% since hitting its bottom a few weeks ago i think this rebound could continue because they're kind of rebuilding some confidence um in the stock price right now there are some risks still ahead but i think provided they're able to finalize their reports in a satisfactory manner this rebound will not only continue but it could turn into a sustained rally for next year yes we'll break down some of those delayed reports in a minute but first let's kind of back up and talk about where this stock has been even though it might be trading over 30 right now it's still a far cry from where this stock peaked earlier this year so last year there was a quite a bubble formed with ai that bubble peak well above $120 earlier this year now we're down around 40 um that big implosion is the ai bubble bursting but also compounded by those filing issues the market really lost its confidence in the stock uh right now what i see is the stock price is really disconnected from reality because trading in the mid-30s it's really in alignment to where it was at the end of last year before the bubble formed but we know that the business is more than 150% bigger so the stock certainly deserves more premium that the market is giving it right now right with that ai bubble bursting earlier this year investors might be a little bit wey about investing in ai i stocks while marketbeat has a free premium report that can help it's called seven ai stocks to invest in an introduction to ai investing for self-directed investors click the link below or scan the qr code to check out that free premium report that could help you dive into ai investing a little more yeah let's talk about some of that loss of trust and and distrust in the stock uh break down a little bit about what happened with earnings reports and financials for this company well it just started with some whistle blower testimony um earlier this year just kind of raising some questions about their practices and highlighting a problem they had in the past that was compounded by a short sale report kind of hit on the same the same subjects uh the company has since been unable to finalize its last year's fiscal year year-end report it lost its auditor because there was some misunderstanding in the numbers they couldn't get they couldn't get p um there has been a risk of delisting uh but the recent news is that they got a new auditor a trusted auditor bdo with the top five accounting firm globally um it's kind of restored some confidence in the market um the risk is that they won't be able to finalize their results but uh the general opinion right now is that boo will be able to do this in an expedited manner um and so whether it's good or bad we should know pretty soon i'm sure the new auditing firm is a part of the reason for the boost in stock price but why do you think the stock is starting to rise again after are voling so low partially it's the rebuilding of confidence but also over the holiday week they announced that they've uh prepaid some debt they closed out two different lines of credit they had which is really a big deal because they're reducing uh debt risk they're freeing up cash flow they're improving the balance sheet and again they're just instilling some more confidence in the company's ability to uh to progress as a going concern yeah and i think that's what a lot of uh investors are wondering right now is how far can this company progress the stock price has certainly seen a lot of movement but let's talk about the company itself how successful is this business well the business is pretty successful they're one of the leaders with uh direct liquid cooled servers which is really important for ai the ai microchips uh use so much power they create so much heat um that cooling them and keeping the data centers functioning is a big cost for the data center operators so these liquid cooled server racks are really important for not only the efficiency of the chips but for the efficiency of the operation the forecasts for next year are still pretty good the company's 150% bigger this year than last year the forecast for next year are for another 20% growth uh those maybe cautious estimates just given um the way things have gone this year the analysts certainly have not a lot of reasons to be really aggressive with those targets absolutely so there's demand for their services uh they expect to see growth for that continue they're also working with nvidia which has some consumer confidence as well correct indeed indeed one of the things that helped build the confidence over the last couple of weeks is that during nvidia's earnings report and conference call they gave super micro a shout out which just kind of um affirms the fact that nvidia is still working with them and that it's still important to the ai infrastructure great well let's move on to the stock price itself this is what investors are really wondering how far do we think this rebound could possibly go well i think the stock could gain a good 50 to 100% from these current levels just based on the way that the revenue and earnings are gr um but where it goes soon and how long it stays there really depends on the new cycle and and how quickly they're able to get these these results finalized now let's dive into the analyst uh predictions a little bit more uh where are the most recent analyst targets at for this stock right so the most recent targets have it fairly valued near its current levels in the mid-30s the consensus is down significantly from its peak and we expect the stock to trade below the consensus because the new the new revision trend is is low but even at consensus we're looking at more than 100% upside so i think that uh we're looking at a floor for the market and the low3s with a potential for a 50 to 100% upside over the next 12 months oh let's talk about any trading plays for this stock with all of

captions language: en a bull market has been growing ever since the start of the election but is this just the beginning here to break down where we're headed is market be guest chris row with true market insiders chris so glad you could be with us today thanks for having me bridget yeah so let's talk about start off today with where the stock market is right now what's been happening well we're talking about large cap stocks or small cap stocks uh right now we're at highs and breaking new highs but the euphoria has yet to even begin and when you reach that euphoric stage it lasts for about a year so what we're doing right now is we're entering into this is just the beginning we're entering into the next phase the strongest phase of the bull market we've already missed the bottom um you we've climbed a wall of worry and um that's typical for a cycle once you remove the big scary problems one by one the market continues to move higher and then after that we go into market mania where people stop thinking about valuation they only want to avoid missing the next big winner so we've just entered that phase um for large caps and small caps so yeah one of that areas that we're seeing people jumping into now more more than others recently is the small cap industry talk about how much growth we're seeing in that sector so small caps um iwm is the russell 2000 small cap index fund so if anybody just wants to buy the stock market right now i would suggest buying the small cap stock market so you have a diversified fairly equally weighted index as opposed to the s&amp;p 500 which are basically buying mega cap tech stocks instead being this very diversified iwm i know it's kind of a basic idea but i think most people are going to be focusing on the wrong things they're going to be focusing on yesterday's stories which are the big giant companies the magnificent 7 and um not only do i think that's over with for a while but i think that might be one the one bearish pocket of the stock market interesting well outside of the stock market another area seeing a big bull run right now is cryptocurrency talk about what's going on in the crypto market well you've got the benchmark of course uh bitcoin bitcoin breaking highs now something to notice about the stock market look at it in the context of the election anytime you want to look at what's strong and likely to continue to be strong for the next couple years just look at what happened from november 6th to november 7th and look at what the biggest gainers were the key is to be in the strongest areas of the market bitcoin exploded to the upside as soon as trump was elected he branded himself as a crypto-friendly uh president took donations um not donations uh campaign contributions um in the form of bitcoin in the form of ethereum and he's also surrounding himself with very pro crypto people obviously like elon musk you mentioned elon musk is one of trump's main advisers right now and through the election and we're seeing that pay out in some of his different stocks including tesla and even dogecoin both doing really well right now yeah tesla another stock that absolutely exploded right after the election so the stock traded from two 48 um within a couple of days it was up at 348 uh it just shows what tesla's going to be doing over the next couple of years if you look at dogecoin it doubled immediately after trump was elected and it tripled just in the last month alone you think about how elon musk bought out twitter i don't know if trump would have gotten elected had elon musk not bought out bought out and opened up twitter yeah elon has made quite a few big investment moves over the years and i'm sure has plenty of more to come if you want to see a free premium report on market beat called elon musk's next move and how to invest in it click on the link below in the description or scan the qr code for that full premium report i know you mentioned whatever was big right away right after the election is what's going to continue to see the biggest bull market in the next four years what are some of the industries that we saw really with an uptick right away the financial sector uh bottom line so you have the financial sector that everybody knows and that's xlf um but that's the large cap s&amp;p biggest financial companies in the planet and that's picked out of an index of 500 stocks but if you just look about across the entire market you've have the uh insurance companies you got wall street sector you got snls you got banks uh you got finance so all parts of the the financial sector shot right up to the top the number one strongest were banks so investing in banks bank etfs um i think if you just buy that with your eyes clos and two hands tight behind your back you're going to outperform the market handily um i think if you don't have exposures to exposure to financials you're absolutely doing the wrong thing in the stock market right now like you said there's a lot of great sentiment about the stock market and the future of the economy right now but there is some risk as well and some things to consider where does some of those risks or questions lie with a trump economy in the future i imagine that even if we had a bad economy i think we'd still have a bull market just because of the supply demand factor um we saw money come into the us stock market last year in a way that we haven't seen since the first half of 2009 that was right after the 2008 collapse right so we haven't seen this much money move out of fixed income out of currencies out of other asset classes and into us equities since that first half of 2009 we saw that just last year so there's a lot of money that moved into the stock market quietly before the election and i think there's a lot of pent up energy they wanted to know who was going to be elected before they actually started piling in and moving stocks higher so i think that a lot of what you're going to see and the explosive nature of the stock market that i think that we're about to witness is going to be just pent up energy that it's kind of been a wait and see game for the last year nobody knew for sure if trump was going to get elected and as soon as he did you just saw a lot of what they've been waiting for basically if something negative happens and that affects the stock market negatively i think you want to get in there and buy you could look at it this way if something horrible happens and it causes the stock market to suddenly jolt much lower at least something good is happening because it's giving you a buying opportunity that's a good way to look at it i do feel like a lot of what you've been saying so far has kind of been building towards really one direction and that's a strong bull market ahead if you think about everything that we discussed today they're all components of a story that's a little more cohesive so if we put it all together think about it like this you have yesterday and you have tomorrow right yesterday's market was pre-trump yesterday's market was nvidia and microsoft and google and the magnificent 7 it's a new day and one of the biggest reasons that individual investors underperform the market is because they get stuck in the old story so i think what everybody needs to do right now is just make sure it's very simple you don't need lots and lots of indicators you don't need all sorts of different news you don't have to crunch numbers it's very very simple because the market tips its hand every time a president gets elected and it tells you what it's going to do for the next couple of years so get in the strongest sectors um get into cryptocurrency i strongly recommend getting into at least bitcoin salana avalanche salana so is one that's probably going to multiply four times just over the next year uh it's a it's a real coin it's not one of these meme coins youall have to look into it um bank stocks financials you want to be in the strongest areas of the stock market so we as we move into this next phase and you begin to feel that sense of euphoria you're well positioned in what is going to be tomorrow leaders like i'm telling you that financials will be tomorrow's leaders you want to position yourself in that and bitcoin and if you look at the pro business cabinet if you look at elon musk donald trump um you look at the us treasury secretary everybody is a business person or a money manager right they're on your side um it's all systems are go right now so buy the dips consider that we're not even close to a market mania we're not even close to the euphoric stage of the stock market that's ahead that hasn't even that's just beginning right now so i think people are going to really start to see that um going into the uh holiday season you know the stock market's generally very strong throughout november and december and if you look at what happened last time trump got elected the market absolutely ripped higher while everybody was at home opening gifts you know not participating in the market you want to stay plugged into this market it's going to be a lot of great opportunities and i wouldn't wait for a pullback i'd get in to your favorite stocks the strongest sectors of the market right now don't stop paying attention to the market all right keep your eyes glued to the market because you're going to see some of the biggest uh profit opportunities just in the next month that you're going to see for the next 12 months so don't take your eye off the ball this is not the time to do it some really great advice chris for investors to consider and look forward to over the next few weeks is again like you said the market is going to see a lot more moves um

year so what we're doing right now is we're entering into this is just the beginning we're entering into the next phase the strongest phase of the bull market we've already missed the bottom um you we've climbed a wall of worry and um that's typical for a cycle once you remove the big scary problems one by one the market continues to move higher and then after that we go into market mania where people stop thinking about valuation they only want to avoid missing the next big winner so we've just entered that phase um for large caps and small caps so yeah one of that areas that we're seeing people jumping into now more more than others recently is the small cap industry talk about how much growth we're seeing in that sector so small caps um iwm is the russell 2000 small cap index fund so if anybody just wants to buy the stock market right now i would suggest buying the small cap stock market so you have a diversified fairly equally weighted index as opposed to the s&amp;p 500 which are basically buying mega cap tech stocks instead being this very diversified iwm i know it's kind of a basic idea but i think most people are going to be focusing on the wrong things they're going to be focusing on yesterday's stories which are the big giant companies the magnificent 7 and um not only do i think that's over with for a while but i think that might be one the one bearish pocket of the stock market interesting well outside of the stock market another area seeing a big bull run right now is cryptocurrency talk about what's going on in the crypto market well you've got the benchmark of course uh bitcoin bitcoin breaking highs now something to notice about the stock market look at it in the context of the election anytime you want to look at what's strong and likely to continue to be strong for the next couple years just look at what happened from november 6th to november 7th and look at what the biggest gainers were the key is to be in the strongest areas of the market bitcoin exploded to the upside as soon as trump was elected he branded himself as a crypto-friendly uh president took donations um not donations uh campaign contributions um in the form of bitcoin in the form of ethereum and he's also surrounding himself with very pro crypto people obviously like elon musk you mentioned elon musk is one of trump's main advisers right now and through the election and we're seeing that pay out in some of his different stocks including tesla and even dogecoin both doing really well right now yeah tesla another stock that absolutely exploded right after the election so the stock traded from two 48 um within a couple of days it was up at 348 uh it just shows what tesla's going to be doing over the next couple of years if you look at dogecoin it doubled immediately after trump was elected and it tripled just in the last month alone you think about how elon musk bought out twitter i don't know if trump would have gotten elected had elon musk not bought out bought out and opened up twitter yeah elon has made quite a few big investment moves over the years and i'm sure has plenty of more to come if you want to see a free premium report on market beat called elon musk's next move and how to invest in it click on the link below in the description or scan the qr code for that full premium report i know you mentioned whatever was big right away right after the election is what's going to continue to see the biggest bull market in the next four years what are some of the industries that we saw really with an uptick right away the financial sector uh bottom line so you have the financial sector that everybody knows and that's xlf um but that's the large cap s&amp;p biggest financial companies in the planet and that's picked out of an index of 500 stocks but if you just look about across the entire market you've have the uh insurance companies you got wall street sector you got snls you got banks uh you got finance so all parts of the the financial sector shot right up to the top the number one strongest were banks so investing in banks bank etfs um i think if you just buy that with your eyes clos and two hands tight behind your back you're going to outperform the market handily um i think if you don't have exposures to exposure to financials you're absolutely doing the wrong thing in the stock market right now like you said there's a lot of great sentiment about the stock market and the future of the economy right now but there is some risk as well and some things to consider where does some of those risks or questions lie with a trump economy in the future i imagine that even if we had a bad economy i think we'd still have a bull market just because of the supply demand factor um we saw money come into the us stock market last year in a way that we haven't seen since the first half of 2009 that was right after the 2008 collapse right so we haven't seen this much money move out of fixed income out of currencies out of other asset classes and into us equities since that first half of 2009 we saw that just last year so there's a lot of money that moved into the stock market quietly before the election and i think there's a lot of pent up energy they wanted to know who was going to be elected before they actually started piling in and moving stocks higher so i think that a lot of what you're going to see and the explosive nature of the stock market that i think that we're about to witness is going to be just pent up energy that it's kind of been a wait and see game for the last year nobody knew for sure if trump was going to get elected and as soon as he did you just saw a lot of what they've been waiting for basically if something negative happens and that affects the stock market negatively i think you want to get in there and buy you could look at it this way if something horrible happens and it causes the stock market to suddenly jolt much lower at least something good is happening because it's giving you a buying opportunity that's a good way to look at it i do feel like a lot of what you've been saying so far has kind of been building towards really one direction and that's a strong bull market ahead if you think about everything that we discussed today they're all components of a story that's a little more cohesive so if we put it all together think about it like this you have yesterday and you have tomorrow right yesterday's market was pre-trump yesterday's market was nvidia and microsoft and google and the magnificent 7 it's a new day and one of the biggest reasons that individual investors underperform the market is because they get stuck in the old story so i think what everybody needs to do right now is just make sure it's very simple you don't need lots and lots of indicators you don't need all sorts of different news you don't have to crunch numbers it's very very simple because the market tips its hand every time a president gets elected and it tells you what it's going to do for the next couple of years so get in the strongest sectors um get into cryptocurrency i strongly recommend getting into at least bitcoin salana avalanche salana so is one that's probably going to multiply four times just over the next year uh it's a it's a real coin it's not one of these meme coins youall have to look into it um bank stocks financials you want to be in the strongest areas of the stock market so we as we move into this next phase and you begin to feel that sense of euphoria you're well positioned in what is going to be tomorrow leaders like i'm telling you that financials will be tomorrow's leaders you want to position yourself in that and bitcoin and if you look at the pro business cabinet if you look at elon musk donald trump um you look at the us treasury secretary everybody is a business person or a money manager right they're on your side um it's all systems are go right now so buy the dips consider that we're not even close to a market mania we're not even close to the euphoric stage of the stock market that's ahead that hasn't even that's just beginning right now so i think people are going to really start to see that um going into the uh holiday season you know the stock market's generally very strong throughout november and december and if you look at what happened last time trump got elected the market absolutely ripped higher while everybody was at home opening gifts you know not participating in the market you want to stay plugged into this market it's going to be a lot of great opportunities and i wouldn't wait for a pullback i'd get in to your favorite stocks the strongest sectors of the market right now don't stop paying attention to the market all right keep your eyes glued to the market because you're going to see some of the biggest uh profit opportunities just in the next month that you're going to see for the next 12 months so don't take your eye off the ball this is not the time to do it some really great advice chris for investors to consider and look forward to over the next few weeks is again like you said the market is going to see a lot more moves um where can people and our viewers find more of your advice and information from your company i'll keep it simple if you just go to chris ro. chrisr .io you'll see i post a video there almost every day

behind your back you're going to outperform the market handily um i think if you don't have exposures to exposure to financials you're absolutely doing the wrong thing in the stock market right now like you said there's a lot of great sentiment about the stock market and the future of the economy right now but there is some risk as well and some things to consider where does some of those risks or questions lie with a trump economy in the future i imagine that even if we had a bad economy i think we'd still have a bull market just because of the supply demand factor um we saw money come into the us stock market last year in a way that we haven't seen since the first half of 2009 that was right after the 2008 collapse right so we haven't seen this much money move out of fixed income out of currencies out of other asset classes and into us equities since that first half of 2009 we saw that just last year so there's a lot of money that moved into the stock market quietly before the election and i think there's a lot of pent up energy they wanted to know who was going to be elected before they actually started piling in and moving stocks higher so i think that a lot of what you're going to see and the explosive nature of the stock market that i think that we're about to witness is going to be just pent up energy that it's kind of been a wait and see game for the last year nobody knew for sure if trump was going to get elected and as soon as he did you just saw a lot of what they've been waiting for basically if something negative happens and that affects the stock market negatively i think you want to get in there and buy you could look at it this way if something horrible happens and it causes the stock market to suddenly jolt much lower at least something good is happening because it's giving you a buying opportunity that's a good way to look at it i do feel like a lot of what you've been saying so far has kind of been building towards really one direction and that's a strong bull market ahead if you think about everything that we discussed today they're all components of a story that's a little more cohesive so if we put it all together think about it like this you have yesterday and you have tomorrow right yesterday's market was pre-trump yesterday's market was nvidia and microsoft and google and the magnificent 7 it's a new day and one of the biggest reasons that individual investors underperform the market is because they get stuck in the old story so i think what everybody needs to do right now is just make sure it's very simple you don't need lots and lots of indicators you don't need all sorts of different news you don't have to crunch numbers it's very very simple because the market tips its hand every time a president gets elected and it tells you what it's going to do for the next couple of years so get in the strongest sectors um get into cryptocurrency i strongly recommend getting into at least bitcoin salana avalanche salana so is one that's probably going to multiply four times just over the next year uh it's a it's a real coin it's not one of these meme coins youall have to look into it um bank stocks financials you want to be in the strongest areas of the stock market so we as we move into this next phase and you begin to feel that sense of euphoria you're well positioned in what is going to be tomorrow leaders like i'm telling you that financials will be tomorrow's leaders you want to position yourself in that and bitcoin and if you look at the pro business cabinet if you look at elon musk donald trump um you look at the us treasury secretary everybody is a business person or a money manager right they're on your side um it's all systems are go right now so buy the dips consider that we're not even close to a market mania we're not even close to the euphoric stage of the stock market that's ahead that hasn't even that's just beginning right now so i think people are going to really start to see that um going into the uh holiday season you know the stock market's generally very strong throughout november and december and if you look at what happened last time trump got elected the market absolutely ripped higher while everybody was at home opening gifts you know not participating in the market you want to stay plugged into this market it's going to be a lot of great opportunities and i wouldn't wait for a pullback i'd get in to your favorite stocks the strongest sectors of the market right now don't stop paying attention to the market all right keep your eyes glued to the market because you're going to see some of the biggest uh profit opportunities just in the next month that you're going to see for the next 12 months so don't take your eye off the ball this is not the time to do it some really great advice chris for investors to consider and look forward to over the next few weeks is again like you said the market is going to see a lot more moves um

captions language: en a bull market has been growing ever since the start of the election but is this just the beginning here to break down where we're headed is market be guest chris row with true market insiders chris so glad you could be with us today thanks for having me bridget yeah so let's talk about start off today with where the stock market is right now what's been happening well we're talking about large cap stocks or small cap stocks uh right now we're at highs and breaking new highs but the euphoria has yet to even begin and when you reach that euphoric stage it lasts for about a year so what we're doing right now is we're entering into this is just the beginning we're entering into the next phase the strongest phase of the bull market we've already missed the bottom um you we've climbed a wall of worry and um that's typical for a cycle once you remove the big scary problems one by one the market continues to move higher and then after that we go into market mania where people stop thinking about valuation they only want to avoid missing the next big winner so we've just entered that phase um for large caps and small caps so yeah one of that areas that we're seeing people jumping into now more more than others recently is the small cap industry talk about how much growth we're seeing in that sector so small caps um iwm is the russell 2000 small cap index fund so if anybody just wants to buy the stock market right now i would suggest buying the small cap stock market so you have a diversified fairly equally weighted index as opposed to the s&amp;p 500 which are basically buying mega cap tech stocks instead being this very diversified iwm i know it's kind of a basic idea but i think most people are going to be focusing on the wrong things they're going to be focusing on yesterday's stories which are the big giant companies the magnificent 7 and um not only do i think that's over with for a while but i think that might be one the one bearish pocket of the stock market interesting well outside of the stock market another area seeing a big bull run right now is cryptocurrency talk about what's going on in the crypto market well you've got the benchmark of course uh bitcoin bitcoin breaking highs now something to notice about the stock market look at it in the context of the election anytime you want to look at what's strong and likely to continue to be strong for the next couple years just look at what happened from november 6th to november 7th and look at what the biggest gainers were the key is to be in the strongest areas of the market bitcoin exploded to the upside as soon as trump was elected he branded himself as a crypto-friendly uh president took donations um not donations uh campaign contributions um in the form of bitcoin in the form of ethereum and he's also surrounding himself with very pro crypto people obviously like elon musk you mentioned elon musk is one of trump's main advisers right now and through the election and we're seeing that pay out in some of his different stocks including tesla and even dogecoin both doing really well right now yeah tesla another stock that absolutely exploded right after the election so the stock traded from two 48 um within a couple of days it was up at 348 uh it just shows what tesla's going to be doing over the next couple of years if you look at dogecoin it doubled immediately after trump was elected and it tripled just in the last month alone you think about how elon musk bought out twitter i don't know if trump would have gotten elected had elon musk not bought out bought out and opened up twitter yeah elon has made quite a few big investment moves over the years and i'm sure has plenty of more to come if you want to see a free premium report on market beat called elon musk's next move and how to invest in it click on the link below in the description or scan the qr code for that full premium report i know you mentioned whatever was big right away right after the election is what's going to continue to see the biggest bull market in the next four years what are some of the industries that we saw really with an uptick right away the financial sector uh bottom line so you have the financial sector that everybody knows and that's xlf um but that's the large cap s&amp;p biggest financial companies in the planet and that's picked out of an index of 500 stocks but if you just look about across the entire market you've have the uh insurance companies you got wall street sector you got snls you got banks uh you got finance so all parts of the the financial sector shot right up to the top the number one strongest were banks so investing in banks bank etfs um i think if you just buy that with your eyes clos and two hands tight

surged new highs since the election and now all eyes are on crypto here to break down what's going on in this world of investing is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas there is quite a bit of movement in the crypto market right now yeah it's been pretty phenomenal bitcoin's up like 60% in the last couple of weeks um and a lot of this is just due to the election it was tickling new highs before the election it broke out right after the election and that's because trump and the republicans are cryptocurrency friendly his pick for treasury scott bessent is cryptocurrency friendly so the market is just taking this as a uh a go-ahead to start investing in crypto again to start investing in crypto businesses for those businesses to start investing in in themselves so it's kind of unleashed a new cryptocurrency summer and bitcoin is the one that everyone's heard of but there's a lot of different altcoins out there are they seeing a lot of movement right now too they really are too but i think the movement and the altcoins is more of a risk-on mentality in the market now that the cryptocurrency um outlook is a lot brighter there's going to be a lot more risky investors going into those coins um if you look at the data bitcoin is still the dominant coin and it's actually gaining in dominance its market cap has reached a multi-year high it's been rising steadily it's at an all-time high and the hash rate which is the measure of the amount of computing power that's going into bitcoin is also continuing to rise also at all-time high so bitcoin is just as popular as it has ever been and is gaining popularity within the crypto currency universe well for some investors who maybe aren't familiar or haven't yet gotten into cryptocurrency investing uh there's still ways to invest in this industry using the traditional stock market there are some companies that are either mining bitcoin or investing in bitcoin and micro strategy is one that stands out it used to be a software company but now it's pretty much just a bank of bitcoin they've been leveraging their balance sheet to buy bitcoin um for the last few quarters um the latest results show their bitcoin stash growing by another 11% the value of that bitcoin is up more than double in the last year because of the rise of bitcoin's prices um right now the outlook for this stock is that they're just going to continue to leverage their balance sheet and buy more bitcoin and potentially become the world's first reserve bank of bitcoin wow oh let's talk about their stock price right now where is it at and how much of a growth story is that in just this year well right the stock price shot up pretty solidly along with the price of bitcoin um the outlook is still pretty bullish but the market recently hit a top at 450 it's showing some pretty significant resistance i would expect to see shares of this stock uh trend sideways and consolidate for the next few weeks maybe for a few months until uh trump takes office and we see what's really going to happen but the long-term outlook is pretty bullish for this for the stock it looks like uh analysts are raising their price targets quite a bit yes the trending analyst sentiment is very supportive for this market and they are leading it to new highs if you're new to investing especially in crypto you probably have a lot of questions about how to get started well we have a free premium report here at marketbeat called 10 best starter stocks for beginning investors click on the link or scan the qr code to get that free report and learn some of the best ways to get started thomas if you are just getting started in crypto is it safer to really try and invest through the stock market in stocks like the one you just recommended or is it just as safe to really get into buying bitcoin on your own well i want to say to start with that it is becoming safer to invest in bitcoin but it's still a very risky asset and the stocks that invested it are still also very risky you have to be um very prepared for vol volatility and you can see that in micro strategy price and in bitcoin's price it'll make some pretty wicked moves higher but it'll pull back just as quickly depending on uh which asset that you go for that's really going to be an individual risk preference whether you want to go into the stocks or into the coins themselves but the the big thing is just to be prepared for volatility long term though i think it is a good play cryptocurrencies is the future of finances um and eventually it will become a lot more mainstream than it is i know you mentioned it's getting safer and i think investors are realizing that simply in the number of investors that are starting to move toward investing in crypto right i can't really speak towards a specific number of investors that are doing it but there is some interesting data the inflows into bitcoin tracking etfs jump by 100% the week after the election which i think is a pretty telling sign that retail investors are now interested in this market again and their support is present in the market well thanks for breaking down what's going on in the crypto market again it's something everyone is talking about right now and i think we're going to be talking about this story for a long time to come thanks thomas and thank you for joining us as always happy investing

captions language: en do you know the value of your life insurance policy a new public company is helping millions of people look at life insurance as an asset let's dive in today we are excited to have jay jackson the ceo of advocus life with us at market beat thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today jay absolutely excited to be here well we're excited to hear your company's story in really a unique space share a little bit about what abacus life does sure abacus life is an alternative asset manager a global alternative asset manager that focuses primarily on purchasing assets that are predictable and consistent that might be traditionally uncorrelated through the market using our actuarial data and our lifespan data to help set the value and that makes us a really unique business that investors today are really looking for how can they invest in assets that don't have the types of correlation that you see related to interest rate sensitivity and market volatility and we're the company that originates those assets we're the market maker in those assets and we're also the asset manager in those assets you had a lot of big financial terms there so breaking it down to what what amicus life provides it's really about life insurance talk about who your customers are and kind of your target group sure so what's really interesting is that in our name you see it's abacus life which we thought we were being clever early on in the sense that abacus being the first cou calculator and really the life part was the idea of calculating your life knowing the value of your life and so we purchase life insurance policies we don't issue them and that is a really unique kind of twist because what happens is is that life insurance is used for a purpose a specific amount of time but then very rarely actually passed on to the airs and what i mean by that is life insurance is about a 13 trillion industry of the 13 trillion which by the way is two and a half times the us residential real estate market of that 90% of those policies or n9 out of 10 never pay a claim to the beneficiaries and it's not because the life insurance company has done something wrong it's because we don't treat it like an actual asset the supreme court ruled life insurance as personal property but we don't treat it like personal property we don't treat it like our home instead we just stop making payments on it because we think oh it's it served its purpose and what we do is educate all of our policy holders and clients to say hold on a minute you have an actual value just like your home and you have a choice to recognize what that value is in today's dollar and we're licensed all across the state it's very regulated and provide this service to those millions of policy holders that bought a life insurance policy and didn't know they had a liquidity on it yeah it's been around for a long time your company i believe 19 years old how has it grown and developed over that time and gained success in that time too it's done very very well so you know although many time for many people this is a newer idea or concept to them however we've been in in business for nearly well actually over 20 years now we've purchased over5 billion dollars of life insurance policies over that time period and here's what's really interesting we went public about 18 months ago that introduced us to a whole another set of not just investors but asset managers and lots of different investors who would look at this asset today much differently than they would have then and that's really broadened the audience to hear what's what's really happening in the underlying asset again you said your goal is educating people and you do that a lot through commercials if you watch cnbc or any other large network out there you've probably seen an aboca's life commercial what's the goal of all of those commercials you're running right now jay sure and you've probably seen me on them um and so we run we even ran on monday night football um a few times last week and the goal is very simple we designed and built an easy to use calculator that somebody can quickly assess the value of that life insurance policy without having to speak to anyone they can just simply put in the size of their policy their age and gender and the policy type and and literally in just a few seconds it helps assess for them what the actual value of that policy might be based upon how they assess their own health that alone has driven tens of thousands of policy holders to us just searching for information and that then provides them a baseline to get an idea that says wow maybe i shouldn't laugh policy maybe i should keep it enforced for a little while longer because it might be worth 100,000 or 400,000 or even half a million dollars where they were just going to stop paying on it and think it was worth nothing and now with just 30 seconds they can actually find out so we've had a huge success with those with those commercials and and the response has been tremendous so part of your company is educating consumers out there about the value of their actual life insurance policies but there's another aspect to your company that's very interesting to people and that's how your calcul relating lifespan talk about that so we aggregate data related to lifespan and here's how we do it and and the reason why we do it is for someone to know what the current value of their life insurance policy is they need to know first how much longer you might continue to pay on it and and so what we do is help people solve and understand what's the today value if you're 75 years old and ideally you want to you know you're probably going to live to let's say to age 90 in 15 years if you have a million dollar life insurance policy assuming you keep paying on it then it will be worth to your estate a million dollars but what's it worth today and you have to deduct out those insurance premiums and you have to understand well okay what's my probability of living for the next 15 years what is my lifespan and the first thing we do with clients is that we get their updated medical files we reer write them in today's terms and help them have a better understanding of what their probabilistic lifespan is on a go forward basis that data is really really valuable and in in addition to just their life insurance policy we are also applying that data to their financial and estate plan so many times people are worried about gosh i'm going to run out of money in retirement we can help solve that by having people understand first and foremost how long are you going to be in retirement i think that should be the first question anyone asks themselves before they do a retirement or estate plan is okay well how long do i think i'm going to be here and we can provide that accurate data i think that's an concept a lot of our retail investors are interested in for themselves but i think they also want to hear about a lot of your company financials too before making an investment in a new stock our our viewers really care about the financials of your company so let's talk about kind of this steady revenue growth that you've seen especially since going public it's interesting again we've been doing this for 20 years and these numbers have been relatively consistent um it's just that the investment public is just learning about us as a company that that so when they start to look at this analysis they're like wow where where have you been there's three key things and we trade on the nasdaq and we we ran this statistic and what we looked for were saying how many other companies have mid- teen year-over-year growth rates top and bottom line that have return on equity greater than 18% and have an eida margin or profitability margin a profit margin of greater than 50% and i'll pause just so your your your audience can try to think about how many companies would meet that criteria consider all the companies that trade on the mag nasdaq which include microsoft it's just us we're the only company on all of nasdaq that can state that so here you have a business that's been in existence for 20 years that is highly profitable with great margins and has been doing it consistently for the last two decades that's what's rare about our business and so so many times people today are looking for investments or individual stocks that they invest in and they're concerned about oh hey is this just a gross stock or is this is do they actually make money should be the first and foremost question particularly you ask in today's kind of volatile market absolutely and it sounds like you've got a good answer with your company for that question um let's move on to talking a little bit about growth where is your company going as far as expanding maybe adding additional assets or programs to what amicus life provides what we're really starting to capitalize and monetize on is all of the data that we've aggregated over the last 20 years keep in mind understanding um lifespan and it's a very important and kind of a hot topic right several of the last new york times best sellers are based on longevity lifespan and health span we have the data and we're actually providing that data starting to work with government agencies as well as informing people on how this lifespan can truly help monetize some of your other assets that you may have particularly your financial plan so some of the things we're very excited about we started rolling out our lifespan tracking to pension funds so that they have a better understanding of of how they can best manage their pension and their unfunded liabilities and what their underlying pension needs actually look like we're also taking that data and applying it to target dat funds target date funds have raised nearly a trillion dollars in the united states where effectively you pick a target date meaning 2035 some point in the future but you pick it without knowing what the actual target date is those should be customized to each individual and when you start to think about how we apply our lifespan data it can be fundamentally applied to a lot of different industries but specifically in financial planning all of a sudden now you will have the tools to be able to make really informed decisions as to whether you should be investing more heavily in equity or debt or depending on what your asset allocation may be based upon actually what the time is that you need to use it for let's talk about competition in this field are there other companies out there providing a similar service and how much of this space is amaka's life currently occupying so we maintain a very large market share uh and part of that's due because we've earned that market share through 20 years of of of business support and relationships we partner with over 30,000 financial advisers across the united states we work with tens of thousands of consumers directly not just educating them on what the actual value of their life insurance or market value of the life insurance policy might be but also educating them on how this could potentially apply to their estate plan uh we are the only publicly traded uh company in our entire industry there are other companies in our business that that focus in different areas of of the origination piece but we're the only company that's taken gone the step further and said let's make this available and transparent uh and and validate what everybody can now look at our assets and our balance sheet and potentially invest in it so you know we're in a very fortunate position where we maintain over a quarter of the market share in our business and in addition to that we're the only publicly traded option for any investor to really get involved with and so we're thrilled uh and when you look at the growth prospects of everything we're doing think about the addressable market we have in front of us we have an addressable market that google would blush over think about it it it effectively impacts nearly every american there's 13 trillion dollar of just the life insurance piece but when you start to roll that into other sides of financial planning it shouldn't be any surprise that we're having conversations with the largest in financial institutions in the country looking to apply and use some of these data sets that kind of leads to my next question which is investors are always curious about the risk and the future potential growth for this company are there any economic factors or changes in policy or things that could impact the future growth of your company or like you said is this a product that really truly will continue to impact everyone i think we're at the very early stages here which means that you're you're mitigating a lot of that what we would call compressed yield growth and in our case because you look at the overall size of the market is so large there are so many people that are just learning that this is a financial option to them and then applying this longevity piece to financial planning we have a lot of run room still left to go uh and frankly this is a proc consumer transaction so the regulators it's heavily regulated already the regulators really like this transaction right think about it we paid out just in 2023 $220 million to consumers that $220 million on average went to people over the age of 70 think about how they're applying that maybe they're not having to go on medicare or medicaid even sooner right like we're putting a lot of liquidity into what might be deemed as a as a market that you know wants to maintain their dignity and integrity and now they have the resources to do so so where we sit today we are in a terrific position from both a regulatory as well as a market position to continue to maintain these growth well the last question i like to ask is as the ceo of this company what excites you most about abacus's life the way this company is run the products you offer what about running this company makes you most excited every day when people think of advocus what i really hope their takeaway is is that we are improving the quality of life for seniors for their families for their caregivers just on the insurance side and when you can change someone's quality of life uh and you can truly put wealth in a place that they didn't think that they have it that's what gets me up in the morning it's our purpose is about education and truly having an impact when you look at the underlying tagline of our company it's know the value of your life people don't place a value on their most important asset which is their lifespan and what we think we can do is help people better understand it and if they better understand it they can place a value on it and if they do that now they're going to be able to expand this into several other areas of their life so purpose and quality of life is super important that i think abacus is providing thank you so much for your time today jay and sharing more about your company with our viewers thank you

captions language: en do you know the value of your life insurance policy a new public company is helping millions of people look at life insurance as an asset let's dive in today we are excited to have jay jackson the ceo of advocus life with us at market beat thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today jay absolutely excited to be here well we're excited to hear your company's story in really a unique space share a little bit about what abacus life does sure abacus life is an alternative asset manager a global alternative asset manager that focuses primarily on purchasing assets that are predictable and consistent that might be traditionally uncorrelated through the market using our actuarial data and our lifespan data to help set the value and that makes us a really unique business that investors today are really looking for how can they invest in assets that don't have the types of correlation that you see related to interest rate sensitivity and market volatility and we're the company that originates those assets we're the market maker in those assets and we're also the asset manager in those assets you had a lot of big financial terms there so breaking it down to what what amicus life provides it's really about life insurance talk about who your customers are and kind of your target group sure so what's really interesting is that in our name you see it's abacus life which we thought we were being clever early on in the sense that abacus being the first cou calculator and really the life part was the idea of calculating your life knowing the value of your life and so we purchase life insurance policies we don't issue them and that is a really unique kind of twist because what happens is is that life insurance is used for a purpose a specific amount of time but then very rarely actually passed on to the airs and what i mean by that is life insurance is about a 13 trillion industry of the 13 trillion which by the way is two and a half times the us residential real estate market of that 90% of those policies or n9 out of 10 never pay a claim to the beneficiaries and it's not because the life insurance company has done something wrong it's because we don't treat it like an actual asset the supreme court ruled life insurance as personal property but we don't treat it like personal property we don't treat it like our home instead we just stop making payments on it because we think oh it's it served its purpose and what we do is educate all of our policy holders and clients to say hold on a minute you have an actual value just like your home and you have a choice to recognize what that value is in today's dollar and we're licensed all across the state it's very regulated and provide this service to those millions of policy holders that bought a life insurance policy and didn't know they had a liquidity on it yeah it's been around for a long time your company i believe 19 years old how has it grown and developed over that time and gained success in that time too it's done very very well so you know although many time for many people this is a newer idea or concept to them however we've been in in business for nearly well actually over 20 years now we've purchased over5 billion dollars of life insurance policies over that time period and here's what's really interesting we went public about 18 months ago that introduced us to a whole another set of not just investors but asset managers and lots of different investors who would look at this asset today much differently than they would have then and that's really broadened the audience to hear what's what's really happening in the underlying asset again you said your goal is educating people and you do that a lot through commercials if you watch cnbc or any other large network out there you've probably seen an aboca's life commercial what's the goal of all of those commercials you're running right now jay sure and you've probably seen me on them um and so we run we even ran on monday night football um a few times last week and the goal is very simple we designed and built an easy to use calculator that somebody can quickly assess the value of that life insurance policy without having to speak to anyone they can just simply put in the size of their policy their age and gender and the policy type and and literally in just a few seconds it helps assess for them what the actual value of that policy might be based upon how they assess their own health that alone has driven tens of thousands of policy holders to us just searching for information and that then provides them a baseline to get an idea that says wow maybe i shouldn't laugh policy maybe i should keep it enforced for a little while longer because it might be worth 100,000 or 400,000 or even half a million dollars where they were just going to stop paying on it and think it was worth nothing and now with just 30 seconds they can actually find out so we've had a huge success with those with those commercials and and the response has been tremendous so part of your company is educating consumers out there about the value of their actual life insurance policies but there's another aspect to your company that's very interesting to people and that's how your calcul relating lifespan talk about that so we aggregate data related to lifespan and here's how we do it and and the reason why we do it is for someone to know what the current value of their life insurance policy is they need to know first how much longer you might continue to pay on it and and so what we do is help people solve and understand what's the today value if you're 75 years old and ideally you want to you know you're probably going to live to let's say to age 90 in 15 years if you have a million dollar life insurance policy assuming you keep paying on it then it will be worth to your estate a million dollars but what's it worth today and you have to deduct out those insurance premiums and you have to understand well okay what's my probability of living for the next 15 years what is my lifespan and the first thing we do with clients is that we get their updated medical files we reer write them in today's terms and help them have a better understanding of what their probabilistic lifespan is on a go forward basis that data is really really valuable and in in addition to just their life insurance policy we are also applying that data to their financial and estate plan so many times people are worried about gosh i'm going to run out of money in retirement we can help solve that by having people understand first and foremost how long are you going to be in retirement i think that should be the first question anyone asks themselves before they do a retirement or estate plan is okay well how long do i think i'm going to be here and we can provide that accurate data i think that's an concept a lot of our retail investors are interested in for themselves but i think they also want to hear about a lot of your company financials too before making an investment in a new stock our our viewers really care about the financials of your company so let's talk about kind of this steady revenue growth that you've seen especially since going public it's interesting again we've been doing this for 20 years and these numbers have been relatively consistent um it's just that the investment public is just learning about us as a company that that so when they start to look at this analysis they're like wow where where have you been there's three key things and we trade on the nasdaq and we we ran this statistic and what we looked for were saying how many other companies have mid- teen year-over-year growth rates top and bottom line that have return on equity greater than 18% and have an eida margin or profitability margin a profit margin of greater than 50% and i'll pause just so your your your audience can try to think about how many companies would meet that criteria consider all the companies that trade on the mag nasdaq which include microsoft it's just us we're the only company on all of nasdaq that can state that so here you have a business that's been in existence for 20 years that is highly profitable with great margins and has been doing it consistently for the last two decades that's what's rare about our business and so so many times people today are looking for investments or individual stocks that they invest in and they're concerned about oh hey is this just a gross stock or is this is do they actually make money should be the first and foremost question particularly you ask in today's kind of volatile market absolutely and it sounds like you've got a good answer with your company for that question um let's move on to talking a little bit about growth where is your company going as far as expanding maybe adding additional assets or programs to what amicus life provides what we're really starting to capitalize and monetize on is all of the data that we've aggregated over the last 20 years keep in mind understanding um lifespan and it's a very important and kind of a hot topic right several of the last new york times best sellers are based on longevity lifespan and health span we have the data and we're actually providing that data starting to work with government agencies as well as informing people on how this lifespan can truly help monetize some of your other assets that you may have particularly your financial plan so some of the things we're very excited about we started rolling out our lifespan tracking to pension funds so that they have a better understanding of of how they can best manage their pension and their unfunded liabilities and what their underlying pension needs actually look like we're also taking that data and applying it to target dat funds target date funds have raised nearly a trillion dollars in the united states where effectively you pick a target date meaning 2035 some point in the future but you pick it without knowing what the actual target date is those should be customized to each individual and when you start to think about how we apply our lifespan data it can be fundamentally applied to a lot of different industries but specifically in financial planning all of a sudden now you will have the tools to be able to make really informed decisions as to whether you should be investing more heavily in equity or debt or depending on what your asset allocation may be based upon actually what the time is that you need to use it for let's talk about competition in this field are there other companies out there providing a similar service and how much of this space is amaka's life currently occupying so we maintain a very large market share uh and part of that's due because we've earned that market share through 20 years of of of business support and relationships we partner with over 30,000 financial advisers across the united states we work with tens of thousands of consumers directly not just educating them on what the actual value of their life insurance or market value of the life insurance policy might be but also educating them on how this could potentially apply to their estate plan uh we are the only publicly traded uh company in our entire industry there are other companies in our business that that focus in different areas of of the origination piece but we're the only company that's taken gone the step further and said let's make this available and transparent uh and and validate what everybody can now look at our assets and our balance sheet and potentially invest in it so you know we're in a very fortunate position where we maintain over a quarter of the market share in our business and in addition to that we're the only publicly traded option for any investor to really get involved with and so we're thrilled uh and when you look at the growth prospects of everything we're doing think about the addressable market we have in front of us we have an addressable market that google would blush over think about it it it effectively impacts nearly every american there's 13 trillion dollar of just the life insurance piece but when you start to roll that into other sides of financial planning it shouldn't be any surprise that we're having conversations with the largest in financial institutions in the country looking to apply and use some of these data sets that kind of leads to my next question which is investors are always curious about the risk and the future potential growth for this company are there any economic factors or changes in policy or things that could impact the future growth of your company or like you said is this a product that really truly will continue to impact everyone i think we're at the very early stages here which means that you're you're mitigating a lot of that what we would call compressed yield growth and in our case because you look at the overall size of the market is so large there are so many people that are just learning that this is a financial option to them and then applying this longevity piece to financial planning we have a lot of run room still left to go uh and frankly this is a proc consumer transaction so the regulators it's heavily regulated already the regulators really like this transaction right think about it we paid out just in 2023 $220 million to consumers that $220 million on average went to people over the age of 70 think about how they're applying that maybe they're not having to go on medicare or medicaid even sooner right like we're putting a lot of liquidity into what might be deemed as a as a market that you know wants to maintain their dignity and integrity and now they have the resources to do so so where we sit today we are in a terrific position from both a regulatory as well as a market position to continue to maintain these growth well the last question i like to ask is as the ceo of this company what excites you most about abacus's life the way this company is run the products you offer what about running this company makes you most excited every day when people think of advocus what i really hope their takeaway is is that we are improving the quality of life for seniors for their families for their caregivers just on the insurance side and when you can change someone's quality of life uh and you can truly put wealth in a place that they didn't think that they have it that's what gets me up in the morning it's our purpose is about education and truly having

be worth 100,000 or 400,000 or even half a million dollars where they were just going to stop paying on it and think it was worth nothing and now with just 30 seconds they can actually find out so we've had a huge success with those with those commercials and and the response has been tremendous so part of your company is educating consumers out there about the value of their actual life insurance policies but there's another aspect to your company that's very interesting to people and that's how your calcul relating lifespan talk about that so we aggregate data related to lifespan and here's how we do it and and the reason why we do it is for someone to know what the current value of their life insurance policy is they need to know first how much longer you might continue to pay on it and and so what we do is help people solve and understand what's the today value if you're 75 years old and ideally you want to you know you're probably going to live to let's say to age 90 in 15 years if you have a million dollar life insurance policy assuming you keep paying on it then it will be worth to your estate a million dollars but what's it worth today and you have to deduct out those insurance premiums and you have to understand well okay what's my probability of living for the next 15 years what is my lifespan and the first thing we do with clients is that we get their updated medical files we reer write them in today's terms and help them have a better understanding of what their probabilistic lifespan is on a go forward basis that data is really really valuable and in in addition to just their life insurance policy we are also applying that data to their financial and estate plan so many times people are worried about gosh i'm going to run out of money in retirement we can help solve that by having people understand first and foremost how long are you going to be in retirement i think that should be the first question anyone asks themselves before they do a retirement or estate plan is okay well how long do i think i'm going to be here and we can provide that accurate data i think that's an concept a lot of our retail investors are interested in for themselves but i think they also want to hear about a lot of your company financials too before making an investment in a new stock our our viewers really care about the financials of your company so let's talk about kind of this steady revenue growth that you've seen especially since going public it's interesting again we've been doing this for 20 years and these numbers have been relatively consistent um it's just that the investment public is just learning about us as a company that that so when they start to look at this analysis they're like wow where where have you been there's three key things and we trade on the nasdaq and we we ran this statistic and what we looked for were saying how many other companies have mid- teen year-over-year growth rates top and bottom line that have return on equity greater than 18% and have an eida margin or profitability margin a profit margin of greater than 50% and i'll pause just so your your your audience can try to think about how many companies would meet that criteria consider all the companies that trade on the mag nasdaq which include microsoft it's just us we're the only company on all of nasdaq that can state that so here you have a business that's been in existence for 20 years that is highly profitable with great margins and has been doing it consistently for the last two decades that's what's rare about our business and so so many times people today are looking for investments or individual stocks that they invest in and they're concerned about oh hey is this just a gross stock or is this is do they actually make money should be the first and foremost question particularly you ask in today's kind of volatile market absolutely and it sounds like you've got a good answer with your company for that question um let's move on to talking a little bit about growth where is your company going as far as expanding maybe adding additional assets or programs to what amicus life provides what we're really starting to capitalize and monetize on is all of the data that we've aggregated over the last 20 years keep in mind understanding um lifespan and it's a very important and kind of a hot topic right several of the last new york times best sellers are based on longevity lifespan and health span we have the data and we're actually providing that data starting to work with government agencies as well as informing people on how this lifespan can truly help monetize some of your other assets that you may have particularly your financial plan so some of the things we're very excited about we started rolling out our lifespan tracking to pension funds so that they have a better understanding of of how they can best manage their pension and their unfunded liabilities and what their underlying pension needs actually look like we're also taking that data and applying it to target dat funds target date funds have raised nearly a trillion dollars in the united states where effectively you pick a target date meaning 2035 some point in the future but you pick it without knowing what the actual target date is those should be customized to each individual and when you start to think about how we apply our lifespan data it can be fundamentally applied to a lot of different industries but specifically in financial planning all of a sudden now you will have the tools to be able to make really informed decisions as to whether you should be investing more heavily in equity or debt or depending on what your asset allocation may be based upon actually what the time is that you need to use it for let's talk about competition in this field are there other companies out there providing a similar service and how much of this space is amaka's life currently occupying so we maintain a very large market share uh and part of that's due because we've earned that market share through 20 years of of of business support and relationships we partner with over 30,000 financial advisers across the united states we work with tens of thousands of consumers directly not just educating them on what the actual value of their life insurance or market value of the life insurance policy might be but also educating them on how this could potentially apply to their estate plan uh we are the only publicly traded uh company in our entire industry there are other companies in our business that that focus in different areas of of the origination piece but we're the only company that's taken gone the step further and said let's make this available and transparent uh and and validate what everybody can now look at our assets and our balance sheet and potentially invest in it so you know we're in a very fortunate position where we maintain over a quarter of the market share in our business and in addition to that we're the only publicly traded option for any investor to really get involved with and so we're thrilled uh and when you look at the growth prospects of everything we're doing think about the addressable market we have in front of us we have an addressable market that google would blush over think about it it it effectively impacts nearly every american there's 13 trillion dollar of just the life insurance piece but when you start to roll that into other sides of financial planning it shouldn't be any surprise that we're having conversations with the largest in financial institutions in the country looking to apply and use some of these data sets that kind of leads to my next question which is investors are always curious about the risk and the future potential growth for this company are there any economic factors or changes in policy or things that could impact the future growth of your company or like you said is this a product that really truly will continue to impact everyone i think we're at the very early stages here which means that you're you're mitigating a lot of that what we would call compressed yield growth and in our case because you look at the overall size of the market is so large there are so many people that are just learning that this is a financial option to them and then applying this longevity piece to financial planning we have a lot of run room still left to go uh and frankly this is a proc consumer transaction so the regulators it's heavily regulated already the regulators really like this transaction right think about it we paid out just in 2023 $220 million to consumers that $220 million on average went to people over the age of 70 think about how they're applying that maybe they're not having to go on medicare or medicaid even sooner right like we're putting a lot of liquidity into what might be deemed as a as a market that you know wants to maintain their dignity and integrity and now they have the resources to do so so where we sit today we are in a terrific position from both a regulatory as well as a market position to continue to maintain these growth well the last question i like to ask is as the ceo of this company what excites you most about abacus's life the way this company is run the products you offer what about running this company makes you most excited every day when people think of advocus what i really hope their takeaway is is that we are improving the quality of life for seniors for their families for their caregivers just on the insurance side and when you can change someone's quality of life uh and you can truly put wealth in a place that they didn't think that they have it that's what gets me up in the morning it's our purpose is about education and truly having an impact when you look at the underlying tagline of our company it's know the value of your life people don't place a value on their most important asset which is their lifespan and what we think we can do is help people better understand it and if they better understand it they can place a value on it and if they do that now they're going to be able to expand this into several other areas of their life so purpose and quality of life is super important that i think abacus is providing thank you so much for your time today jay and sharing more about your company with our viewers thank you for watching market beat and learning more about this company and many others you can find lots of videos just like this one right here on our channel leave us a comment let us know what you think about abacus life and whether you might be adding it to your portfolio thanks again for watching and as always happy investing [music]",cnbc,0.9,0.0

captions language: en do you know the value of your life insurance policy a new public company is helping millions of people look at life insurance as an asset let's dive in today we are excited to have jay jackson the ceo of advocus life with us at market beat thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today jay absolutely excited to be here well we're excited to hear your company's story in really a unique space share a little bit about what abacus life does sure abacus life is an alternative asset manager a global alternative asset manager that focuses primarily on purchasing assets that are predictable and consistent that might be traditionally uncorrelated through the market using our actuarial data and our lifespan data to help set the value and that makes us a really unique business that investors today are really looking for how can they invest in assets that don't have the types of correlation that you see related to interest rate sensitivity and market volatility and we're the company that originates those assets we're the market maker in those assets and we're also the asset manager in those assets you had a lot of big financial terms there so breaking it down to what what amicus life provides it's really about life insurance talk about who your customers are and kind of your target group sure so what's really interesting is that in our name you see it's abacus life which we thought we were being clever early on in the sense that abacus being the first cou calculator and really the life part was the idea of calculating your life knowing the value of your life and so we purchase life insurance policies we don't issue them and that is a really unique kind of twist because what happens is is that life insurance is used for a purpose a specific amount of time but then very rarely actually passed on to the airs and what i mean by that is life insurance is about a 13 trillion industry of the 13 trillion which by the way is two and a half times the us residential real estate market of that 90% of those policies or n9 out of 10 never pay a claim to the beneficiaries and it's not because the life insurance company has done something wrong it's because we don't treat it like an actual asset the supreme court ruled life insurance as personal property but we don't treat it like personal property we don't treat it like our home instead we just stop making payments on it because we think oh it's it served its purpose and what we do is educate all of our policy holders and clients to say hold on a minute you have an actual value just like your home and you have a choice to recognize what that value is in today's dollar and we're licensed all across the state it's very regulated and provide this service to those millions of policy holders that bought a life insurance policy and didn't know they had a liquidity on it yeah it's been around for a long time your company i believe 19 years old how has it grown and developed over that time and gained success in that time too it's done very very well so you know although many time for many people this is a newer idea or concept to them however we've been in in business for nearly well actually over 20 years now we've purchased over5 billion dollars of life insurance policies over that time period and here's what's really interesting we went public about 18 months ago that introduced us to a whole another set of not just investors but asset managers and lots of different investors who would look at this asset today much differently than they would have then and that's really broadened the audience to hear what's what's really happening in the underlying asset again you said your goal is educating people and you do that a lot through commercials if you watch cnbc or any other large network out there you've probably seen an aboca's life commercial what's the goal of all of those commercials you're running right now jay sure and you've probably seen me on them um and so we run we even ran on monday night football um a few times last week and the goal is very simple we designed and built an easy to use calculator that somebody can quickly assess the value of that life insurance policy without having to speak to anyone they can just simply put in the size of their policy their age and gender and the policy type and and literally in just a few seconds it helps assess for them what the actual value of that policy might be based upon how they assess their own health that alone has driven tens of thousands of policy holders to us just searching for information and that then provides them a baseline to get an idea that says wow maybe i shouldn't laugh policy maybe i should keep it enforced for a little while longer because it might be worth 100,000 or 400,000 or even half a million dollars where they were just going to stop paying on it and think it was worth nothing and now with just 30 seconds they can actually find out so we've had a huge success with those with those commercials and and the response has been tremendous so part of your company is educating consumers out there about the value of their actual life insurance policies but there's another aspect to your company that's very interesting to people and that's how your calcul relating lifespan talk about that so we aggregate data related to lifespan

surprise it's been a very high volume week for nvidia as earnings came out on wednesday to talk about where the stock is now and where it's headed is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas there's been a lot of movement on nvidia ever since that report came out yeah it's been a pretty volatile reaction i would say the market's having a hard time deciding if it's a good or a bad report i think it was a very very good report given the growth and the cash flow and the outlook for sales so right now we're down a little bit from uh the highs on wednesday when they reported earnings still above critical support levels that's the previous all-time highs the volume is rising on a day-to-day basis and for the last few weeks um we are still also below a critical resistance point so we might see a little bit more sidewinding over the next few weeks but um the outlook is positive the analyst trend is positive so i would expect to see all-time highs again pretty soon yeah i know you said before that this is the best report you've seen in two years from nvidia and that if there is a dip which is kind what we're seeing right now at least sideways movement um it would be pretty short-lived why do you think this is going to be such a short-lived pullback the last few years have shown that nvidia's um position and technology has changed it's not just a stock for video games anymore it is now central to the technology infrastructure because technology is now based on ai and when it comes to ai nvidia is the first mover it's the the industry leader uh not only with its chips but with its cuda infrastructure structure because without cuda you can't really use those chips to do anything and now with blackwell coming out those gpus are really being made to be ai specific so it's really going to improve the technology i expect to see more improvements over the next few years there's going to be really big major advances coming fairly regularly i would believe and nvidia is central to all of that absolutely the big part of this report is talking about how much demand there is for blackwell and that blackwell will be actually hitting the market in 2025 so let's talk about what that means for this stock moving forward and why blackwell is in such high demand so blackwell is in demand because it's better it's better than the previous iterations and it's better than a lot of the competition so it provides improved performance for ai specifically with training and inference now inference is critical because that's the leap from just reading data to making decisions that's where the ai really comes into play and you mentioned some features about black well that are so much better again this next generation is something people are excited for what are some features that have companies already investing in upgrading their ai tech well a lot of it centered on the high bandwidth memory it's a new architecture for memory where um micron technology is a leader but what it does is allow for faster computing um higher performance computing while also helping to control temperatures temperatures are really important because of the power usage and the cost for the data centers to operate them and it seems like every big ai giant out there is investing in those data centers right now let's talk about customers who are some of the biggest customers for these blackwell chips all right so there's a number of customers that kind of fit into two or three different categories the number one are the cloud hyperscalers you've got microsoft aws and google including oracle to a lesser degree who command 95% of the cloud market all of these companies already have blackwell in use and the word on the street is that they're using them to build their most advanced super clusters met is using them to build a super advanced cluster and oracle is using it to build the oci super cluster which is going to be the first zeta scale super cluster it's going to use 130,000 gpus in one cluster that's a large amount of gpus and quite a bit of revenue for nvidia especially considering over the next few years the upgrade cycle that's going to come about with the next iterations of these chips so that's a lot of positive outlook for nvidia but let's talk about any potential risks for this stock so there is some concern that the revenue will contract or compress in in the future we're not sure when that's going to happen but eventually there'll be some market normalization right now there's a rush to kind of get ahead of the curve once the industry normalizes revenue might pull back a little bit but even so we're going to be looking at a company that's 8 n 10 times bigger than it was before the ai revolution kicked off so the big question right now though is the cash this company is generating so much cash it's ridiculous its cash balance doubled over the last year it's net cash versus total liability it's in such a strong position to provide capital returns the only question is when so right now what i'm thinking is that this company is probably going to ride its momentum on its revenue momentum until the stock price really begins to top out and then i would expect to see some pretty aggressive capital returns including special dividend dividend increases and aggressive share repurchases what are analysts saying about the returns the stock could have just in the next year right so the analyst response to the news was pretty good i mean there's a lot of market pundits kind of poo pooing it and calling it a bad report and kind of uh clouding the the future but the analysts are across the board raising their price targets they're leading to the high-end range of their target range which puts the stock at 200 or higher which is a $50 or about a 35% increase over the next 12 months based on the business trends i would expect the analyst trends to continue so that high-end will continue to rise over the next 12 months and a move to 200 may just be the tip of the next iceberg so there's still plenty of room for this stock to grow but a lot of people are questioning when will nvidia's competitors start to catch up right so the competitors are working really hard right now and the closest competitor is amd they're still the ways behind because nvidia has so many years of of advanced work on their their infrastructure but amd is really catching up now the opportunity right now is that demand for nvidia chips outpaces their ability to produce them so if amd is able to get their production going there's an opportunity for them to start selling chips to people that just can't wait long enough to get the nvidia chips all right thomas thank you so much for this in-depth analysis of nvidia earnings and where this stock could go in 2025 thank you for joining us check out our other videos on nvidia and other stocks right here on market beach as always happy investing [music]",nvidia,1.0,0.9

chips all right so there's a number of customers that kind of fit into two or three different categories the number one are the cloud hyperscalers you've got microsoft aws and google including oracle to a lesser degree who command 95% of the cloud market all of these companies already have blackwell in use and the word on the street is that they're using them to build their most advanced super clusters met is using them to build a super advanced cluster and oracle is using it to build the oci super cluster which is going to be the first zeta scale super cluster it's going to use 130,000 gpus in one cluster that's a large amount of gpus and quite a bit of revenue for nvidia especially considering over the next few years the upgrade cycle that's going to come about with the next iterations of these chips so that's a lot of positive outlook for nvidia but let's talk about any potential risks for this stock so there is some concern that the revenue will contract or compress in in the future we're not sure when that's going to happen but eventually there'll be some market normalization right now there's a rush to kind of get ahead of the curve once the industry normalizes revenue might pull back a little bit but even so we're going to be looking at a company that's 8 n 10 times bigger than it was before the ai revolution kicked off so the big question right now though is the cash this company is generating so much cash it's ridiculous its cash balance doubled over the last year it's net cash versus total liability it's in such a strong position to provide capital returns the only question is when so right now what i'm thinking is that this company is probably going to ride its momentum on its revenue momentum until the stock price really begins to top out and then i would expect to see some pretty aggressive capital returns including special dividend dividend increases and aggressive share repurchases what are analysts saying about the returns the stock could have just in the next year right so the analyst response to the news was pretty good i mean there's a lot of market pundits kind of poo pooing it and calling it a bad report and kind of uh clouding the the future but the analysts are across the board raising their price targets they're leading to the high-end range of their target range which puts the stock at 200 or higher which is a $50 or about a 35% increase over the next 12 months based on the business trends i would expect the analyst trends to continue so that high-end will continue to rise over the next 12 months and a move to 200 may just be the tip of the next iceberg so there's still plenty of room for this stock to grow but a lot of people are questioning when will nvidia's competitors start to catch up right so the competitors are working really hard right now and the closest competitor is amd they're still the ways behind because nvidia has so many years of of advanced work on their their infrastructure but amd is really catching up now the opportunity right now is that demand for nvidia chips outpaces their ability to produce them so if amd is able to get their production going there's an opportunity for them to start selling chips to people that just can't wait long enough to get the nvidia chips all right thomas thank you so much for this in-depth analysis of nvidia earnings and where this stock

surprise it's been a very high volume week for nvidia as earnings came out on wednesday to talk about where the stock is now and where it's headed is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas there's been a lot of movement on nvidia ever since that report came out yeah it's been a pretty volatile reaction i would say the market's having a hard time deciding if it's a good or a bad report i think it was a very very good report given the growth and the cash flow and the outlook for sales so right now we're down a little bit from uh the highs on wednesday when they reported earnings still above critical support levels that's the previous all-time highs the volume is rising on a day-to-day basis and for the last few weeks um we are still also below a critical resistance point so we might see a little bit more sidewinding over the next few weeks but um the outlook is positive the analyst trend is positive so i would expect to see all-time highs again pretty soon yeah i know you said before that this is the best report you've seen in two years from nvidia and that if there is a dip which is kind what we're seeing right now at least sideways movement um it would be pretty short-lived why do you think this is going to be such a short-lived pullback the last few years have shown that nvidia's um position and technology has changed it's not just a stock for video games anymore it is now central to the technology infrastructure because technology is now based on ai and when it comes to ai nvidia is the first mover it's the the industry leader uh not only with its chips but with its cuda infrastructure structure because without cuda you can't really use those chips to do anything and now with blackwell coming out those gpus are really being made to be ai specific so it's really going to improve the technology i expect to see more improvements over the next few years there's going to be really big major advances coming fairly regularly i would believe and nvidia is central to all of that absolutely the big part of this report is talking about how much demand there is for blackwell and that blackwell will be actually hitting the market in 2025 so let's talk about what that means for this stock moving forward and why blackwell is in such high demand so blackwell is in demand because it's better it's better than the previous iterations and it's better than a lot of the competition so it provides improved performance for ai specifically with training and inference now inference is critical because that's the leap from just reading data to making decisions that's where the ai really comes into play and you mentioned some features about black well that are so much better again this next generation is something people are excited for what are some features that have companies already investing in upgrading their ai tech well a lot of it centered on the high bandwidth memory it's a new architecture for memory where um micron technology is a leader but what it

clusters met is using them to build a super advanced cluster and oracle is using it to build the oci super cluster which is going to be the first zeta scale super cluster it's going to use 130,000 gpus in one cluster that's a large amount of gpus and quite a bit of revenue for nvidia especially considering over the next few years the upgrade cycle that's going to come about with the next iterations of these chips so that's a lot of positive outlook for nvidia but let's talk about any potential risks for this stock so there is some concern that the revenue will contract or compress in in the future we're not sure when that's going to happen but eventually there'll be some market normalization right now there's a rush to kind of get ahead of the curve once the industry normalizes revenue might pull back a little bit but even so we're going to be looking at a company that's 8 n 10 times bigger than it was before the ai revolution kicked off so the big question right now though is the cash this company is generating so much cash it's ridiculous its cash balance doubled over the last year it's net cash versus total liability it's in such a strong position to provide capital returns the only question is when so right now what i'm thinking is that this company is probably going to ride its momentum on its revenue momentum until the stock price really begins to top out and then i would expect to see some pretty aggressive capital returns including special dividend dividend increases and aggressive share repurchases what are analysts saying about the returns the stock could have just in the next year right so the analyst response to the news was pretty good i mean there's a lot of market pundits kind of poo pooing it and calling it a bad report and kind of uh clouding the the future but the analysts are across the board raising their price targets they're leading to the high-end range of their target range which puts the stock at 200 or higher which is a $50 or about a 35% increase over the next 12 months based on the business trends i would expect the analyst trends to continue so that high-end will continue to rise over the next 12 months and a move to 200 may just be the tip of the next iceberg so there's still plenty of room for this stock to grow but a lot of people are questioning when will nvidia's competitors start to catch up right so the competitors are working really hard right now and the closest competitor is amd they're still the ways behind because nvidia has so many years of of advanced work on their their infrastructure but amd is really catching up now the opportunity right now is that demand for nvidia chips outpaces their ability to produce them so if amd is able to get their production going there's an opportunity for them to start selling chips to people that just can't wait long enough to get the nvidia chips all right thomas thank you so much for this in-depth analysis of nvidia earnings and where this stock could go in 2025 thank you for joining us check out our other videos on nvidia and other stocks right here on market beach as always happy investing [music]",meta,0.9,0.7

surprise it's been a very high volume week for nvidia as earnings came out on wednesday to talk about where the stock is now and where it's headed is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas there's been a lot of movement on nvidia ever since that report came out yeah it's been a pretty volatile reaction i would say the market's having a hard time deciding if it's a good or a bad report i think it was a very very good report given the growth and the cash flow and the outlook for sales so right now we're down a little bit from uh the highs on wednesday when they reported earnings still above critical support levels that's the previous all-time highs the volume is rising on a day-to-day basis and for the last few weeks um we are still also below a critical resistance point so we might see a little bit more sidewinding over the next few weeks but um the outlook is positive the analyst trend is positive so i would expect to see all-time highs again pretty soon yeah i know you said before that this is the best report you've seen in two years from nvidia and that if there is a dip which is kind what we're seeing right now at least sideways movement um it would be pretty short-lived why do you think this is going to be such a short-lived pullback the last few years have shown that nvidia's um position and technology has changed it's not just a stock for video games anymore it is now central to the technology infrastructure because technology is now based on ai and when it comes to ai nvidia is the first mover it's the the industry leader uh not only with its chips but with its cuda infrastructure structure because without cuda you can't really use those chips to do anything and now with blackwell coming out those gpus are really being made to be ai specific so it's really going to improve the technology i expect to see more improvements over the next few years there's going to be really big major advances coming fairly regularly i would believe and nvidia is central to all of that absolutely the big part of this report is talking about how much demand there is for blackwell and that blackwell will be actually hitting the market in 2025 so let's talk about what that means for this stock moving forward and why blackwell is in such high demand so blackwell is in demand because it's better it's better than the previous iterations and it's better than a lot of the competition so it provides improved performance for ai specifically with training and inference now inference is critical because that's the leap from just reading data to making decisions that's where the ai really comes into play and you mentioned some features about black well that are so much better again this next generation is something people are excited for what are some features that have companies already investing in upgrading their ai tech well a lot of it centered on the high bandwidth memory it's a new architecture for memory where um micron technology is a leader but what it does is allow for faster computing um higher performance computing while also helping to control temperatures temperatures are really important because of the power usage and the cost for the data centers to operate them and it seems like every big ai giant out there is investing in those data centers right now let's talk about customers who are some of the biggest customers for these blackwell chips all right so there's a number of customers that kind of fit into two or three different categories the number one are the cloud hyperscalers you've got microsoft aws and google including oracle to a lesser degree who command 95% of the cloud market all of these companies already have blackwell in use and the word on the street is that they're using them to build their most advanced super

in the future we're not sure when that's going to happen but eventually there'll be some market normalization right now there's a rush to kind of get ahead of the curve once the industry normalizes revenue might pull back a little bit but even so we're going to be looking at a company that's 8 n 10 times bigger than it was before the ai revolution kicked off so the big question right now though is the cash this company is generating so much cash it's ridiculous its cash balance doubled over the last year it's net cash versus total liability it's in such a strong position to provide capital

hard to believe the end of the year is nearly here but there's some winners from 2024 that could still have a big runup coming in 2025 here to break down some great stock picks for us is market beat analyst thomas hughes so thomas before we get into the two stocks that you have for us today that are still going to be great in 2025 let's just start out this video talking about how the stock market in general is doing as we come to almost a close of 2024 the market is really doing pretty well much better than i expected for for sure um it turns out that all of the concerns we had at the beginning of the year were just bricks in a wall of worry the wall of worry is a very common phrase in the stock market these little worries cloud the outlook and they cause near-term pullbacks in the price action but so long as the fundamental outlook is positive these pullbacks are just buying opportunities and that's what i see happening in these two stocks today yeah let's get into the two stocks that you've picked that have had a really good 2024 and could have an even better 2025 what's your first company that's amazon amazon is performing well it's in my opinion it's um it's a perfect play on the consumer and ai its two business segments are you know it's amazon platform and selling to the consumer but then there's aws which is the number one the largest hyperscaler in the world they have the most data centers they're the most influential in the data center industry as far as ai goes and all that ai power is just really going to be funnel into their their consumer business so the two things go hand inand all that data analytics and all the services that could be rendered um right now it's growing at double digits it's outperforming on top and bottom line the outlook for next year is for this to be sustained uh cash flow is good they're buying back shares the share buybacks are pretty central to the entire s&amp;p 500 story helping to lift the entire market buybacks are supposed to accelerate over the next year so i see these trends just supporting a general uptrend in this stock not to mention a great holiday season for amazon that's always good for the companies bottom line um let's talk about where their stock price is right now and what it's done in 2024 well right now it's sitting at an all-time high it's pulled back over the last couple of weeks but it's still above the critical support target which was the previous all-time high so long as that support target holds i would expect to see this um stock regain its footing very quickly and resume its uptrend before the end of the year as far as getting into amazon many people already own this stock if you want to add more or trade more of this any advice about getting in when a stock is so close to an all-time high right now well that is a concern there's always a risk of the stock market correcting but the thing about a stock that's trending higher you can buy it high and continue selling it higher and higher as it goes right now the fundamental story is pointing to higher prices for this stock there's really no expectation for it to peak out or reverse now um that may change over the coming quarters but for now the uptrend is is intact and what an analyst say as far as price targets for this next year it looks like they're pointing to about a 15% upside at the consensus right now but the consensus is rising so the high-end range is more likely um again with the trends intact i would expect to see these price targets continue to rise as the company continues to grow analysts are raising their target on this stock what are some reasons that analysts are expecting amazon to continue to grow it's already a giant what could take this company higher well first there's just global digitization the world's population is not yet been fully penetrated by digitization so that's just an expanding addressable market within that amazon is continuing to expand its own territories and also deepen penetration so there are several factors driving the growth in this core segment but then again there's also aws which is the um amazon web services it's the data center segment and that segment is growing um it's not expected to slow down anytime soon uh data center growth is accelerating in 2024 because of ai and should remain strong over the next couple years awesome well thanks for the breakdown on amazon and why it's making your list of stocks that are going to take off in 2025 again your second stock pick it's a good pick that was a winner this year and it's going to be a winner next year is a name many of us already know right meta platforms it's been a winner for the last couple years um i expect to see this stock also continue winning for the next couple of years the big concern over in the last earnings report which is kind of causing the price pullback now forecast for increased r&amp;d spending on ai meta like amazon has already proven as with microsoft google oracle whoever spends money on ai makes money on ai so they're spending money right now margins are going to be a little bit tighter than what analyst had expected for next year still solid but this investment should pay off in in accelerated growth over the coming years let's talk about where meta stock price is right now pulling back from an all-time high it's still above a critical support target we're just waiting for the market to show a clear bottom but when it does i expect it to be fairly soon i would also expect to see this market continue trending higher and setting a new all-time high this year before the end of the year what are analysts saying about meta's future analysts like meta in 2024 they've been raising their price targets and lifting sentiment they're uh leading this stock to new all-time highs uh because the company has persistently outperformed its own forecast and the consensus forecast i expect that to continue again in 2025 and that will add fuel for analy to continue lifting their own their own targets so what we're in is an analyst upgrade cycle that should continue for the next few quarters at least and drive this stock to new highs well there's a lot of bright side on the future for meta platforms especially as they integrate ai like you said let's talk about some economic political factors out there around the globe some countries are starting to come up with some restrictions on social media especially for younger audiences do you think any of this conversation around the the pros and cons of social media could impact meta's future of course but there's nothing new with this and those have been concerns from the very beginning um they've always been part of meta's outlook um as i mentioned before they're bricks on the wall of worry um they may cause meta to have some some price corrections but those corrections will be buying opportunities so as you've said before meta a very fundamentally strong company just like amazon so much of the conversation around ai investing right now is looking for those companies that are having incredibly accelerated growth going from a small company to very very large almost overnight what is kind of the the argument for investing in more sound long-established stocks like the two that you've just mentioned here you have better total returns over the long term investing is about buying and holding it's been proven time and time again that trying to chase stocks is a good way to lose your money that buying and holding is the way to go companies that are fundamentally sound are able to sustain long-term growth and long-term share price increases these companies that are small and seeing this really rapid growth are flashing the pan names their stock prices are being rocketed higher by sentiment not fundamentals um and they'll come crashing back to earth well some good advice for our investors to consider thanks for breaking down these

hard to believe the end of the year is nearly here but there's some winners from 2024 that could still have a big runup coming in 2025 here to break down some great stock picks for us is market beat analyst thomas hughes so thomas before we get into the two stocks that you have for us today that are still going to be great in 2025 let's just start out this video talking about how the stock market in general is doing as we come to almost a close of 2024 the market is really doing pretty well much better than i expected for for sure um it turns out that all of the concerns we had at the beginning of the year were just bricks in a wall of worry the wall of worry is a very common phrase in the stock market these little worries cloud the outlook and they cause near-term pullbacks in the price action but so long as the fundamental outlook is positive these pullbacks are just buying opportunities and that's what i see happening in these two stocks today yeah let's get into the two stocks that you've picked that have had a really good 2024 and could have an even better 2025 what's your first company that's amazon amazon is performing well it's in my opinion it's um it's a perfect play on the consumer and ai its two business segments are you know it's amazon platform and selling to the consumer but then there's aws which is the number one the largest hyperscaler in the world they have the most data centers they're the most influential in the data center industry as far as ai goes and all that ai power is just really going to be funnel into their their consumer business so the two things go hand inand all that data analytics and all the services that could be rendered um right now it's growing at double digits it's outperforming on top and bottom line the outlook for next year is for this to be sustained uh cash flow is good they're buying back shares the share buybacks are pretty central to the entire s&amp;p 500 story helping to lift the entire market buybacks are supposed to accelerate over the next year so i see these trends just supporting a general uptrend in this stock not to mention a great holiday season for amazon that's always good for the companies bottom line um let's talk about where their stock price is right now and what it's done in 2024 well right now it's sitting at an all-time high it's pulled back over the last couple of weeks but it's still above the critical support target which was the previous all-time high so long as that support target holds i would expect to see this um stock regain its footing very quickly and resume its uptrend before the end of the year as far as getting into amazon many people already own this stock if you want to add more or trade more of this any advice about getting in when a stock is so close to an all-time high right now well that is a concern there's always a risk of the stock market correcting but the thing about a stock that's trending higher you can buy it high and continue selling it higher and higher as it goes right now the fundamental story is pointing to higher prices for this stock there's really no expectation for it to peak out or reverse now um that may change over the coming quarters but for now the uptrend is is intact and what an analyst say as far as price targets for this next year it looks like they're pointing to about a 15% upside at the consensus right now but the consensus is rising so the high-end range is more likely um again with the trends intact i would expect to see these price targets continue to rise as the company continues to grow analysts are raising their target on this stock what are some reasons that analysts are expecting amazon to continue to grow it's already a giant what could take this company higher well first there's just global digitization the world's population is not yet been fully penetrated by digitization so that's just an expanding addressable market within that amazon is continuing to expand its own territories and also deepen penetration so there are several factors driving the growth in this core segment but then again there's also aws which is the um amazon web services it's the data center segment and that segment is growing um it's not expected to slow down anytime soon uh data center growth is accelerating in 2024 because of ai and should remain strong over the next couple years awesome well thanks for the breakdown on amazon and why it's making your list of stocks that are going to take off in 2025 again your second stock pick it's a good pick that was a winner this year and it's going to be a winner next year is a name many of us already know right meta platforms it's been a winner for the last couple years um i expect to see this stock also continue winning for the next couple of years the big concern over in the last earnings report which is kind of causing the price pullback now forecast for increased r&amp;d spending on ai meta like amazon has already proven as with microsoft google oracle whoever spends money on ai makes money on ai so they're spending money right now margins are going to be a little bit tighter than what analyst had expected for next year still solid but this investment should pay off in in accelerated growth over the coming years let's talk about where meta stock price is right now pulling back from an all-time high it's still above a critical support target we're just waiting for the market to show a clear bottom but when it does i expect it to be fairly soon i would also expect to see this market continue trending higher and setting a new all-time high this year before the end of the year what are analysts saying about meta's future analysts like meta in 2024 they've been raising their price targets and lifting sentiment they're uh leading this stock to new all-time highs uh because the company has persistently outperformed its own forecast and the consensus forecast i expect that to continue again in 2025 and that will add fuel for analy to continue lifting their own their own targets so what we're in is an analyst upgrade cycle that should continue for the next few quarters at least and drive this stock to new highs well there's a lot of bright side on the future for meta platforms especially as they integrate ai like you said let's talk about some economic political factors out there around the globe some countries are starting to come up with some restrictions on social media especially for younger audiences do you think any of this conversation around the the pros and cons of social media could impact meta's future of course but there's nothing new with this and those have been concerns from the very beginning um they've always been part of meta's outlook um as i mentioned before they're bricks on the wall of worry um they may cause meta to have some some price corrections but those corrections will be buying opportunities so as you've said before meta a very fundamentally strong company just like amazon so much of the conversation around ai investing right now is looking for those companies that are having incredibly accelerated growth going from a small company to very very large almost overnight what is kind of the the argument for investing in more sound long-established stocks like the two that you've just mentioned here you have better total returns over the long term investing is about buying and holding it's been proven time and time again that trying to chase stocks is a good way to lose your money that buying and holding is the way to go companies that are fundamentally sound are able to sustain long-term growth and long-term share price increases these companies that are small and seeing this really rapid growth are flashing the pan names their stock prices are being rocketed higher by sentiment not fundamentals um and they'll come crashing back to earth well some good advice for our investors to consider thanks for breaking down these two big picks for next year thomas and thank you for watching and joining market beat we have lots of content just like this one check out the other videos on our channel comment and share your take

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,lI8m27BhQRs,MarketBeat,2024-11-21 00:54:12+00:00,'Best Report in 2 Years': NVIDIA Earnings Crushes Expectations Again,kind: captions language: en it's the earnings report everyone's been waiting on and yet another record for nvidia let's dive in with market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas this report impressive yet again this might be the most impressive report nvidia has given in the last two years and it's given a string of very highly impressive reports uh we need to understand just how high the bar was set analysts have been raising their forecast and their estimates up until just minutes before the rel it's been a steady stream of revisions so the consensus was a little bit more than 82% revenue growth they produced almost 95% revenue growth they widen their margins um earnings are up 111% and on top of that the guidance is also hot so this really is just an all the way around excellent report much better than expected better than expected is a thing any investor likes to hear but last earnings report nvidia was also better than expected and it still wasn't quite enough do you think it's enough to satisfy investors well you can never tell what the market the market's a pickle beast um if the market does pull back right now it would be absolutely a buying opportunity uh this company is still firing on all cylinders i mean it's so strong as having to borrow cylinders from other people to fire on them it's doing so well so yeah i would expect this stock to continue trending higher i will be looking out for quite a few um analyst revisions tomorrow i would expect to see them coming out pretty strongly over the next couple days and just see what they say i think that they're going to leave this stock much much higher let's dive into the details of this report a little bit more what are some of the really exciting things that we saw for the future of nvidia come out in this report well so all the strength is still in the data center so it's all about ai the company says that demand is incredible for hopper which is the current um iteration of its products but also for blackwell which is the next generation they say blackwell is a full production right now so we should expect to see that hitting the uh end users really soon and start seeing some some benefit from that in their results but as far as data center goes it grew by 112% 177% sequentially we're looking for another big impressive uh growth in the current quarter the guidance for the current quarter is pretty awesome as well just one more factor that will help lead this stock to new highs this stock does just keep getting higher reaching all alltime highs just within the last couple of weeks i feel like we see this every time before an nvidia earings report where the market gets really excited for the news that's going to come out and then we do sometimes see that pullback i know you talked about it a little bit already but what are your thoughts on whether we see a pullback in a stock and if we do see a pullback how shortlived will that be well the last pullback didn't last very long i think that this one if it were to happen would not last very long either um just as you were saying the market did run up quite a bit ahead of their results people were fully expecting the strength we broke to new highs just a week or so ago so a little pullback would be a natural a natural market movement and i think that it would absolutely lead to the next buying opportunity where are analysts expecting the stock to go it's been on quite a rip already well there is a little bit of a range to the consensus estim or to the estimates but the consensus is rising it's looking for about a 15% increase but the high-end range where most of the targets are uh caps out at $200 which is about 33% upside for the stock i would expect to see that number increase over the coming weeks because of these results yeah and there's no really stopping the growth of this company in fact some are saying the growth for nvidia is really just beginning that once blackwell comes out we're going to see even more growth down the road is that what you're seeing in this report uh yeah i think i would concur with that assessment um as the ceo has said before there is a multi-trillion dollar um upgrade cycle going on right now in data centers so all the data centers that are existing are trying to upgrade and then that all the new data centers are relying on all this nextg technology the way that ai is advancing technology will advance again in the next year or two so all of these data centers will need to upgrade again so we're in a persistent upgrade cycle i would say because i would expect to see ai technology advance rapidly and significantly enlarged steps over the next few years so just wrapping up your thoughts on this report did nvidia satisfy with its q3 report i would say that it did awesome well thank you so much for the analysis thomas and thank you for joining us i know we have a lot of nvidia fans on this channel you can watch our other content about nvidia and many more stocks right here on marketbeat we will continue to follow where this massive stock goes from here thanks for watching and as always happy investing [music],nvidia,1.0,1.0

language: en it's been a wild week for paler with the stock shooting up and then back down again here to break down what's behind all the movement is market beat analyst chris marot chris this feels like a week for the record books for paler i know you've been a fan of the stock for a while what's going on right now well the stock really just shot higher on on news that um the company's not going to be trading on the new york stock exchange as of friday it'll be trading on the nasdaq but what really got the stock moving was the company believes it's going to be able to fulfill the listing requirements to be a part of the nasdaq 100 index and if that happens um it means that funds such as the investco qqq which are benchmark to the nasdaq 100 index are going to start to have to add paler stock that's why that was the reason for the movement up in the stock yeah let's talk about just how far the stock moved up let's pull up the chart here 5 day is really crazy to see how much the stock went up and then come monday it went down almost just as much as it went up the week before absolutely so it bounced up um and then it came all the way back down here to about where it started the week and then this this was the price action late week and it got all the way up to over $65 a share when it closed on uh friday night so that was a 10% gain from you know from the start of the week to here was about a 10% gain lost that this isn't was in pre-market on on monday morning it lost that and you'll notice though that where it bottomed here is about the same as where it started so that's kind of telling me that paler is forming a fairly good base of support right there around that $ 5859 level so you're looking at support around $5 5859 but i feel like just a couple of months ago you and i were on here doing a video about will paler reach $50 so this stock has seen quite a bit of movement that now $58 is that support level and not a will it reach that level right and so if we can just take a look here bridget we can see that three months ago and we were doing the we were doing the video for could paler hit 50 when the stock was trading down around here and that's you know right around the $35 level and since then look at all the gains that it's made so clearly palente answered that question and then even if you look here i mean it's bounced off that level of what looked like support at around you know $40 and it's just been shooting higher so yeah this has been a this has been a big winner for the year and it just keeps on setting new levels of support as it goes higher i think that's so right it's been a big winner for the year and is that why there's so many traders getting in on this stock right now kind of moving those 10% swings into each direction paler is a fairly heavily shorted stock but that hasn't necessarily worked out really well if you're a short seller because there's a lot of retail investors that are still committed to holding the stock for the long term they're not selling their shares and so when you see a price movement like that it there's really not a lot of opportunity now some of the price action that you saw on monday morning that may have been just people taking profits on the stock and if that's the case that's fine the stock is overvalued by any fundamental measure right let's get into that value what are analysts predicting and how often are those price targets changing because the stock is growing and moving so quickly price targets haven't changed a whole bunch since their last earnings report um goldman sachs came out and they raised it to like $41 they were at like $31 so analysts are still believing that paler is overvalued and i'm not going to sit here and argue with anybody by any objective measure paler stock is is overvalued the question is if you're a long investor you're long and so you would probably love to see paler pull back even more than it's pulled back right now and you could continue to accumulate shares at a much lower price but but that as we're showing in the chart that doesn't look like it's really likely to happen so really the question you just have to ask yourself is are you going to get in are you not going to get in options trading actually i put in my article options trading might have been a really good strategy but now the stock's already dipped on monday morning i don't know if you know there's there's probably an option trade in there somewhere but i'd have to go back and look at the charts to see you know where i would want to be putting my putting my price targets for that ab absolutely now this is such an interesting stock we've done a lot of different stories about what paler is what this company provides it's one big player in ai and we'll get to that in a minute but first i want to talk about a premium report you can only find here on market beep that outlines the 10 best ai stocks to own in 2024 click the link and see if paler makes that list there are so many ai stocks like this one that are really gaining tremendous success so where exactly does paler fit in on the the ai story here's the thing about ai is i was just hearing last week something that's really interesting is that there's as the earning season has gone through there's some analysts that are becoming a little bit how should we say a little bit skeptical about ai and that's because companies are reporting that they're making this investment in ai but they're not necessarily seeing the return on that investment in what ai is delivering for them that's the key thing with paler and their ontology what paler is being able to provide their customers with is usable data that the companies have never been able to figure out how to make any use of it before and palente delivering meaningful insights to those customers and that's the difference is peners being able to show the customers a return on their investment with meaningful insights using ai and that's where paler has a significant lead and it's which is why it paler not just a one of many but right now it's the one of one yeah you can find a lot of chris's other videos where he's talked about paler and why this company is so unique part of the reason we're seeing so much movement in their stock right now oh chris thank you so much for breaking down what's been going on with paler this week we will stay tuned to all the moves in this stock and many others in the ai space thanks for joining us here on market beat and as always happy investing

language: en it's been a wild week for paler with the stock shooting up and then back down again here to break down what's behind all the movement is market beat analyst chris marot chris this feels like a week for the record books for paler i know you've been a fan of the stock for a while what's going on right now well the stock really just shot higher on on news that um the company's not going to be trading on the new york stock exchange as of friday it'll be trading on the nasdaq but what really got the stock moving was the company believes it's going to be able to fulfill the listing requirements to be a part of the nasdaq 100 index and if that happens um it means that funds such as the investco qqq which are benchmark to the nasdaq 100 index are going to start to have to add paler stock that's why that was the reason for the movement up in the stock yeah let's talk about just how far the stock moved up let's pull up the chart here 5 day is really crazy to see how much the stock went up and then come monday it went down almost just as much as it went up the week before absolutely so it bounced up um and then it came all the way back down here to about where it started the week and then this this was the price action late week and it got all the way up to over $65 a share when it closed on uh friday night so that was a 10% gain from you know from the start of the week to here was about a 10% gain lost that this isn't was in pre-market on on monday morning it lost that and you'll notice though that where it bottomed here is about the same as where it started so that's kind of telling me that paler is forming a fairly good base of support right there around that $ 5859 level so you're looking at support around $5 5859 but i feel like just a couple of months ago you and i were on here doing a video about will paler reach $50 so this stock has seen quite a bit of movement that now $58 is that support level and not a will it reach that level right and so if we can just take a look here bridget we can see that three months ago and we were doing the we were doing the video for could paler hit 50 when the stock was trading down around here and that's you know right around the $35 level and since then look at all the gains that it's made so clearly palente answered that question and then even if you look here i mean it's bounced off that level of what looked like support at around you know $40 and it's just been shooting higher so yeah this has been a this has been a big winner for the year and it just keeps on setting new levels of support as it goes higher i think that's so right it's been a big winner for the year and is that why there's so many traders getting in on this stock right now kind of moving those 10% swings into each direction paler is a fairly heavily shorted stock but that hasn't necessarily worked out really well if you're a short seller because there's a lot of retail investors that are still committed to holding the stock for the long term they're not selling their shares and so when you see a price movement like that it there's really not a lot of opportunity now some of the price action that you saw on monday morning that may have been just people taking profits on the stock and if that's the case that's fine the stock is overvalued by any fundamental measure right let's get into that value what are analysts predicting and how often are those price targets changing because the stock is growing and moving so quickly price targets haven't changed a whole bunch since their last earnings report um goldman sachs came out and they raised it to like $41 they were at like $31 so analysts are still believing that paler is overvalued and i'm not going to sit here and argue with anybody by any objective measure paler stock is is overvalued the question is if you're a long investor you're long and so you would probably love to see paler pull back even more than it's pulled back right now and you could continue to accumulate shares at a much lower price but but that as we're showing in the chart that doesn't look like it's really likely to happen so really the question you just have to ask yourself is are you going to get in are you not going to get in options trading actually i put in my article options trading might have been a really good strategy but now the stock's already dipped on monday morning i don't know if you know there's there's probably an option trade in there somewhere but i'd have to go back and look at the charts to see you know where i would want to be putting my putting my price targets for that ab absolutely now this is such an interesting stock we've done a lot of different stories about what paler is what this company provides it's one big player in ai and we'll get to that in a minute but first i want to talk about a premium report you can only find here on market beep that outlines the 10 best ai stocks to own in 2024 click the link and see if paler makes that list there are so many ai stocks like this one that are really gaining tremendous success so where exactly does paler fit in on the the ai story here's the thing about ai is i was just hearing last week something that's really interesting is that there's as the earning season has gone through there's some analysts that are becoming a little bit how should we say a little bit skeptical about ai and that's because companies are reporting that they're making this investment in ai but they're not necessarily seeing the return on that investment in what ai is delivering for them that's the key thing with paler and their ontology what paler is being able to provide their customers with is usable data that the companies have never been able to figure out how to make any use of it before and palente delivering meaningful insights to those customers and that's the difference is peners being able to show the customers a return on their investment with meaningful

rocket lab stock is taking off ever since some exciting news was announced for the company during last week's earnings report here to break it all down for us is market beat analyst chris marot chris really some exciting news about some big launches for this company in their earnings report they said that they had a record number of launches of their electron rockets during the last quarter and i believe they said it was over 1 billion in backlogs in terms of launches for the company so very good news for the long-term shareholders uh sets very well for the company as far as the path to profitability which is important going forward i think there was also some earnings beat uh excitement in the report that or the earnings report that came out too you know the company is um they're not profitable yet but they're getting closer you can see the path to profitability and the revenue just keeps getting higher year-over-year that's what investors like to see let's talk about all of the trading interest in this stock there is a lot of people looking at rocket lab right now yeah and some of them are not looking at it in terms of going long and investing for the future some are looking to short it this is a fairly high short interest stock yeah chris a lot of traders are really interested in this stock right now there's some pretty high short interest numbers right now in addition to having investors who are looking to buy the stock and hold it for the long term you've also got a lot of traders looking to short the stock it short interest in rocket lab right now is up about 19% i think you and i were looking at that before we came on so it's down a little bit in the last month but it's still 19% short interest is still considered very high for a stock if you are new to trading in these high short interest stocks market bead has a free report that anyone can click on right now in the link below or in the corner of your screen you can also scan the qr code it's a guide to high short interest stocks and how you can profit off of those as you are new to your investment journey we've talked about short interest for rocket lab let's talk about the price and what analysts are expecting right now this stock is trading way higher than what anyone really thought if you go on the market beat page for the analyst forecast the consensus price has it at about $14.72 so that's almost $5 higher than where the stocks trading right now but since i wrote my article um both caner fitzgerald and bank of america raised their price targets significantly for rocket lab stock bank of america went from $10 all the way up to $30 caner fitz gerro went from $7 all the way up to $24 so you you're starting to see sentiment where analysts are raising their price targets above where the price is now which then suggests that the stock could go higher and getting back to that short interest point we were just talking about that means this may not be a good time to be shorting the stock because you could get caught in a squeeze absolutely with it being this high already do we see a risk of it coming down or are some of those new analyst predictions maybe something to look towards could this go even higher yet it could go higher it wouldn't surprise me if there was a little bit of a pullback when a stock goes up this high this fast uh it's right for people that are for shortterm traders who are looking to just take some profit get some money off the table so it wouldn't surprise me if it goes down and keep in mind those price targets are probably you know for 12 months out so it wouldn't be surprising to see the stock come down a little bit then see a lot of institutional interest in buying the stock at a little bit lower price and then see it go back up again and of course if you're long on the stock you're just you're long and you just believe that the price is going to go up and so you're going to probably stay the course and you might even want to see a little bit of a dip now we've talked about rocket lab a few times on this channel and the people who are investing in this company are excited about the space race and everything that rocket lab take brings to the the table for that talk about some exciting advancements happening in this industry and specifically for this company we're in the middle of i guess a new space race is what i would call it and instead of it being i think in the' 60s it was the united states and the soviet union this is more of the united states and china in terms of we're trying to get that next lunar landing with human beings on the moon and then ultimately to get to mars rocket lab's a part of that but right now that's in the future right now the next step for rocket lab is their neutron rockets which which have the ability to take on a slightly larger payload than their electron rockets and the good news that came out of the company's report is that they are still on schedule to have those launches execute starting in 2025 that's just again more revenue for the company pushes it closer to the path of profitability and that's good news that's what investors want to see the company is about more than just launches but right now launches is where they're generating a tremendous amount of their business oh let's talk about the the current econ and kind of some different factors that might impact the investment into the space race moving forward i think the space sector is going to be okay um obviously you know we're just not really sure how all of the government efficiency efforts that the trump administration is going to undertake is going to affect that where are some of the cuts going to come where are they not going to be i think we're going to be okay here as long as you don't see the economy jump into a massive recession which doesn't look like it's going to happen let's talk about those people who might be new to rocket lab just hearing about the stock because of this big takeoff is now a time to buy um when it's taken off this much and let's back up a little bit and just talk about how unique a runup this fast and or this big this fast is for stocks like this you always have to be careful um when you look at price action like this when you have short interest that's as high as rocket labs because you have to wonder is this new money coming in on the sidelines or is this money short investors who are now covering their short positions now that the stocks gone higher that's going to take a little bit of time to play out um if i were interested in buying the stock i i think the question you have to ask yourself is are you looking at this as a short-term trade or as a longer term investment i think the answer might be a little bit of the same which is if you're investing in it as a trader i think you're going to want to wait to see it try to come back a little bit and then you try to get in if you're a investor that's interested in taking a longer position on the stock and you believe that the stock's going to have a lot of growth coming in the next five 10 15 years i think it's okay to get in now and just you don't maybe have to go all in but maybe take a smaller position and then just add to that position over time some good information chris thank you so much for your time today talking about this stock that has really caught a lot of people's attention right now if you want to learn more about rocket lab we've got several other videos we've done on this company check out those on our channel and as always thank you for watching and happy investing [music],rocket lab,1.0,0.9

efforts that the trump administration is going to undertake is going to affect that where are some of the cuts going to come where are they not going to be i think we're going to be okay here as long as you don't see the economy jump into a massive recession which doesn't look like it's going to happen let's talk about those people who might be new to rocket lab just hearing about the stock because of this big takeoff is now a time to buy um when it's taken off this much and let's back up a little bit and just talk about how unique a runup this fast and or this big this fast is for stocks like this you always have to be careful um when you look at price action like this when you have short interest that's as high as rocket labs because you have to wonder is this new money coming in on the sidelines or is this money short investors who are now covering their short positions now that the stocks gone higher that's going to take a little bit of time to play out um if i were interested in buying the stock i i think the question you have to ask yourself is are you looking at this as a short-term trade or as a longer term investment i think the answer might be a little bit of the same which is if you're investing in it as a trader i think you're going to want to wait to see it try to come back a little bit and then you try to get in if you're a investor that's interested in taking a longer position on the stock and you believe that the stock's going to have a lot of growth coming in the next five 10 15 years i think it's okay to get in now and just you don't maybe have to go all in but maybe take a smaller position and then just add to that position over time some good information chris thank you so much for your time today talking about this stock

rocket lab stock is taking off ever since some exciting news was announced for the company during last week's earnings report here to break it all down for us is market beat analyst chris marot chris really some exciting news about some big launches for this company in their earnings report they said that they had a record number of launches of their electron rockets during the last quarter and i believe they said it was over 1 billion in backlogs in terms of launches for the company so very good news for the long-term shareholders uh sets very well for the company as far as the path to profitability which is important going forward i think there was also some earnings beat uh excitement in the report that or the earnings report that came out too you know the company is um they're not profitable yet but they're getting closer you can see the path to profitability and the revenue just keeps getting higher year-over-year that's what investors like to see let's talk about all of the trading interest in this stock there is a lot of people looking at rocket lab right now yeah and some of them are not looking at it in terms of going long and investing for the future some are looking to short it this is a fairly high short interest stock yeah chris a lot of traders are really interested in this stock right now there's some pretty high short interest numbers right now in addition to having investors who are looking to buy the stock and hold it for the long term you've also got a lot of traders looking to short the stock it short interest in rocket lab right now is up about 19% i think you and i were looking at that before we came on so it's down a little bit in the last month but it's still 19% short interest is still considered very high for a stock if you are new to trading in these high short interest stocks market bead has a free report that anyone can click on right now in the link below or in the corner of your screen you can also scan the qr code it's a guide to high short interest stocks and how you can profit off of those as you are new to your investment journey we've talked about short interest for rocket lab let's talk about the price and what analysts are expecting right now this stock is trading way higher than what anyone really thought if you go on the market beat page for the analyst forecast the consensus price has it at about $14.72 so that's almost $5 higher than where the stocks trading right now but since i wrote my article um both caner fitzgerald and bank of america raised their price targets significantly for rocket lab stock bank of america went from $10 all the way up to $30 caner fitz gerro went from $7 all the way up to $24 so you you're starting to see sentiment where analysts are raising their price targets above where the price is now which then suggests that the stock could go higher and getting back to that short interest point we were just talking about that means this may not be a good time to be shorting the stock because you could get caught in a squeeze absolutely with it being this high already do we see a risk of it coming down or are some of those new analyst predictions maybe something to look towards could this go even higher yet it could go higher it wouldn't surprise me if there was a little bit of a pullback when a stock goes up this high this fast uh it's right for people that are for shortterm traders who are looking to just take some profit get some money off the table so it wouldn't surprise me if it goes down and keep in mind those price targets are probably you know for 12 months out so it wouldn't be surprising to see the stock come down a little bit then see a lot of institutional interest in buying the stock at a little bit lower price and then see it go back up again and of course if you're long on the stock you're just you're long and you just believe that the price is going to go up and so you're going to probably stay the course and you might even want to see a little bit of a dip now we've talked about rocket lab a few times on this channel and the people who are investing in this company are excited about the space race and everything that rocket lab take brings to the the table for that talk about some exciting advancements happening in this industry and specifically for this company we're in the middle of i guess a new space race is what i would call it and instead of it being i think in the' 60s it was the united states and the soviet union this is more of the united states and china in terms of we're trying to get that next lunar landing with human beings on the moon and then ultimately to get to mars rocket lab's a part of that but right now that's in the future right now the next step for rocket lab is their neutron rockets which which have the ability to take on a slightly larger payload than their electron rockets and the good news that came out of the company's report is that they are still on schedule to have those launches execute starting in 2025 that's just again more revenue for the company pushes it closer to the path of profitability and that's good news that's what investors want to see the company is about more than just launches but right now launches is where they're generating a tremendous amount of their business oh let's talk about the the current econ and kind of some different factors that might impact the investment into the space race moving forward i think the space sector is going to be okay um obviously you know we're just not really sure how all of the government efficiency efforts that the trump administration is going to undertake is going to affect that where are some of the cuts going to come where are they not going to be i think we're going to be okay here as long

language: en a real estate investment trust up 35% this year what's driving their success let's dive in today we're excited to have dave hullman joining us dave is the ceo of whit stone reads dave thank you so much for the time today well it's it's a pleasure to be with you and look forward to to speaking let's start off the conversation today with what sets whit stone reed apart from other commercial real estate companies across the country so we are a a community centered real estate investment trust we value very much the the neighborhood so we we put our properties in in great neighborhoods and we're a reit so we're a vehicle that allows investors to invest in real estate without having to go through all the trouble of of of buying and financing and and operating the properties we're located uh in the sun belt so 100% of our properties are in the sun belt in texas and arizona and we're in the the fastest growing markets in those states we're in dallas houston san antonio austin and then we're also in the the phoenix market our centers tend to be more convenience focused so we have really leaned into the driver of convenience being a large factor in consumer buying and then we specialize in in higher demand smaller spaces uh from a company perspective we're we're traded on the nysc our ticker is wsr about a $750 million market cap company uh we we are one of the few public companies that pays a monthly dividend so we pay investors a monthly dividend uh allowing them the opportunity obviously to have income and participate in our growth and then very proud of our our performance if you look at whit stone over the last year uh our shareholder return is over 35% and then really since i stepped into the ceo role back in january of 22 uh we've produced a shareholder return of over 60% and that compares to the the sector return of about 15% very impressive growth story we'll get back to some of the stock numbers in a little bit i want to talk a little bit more about some of your properties and the history of your company how long has whit stone been around and are you developing some of these properties new yourself or are you taking over existing properties already yeah sure sure to glad to to share a little bit about our history i joined the company back in 2006 and was the chief financial officer for a number of years uh at that time it was a very small uh company that owned assets largely in houston uh and really had uh all retail shareholders and no institutional ownership at that time we internalized our management team uh and we adopted a strategy that really you know take took a look at the changing retail environment obviously e-commerce was uh was was growing uh there was a lot of thought about retail bricks and mortar being dead and we really leaned into the the the space of of services and convenience and the kinds of things that you couldn't buy on the internet over the next know 10 years we bought great properties in growing markets we expanded our geographic footprint uh as i mentioned some of our markets were're in and then we've also strengthened our investor base uh 2020 which seems like a bunch of years ago obviously was the the pandemic and was a a big kind of rocked the world for all of us but uh we're the strength of whit stone's portfolio uh stood out during that time as we had you know some of the best performance in the sector and then recently our history with u as i mentioned i stepped into the ceo role in early 2022 so we've really been laker laser focused on uh really strong corporate governance uh operational and financial performance you know for us it's a matter of of of doing what we say we're going to do and we've been focused on that and then discipline capital allocation uh we've also spent a lot of time making sure we have the right team members in place we have goals and accountability and then uh tenant selection we'll uh we'll talk about what we do a little bit but but really understanding the consumer i think is incredibly important and no matter what business you're in and so we focused on making sure that we understand the neighborhoods have the right uh businesses in place and really support the community we're not a groundup developer we historically buy properties uh where we can find a property that we can come in and apply our operational and strategy to and add value so with that we do uh we do some amount of development uh in the existing properties but we're not a groundup developer we look for for assets and great markets that we can add value to one thing that you say sets your company apart too is working directly with your tenants what does that look like from you know the real estate owner and tenant partnership very fundamental to everything we do uh i mentioned our performance in the pandemic and i credit a lot of that to our close strong deep relationships with our tenants uh we're a little smaller than some of the other big public reats and i think with that we take a more hands-on approach uh we're very very active in using technology to understand the community what the the buying needs are what the void analysis is and we we really lean into that and and spend time with tenants uh we have a a a team that regularly interacts with tenants uh meets with them regularly understands you know who their customers are what can we as a landlord do to help their businesses who are complimentary businesses that would help drive their business so for us being uh very involved with our our tenants is crucial and we structure we actually structure that arrangement a little differently than some of the others we have shorter lease terms which we like because it keeps us uh in front of the tenants more often it's important to have fresh centers with uh with businesses that are performing well and so we consider uh the strong tenant relationships one of the things that really sets white stone ap par and your stock price is definitely showing the results of that strategy um doing very very well as you said up about 35% this year what do you expect for growth in the future yeah so so growth is something that we we focus on every day for us it has a lot of different different legs right you think about uh the existing portfolio we have today uh if you look at our same store growth in our properties it's among the best in the sector and we credit that to the you know the operational expertise of the team and our strategy we've also got growth opportunities i mentioned in some development and redevelopment of our existing centers so uh for us we buy properties that sometimes have a little extra land where we can add a a very valuable pad site uh and we do that driven you know 100% by by demand and then uh growth also for us will be uh acquisitions if you look at over the last couple years we've bought about hundred million in properties we've financed that with with doing some sales of properties but we think there's going to be great opportunities for us in the markets we're in and similar markets to really expand our asset base over the coming years yeah how does the current state of the economy uh discussions around interest rates impact your business going forward yeah it's it's the the current environment is as strong as i've ever seen it in our sector uh obviously the the macro i'm not an economist so i won't get too far over my skis but uh what we're seeing is we continue to see a healthy consumer the data that's coming out supports that and then more importantly on the ground we see our businesses doing well uh in our sector in the retail world real estate is is very different right and retail real estate is very different i mentioned neighborhood centers uh we focus on the neighborhood centers which have seen the the best performance in the retail group uh but we're seeing a super strong supply environment uh if you look back really from 2000 to 2009 uh there was really very little new supply delivered into the markets for for strip centers and retail centers you know for the last decade we've seen very little supply so we're in a we're in an environmental time right now where we have strong demand we're in we're in markets that have great migration i mentioned texas and arizona leading the country and in new job growth and and new migration and then we also benefit from a a supply environment that that is uh super positive as well and then interest rates i think uh all of us have learned to operate with different interest rate levels for us as a real estate operator it's just it's matching uh we have shorter leases so we have the ability to to grow those lease rates in good times and and to to move them as interest rates change uh we have a capital structure that uh has uh you know extended maturities we lad our maturities we have lots of of financial partners so so interest rates are something that i think we can we can uh work well with we've worked well with the the rising rates and i think we all think there's going to be you know it may take a little longer but there's going to be an environment with a little lower interest rates coming i believe for our retail investors out there you've already mentioned a little bit about being really proud of the balance sheet and how your company is run that's what a lot of our investors are interested in what are some of the the things about how your company operates that you're most proud of that you think investors would be interested to hear about one of the things we we focused on is making sure that we have the kind of transparency that allows investors to to see exactly what the drivers are in our business we have with that we've strengthened some of our governance we recently brought on a couple new extremely experienced strong board members that'll oversee uh the company so i think that's that's a great benefit for all investors and then from a balance sheet perspective i mentioned our capital structure uh we don't have complexity we have uh largely unsecured debt we have it well laded uh and then we'll continue to look for for ways to to fix those rates about 90% of our debt is at fixed rates and very little matur is coming over the the next several years so from a balance sheet perspective uh since i've stepped into the ceo role we've also focused on strengthening the balance sheet uh we received a an investment grade credit rating in late 22 and we've continued to to have a lower debt leverage on our balance sheet which i think shows the the strength of our portfolio i think a lot of investors are happy to hear about the improvements and the focus on your balance sheet how about the focus on the future anything else just to wrap up our conversation today that you're just excited about for the momentum for whit stone yeah i think uh momentum is a word that i think i would use to describe where we are today we have very positive momentum if you look at uh we talked a little bit about growth ultimately you know we we we judge ourselves on growth are we growing our shareholder value our shareholders uh earnings and are there is their stock worth more than it was before if you look at whit stone's earnings growth for 2014 we expect it to be about 11% on a per share basis which is is very good and i think the runway going forward is is great our organic growth is is super strong our team is good and we're positioned in a a great place in the in the market wonderful well dave thank you so much for sharing more about whit stone re with our investors today you can find more about this company and many others right on marketbeat.com and stay on our channel

soundhound is starting wednesday down 15% after its earnings report but what could the future hold market beat analyst thomas hughes joins us now with a look at the stock that's seen some explosive growth this year but not so great news this morning thomas yeah this morning the stock is down but it's really just a reaction to uh news that didn't make the market quite happy enough uh the bar for this company has been set very high analysts have been raising the bar very high it's still outperformed the bar and raised its guidance but the whisper figures were even higher so it's just a response to to not meeting up to these really high expectations but you got to remember that the company is still growing by nearly 90% growth is accelerating it's in the very very earliest stages of um an industry that's expected to more than to grow more than 500% in the next six years that 28% cgr so this is a big big story this pullback is absolutely a time to buy the stock this pull back is something we've seen in a lot of these rapidly growing ai companies nvidia being one of them after earnings reports there's such high expectations but i think it's hard for investors to figure out how to play such rapid growth this stock at the beginning of this year was trading under $2 and now we're up above seven almost $9 with more growth to come how do you keep as an investor on top of a stock that's seen such rapid growth well you have to keep it in perspective okay okay cuz soundhound is still a a very tiny micro cap its revenue this quarter was just $25 million that is a very very small amount of money so it's only begun to monetize its product but its industry is ai voice assistance and ai voice assistance is seen as u some have called it the the killer app for ai for generative ai it is what ai is supposed to be doing talking to you and helping you get through navigate through some processes including like um customer engagement so this compy focus is on helping brands connect with their customers you think about call centers and all those voice ai products this is the leading voed ai product that's able to hold a conversation with people it's improving daily they're expanding into new verticals they're uh increasing they're improving the breadth of their product offerings so there's just a lot of things going for this company right now it's growing at a hyper growth pace above 80% growth is accelerating it's continuously persistently raising its guidance it's raised guidance three times this year while outperforming so this is like a quadruple win for the business it's outperforming it's hyper growing it's raising guidance and it's persistently raising guidance we have to assume that guidance in the coming quarter will be raised and the guidance for next year which is calling for another acceleration and revenue to also be cautious so we're looking at a persistent cycle of improved guidance that should also be seen in the anal sentiment we should start seeing those guys start raising their estimates pretty soon and help um add lift to the stock price yeah so despite the the dip that soundhound is seing this morning you just released an article saying you expect a big 2025 ahead for this company uh talk about some of those reasons you just mentioned a lot of them i think the the number of new contracts and other businesses that are jumping on top of soundhound products is another good sign for strong future growth in 2025 right it's expanding the number of businesses and also the number of industries that it's serving so it's improving its client base one of the important metrics for this quarter is that its concentration and diversification were greatly improved last year at this time 70% of its revenue came from a single client this year that same client only produced 12% of the revenue and there was an expansion into um other other segments other industries that just provides a much firmer base of support for the company's business all right with so much volatility in a stock in such a short time period what's the trading play for soundhound yeah the 6 50 level looks like a pretty good trigger point for buying the stock fell hard after after the release it's down around that level right now but the early indications are that the market is buying this dip i would expect to see that this level or near to it hold as firm support for the market to rebuild its base of support and to begin moving higher if not by the end of this year and early in two early in 2025 that sounds like a good entry point for traders but a lot of traders are also taking advantage of options especially for stocks like like this one if you are new to options market bead has a premium report really explaining how options trading can really benefit your portfolio check out the link below or scan the qr code to get this premium report you're only going to find on market beat all about options trading now thomas what are some good options that people could consider for sound hound well soundhound is probably a pretty good play for options traders because of the volatility it's producing some pretty big moves it's also got some pretty clear technical levels for support targets where it's trading at now so i think this would be a fine a fine candidate for short-term and long-term options plays trying to capture the near-term volatility as well as the long-term price movements yeah there's been so much movement in this stock of course the short interest is also seeing a big increase uh any thoughts about that and how it impacts how you would play the stock well the short interest is certainly going to provide some headwinds for the market but ultimately i think the shorts are going to provide fuel for higher prices because as the company can continues to grow and op form it its estimates they're going to be forced to cover their trades and provide fuel for a short covering rally if not for a short squeeze uh the higher the short interest goes um the greater the chances for a short squeeze yeah how far are analysts expecting the stock to go in just the next year right so if you look on market beach you can see there's about eight analysts covering the stock their sentiment has been firming this year lifting the sentiment up to a moderate buy verging on buy and they've been raising their price targets right now their price targets are only expecting a low double- digit advance but again i expect the results and the forward results to lead to an analyst upgrade cycle that will provide lift to the market and lead this stock to new highs so it sounds like you are a soundhound fan and you would get on right now during this dip oh yeah i think this is a good stock to get into it's certainly a speculative play but it's got a lot going for it i think a smart position uh will perform very well for investors thanks for the time today thomas and walking us through soundhound you can read his full article on marketbeat.com and thank you for joining us here on marketbeat media let us know what you think about soundhound is this a play that you're getting in on we'd love to hear from you thanks again for

here to break it all down for us is marketbeat analyst thomas hughes. thomas, let's start with just how high nvidia's stock went just last week. well, uh, last week it broke above a critical resistance target. that was the previous all-time high right around 141. and then it continued to move higher. so, it gained about 6 or 7% by the end of the week. uh, but the critical detail is that it broke above a trading range. it broke above a previous high as a significant resistance point which indicates that the trend is still up. i would expect to see the stock continue to rise over the next week going into the earnings report. the earnings report very well could be a strong catalyst for bigger gains over the next two to three quarters. yeah, there's a lot of movement and a lot of talk around nvidia that happens every time their earnings report comes up. now, one thing i want to point out is last time we were talking about nvidia's earnings report, the everyone was waiting for that report to come and then the stock price fell immediately after earnings report. are we expecting or anticipating anything like that surrounding this earnings? i think it would be safe bet to assume that there will be a price pullback after that. there's a lot of sentiment and um euphoria driven or embedded in the nvidia price. so, even with a good report, there's probably going to be some profit taking. uh, but any dip that forms would be a likely buying or entry point for new money, for new investors, both for short-term trades and for long-term investments. so, let's talk about getting in for those traders who are looking to make a profit off of some of the swings that are going to be happening with nvidia this week and next week. uh, where is a good entry point? well, right now the 141 level looks like a pretty solid entry point. that is our resistance target, the previous high that was broken last week. uh the market is moving up from that level. but uh technical theory says that the market is likely to pull back and retest for support. it could pull back as far as that 141 level. if it were to touch to that level, i would expect to see a pretty strong confirmation from the market that that is a a buying opportunity as far as wanting to get out and make that short-term profit. what price target would you be looking for in the near term? a 10 to 20% gain would be pretty easy. that aligns with um the general trend of analyst revisions. but over the long term, i would say there's a good 30% upside from that previous high because of the revision trends and because i would expect to see the revision trend continue to be positive over the coming quarters. now, if you're looking to stay in nvidia or to get in on more nvidia, maybe when it has one of those dips coming up in the stock, what are some indicators and some talk right now about positive signs for long-term nvidia growth? there's been a lot of discussion around blackwell and just on their really solid revenue happening right now. well, right now it's coming down to the uh the hyperscalers. microsoft, amazon, and google are all investing big dollars into their into their data center infrastructure, and most of that money is flowing to nvidia. um, we can see some of that flow going through taiwan semiconductors, who posted a pretty significant revenue increase. they make the bulk of nvidia chips. so, right now, this is a systemic issue that we're watching. um, the system is focused on nvidia's chips, but it's being driven by all of the big major mega tech companies. even uh meta, oracle, all the big guys that are building their data centers are all relying real heavily on nvidia chips. so, what's the longer term target for nvidia's stock price moving forward? well, right now we have the analyst and the technical indicators um kind of confirming or agreeing together uh for the 190 to 200 range. so that that's right in line with the 30 to 35% gain i was talking about before. so a good long-term future, but in the short term, it feels like there could be some risk with that earnings report still coming out. what's the risk for people looking at this as as a short-term trade right now? well, the risk is that the report will be underwhelming. so there is a lot of expectation baked into the report. analysts have been raising their estimates. the bar has been set pretty high. um, but with such demand, there's possible that the pipeline of chips isn't able to support how much demand there is. so, the report really could be underwhelming and that is a big risk for the stock price. that's definitely what we saw at last earnings report. we'll see if this one could be any different. thomas, thank you so much for your analysis today. you can find more nvidia news coverage right here on marketbeat media. check out our other nvidia videos right here on our channel. thanks for watching and as always, happy investing.

here to break it all down for us is marketbeat analyst thomas hughes. thomas, let's start with just how high nvidia's stock went just last week. well, uh, last week it broke above a critical resistance target. that was the previous all-time high right around 141. and then it continued to move higher. so, it gained about 6 or 7% by the end of the week. uh, but the critical detail is that it broke above a trading range. it broke above a previous high as a significant resistance point which indicates that the trend is still up. i would expect to see the stock continue to rise over the next week going into the earnings report. the earnings report very well could be a strong catalyst for bigger gains over the next two to three quarters. yeah, there's a lot of movement and a lot of talk around nvidia that happens every time their earnings report comes up. now, one thing i want to point out is last time we were talking about nvidia's earnings report, the everyone was waiting for that report to come and then the stock price fell immediately after earnings report. are we expecting or anticipating anything like that surrounding this earnings? i think it would be safe bet to assume that there will be a price pullback after that. there's a lot of sentiment and um euphoria driven or embedded in the nvidia price. so, even with a good report, there's probably going to be some profit taking. uh, but any dip that forms would be a likely buying or entry point for new money, for new investors, both for short-term trades and for long-term investments. so, let's talk about getting in for those traders who are looking to make a profit off of some of the swings that are going to be happening with nvidia this week and next week. uh, where is a good entry point? well, right now the 141 level looks like a pretty solid entry point. that is our resistance target, the previous high that was broken last week. uh the market is moving up from that level. but uh technical theory says that the market is likely to pull back and retest for support. it could pull back as far as that 141 level. if it were to touch to that level, i would expect to see a pretty strong confirmation from the market that that is a a buying opportunity as far as wanting to get out and make that short-term profit. what price target would you be looking for in the near term? a 10 to 20% gain would be pretty easy. that aligns with um the general trend of analyst revisions. but over the long term, i would say there's a good 30% upside from that previous high because of the revision trends and because i would expect to see the revision trend continue to be positive over the coming quarters. now, if you're looking to stay in nvidia or to get in on more nvidia, maybe when it has one of those dips coming up in the stock, what are some indicators and some talk right now about positive signs for long-term nvidia growth? there's been a lot of discussion around blackwell and just on their really solid revenue happening right now. well, right now it's coming down to the uh the hyperscalers. microsoft, amazon, and google are all investing big dollars into their into their data center infrastructure, and most of that money is flowing to nvidia. um, we can see some of that flow going through taiwan semiconductors, who posted a pretty significant revenue increase. they make the bulk of nvidia chips. so, right now, this is a systemic issue that we're watching. um, the system is focused on nvidia's chips, but it's being driven by all of the big major mega tech companies. even uh meta, oracle, all the big guys that are building their data centers are all relying real heavily on nvidia chips. so, what's the longer term target for nvidia's stock price moving forward? well, right now we have the analyst and the technical indicators um kind of confirming or agreeing together uh for the 190 to 200 range. so that that's right in line with the 30 to 35% gain i was talking about before. so a good long-term future, but in the short term, it feels like there could be some risk with that earnings report still coming out. what's the risk for people looking at this as as a short-term trade right now? well, the risk is that the report will be underwhelming. so there is a lot of expectation baked into the report. analysts have been raising their estimates. the bar has been set pretty high. um, but with such demand, there's possible that the pipeline of chips isn't able to support how much demand there is. so, the report really could be underwhelming and that is a big risk for the stock price. that's definitely what we saw at last earnings report. we'll see if this one could be any different. thomas, thank you so much for your analysis today. you can find more nvidia news coverage right here on marketbeat media. check out our other nvidia videos right here on our channel. thanks for watching and as always, happy investing.

captions language: en using ai to help companies keep track of their things let's dive into this new company about to go public today we are excited to have ed ne brosky the ceo ofai corporation with us to share more about his company ed thank you so much for your time today thanks for inviting us we're excited to tell our story let's start out with what isai we started about three years ago and we developed a new way of collecting data at the edge of the enterprise we um we kind of invented that in the basement as most startups do and we started working on that actually in the autonomous vehicle market we were looking at ways of using cooperative markers to interact with um traffic signs urban canyons and cities and things like that but the technology we developed there really became more applicable to uh logistics and manufacturing and and um asset tracking type technology and so we started transition into that space um the software we were veloping at the time also we realized the advantage of ai was much more powerful in these kind of multi-layered complex systems and so about two years ago we migrated the company much more towards logistics and asset management and and that's really where we found a home and found great traction so uh that's what we are today wonderful so let's start with who are your customers who who uses your product well that's the problem with assets uh we all have things right i like to talk about the the internet of things but let's talk about the things customers are everything from consumers who have things all the way up to large enterprises that have things we all want to know where our things are how many things we have are our things getting to the right place at the right time so anyone that has that kind of concern is one of our customers now we target enterprise class customers that have multiple locations that are really concerned about their things and so uh large customers that are in the retail sector uh manufacturing is one of our biggest sectors that are moving a lot of things a lot of times through processes uh logistics uh shipping companies the military has been a big deal for us they have a lot of things moving all the time um anyone who's got to manage their things is is our customer it sounds like that would take a team of software developers who are some of the people you have working for your team and and talk a little bit about where you are located around the world oh yeah we've uh we've assembled an amazing team i've done a number of startups in the past but i'm really proud of the team that we have our cto is vj nambiar he came to us from verizon we recruited him specifically he was leading their 5g team to veling 5g routers in fact if you're using a verizon 5g router that was probably vian's work when he was there at at verizon um so he's an expert in that area uh v jan has got our embedded team here in shirley massachusetts that's where i'm broadcasting from today i'm here in the lab with our launch party getting our our dfm group ready to launch our new product here for the fourth quarter we've got a brand new revolutionary patent pending bridge that we're launching and that's i'm here doing so shirley massachusetts just outs side of boston is our technical headquarters where the r&amp;d really happens um a lot of our software is programmed here from the embedded and device driver side but then we also have our web services and cloud operations over in india in bangalore and we have a large team there uh the hardware that we design for our edge systems is actually manufactured in puerto rico we have our own hardware manufacturing facility there just outside of san juan and actually the puerto rican team is up here with me this week as we prepare for this launch uh so that's a fantastic facility i work mostly out of the bethesda office we have a washington dc administrative office office that's where all of our accounting and legal and uh compliance work happens um the sales department would call that the overhead group and then of course we have our our headquarters over in las vegas in our headquarters we're actually co-located with one of our large distributors and we call it our western experience center that's where our customers can come and see our technology working in a warehouse environment where we move things around where we we change things um we use that as our training center for all of our distribution partners and channel partners as well as our salespeople so our go to market headquarters is collocated there with our admin center in vegas where it's very easy to get people to fly to vegas and come for training that's a big wide footprint kind of all over the place let's talk about the growth that you're experiencing as a company right now and the recent announcement that just came out too yes so we're we're taking our company public which is really exciting um we'll be on the nasdaq we hope by the end of the year we're working our way through that we've been going through the various filings and compliance uh but we're on schedule for you know an endof year transition to that public company we need that cash to really finance the growth that we're seeing we've already started with some lighthouse customers that are very large multinational billion dollar corporations multi-billion dollar corporations that want to base their systems on our technology and so we've done initial pilots we've started working through initial sites but uh this explosive growth needs to be funded as we go international uh we'll be founding more locations in europe in particular as well as southeast asia and um we'll be advancing a lot of our channel programs through that that funding the technology we do needs a lot of work as well i mean we've got our base system working but there's so much to be done with ai and with uh image processing that we're working with some of our chip developments we've done with our patented passive microwave technology that this go public move is a chance to give us the rocket fuel we need to really take the system into a new generation of of performance as well as support uh for our customers around the world there's so much conversation around the world about ai and so many new companies like yours popping up because of the new developments in ai let's talk about competition in this field a little bit are there other competitors out there who are doing something similar to what you're doing or are you really unique in this space well everyone's going to tell you they think they're unique but i've got a a long history i've worked for decades in the rfid and auto id business um and so i understand the systems that are there now and i guess i can boil this downbridge into two problems so applying ai to logistics is relatively easy because ai engines are now available and the technology become more and more refined but the difficulty in applying i logistics is the data isn't there it's very difficult and expensive to get data from all these things that move today we hire a lot of operators do barcode scanning where you put very expensive portals or infrastructured antennas up and that doesn't give us the richness of data you really need to drive an intelligent ai implementation what's unique about us is that we're not just an rfid company supplying the rfid we're we're marrying it with the vision systems and the ai backend that allows that data to be useful in the workflow so the combination of having the ai software as well as a really unique edge data collection system is what lets us develop value or deliver value that other companies really can't we find a lot of our competitors are kind of one trick ponies that are focused either on the software or on the data collection system but they struggle to get the both married together into a way that adds the value and maybe i can elaborate on one part of that so when you think about edge collection uh edge data collection um we think often about either a manual process like barcode scanning or we think about a very expensive of infrastructure like portals you know antennas that are scanning through pinch points um what we've developed is is something that you could think of like an apple air tag where an iphone that's traveling through an enterprise can pick up your air tag and report its location we've developed mobile readers that are battery powered that can go on your pallets on your forklifts on your totes and as it goes through your enterprise it picks up these other tags and these other items um very seamlessly very inexpensively without having an engineer on site that has to put that together that's what's kind of unique about our data collection system uh and then on the software side having people that are experienced in this industry i've spent a career in this industry um many of my my sea- lev team are from that side we've done an implementation i think that is really unique in the ai uh using not just the rf uh data capture capability but also the the vision systems that we overlay with it so um it's really kind of a an exciting and unique way that we've created a way to dynamically gather this data and then make it meaningful to an operator to get my things to the right place the right time i think that's what investors want to hear is what kind of demand is out there and what kind of success are you seeing with your clients clearly you're seeing some growth already but what's the benefit to the customers that you're serving and what kind of demand are you seeing from that pool of customers i've never had a company like this that has such a u a high hit rate normally when you're calling out you're in single-digit percentages about demand generation activities and number of contacts we've been ping in the percentages and i i don't want to over quote it here and get in trouble but so many people are looking for a way to do this better and that's a combination of two things one is they they understand the inefficiencies in their process they're losing things they're having unreliability in the things but i think the other part is they're being driven by fear that the big retailers like amazon walmart have shown that tying their demand triggers from the front end to their backend operation is tremendously efficient and delivers value that we've never believed before i mean i i don't you're not as old as i am but i i would never have thought that i could order something online and have it show up on my doorstep the next day right that's like a miracle but we now expect that but so many enterprises in the world today they have two we lead times to fulfill an order within their own internal operations their logistics programs are still antiquated and they and they don't have a way to upgrade them to that kind of modern expectation so the cios i talk to the ceos i talk to at our customers are desperate to get those demand triggers in real time to the edge and get data from the edge to to their customers of where their things are and how they're going to be delivered and they just haven't found a good solution that rolls in a cost- effective way that has the intelligence that they want that we're seeing in the commercial world and so we hope to be the one to bring it to them uh we know there's others of course trying to get there but we think we have a unique ability to get there first another important thing for our investors is always about the financials and how the company is run to um are you finding success already at this early stage of your company i believe you said you're about three years into development yes that's right so that the financials are always difficult i mean we are basically pre-revenue as a sas company so although we've had some revenue uh we've had a lot of seed funding um having gathered more than $7 million in seed as we've gone them to the stage and then also gone off of um various grants and research programs we've done that's been the primary source of our funding but um as we build our our sas model and we're a bit of a hybrid where we have sas and and hardware what's wonderful coming to this stage is we have a backlog for our hardware orders coming in from our transactional side and on the sas side we have a base of lighthouse customers that are now growing exponentially as they add more sites and add more applications and so the foundation for growth is there and the customer pickup is there uh but our funding so far has been more pre-revenue type activities that you'd see in a typical tech startup well and you do have a new partnership with shoulder up tell us what that means for your company yeah shoulder up is our sponsor as we work through this go public uh exercise uh shoulder up is a fantastic uh group that we've enjoyed working with they have deep ties in the military um i probably should have explained earlier that in our our initial start some of our early customers were military uh projects we uh were awarded several sb programs we demonstrated logistics applications within military and they continue to be an important sector um so schrop has really helped us open more doors there and there's a huge part of our business that's that's focused there um our factory in puerto rico allows us to do made in america development of our hardware in a way that most of our competitors are sourcing from china and from countries that are not going to allow them to be in those government areas so shoulder up helps us uh open that important door shoulder up is already a a spack company that can help us also take us public and that's been helpful um so u they're not just a transactional partner they're a partner go forward that's going to help us develop our markets that we're targeting they have really good contacts in the areas that we're we're moving forward on so if it's a retail investor who's watching this right now you can't quite find your company right now to invest in but when and how will they be able to find you if they're interest in being an early investor all right so the first thing i would say is look for us on our public disclosures we have filed our initial s4s and those are available if you search for us uh you should know that our current name we're listed under is cid inc that's uh we we're transitioning the corporation as part of this uh company transition so if you search on the the sec disclosures under cid inc you'll see our current s4 which is all of our financial filings as well as the company um go forward plans in terms of being a investor um as we're in this stage um we're we're working with our sponsors with through institutionalsales will be funneled into that group so you would contact me or my cfo charlie maddox and we would uh bring you into our our institutional pipeline group well thank you so much for your time today is there anything else about your company that you'd like to share you've said a few different times um about what makes you so excited about this company compared to others you've been at and that's a question i love to ask is just why as the ceo of this company are you excited about what you are offering atai oh goodness there's so many reasons um it always starts with the people i have an exceptional management team and it's been such a joy to work with them and to have them so confident in each of their areas the departments we set up the people we' started to attract it's been wonderful to build a team and and that's always the great joy but the second part that we're seeing the adoption we are um i think we've hit the timing really really well uh it's a time where ai is is emerging and it needs to be applied to more use cases we're seeing it being applied in our our normal lives but logistics and supply chain and and asset management generally is pretty old school there's a lot of paper and clipboard out there still there's a lot of manual barcode scanning and labeling and um it's a rich field for this technology to be applied um it's a complex field no one person can manage a multi-layered supply chain and get everything to the right place at the right time uh ai is a tremendous aid for that and and i think everyone's seeing that because they're more comfortable with ai in their private life so it's a combination of the timing our technology hitting the market at the right time it's solving a real problem that's a multi-trillion dollar problem and i've got the best team i've ever had in a in a company to tackle it so i'm excited about that that is something to be excited about thank you again ed so much for your time today and for sharing a little bit more about your company with our investors you can check out the article we have on marketbeat.com with more details about this company and

growth that you're experiencing as a company right now and the recent announcement that just came out too yes so we're we're taking our company public which is really exciting um we'll be on the nasdaq we hope by the end of the year we're working our way through that we've been going through the various filings and compliance uh but we're on schedule for you know an endof year transition to that public company we need that cash to really finance the growth that we're seeing we've already started with some lighthouse customers that are very large multinational billion dollar corporations multi-billion dollar corporations that want to base their systems on our technology and so we've done initial pilots we've started working through initial sites but uh this explosive growth needs to be funded as we go international uh we'll be founding more locations in europe in particular as well as southeast asia and um we'll be advancing a lot of our channel programs through that that funding the technology we do needs a lot of work as well i mean we've got our base system working but there's so much to be done with ai and with uh image processing that we're working with some of our chip developments we've done with our patented passive microwave technology that this go public move is a chance to give us the rocket fuel we need to really take the system into a new generation of of performance as well as support uh for our customers around the world there's so much conversation around the world about ai and so many new companies like yours popping up because of the new developments in ai let's talk about competition in this field a little bit are there other competitors out there who are doing something similar to what you're doing or are you really unique in this space well everyone's going to tell you they think they're unique but i've got a a long history i've worked for decades in the rfid and auto id business um and so i understand the systems that are there now and i guess i can boil this downbridge into two problems so applying ai to logistics is relatively easy because ai engines are now available and the technology become more and more refined but the difficulty in applying i logistics is the data isn't there it's very difficult and expensive to get data from all these things that move today we hire a lot of operators do barcode scanning where you put very expensive portals or infrastructured antennas up and that doesn't give us the richness of data you really need to drive an intelligent ai implementation what's unique about us is that we're not just an rfid company supplying the rfid we're we're marrying it with the vision systems and the ai backend that allows that data to be useful in the workflow so the combination of having the ai software as well as a really unique edge data collection system is what lets us develop value or deliver value that other companies really can't we find a lot of our competitors are kind of one trick ponies that are focused either on the software or on the data collection system but they struggle to get the both married together into a way that adds the value and maybe i can elaborate on one part of that so when you think about edge collection uh edge data collection um we think often about either a manual process like barcode scanning or we think about a very expensive of infrastructure like portals you know antennas that are scanning through pinch points um what we've developed is is something that you could think of like an apple air tag where an iphone that's traveling through an enterprise can pick up your air tag and report its location we've developed mobile readers that are battery powered that can go on your pallets on your forklifts on your totes and as it goes through your enterprise it picks up these other tags and these other items um very seamlessly very inexpensively without having an engineer on site that has to put that together that's what's kind of unique about our data collection system uh and then on the software side having people that are experienced in this industry i've spent a career in this industry um many of my my sea- lev team are from that side we've done an implementation i think that is really unique in the ai uh using not just the rf uh data capture capability but also the the vision systems that we overlay with it so um it's really kind of a an exciting and unique way that we've created a way to dynamically gather this data and then make it meaningful to an operator to get my things to the right place the right time i think that's what investors want to hear is what kind of demand is out there and what kind of success are you seeing with your clients clearly you're seeing some growth already but what's the benefit to the customers that you're serving and what kind of demand are you seeing from that pool of customers i've never had a company like this that has such a u a high hit rate normally when you're calling out you're in single-digit percentages about demand generation activities and number of contacts we've been ping in the percentages and i i don't want to over quote it here and get in trouble but so many people are looking for a way to do this better and that's a combination of two things one is they they understand the inefficiencies in their process they're losing things they're having unreliability in the things but i think the other part is they're being driven by fear that the big retailers like amazon walmart have shown that tying their demand triggers from the front end to their backend operation is tremendously efficient and delivers value that we've never believed before i mean i i don't you're not as old as i am but i i would never have thought that i could order something online and have it show up on my doorstep the next day right that's like a miracle but we now expect that but so many enterprises in the world today they have two we lead times to fulfill an order within their own internal operations their logistics programs are still antiquated and they and they don't have a way to upgrade them to that kind of modern expectation so the cios i talk to the ceos i talk to at our customers are desperate to get those demand triggers in real time to the edge and get data from the edge to to their customers of where their things are and how they're going to be delivered and they just haven't found a good solution that rolls in a cost- effective way that has the intelligence that they want that we're seeing in the commercial world and so we hope to be the one to bring it to them uh we know there's others of course trying to get there but we think we have a unique ability to get there first another important thing for our investors is always about the financials and how the company is run to um are you finding success already at this early stage of your company i believe you said you're about three years into development yes that's right so that the financials are always difficult i mean we are basically pre-revenue as a sas company so although we've had some revenue uh we've had a lot of seed funding um having gathered more than $7 million in seed as we've gone them to the stage and then also gone off of um various grants and research programs we've done that's been the primary source of our funding but um as we build our our sas model and we're a bit of a hybrid where we have sas and and hardware what's wonderful coming to this stage is we have a backlog for our hardware orders coming in from our transactional side and on the sas side we have a base of lighthouse customers that are now growing exponentially as they add more sites and add more applications and so the foundation for growth is there and the customer pickup is there uh but our funding so far has been more pre-revenue type activities that you'd see in a typical tech startup well and you do have a new partnership with shoulder up tell us what that means for your company yeah shoulder up is our sponsor as we work through this go public uh exercise uh shoulder up is a fantastic uh group that we've enjoyed working with they have deep ties in the military um i probably should have explained earlier that in our our initial start some of our early customers were military uh projects we uh were awarded several sb programs we demonstrated logistics applications within military and they continue to be an important sector um so schrop has really helped us open more doors there and there's a huge part of our business that's that's focused there um our factory in puerto rico allows us to do made in america development of our hardware in a way that most of our competitors are sourcing from china and from countries that are not going to allow them to be in those government areas so shoulder up helps us uh open that important door shoulder up is already a a spack company that can help us also take us public and that's been helpful um so u they're not just a transactional partner they're a partner go forward that's going to help us develop our markets that we're targeting they have really good contacts in the areas that we're we're moving forward on so if it's a retail investor who's watching this right now you can't quite find your company right now to invest in but when and how will they be able to find you if they're interest in being an early investor all right so the first thing i would say is look for us on our public disclosures we have filed our initial s4s and those are available if you search for us uh you should know that our current name we're listed under is cid inc that's uh we we're transitioning the corporation as part of this uh company transition so if you search on the the sec disclosures under cid inc you'll see our current s4 which is all of our financial filings as well as the company um go forward plans in terms of being a investor um as we're in this stage um we're we're working with our sponsors with through institutionalsales will be funneled into that group so you would contact me or my cfo charlie maddox and we would uh bring you into our our institutional pipeline group well thank you so much for your time today is there anything else about your company that you'd like to share you've said a few different times um about what makes you so excited about this company compared to others you've been at and that's a question i love to ask is just why as the ceo of this company are you excited about what you are offering atai oh goodness there's so many reasons um it always starts with the people i have an exceptional management team and it's been such a joy to work with them and to have them so confident in each of their areas the departments we set up the people we' started to attract it's been wonderful to build a team and and that's always the great joy but the second part that we're seeing the adoption we are um i think we've hit the timing really really well uh it's a time where ai is is emerging and it needs to be applied to more use cases we're seeing it being applied in our our normal lives but logistics and supply chain and and asset management generally is pretty old school there's a lot of paper and clipboard out there still there's a lot of manual barcode scanning and labeling and um it's a rich field for this technology to be applied um it's a complex field no one person can manage a multi-layered supply chain and get everything to the right place at the right time uh ai is a tremendous aid for that and and i think everyone's seeing that because they're more comfortable with ai in their private life so it's a combination of the timing our technology hitting the market at the right time it's solving a real problem that's a multi-trillion dollar problem and i've got the best team i've ever had in a in a company to tackle it so i'm excited about that that is something to be excited about thank you again ed so much for your time today and for sharing a little bit more about your company with our investors you can check out the article we have on marketbeat.com with more details about this company and

captions language: en using ai to help companies keep track of their things let's dive into this new company about to go public today we are excited to have ed ne brosky the ceo ofai corporation with us to share more about his company ed thank you so much for your time today thanks for inviting us we're excited to tell our story let's start out with what isai we started about three years ago and we developed a new way of collecting data at the edge of the enterprise we um we kind of invented that in the basement as most startups do and we started working on that actually in the autonomous vehicle market we were looking at ways of using cooperative markers to interact with um traffic signs urban canyons and cities and things like that but the technology we developed there really became more applicable to uh logistics and manufacturing and and um asset tracking type technology and so we started transition into that space um the software we were veloping at the time also we realized the advantage of ai was much more powerful in these kind of multi-layered complex systems and so about two years ago we migrated the company much more towards logistics and asset management and and that's really where we found a home and found great traction so uh that's what we are today wonderful so let's start with who are your customers who who uses your product well that's the problem with assets uh we all have things right i like to talk about the the internet of things but let's talk about the things customers are everything from consumers who have things all the way up to large enterprises that have things we all want to know where our things are how many things we have are our things getting to the right place at the right time so anyone that has that kind of concern is one of our customers now we target enterprise class customers that have multiple locations that are really concerned about their things and so uh large customers that are in the retail sector uh manufacturing is one of our biggest sectors that are moving a lot of things a lot of times through processes uh logistics uh shipping companies the military has been a big deal for us they have a lot of things moving all the time um anyone who's got to manage their things is is our customer it sounds like that would take a team of software developers who are some of the people you have working for your team and and talk a little bit about where you are located around the world oh yeah we've uh we've assembled an amazing team i've done a number of startups in the past but i'm really proud of the team that we have our cto is vj nambiar he came to us from verizon we recruited him specifically he was leading their 5g team to veling 5g routers in fact if you're using a verizon 5g router that was probably vian's work when he was there at at verizon um so he's an expert in that area uh v jan has got our embedded team here in shirley massachusetts that's where i'm broadcasting from today i'm here in the lab with our launch party getting our our dfm group ready to launch our new product here for the fourth quarter we've got a brand new revolutionary patent pending bridge that we're launching and that's i'm here doing so shirley massachusetts just outs side of boston is our technical headquarters where the r&amp;d really happens um a lot of our software is programmed here from the embedded and device driver side but then we also have our web services and cloud operations over in india in bangalore and we have a large team there uh the hardware that we design for our edge systems is actually manufactured in puerto rico we have our own hardware manufacturing facility there just outside of san juan and actually the puerto rican team is up here with me this week as we prepare for this launch uh so that's a fantastic facility i work mostly out of the bethesda office we have a washington dc administrative office office that's where all of our accounting and legal and uh compliance work happens um the sales department would call that the overhead group and then of course we have our our headquarters over in las vegas in our headquarters we're actually co-located with one of our large distributors and we call it our western experience center that's where our customers can come and see our technology working in a warehouse environment where we move things around where we we change things um we use that as our training center for all of our distribution partners and channel partners as well as our salespeople so our go to market headquarters is collocated there with our admin center in vegas where it's very easy to get people to fly to vegas and come for training that's a big wide footprint kind of all over the place let's talk about the

that we're not just an rfid company supplying the rfid we're we're marrying it with the vision systems and the ai backend that allows that data to be useful in the workflow so the combination of having the ai software as well as a really unique edge data collection system is what lets us develop value or deliver value that other companies really can't we find a lot of our competitors are kind of one trick ponies that are focused either on the software or on the data collection system but they struggle to get the both married together into a way that adds the value and maybe i can elaborate on one part of that so when you think about edge collection uh edge data collection um we think often about either a manual process like barcode scanning or we think about a very expensive of infrastructure like portals you know antennas that are scanning through pinch points um what we've developed is is something that you could think of like an apple air tag where an iphone that's traveling through an enterprise can pick up your air tag and report its location we've developed mobile readers that are battery powered that can go on your pallets on your forklifts on your totes and as it goes through your enterprise it picks up these other tags and these other items um very seamlessly very inexpensively without having an engineer on site that has to put that together that's what's kind of unique about our data collection system uh and then on the software side having people that are experienced in this industry i've spent a career in this industry um many of my my sea- lev team are from that side we've done an implementation i think that is really unique in the ai uh using not just the rf uh data capture capability but also the the vision systems that we overlay with it so um it's really kind of a an exciting and unique way that we've created a way to dynamically gather this data and then make it meaningful to an operator to get my things to the right place the right time i think that's what investors want to hear is what kind of demand is out there and what kind of success are you seeing with your clients clearly you're seeing some growth already but what's the benefit to the customers that you're serving and what kind of demand are you seeing from that pool of customers i've never had a company like this that has such a u a high hit rate normally when you're calling out you're in single-digit percentages about demand generation activities and number of contacts we've been ping in the percentages and i i don't want to over quote it here and get in trouble but so many people are looking for a way to do this better and that's a combination of two things one is they they understand the inefficiencies in their process they're losing things they're having unreliability in the things but i think the other part is they're being driven by fear that the big retailers like amazon walmart have shown that tying their demand triggers from the front end to their backend operation is tremendously efficient and delivers value that we've never believed before i mean i i don't you're not as old as i am but i i would never have thought that i could order something online and have it show up on my doorstep the next day right that's like a miracle but we now expect that but so many enterprises in the world today they have two we lead times to fulfill an order within their own internal operations their logistics programs are still antiquated and they and they don't have a way to upgrade them to that kind of modern expectation so the cios i talk to the ceos i talk to at our customers are desperate to get those demand triggers in real time to the edge and get data from the edge to to their customers of where their things are and how they're going to be delivered and they just haven't found a good solution that rolls in a cost- effective way that has the intelligence that they want that we're seeing in the commercial world and so we hope to be the one to bring it to them uh we know there's others of course trying to get there but we think we have a unique ability to get there first another important thing for our investors is always about the financials and how the company is run to um are you finding success already at this early stage of your company i believe you said you're about three years into development yes that's right so that the financials are always difficult i mean we are basically pre-revenue as a sas company so although we've had some revenue uh we've had a lot of seed funding um having gathered more than $7 million in seed as we've gone them to the stage and then also gone off of um various grants and research programs we've done that's been the primary source of our funding but um as we build our our sas model and we're a bit of a hybrid where we have sas and and hardware what's wonderful coming to this stage is we have a backlog for our hardware orders coming in from our transactional side and on the sas side we have a base of lighthouse customers that are now growing exponentially as they add more sites and add more applications and so the foundation for growth is there and the customer pickup is there uh but our funding so far has been more pre-revenue type activities that you'd see in a typical tech startup well and you do have a new partnership with shoulder up tell us what that means for your company yeah shoulder up is our sponsor as we work through this go public uh exercise uh shoulder up is a fantastic uh group that we've enjoyed working with they have deep ties in the military um i probably should have explained earlier that in our our initial start some of our early customers were military uh projects we uh were awarded several sb programs we demonstrated logistics applications within military and they continue to be an important sector um so schrop has really helped us open more doors there and there's a huge part of our business that's that's focused there um our factory in puerto rico allows us to do made in america development of our hardware in a way that most of our competitors are sourcing from china and from countries that are not going to allow them to be in those government areas so shoulder up helps us uh open that important door shoulder up is already a a spack company that can help us also take us public and that's been helpful um so u they're not just a transactional partner they're a partner go forward that's going to help us develop our markets that we're targeting they have really good contacts in the areas that we're we're moving forward on so if it's a retail investor who's watching this right now you can't quite find your company right now to invest in but when and how will they be able to find you if they're interest in being an early investor all right so the first thing i would say is look for us on our public disclosures we have filed our initial s4s and those are available if you search for us uh you should know that our current name we're listed under is cid inc that's uh we we're transitioning the corporation as part of this uh company transition so if you search on the the sec disclosures under cid inc you'll see our current s4 which is all of our financial filings as well as the company um go forward plans in terms of being a investor um as we're in this stage um we're we're working with our sponsors with through institutionalsales will be funneled into that group so you would contact me or my cfo charlie maddox and we would uh bring you into our our institutional pipeline group well thank you so much for your time today is there anything else about your company that you'd like to share you've said a few different times um about what makes you so excited about this company compared to others you've been at and that's a question i love to ask is just why as the ceo of this company are you excited about what you are offering atai oh goodness there's so many reasons um it always starts with the people i have an exceptional management team and it's been such a joy to work with them and to have them so confident in each of their areas the departments we set up the people we' started to attract it's been wonderful to build a team and and that's always the great joy but the second part that we're seeing the adoption we are um i think we've hit the timing really really well uh it's a time where ai is is emerging and it needs to be applied to more use cases we're seeing it being applied in our our normal lives but logistics and supply chain and and asset management generally is pretty old school there's a lot of paper and clipboard out there still there's a lot of manual barcode scanning and labeling and um it's a rich field for this technology to be applied um it's a complex field no one person can manage a multi-layered supply chain and get everything to the right place at the right time uh ai is a tremendous aid for that and and i think everyone's seeing that because they're more comfortable with ai in their private life so it's a combination of the timing our technology hitting the market at the right time it's solving a real problem that's a multi-trillion dollar problem and i've got the best team i've ever had in a in a company to tackle it so i'm excited about that that is something to be excited about thank you again ed so much for your time today and for sharing a little bit more about your company with our investors you can check out the article we have on marketbeat.com with more details about this company and

captions language: en using ai to help companies keep track of their things let's dive into this new company about to go public today we are excited to have ed ne brosky the ceo ofai corporation with us to share more about his company ed thank you so much for your time today thanks for inviting us we're excited to tell our story let's start out with what isai we started about three years ago and we developed a new way of collecting data at the edge of the enterprise we um we kind of invented that in the basement as most startups do and we started working on that actually in the autonomous vehicle market we were looking at ways of using cooperative markers to interact with um traffic signs urban canyons and cities and things like that but the technology we developed there really became more applicable to uh logistics and manufacturing and and um asset tracking type technology and so we started transition into that space um the software we were veloping at the time also we realized the advantage of ai was much more powerful in these kind of multi-layered complex systems and so about two years ago we migrated the company much more towards logistics and asset management and and that's really where we found a home and found great traction so uh that's what we are today wonderful so let's start with who are your customers who who uses your product well that's the problem with assets uh we all have things right i like to talk about the the internet of things but let's talk about the things customers are everything from consumers who have things all the way up to large enterprises that have things we all want to know where our things are how many things we have are our things getting to the right place at the right time so anyone that has that kind of concern is one of our customers now we target enterprise class customers that have multiple locations that are really concerned about their things and so uh large customers that are in the retail sector uh manufacturing is one of our biggest sectors that are moving a lot of things a lot of times through processes uh logistics uh shipping companies the military has been a big deal for us they have a lot of things moving all the time um anyone who's got to manage their things is is our customer it sounds like that would take a team of software developers who are some of the people you have working for your team and and talk a little bit about where you are located around the world oh yeah we've uh we've assembled an amazing team i've done a number of startups in the past but i'm really proud of the team that we have our cto is vj nambiar he came to us from verizon we recruited him specifically he was leading their 5g team to veling 5g routers in fact if you're using a verizon 5g router that was probably vian's work when he was there at at verizon um so he's an expert in that area uh v jan has got our embedded team here in shirley massachusetts that's where i'm broadcasting from today i'm here in the lab with our launch party getting our our dfm group ready to launch our new product here for the fourth quarter we've got a brand new revolutionary patent pending bridge that we're launching and that's i'm here doing so shirley massachusetts just outs side of boston is our technical headquarters where the r&amp;d really happens um a lot of our software is programmed here from the embedded and device driver side but then we also have our web services and cloud operations over in india in bangalore and we have a large team there uh the hardware that we design for our edge systems is actually manufactured in puerto rico we have our own hardware manufacturing facility there just outside of san juan and actually the puerto rican team is up here with me this week as we prepare for this launch uh so that's a fantastic facility i work mostly out of the bethesda office we have a washington dc administrative office office that's where all of our accounting and legal and uh compliance work happens um the sales department would call that the overhead group and then of course we have our our headquarters over in las vegas in our headquarters we're actually co-located with one of our large distributors and we call it our western experience center that's where our customers can come and see our technology working in a warehouse environment where we move things around where we we change things um we use that as our training center for all of our distribution partners and channel partners as well as our salespeople so our go to market headquarters is collocated there with our admin center in vegas where it's very easy to get people to fly to vegas and come for training that's a big wide footprint kind of all over the place let's talk about the growth that you're experiencing as a company right now and the recent announcement that just came out too yes so we're we're taking our company public which is really exciting um we'll be on the nasdaq we hope by the end of the year we're working our way through that we've been going through the various filings and compliance uh but we're on schedule for you know an endof year transition to that public company we need that cash to really finance the growth that we're seeing we've already started with some lighthouse customers that are very large multinational billion dollar corporations multi-billion dollar corporations that want to base their systems on our technology and so we've done initial pilots we've started working through initial sites but uh this explosive growth needs to be funded as we go international uh we'll be founding more locations in europe in particular as well as southeast asia and um we'll be advancing a lot of our channel programs through that that funding the technology we do needs a lot of work as well i mean we've got our base system working but there's so much to be done with ai and with uh image processing that we're working with some of our chip developments we've done with our patented passive microwave technology that this go public move is a chance to give us the rocket fuel we need to really take the system into a new generation of of performance as well as support uh for our customers around the world there's so much conversation around the world about ai and so many new companies like yours popping up because of the new developments in ai let's talk about competition in this field a little bit are there other competitors out there who are doing something similar to what you're doing or are you really unique in this space well everyone's going to tell you they think they're unique but i've got a a long history i've worked for decades in the rfid and auto id business um and so i understand the systems that are there now and i guess i can boil this downbridge into two problems so applying ai to logistics is relatively easy because ai engines are now available and the technology become more and more refined but the difficulty in applying i logistics is the data isn't there it's very difficult and expensive to get data from all these things that move today we hire a lot of operators do barcode scanning where you put very expensive portals or infrastructured antennas up and that doesn't give us the richness of data you really need to drive an intelligent ai implementation what's unique about us is

in trouble but so many people are looking for a way to do this better and that's a combination of two things one is they they understand the inefficiencies in their process they're losing things they're having unreliability in the things but i think the other part is they're being driven by fear that the big retailers like amazon walmart have shown that tying their demand triggers from the front end to their backend operation is tremendously efficient and delivers value that we've never believed before i mean i i don't you're not as old as i am but i i would never have thought that i could order something online and have it show up on my doorstep the next day right that's like a miracle but we now expect that but so many enterprises in the world today they have two we lead times to fulfill an order within their own internal operations their logistics programs are still antiquated and they and they don't have a way to upgrade them to that kind of modern expectation so the cios i talk to the ceos i talk to at our customers are desperate to get those demand triggers in real time to the edge and get data from the edge to to their customers of where their things are and how they're going to be delivered and they just haven't found a good solution that rolls in a cost- effective way that has the intelligence that they want that we're seeing in the commercial world and so we hope to be the one to bring it to them uh we know there's others of course trying to get there but we think we have a unique ability to get there first another important thing for our investors is always about the financials and how the company is run to um are you finding success already at this early stage of your company i believe you said you're about three years into development yes that's right so that the financials are always difficult i mean we are basically pre-revenue as a sas company so although we've had some revenue uh we've had a lot of seed funding um having gathered more than $7 million in seed as we've gone them to the stage and then also gone off of um various grants and research programs we've done that's been the primary source of our funding but um as we build our our sas model and we're a bit of a hybrid where we have sas and and hardware what's wonderful coming to this stage is we have a backlog for our hardware orders coming in from our transactional side and on the sas side we have a base of lighthouse customers that are now growing exponentially as they add more sites and add more applications and so the foundation for growth is there and the customer pickup is there uh but our funding so far has been more pre-revenue type activities that you'd see in a typical tech startup well and you do have a new partnership with shoulder up tell us what that means for your company yeah shoulder up is our sponsor as we work through this go public uh exercise uh shoulder up is a fantastic uh group that we've enjoyed working with they have deep ties in the military um i probably should have explained earlier that in our our initial start some of our early customers were military uh projects we uh were awarded several sb programs we demonstrated logistics applications within military and they continue to be an important sector um so schrop has really helped us open more doors there and there's a huge part of our business that's that's focused there um our factory in puerto rico allows us to do made in america development of our hardware in a way that most of our competitors are sourcing from china and from countries that are not going to allow them to be in those government areas so shoulder up helps us uh open that important door shoulder up is already a a spack company that can help us also take us public and that's been helpful um so u they're not just a transactional partner they're a partner go forward that's going to help us develop our markets that we're targeting they have really good contacts in the areas that we're we're moving forward on so if it's a retail investor who's watching this right now you can't quite find your company right now to invest in but when and how will they be able to find you if they're interest in being an early investor all right so the first thing i would say is look for us on our public disclosures we have filed our initial s4s and those are available if you search for us uh you should know that our current name we're listed under is cid inc that's uh we we're transitioning the corporation as part of this uh company transition so if you search on the the sec disclosures under cid inc you'll see our current s4 which is all of our financial filings as well as the company um go forward plans in terms of being a investor um as we're in this stage um we're we're working with our sponsors with through institutionalsales will be funneled into that group so you would contact me or my cfo charlie maddox and we would uh bring you into our our institutional pipeline group well thank you so much for your time today is there anything else about your company that you'd like to share you've said a few different times um about what makes you so excited about this company compared to others you've been at and that's a question i love to ask is just why as the ceo of this company are you excited about what you are offering atai oh goodness there's so many reasons um it always starts with the people i have an exceptional management team and it's been such a joy to work with them and to have them so confident in each of their areas the departments we set up the people we' started to attract it's been wonderful to build a team and and that's always the great joy but the second part that we're seeing the adoption we are um i think we've hit the timing really really well uh it's a time where ai is is emerging and it needs to be applied to more use cases we're seeing it being applied in our our normal lives but logistics and supply chain and and asset management generally is pretty old school there's a lot of paper and clipboard out there still there's a lot of manual barcode scanning and labeling and um it's a rich field for this technology to be applied um it's a complex field no one person can manage a multi-layered supply chain and get everything to the right place at the right time uh ai is a tremendous aid for that and and i think everyone's seeing that because they're more comfortable with ai in their private life so it's a combination of the timing our technology hitting the market at the right time it's solving a real problem that's a multi-trillion dollar problem and i've got the best team i've ever had in a in a company to tackle it so i'm excited about that that is something to be excited about thank you again ed so much for your time today and for sharing a little bit more about your company with our investors you can check out the article we have on marketbeat.com with more details about this company and

captions language: en using ai to help companies keep track of their things let's dive into this new company about to go public today we are excited to have ed ne brosky the ceo ofai corporation with us to share more about his company ed thank you so much for your time today thanks for inviting us we're excited to tell our story let's start out with what isai we started about three years ago and we developed a new way of collecting data at the edge of the enterprise we um we kind of invented that in the basement as most startups do and we started working on that actually in the autonomous vehicle market we were looking at ways of using cooperative markers to interact with um traffic signs urban canyons and cities and things like that but the technology we developed there really became more applicable to uh logistics and manufacturing and and um asset tracking type technology and so we started transition into that space um the software we were veloping at the time also we realized the advantage of ai was much more powerful in these kind of multi-layered complex systems and so about two years ago we migrated the company much more towards logistics and asset management and and that's really where we found a home and found great traction so uh that's what we are today wonderful so let's start with who are your customers who who uses your product well that's the problem with assets uh we all have things right i like to talk about the the internet of things but let's talk about the things customers are everything from consumers who have things all the way up to large enterprises that have things we all want to know where our things are how many things we have are our things getting to the right place at the right time so anyone that has that kind of concern is one of our customers now we target enterprise class customers that have multiple locations that are really concerned about their things and so uh large customers that are in the retail sector uh manufacturing is one of our biggest sectors that are moving a lot of things a lot of times through processes uh logistics uh shipping companies the military has been a big deal for us they have a lot of things moving all the time um anyone who's got to manage their things is is our customer it sounds like that would take a team of software developers who are some of the people you have working for your team and and talk a little bit about where you are located around the world oh yeah we've uh we've assembled an amazing team i've done a number of startups in the past but i'm really proud of the team that we have our cto is vj nambiar he came to us from verizon we recruited him specifically he was leading their 5g team to veling 5g routers in fact if you're using a verizon 5g router that was probably vian's work when he was there at at verizon um so he's an expert in that area uh v jan has got our embedded team here in shirley massachusetts that's where i'm broadcasting from today i'm here in the lab with our launch party getting our our dfm group ready to launch our new product here for the fourth quarter we've got a brand new revolutionary patent pending bridge that we're launching and that's i'm here doing so shirley massachusetts just outs side of boston is our technical headquarters where the r&amp;d really happens um a lot of our software is programmed here from the embedded and device driver side but then we also have our web services and cloud operations over in india in bangalore and we have a large team there uh the hardware that we design for our edge systems is actually manufactured in puerto rico we have our own hardware manufacturing facility there just outside of san juan and actually the puerto rican team is up here with me this week as we prepare for this launch uh so that's a fantastic facility i work mostly out of the bethesda office we have a washington dc administrative office office that's where all of our accounting and legal and uh compliance work happens um the sales department would call that the overhead group and then of course we have our our headquarters over in las vegas in our headquarters we're actually co-located with one of our large distributors and we call it our western experience center that's where our customers can come and see our technology working in a warehouse environment where we move things around where we we change things um we use that as our training center for all of our distribution partners and channel partners as well as our salespeople so our go to market headquarters is collocated there with our admin center in vegas where it's very easy to get people to fly to vegas and come for training that's a big wide footprint kind of all over the place let's talk about the growth that you're experiencing as a company right now and the recent announcement that just came out too yes so we're we're taking our company public which is really exciting um we'll be on the nasdaq we hope by the end of the year we're working our way through that we've been going through the various filings and compliance uh but we're on schedule for you know an endof year transition to that public company we need that cash to really finance the growth that we're seeing we've already started with some lighthouse customers that are very large multinational billion dollar corporations multi-billion dollar corporations that want to base their systems on our technology and so we've done initial pilots we've started working through initial sites but uh this explosive growth needs to be funded as we go international uh we'll be founding more locations in europe in particular as well as southeast asia and um we'll be advancing a lot of our channel programs through that that funding the technology we do needs a lot of work as well i mean we've got our base system working but there's so much to be done with ai and with uh image processing that we're working with some of our chip developments we've done with our patented passive microwave technology that this go public move is a chance to give us the rocket fuel we need to really take the system into a new generation of of performance as well as support uh for our customers around the world there's so much conversation around the world about ai and so many new companies like yours popping up because of the new developments in ai let's talk about competition in this field a little bit are there other competitors out there who are doing something similar to what you're doing or are you really unique in this space well everyone's going to tell you they think they're unique but i've got a a long history i've worked for decades in the rfid and auto id business um and so i understand the systems that are there now and i guess i can boil this downbridge into two problems so applying ai to logistics is relatively easy because ai engines are now available and the technology become more and more refined but the difficulty in applying i logistics is the data isn't there it's very difficult and expensive to get data from all these things that move today we hire a lot of operators do barcode scanning where you put very expensive portals or infrastructured antennas up and that doesn't give us the richness of data you really need to drive an intelligent ai implementation what's unique about us is that we're not just an rfid company supplying the rfid we're we're marrying it with the vision systems and the ai backend that allows that data to be useful in the workflow so the combination of having the ai software as well as a really unique edge data collection system is what lets us develop value or deliver value that other companies really can't we find a lot of our competitors are kind of one trick ponies that are focused either on the software or on the data collection system but they struggle to get the both married together into a way that adds the value and maybe i can elaborate on one part of that so when you think about edge collection uh edge data collection um we think often about either a manual process like barcode scanning or we think about a very expensive of infrastructure like portals you know antennas that are scanning through pinch points um what we've developed is is something that you could think of like an apple air tag where an iphone that's traveling through an enterprise can pick up your air tag and report its location we've developed mobile readers that are battery powered that can go on your pallets on your forklifts on your totes and as it goes through your enterprise it picks up these other tags and these other items um very seamlessly very inexpensively without having an engineer on site that has to put that together that's what's kind of unique about our data collection system uh and then on the software side having people that are experienced in this industry i've spent a career in this industry um many of my my sea- lev team are from that side we've done an implementation i think that is really unique in the ai uh using not just the rf uh data capture capability but also the the vision systems that we overlay with it so um it's really kind of a an exciting and unique way that we've created a way to dynamically gather this data and then make it meaningful to an operator to get my things to the right place the right time i think that's what investors want to hear is what kind of demand is out there and what kind of success are you seeing with your clients clearly you're seeing some growth already but what's the benefit to the customers that you're serving and what kind of demand are you seeing from that pool of customers i've never had a company like this that has such a u a high hit rate normally

customer pickup is there uh but our funding so far has been more pre-revenue type activities that you'd see in a typical tech startup well and you do have a new partnership with shoulder up tell us what that means for your company yeah shoulder up is our sponsor as we work through this go public uh exercise uh shoulder up is a fantastic uh group that we've enjoyed working with they have deep ties in the military um i probably should have explained earlier that in our our initial start some of our early customers were military uh projects we uh were awarded several sb programs we demonstrated logistics applications within military and they continue to be an important sector um so schrop has really helped us open more doors there and there's a huge part of our business that's that's focused there um our factory in puerto rico allows us to do made in america development of our hardware in a way that most of our competitors are sourcing from china and from countries that are not going to allow them to be in those government areas so shoulder up helps us uh open that important door shoulder up is already a a spack company that can help us also take us public and that's been helpful um so u they're not just a transactional partner they're a partner go forward that's going to help us develop our markets that we're targeting they have really good contacts in the areas that we're we're moving forward on so if it's a retail investor who's watching this right now you can't quite find your company right now to invest in but when and how will they be able to find you if they're interest in being an early investor all right so the first thing i would say is look for us on our public disclosures we have filed our initial s4s and those are available if you search for us uh you should know that our current name we're listed under is cid inc that's uh we we're transitioning the corporation as part of this uh company transition so if you search on the the sec disclosures under cid inc you'll see our current s4 which is all of our financial filings as well as the company um go forward plans in terms of being a investor um as we're in this stage um we're we're working with our sponsors with through institutionalsales will be funneled into that group so you would contact me or my cfo charlie maddox and we would uh bring you into our our institutional pipeline group well thank you so much for your time today is there anything else about your company that you'd like to share you've said a few different times um about what makes you so excited about this company compared to others you've been at and that's a question i love to ask is just why as the ceo of this company are you excited about what you are offering atai oh goodness there's so many reasons um it always starts with the people i have an exceptional management team and it's been such a joy to work with them and to have them so confident in each of their areas the departments we set up the people we' started to attract it's been wonderful to build a team and and that's always the great joy but the second part that we're seeing the adoption we are um i think we've hit the timing really really well uh it's a time where ai is is emerging and it needs to be applied to more use cases we're seeing it being applied in our our normal lives but logistics and supply chain and and asset management generally is pretty old school there's a lot of paper and clipboard out there still there's a lot of manual barcode scanning and labeling and um it's a rich field for this technology to be applied um it's a complex field no one person can manage a multi-layered supply chain and get everything to the right place at the right time uh ai is a tremendous aid for that and and i think everyone's seeing that because they're more comfortable with ai in their private life so it's a combination of the timing our technology hitting the market at the right time it's solving a real problem that's a multi-trillion dollar problem and i've got the best team i've ever had in a in a company to tackle it so i'm excited about that that is something to be excited about thank you again ed so much for your time today and for sharing a little bit more about your company with our investors you can check out the article we have on marketbeat.com with more details about this company and many others as always thank you for joining us here on marketbeat media and happy investing [music],marketbeat media,0.9,0.0

language: en the market's reacting to a trump victory in a big way today here to break down some of the biggest moves of the market is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas we saw quite a few swings today start with the biggest one that everyone's talking about well i think tesla might have been the biggest move of the of the market today but i really think that's just a knee-jerk reaction because of elon musk's association with trump you know trump is supposed to bring a lot of tailwinds into the market potentially easing some other head wins and generally be good for the stock market and businesses but not so much for evs evs had headwinds to begin with so i don't really see trump as a fundamental mover for tesla and that plays into that last article i wrote that last video we did about you know buying the dips and selling the rips tesla certainly ripped and i would not expect it to keep going much higher after this yeah did it was it up about 14% today even more than that yeah it closed the day up about 15 % that's pretty good siiz move absolutely and that was one of many moves that we saw in the market today another big move was jp morgan why is that stock moving so much today right jp morgan also made a big double digit move and that's just because of uh the regulatory outlook i mean generally speaking trump is going to be good for regulations ranging from the financial sector through consumers which is generally good for the entire economy we seeing some definite tailwinds in regards to that help sustain jp morgan's growth um certainly help in in invigorate the merger and acquisition market you know so we'll see some more some more m&amp;a and possibly some more ipos coming up pretty soon too all right we'll move to another sector you like to talk about quite a bit and that's the russell 2000 uh that saw quite a bit of movement today too right yeah russell 2k stocks are jumping because of the business-friendly environment trump is known to be a business-friendly president uh the russell 2k also has some potential tailwinds next year because of falling interest rates add in a business-friendly president and we should really see the the rally and stocks broaden to include a lot of these small cap names yeah do you expect the bump today is just the beginning of kind of the boost in the russell 2000 i think it's just the beginning i think that we're looking at a a multi-year run in stocks ahead of us all right and now let's talk about some currency out there the us dollar we've been talking about gold a lot and bitcoin all three saw some moves today how much movement did they see well bitcoin was another double digit mover um it's up on uh the regulatory outlook you know it's uh been gaining traction with mainstream uh some republicans have been very vocal about supporting bitcoin we've got a wyoming senator trying to make wyoming be a haven for bitcoin so trump's win and what looks to be a pretty clean red sweep of all the both sides of the house or both both sides of congress and the and the white house is very positive for for bitcoin as far as gold goes it made a pretty big decline but that's looking at a stronger us economy and a stronger dollar dollar's up because of an outlook for strengthening us economic trends under trump now you wrote an article today on market.com kind of talking about what a presidency under donald trump could look like in the stock market give us some of the highlights of what your article shares well right first just looking back on his first administration as a kind of a benchmark of what's to come from the week of the election in 2015 through 2016 through the election through the election 2020 the stock market rose 20 or 70% and that was driven by deregulation lower taxes and a strong labor market which was invigorated by business strength caused by reduced regulation and reduced taxes well that's his previous presidency but another factor coming into play this year especially is the fed and inflation what do you think a trump victory could mean for that going forward well it looks like uh trump is going to be invigorating the economy and that will help sustain inflation as we move forward uh one offsetting factor is oil he's going to want us to be drilling for oil so lower oil prices could help contain inflation the risk really right now is that inflation won't fall as quickly as the fed is hoping and so instead of cutting rates quite as quickly as they've been forecasting the fed may pause and wait to see what happens with trump over the next few quarters before it really gets aggressive with cutting rates any sectors you might be concerned about that might be seen more of a dip with a trump presidency some stocks you might want to take note of were healthc care stocks um as far as the market goes most sectors and stocks were up following the election but the health care sector was notably down many of those stocks were in the red so just keep ane out for those all right some great information thomas and a lot to talk about today i'm sure going to be plenty of market moves to talk about over the next few weeks and months

stocks for under $20 here's a list of three that you may want to look at today we have market be analyst chris marot joining us with three really unique stock picks i am interested in several of these from your article chris we're going to get to those details in just a minute but first let's start with what you look at when you're trying to figure out which stocks to pick so when i'm looking for those types of stocks what i'm looking for are stocks that are trading a little bit below what the broader market's doing so that means they've got some upside to them i'm also looking for in this case with with market beat it makes it really easy because you can see what the analyst ratings are so you can see which stocks are getting these strong buy or buy ratings so i'm looking for that and i'm also looking for companies that have earnings upside coming up in like in this case in 2025 which of these companies have strong earning growth projected because that's the biggest indicator for stock price growth now a couple of the stocks on your list are what we call over-the-counter stocks explain what that term is for those who might not know right to otc markets uh it basically means that the stocks don't meet the the stringent requirements to get on a major stock exchange it does add a little bit of risk to the stock in the case of the two stocks that i have in my article that risk is primarily because they're not us-based companies so so there's a little bit of risk to investors there because they don't necessarily have to follow all of the sec guidelines although many of them choose to do so but most of these stocks not all of them but most of them and the two that i have in my article in particular are ones that investors could buy on most trading platforms wonderful well let's get right to your list and start with the first one and this is a company really all about investing right uh process is the company the the thing that i found interesting about this company and that that's kind of exciting if you're an investor is every investor wants to invest in the next new thing well that's exactly what this company does they look for the hottest trends in tech and then they either invest in the companies in some cases they actually manage the companies so you're not just getting a company that invests in emerging tech trends like e-commerce and fintech but you're also getting a company that doesn't just invest in us companies but they invest in emerging markets so we're talking about india we're talking about china in fact one of the stories about process is they just sold off or in the process of selling off some of their stake in tensent which is a which is a major chinese e-commerce giant and that's helping to propel uh what a lot of analysts see are going to be the growth for the company in the coming years well that's the thing about this company they're investing in other companies that they see potential for growth those upand cominging companies that can grow so that means upside and i think that's what every investor is looking at what kind of upside does this stock have i think it's currently trading around $8.50 and the analysts have a consensus price target of around $10.60 high price of $142 so there's significant upside at least that's what the analysts believe well this next company also uh an otc stock but definitely a company many people have heard of before yeah this is actually one i've been watching for about a year now uh it's nintendo and so many investors are familiar with it because they are consumers as well and many are gamers as well and so you know nintendo for the nintendo universe the fun characters super mario zelda all that so here's the thesis for owning the stock right now nintendo introduced the switch about seven years ago i think it was 2018 2019 in that time frame they're due to uh launch a new version of the platform the company has said that's going to start in march of 2025 so if you're thinking like an investor you want to say you want to get in on the stock before that gets launched because that's when the biggest gains in the stock are already going to be gone so if you believe that the company's going to hit that deadline now would be a great time to be investing in the stock it's got a current price of about $13 the analysts are saying it could go as high as $63 so this is a strong by stock because people are believing that once that switch platform is released you're going to start seeing a lot of these people start upgrading the plat the original switch platform that they have yeah and one more thing about nintendo that i didn't that i put my article on i didn't want to forget to say here is it's it's kind of interesting because they're kind of doing what marvel's doing they're taking their characters and they're moving them into the cinematic universe so you already saw super mario's movie there's going to be a sequel to that and there's also going to be other plans to do movies for other of the nintendo characters yeah my kids love that movie i've seen it many times and then they want all of the characters that come with it they want to dress up as bowser for halloween so yeah i see the profitability in that plan for sure um let's talk a little bit more about other stocks maybe some case studies that we've seen when there's so many companies that are dependent on a product launch people get excited for it they want to try it out do we ever see product launches flop and maybe not do quite as well as investors or analysts might be expecting you see them i i can't think of one just right off the top of my head but yes that's always the risk in stocks like this the risk for nintendo i think is not so much that the switch platform is not going to be accepted by consumers i think the risk might be that the launch gets delayed i believe it's already been delayed uh uh by about three months i think their original plan was to have it out for the holiday season this year and they had to push that back so there's always that risk that comes with it but i think in the case of nintendo i don't think analysts have to be that or investors have to be that worried about the platform not being accepted by consumers the from what i've been hearing the gaming community is very very interested in in the new switch platform coming out well and getting in on this stock at around that $13 mark it sounds like a pretty good entry point for sure let's move on to your final pick in the series and this is a topic that everyone's been talking about recently and that's gold it seems like you can't even turn on any financial news anymore without hearing about gold and in many cases it's about gold making new highs almost every day it's i think over 2700 it's near a record high as we're talking today a lot of people are forecasting that it's going to go to 3,000 by the end of the year and then even higher into 2025 and there's reasons for that i don't want to get into all of them right now but basically we're getting into the idea of as long as government continues to spend there's going to be inflationary pressures on the economy which makes gold more attractive to investors but a lot of investors don't want to invest in physical gold and there are reasons for that don't need to go into those here barrett gold is my last pick and honestly it surprised me to see the stock was still trading under under $20 but it is it's just a shade under $20 and it's a really good investment for uh for investors who are looking to get exposure to gold gold miners tend to do well as the price of gold goes up because it makes it more profitable for them to mine that's what barra's discovering they have one of the world's oldest mines they have one of the world's most productive mines uh this is a company some sometimes you can get into mining companies that offer a lot of speculative risk you don't have any of that with baric they're a rock solid company very good financials what about the upside for this stock chris just how high are analysts expecting this could go yeah analysts are forecasting a price target of uh a consensus price of 2467 and that's already about a 29% increase over what the stock's closing price is and of course there are some analysts that are projecting that stock could go even higher than that so now would be a really good time if you're thinking about getting in or you're thinking boy i really should have some exposure to gold barrack's a good way of doing that any risk with this stock when it's so dependent on the commodity price of gold will the price of gold and whatever happens with that in the next year really impact success of baric yeah i think so and and obviously bridget you're hitting on it there's the downside risk if gold prices were to drop especially if they were drop significantly then obviously the gold mining stocks become a become a lot less attractive as an investment but that's not what the forecast is right now as m most people are projecting that gold's going to enjoy a very good year in 2025 and therefore i think baric is is a very safe investment for investors yeah very good information chris and interesting picks out there that won't cost investors much to get into and worth a try for sure thanks for your

stocks for under $20 here's a list of three that you may want to look at today we have market be analyst chris marot joining us with three really unique stock picks i am interested in several of these from your article chris we're going to get to those details in just a minute but first let's start with what you look at when you're trying to figure out which stocks to pick so when i'm looking for those types of stocks what i'm looking for are stocks that are trading a little bit below what the broader market's doing so that means they've got some upside to them i'm also looking for in this case with with market beat it makes it really easy because you can see what the analyst ratings are so you can see which stocks are getting these strong buy or buy ratings so i'm looking for that and i'm also looking for companies that have earnings upside coming up in like in this case in 2025 which of these companies have strong earning growth projected because that's the biggest indicator for stock price growth now a couple of the stocks on your list are what we call over-the-counter stocks explain what that term is for those who might not know right to otc markets uh it basically means that the stocks don't meet the the stringent requirements to get on a major stock exchange it does add a little bit of risk to the stock in the case of the two stocks that i have in my article that risk is primarily because they're not us-based companies so so there's a little bit of risk to investors there because they don't necessarily have to follow all of the sec guidelines although many of them choose to do so but most of these stocks not all of them but most of them and the two that i have in my article in particular are ones that investors could buy on most trading platforms wonderful well let's get right to your list and start with the first one and this is a company really all about investing right uh process is the company the the thing that i found interesting about this company and that that's kind of exciting if you're an investor is every investor wants to invest in the next new thing well that's exactly what this company does they look for the hottest trends in tech and then they either invest in the companies in some cases they actually manage the companies so you're not just getting a company that invests in emerging tech trends like e-commerce and fintech but you're also getting a company that doesn't just invest in us companies but they invest in emerging markets so we're talking about india we're talking about china in fact one of the stories about process is they just sold off or in the process of selling off some of their stake in tensent which is a which is a major chinese e-commerce giant and that's helping to propel uh what a lot of analysts see are going to be the growth for the company in the coming years well that's the thing about this company they're investing in other companies that they see potential for growth those upand cominging companies that can grow so that means upside and i think that's what every investor is looking at what kind of upside does this stock have i think it's currently trading around $8.50 and the analysts have a consensus price target of around $10.60 high price of $142 so there's significant upside at least that's what the analysts believe well this next company also uh an otc stock but definitely a company many people have heard of before yeah this is actually one i've been watching for about a year now uh it's nintendo and so many investors are familiar with it because they are consumers as well and many are gamers as well and so you know nintendo for the nintendo universe the fun characters super mario zelda all that so here's the thesis for owning the stock right now nintendo introduced the switch about seven years ago i think it was 2018 2019 in that time frame they're due to uh launch a new version of the platform the company has said that's going to start in march of 2025 so if you're thinking like an investor you want to say you want to get in on the stock before that gets launched because that's when the biggest gains in the stock are already going to be gone so if you believe that the company's going to hit that deadline now would be a great time to be investing in the stock it's got a current price of about $13 the analysts are saying it could go as high as $63 so this is a strong by stock because people are believing that once that switch platform is released you're going to start seeing a lot of these people start upgrading the plat the original switch platform that they have yeah and one more thing about nintendo that i didn't that i put my article on i didn't want to forget to say here is it's it's kind of interesting because they're kind of doing what marvel's doing they're taking their characters and they're moving them into the cinematic universe so you already saw super mario's movie there's going to be a sequel to that and there's also going to be other plans to do movies for other of the nintendo characters yeah my kids love that movie i've seen it many times and then they want all of the characters that come with it they want to dress up as bowser for halloween so yeah i see the profitability in that plan for sure um let's talk a little bit more about other stocks maybe some case studies that we've seen when there's so many companies that are dependent on a product launch people get excited for it they want to try it out do we ever see product launches flop and maybe not do quite as well as investors or analysts might be expecting you see them i i can't think of one just right off the top of my head but yes that's always the risk in stocks like this the risk for nintendo i think is not so much that the switch platform is not going to be accepted by consumers i think the risk might be that the launch gets delayed i believe it's already been delayed uh uh by about three months i think their original plan was to have it out for the holiday season this year and they had to push that back so there's always that risk that comes with it but i think in the case of nintendo i don't think analysts have to be that or investors have to be that worried about the platform not being accepted by consumers the from what i've been hearing the gaming community is very very interested in in the new switch platform coming out well and getting in on this stock at around that $13 mark it sounds like a pretty good entry point for sure let's move on to your final pick in the series and this is a topic that everyone's been talking about recently and that's gold it seems like you can't even turn on any financial news anymore without hearing about gold and in many cases it's about gold making new highs almost every day it's i think over 2700 it's near a record high as we're talking today a lot of people are forecasting that it's going to go to 3,000 by the end of the year and then even higher into 2025 and there's reasons for that i don't want to get into all of them right now but basically we're getting into the idea of as long as government continues to spend there's going to be inflationary pressures on the economy which makes gold more attractive to investors but a lot of investors don't want to invest in physical gold and there are reasons for that don't need to go into those here barrett gold is my last pick and honestly it surprised me to see the stock was still trading under under $20 but it is it's just a shade under $20 and it's a really good investment for uh for investors who are looking to get exposure to gold gold miners tend to do well as the price of gold goes up because it makes it more profitable for them to mine that's what barra's discovering they have one of the world's oldest mines they have one of the world's most productive mines uh this is a company some sometimes you can get into mining companies that offer a lot of speculative risk you don't have any of that with baric they're a rock solid company very good financials what about the upside for this stock chris just how high are analysts expecting this could go yeah analysts are forecasting a price target of uh a consensus price of 2467 and that's already about a 29% increase over what the stock's closing price is and of course there are some analysts that are projecting that stock could go even higher than that so now would be a really good time if you're thinking about getting in or you're thinking boy i really should have some exposure to gold barrack's a good way of doing that any risk with this stock when it's so dependent on the commodity price of gold will the price of gold and whatever happens with that in the next year really impact success of baric yeah i

become a lot less attractive as an investment but that's not what the forecast is right now as m most people are projecting that gold's going to enjoy a very good year in 2025 and therefore i think

definitely a company many people have heard of before yeah this is actually one i've been watching for about a year now uh it's nintendo and so many investors are familiar with it because they are consumers as well and many are gamers as well and so you know nintendo for the nintendo universe the fun characters super mario zelda all that so here's the thesis for owning the stock right now nintendo introduced the switch about seven years ago i think it was 2018 2019 in that time frame they're due to uh launch a new version of the platform the company has said that's going to start in march of 2025 so if you're thinking like an investor you want to say you want to get in on the stock before that gets launched because that's when the biggest gains in the stock are already going to be gone so if you believe that the company's going to hit that deadline now would be a great time to be investing in the stock it's got a current price of about $13 the analysts are saying it could go as high as $63 so this is a strong by stock because people are believing that once that switch platform is released you're going to start seeing a lot of these people start upgrading the plat the original switch platform that they have yeah and one more thing about nintendo that i didn't that i put my article on i didn't want to forget to say here is it's it's kind of interesting because they're kind of doing what marvel's doing they're taking their characters and they're moving them into the cinematic universe so you already saw super mario's movie there's going to be a sequel to that and there's also going to be other plans to do movies for other of the nintendo characters yeah my kids love that movie i've seen it many times and then they want all of the characters that come with it they want to dress up as bowser for halloween so yeah i see the profitability in that plan for sure um let's talk a little bit more about other stocks maybe some case studies that we've seen when there's so many companies that are dependent on a product launch people get excited for it they want to try it out do we ever see product launches flop and maybe not do quite as well as investors or analysts might be expecting you see them i i can't think of one just right off the top of my head but yes that's always the risk in stocks like this the risk for nintendo i think is not so much that the switch platform is not going to be accepted by consumers i think the risk might be that the launch gets delayed i believe it's already been delayed uh uh by about three months i think their original plan was to have it out for the holiday season this year and they had to push that back so there's always that risk that comes with it but i think in the case of nintendo i don't think analysts have to be that or investors have to be that worried about the platform not being accepted by consumers the from what i've been hearing the gaming community is very very interested in in the new switch platform coming out well and getting in on this stock at around that $13 mark it sounds like a pretty good entry point for sure let's move on to your final pick in the series and this is a topic that everyone's been talking about recently and that's gold it seems like you can't even turn on any financial news anymore without hearing about gold and in many cases it's about gold making new highs almost every day it's i think over 2700 it's near a record high as we're talking today a lot of people are forecasting that it's going to go to 3,000 by the end of the year and then even higher into 2025 and there's reasons for that i don't want to get into all of them right now but basically we're getting into the idea of as long as government continues to spend there's going to be inflationary pressures on the economy which makes gold more attractive to investors but a lot of investors don't want to invest in physical gold and there are reasons for that don't need to go into those here barrett gold is my last pick and honestly it surprised me to see the stock was still trading under under $20 but it is it's just a shade under $20 and it's a really good investment for uh for investors who are looking to get exposure to gold gold miners tend to do well as the price of gold goes up because it makes it more profitable for them to mine that's what barra's discovering they have one of the world's oldest mines they have one of the world's most productive mines uh this is a company some sometimes you can get into mining companies that offer a lot of speculative risk you don't have any of that with baric they're a rock solid company very good financials what about the upside for this stock chris just how high are analysts expecting this could go yeah analysts are forecasting a price target of uh a consensus price of 2467 and that's already about a 29% increase over what the stock's closing price is and of course there are some analysts that are projecting that stock could go even higher than that so now would be a really good time if you're thinking about getting in or you're thinking boy i really should have some exposure to gold barrack's a good way of doing that any risk with this stock when it's so dependent on the commodity price of gold will the price of gold and whatever happens with that in the next year really impact success of baric yeah i think so and and obviously bridget you're hitting on it there's the downside risk if gold prices were to drop especially if they were drop significantly then obviously the gold mining stocks become a become a lot less attractive as an investment but that's not what the forecast is right now as m most people are projecting that gold's going to enjoy a very good year in 2025 and therefore i think baric is is a very safe investment for investors yeah very good information chris and interesting picks out there that won't cost investors much to get into and worth a try for sure thanks for your time today chris and thank you for joining us for this video you can find other unique stock picks right here on our channel market beat media thanks for watching and as always happy investing

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,ls4K-lIY-8Y,MarketBeat,2024-11-01 16:45:03+00:00,Energy Vault Stock Soars 100%: CEO Shares Why in MarketBeat Exclusive,kind: captions language: en today we are excited to launch a brand new ceo series where we're talking to the heads of some companies you may not have heard of but could add some big momentum for your portfolio let's dive in today we are very excited to have robert picone the ceo of energy vault with us to talk about their exciting innovation in the renewable energy field and like most companies robert your company really started off by kind of solving a problem the industry was facing and that's storage share a little bit more about what energy vault does sure thank you virgin pleasure to make some time here and pleasure to meet you we focus on energy storage and we're founded with a mission around broadly decarbonization but very specific to solving a problem around the intermittency of wind and solar uh and enabling essentially what's intermittent power resources uh solar when the sun shining wind when the wind is blowing and storing that energy um to be discharged uh at times when there's high demand so we look at providing uh economic and sustainable energy storage solutions uh and we can provide them uh in a mechanism and through a software platform to integrate various terms of technology uh because there is no let's say silver bullet there's different applications and use cases and different technologies have different econ e omic profiles to solve those so we um utilize a very sophisticated energy management system and software platform to be able to deliver our own proprietary energy storage solutions as well as integrate other energy storage solutions in the market yeah you are a company that's also built on ai or at least utilizing it talk about what sets energy vaults storage solutions apart from maybe some other competitors in this field i think one thing that's very unique about us versus any other provider is is we do support multiple durations and multiple technologies so most energy storage companies will focus on for example lithium ion and the short duration market of two to four hours others uh have developed long duration technologies like like we have that's focused on eight hours to 12 hours um and even others are looking at developing much longer term even 100h hour batteries for example for longer or ultra long duration so what's unique about energy vault is that we um develop solutions to serve all of those markets through the development of our innovative software platform so um that's something that is unique to us and and something that also allows us to be a stronger partner of various customer sets whether that be public utilities uh that can be independent power providers or even um can be large industrial energy users um because we can sit with them understand what problem they're trying to solve and match the appropriate technology to it and deliver it and deliver that uh availability of power and we guarantee that through our software platform um so i'd say that's a primary differentiator um and i i think another secondary differentiator for us is we've been in the market now across many regions of the world in in deploying projects so in the us market in the china market with our gravity solution which is long duration we've gotten started in australia and just announced a full gigawatt hour project for example uh just uh one week ago it's a very interesting for us because we have a definitely a global view on what's happening and have even announced um licensed deals with our long duration gravity technology in 16 uh states in south africa um for example uh and just to complete the circle we just announced with petross in brazil at our last earnings a first gravity system for long duration there so i think this second area of both being global um and and actually implementing projects and delivering projects as a young company is uh also sets us apart absolutely definitely finding success across the globe that announcement with australia partnership last week help to boost your stock price a little bit but i think our investors are definitely interested in hearing about the long-term commercialization plans what is it going to take to get these products in more countries what's your plan as a company for that it's it's the right question question bridget especially for investors uh because we uh in our first year of revenue at 148 million so delivered pretty much right on what we said in our plan we had a a a nice second year where we more than double that growth um so we did almost almost 4 170 million in our first two years and have guided this next two years meaning this year and the next year at 500 to 700 million another large growth but i think investors really want to see that backlog fill up of projects hence to your point of the one gwatt hour in australia which we bounced at $350 million us plus uh as a as a single project um i think investors want to see that show up in the backlog formally now as we progress so they can get visibility into just the execution of those projects which will generate that revenue and also deliver on what we've also formally guided we did this at our first analyst and investor day uh in may earlier this year but we also guided on being ful year cash flow neida positive uh in what would be our third full calendar year having revenue and and as a public company so that's a a nice growth profile i think for us to have and and to get and achieve that uh here in our third um third year which will be next year in 2025 uh and and just seeing these announcements now come is what's driving some of that recent uptick in the in the stock because there's that confidence now that uh investors to enter when it becomes now just a matter of just execution of projects and that's one thing we've been very good at and and also done them very quickly and with quality across the board we delivered over a gigawatt hour in in 2023 and have um more projects now that we'll be delivering and uh and those have gone very well yeah you're just a couple weeks ahead of your next earnings reports will there be more project announcements coming or anything you can give a sneak peek to some of our investors yeah we're in a blackout period right now here before our earnings which which are coming up on uh on the 12th of november it's about a week later this year due to the due to the election but you know generally we'll be giving updates on uh on projects as well as on our guidance for the remaining part of the year now that we're going to be approaching almost mid november so we've got pretty good visibility into where we're going to be and um and we'll see also what we're going to be saying about the next year typically we do our q4 earnings in february later later in february where we would then give our formal guidance on a on an annual basis uh but uh i think we'll be able to talk about what these recent deals that we're announcing um will mean in terms of our plan for next year so we're looking looking forward to that let's go a little broader and talk about your industry as a whole what kind of growth opportunities and demand are we seeing in the energy storage industry yeah well it's it's large just and uh and large because of the the new renewables that are becoming more and more part of the grid and therefore the need to complement that with storage it's large because some countries like the united states have put in place incentives to be able to apply not only as historically to wind and solar on projects but now to storage via investment tax credits but also other incentives that was put in place under the inflation reduction act that um sought to incent localized or domestic content as well as incenting uh investment in communities where the uh the the employment may be lower than other communities and therefore around job creation so i think that's another um uh impetus that we're seeing and and other countries have followed suit to that and then generally the third thing i'd mention here which is very topical now especially in the us and and now becoming topical in other parts the world i i i met with the the minister uh in victoria the minister of energy there in australia about this uh topic of the hyperscalers and the demand on power and what's happening not only with generative ai i know that's getting a lot of the focus for the data center growth but actually a lot of that growth in need is coming from a lot of the applications now being developed natively for the cloud so you combine those factors and and you know the us specifically it's it's a very difficult lineup power uh now and you've seen some of the headlines so i think this this third area of growth is just around um also the need for storage to complement renewable as a power source um that's going to be serving this tremendous growth and power demand from the hyperscalers yeah getting more energy to the grid is a constant topic we cover here because it affects so many companies and especially the growth in many many profitable companies out there right now let's talk about a little bit more just about the risks that are in this industry we're hearing a lot about nuclear power and some of those big data centers partnering and turning towards nuclear are there any other factors like that that could impact the future of renewable energy and storage that you provide yeah sure certainly uh i think given that power demand a lot of the the larger companies the the so-called magna companies so ma microsoft apple um you know google or alphabet and and the larger groups and hyperscalers um they are looking at clean ways to meet that demand and having the large balance sheets they have to invest um you know interestingly what microsoft did my island um you know these are things i think two years ago we would just have never foreseen i'd say even a year ago they were um you know we we just recently i i think this year have seen this this massive uptick in in power demand so i think all of those things will have an impact on our ability to meet the power demand and uh what i can share is that from from our perspective i think meeting that with clean energy is fundamental um uh there is um this push in just securing any power including you know a lot of the natural gas because it is abundant in the country and uh of course that's fossil driven so i think there's a a balance here that um is going to have to be struck uh here so we don't start heating the planet up at a at a very steep rate again and that's going to be solved through a combination of technology some we see today by the way bridgid and some are coming uh getting some of the carbon capture technologies deployed for example the advancements in energy transmission meaning to reduce the the loss of that over over long distances uh and having certain parts of the world where there's abundant solar be able to serve through this distribution other parts of the world where there's that demand a lot of things you know evolving here it's a very evolving industry for sure now rob i wanted to ask this question you've been a part of a lot of fortune 5 or fortune 100 companies out there what makes you excited specifically about helping to lead energy vault in this season where there's all kinds of developments in the world of energy yeah well i think anytime you work and have worked for a larger company uh by n just by definition of its size typically they're global uh so i would say say uh you know that experience that i had in working early on in my career which i started actually in oil and gas and then in the later 90s uh as this little thing called the internet took off got into networking and and software and security and in various companies along the way and seeing how that technology how it evolved and the impact it had in um how businesses were run and how fundamental economics were achieved and how efficiencies were gained and to see that manifest itself in different regions of the world that that absolutely those experiences have supported what we're doing here at energy vault from the very beginning and this has been a this has been such a um you know such an amazing experience for me having started being one of a few people to start this company is a founder uh with bill gross from ide lab so out of pasadena based ide lab and then to build it through the rounds of funding and taking it public and just the dynamics of the last you know three to four years having something like co that that sort of brought the world to its knees at one point uh and then coming out of that with a a focus again on on renewables and and getting those deployed and and the dynamics we have today it's uh been a fascinating experience but for sure i'm i'm most excited about the potential impact that we can have as a company uh on on the world and the global dynamics and around renewable storage um and supporting um you know supporting sustainable ways to make the clean energy transition good i think there's plenty of investors out there who care about the renewable energy sources and want to invest in that now we do have other investors who are all about the dollars and the numbers and that balance sheet um what are some facts about the company and the way it's being run financially that you're proud of that you think investors would be interested to hear yeah i think right off the bat i i'd say that we've um managed our investors cash well meaning uh we've built the company and have taken actions to also have a very efficient cost structure proactively um we've not put any debt on the company so we're debt-free uh which makes it um you know uh i think from a management perspective you can uh have that cash to plan for growth as we've been and that's shown up in the fact that we're investing in projects and owning them so we aren't building things and then just flipping them um to to have a some immediate payback which is um you know might be a little smaller from a pure percentage or or margin perspective we're holding attractive assets on our balance sheet investing in them because the returns are much higher over the long term and investors will like that because we're going to have predictable much more predictable cash flows and streams uh versus relying on um a project based business that can be sort of lumpy quarter to quarter so typically especially is a public company um you know that that lumpiness and those dynamics quarter to quarter can be difficult for some investors um you know predictability reliability of those cash fls becomes very important so i say the fact that we've managed the cash well uh no debt in the company have not done any dilutive financings um so a lot of companies were sort of forced to do that given just the capital dynamics uh and um and these are all things i think as we've evolved the company that that investors um app appreciate and will appreciate uh and finally just the aspect of we've able to develop a solution that can adapt to the changes in the market very quickly with software meaning uh if we would have developed just a single product for example and the market shifts like in long duration things moved out a little bit um if we didn't have a platform that could adapt and allow us to deliver what customers wanted in short duration um you know we had a we would have had a much different type of growth path so i think that that innovation and flexibility and what we've built into our software um means there's more diversification for investors that invest in our company because of our unique ability to meet different technology and durations in energy storage that flexibility and innovation is already capturing attention of some big companies including that big $350 million deal you got in australia we saw lots of news coverage of that this october what does that mean and for your future as energy belt yeah i just spent a great week there and was in melbourne um where they had their all energy conference which is their largest one there and what a amazing opportunity there is there and amazing investments being there and supported by the local governments um given that the demand and the renewable buildout that's taking place so uh we were very excited to participate not only in the conference but we met with our local teams and brought a lot of our global executives there to look at um all the growth that that we see and we just announced our first project last may in australia a 400 megawatt hour with a um a group called ain uh and then just announced this second project a full gigawatt hour and just you know so much opportunity there and working in that case with a an earlier stage developer and you get those insights into a set of assets and and platform builds uh and to get involved early gives you that insight and ability to i think plan and and meet those customer needs and and make the announcements like we did so we see a tremendous opportunity there and we'll be um spending more time in building and and growing are actually going to be tripling the size of our team there um over the next 12 months given all the opportunity so so very excited about um participating in that market which is going to be um our most important market in particular in terms of growth over the next few years well aome very exciting things to be watching in the future and we will continue to watch it right here at market beat thank you so much for joining us today rob we really appreciate you sharing more about energy vault and a little bit about the company's future with our investors and thank you viewers for tuning in to

think this year have seen this this massive uptick in in power demand so i think all of those things will have an impact on our ability to meet the power demand and uh what i can share is that from from our perspective i think meeting that with clean energy is fundamental um uh there is um this push in just securing any power including you know a lot of the natural gas because it is abundant in the country and uh of course that's fossil driven so i think there's a a balance here that um is going to have to be struck uh here so we don't start heating the planet up at a at a very steep rate again and that's going to be solved through a combination of technology some we see today by the way bridgid and some are coming uh getting some of the carbon capture technologies deployed for example the advancements in energy transmission meaning to reduce the the loss of that over over long distances uh and having certain parts of the world where there's abundant solar be able to serve through this distribution other parts of the world where there's that demand a lot of things you know evolving here it's a very evolving industry for sure now rob i wanted to ask this question you've been a part of a lot of fortune 5 or fortune 100 companies out there what makes you excited specifically about helping to lead energy vault in this season where there's all kinds of developments in the world of energy yeah well i think anytime you work and have worked for a larger company uh by n just by definition of its size typically they're global uh so i would say say uh you know that experience that i had in working early on in my career which i started actually in oil and gas and then in the later 90s uh as this little thing called the internet took off got into networking and and software and security and in various companies along the way and seeing how that technology how it evolved and the impact it had in um how businesses were run and how fundamental economics were achieved and how efficiencies were gained and to see that manifest itself in different regions of the world that that absolutely those experiences have supported what we're doing here at energy vault from the very beginning and this has been a this has been such a um you know such an amazing experience for me having started being one of a few people to start this company is a founder uh with bill gross from ide lab so out of pasadena based ide lab and then to build it through the rounds of funding and taking it public and just the dynamics of the last you know three to four years having something like co that that sort of brought the world to its knees at one point uh and then coming out of that with a a focus again on on renewables and and getting those deployed and and the dynamics we have today it's uh been a fascinating experience but for sure i'm i'm most excited about the potential impact that we can have as a company uh on on the world and the global dynamics and around renewable storage um and supporting um you know supporting sustainable ways to make the clean energy transition good i think there's plenty of investors out there who care about the renewable energy sources and want to invest in that now we do have other investors who are all about the dollars and the numbers and that balance sheet um what are some facts about the company and the way it's being run financially that you're proud of that you think investors would be interested to hear yeah i think right off the bat i i'd say that we've um managed our investors cash well meaning uh we've built the company and have taken actions to also have a very efficient cost structure proactively um we've not put any debt on the company so we're debt-free uh which makes it um you know uh i think from a management perspective you can uh have that cash to plan for growth as we've been and that's shown up in the fact that we're investing in projects and owning them so we aren't building things and then just flipping them um to to have a some immediate payback which is um you know might be a little smaller from a pure percentage or or margin perspective we're holding attractive assets on our balance sheet investing in them because the returns are much higher over the long term and investors will like that because we're going to have predictable much more predictable cash flows and streams uh versus relying on um a project based business that can be sort of lumpy quarter to quarter so typically especially is a public company um you know that that lumpiness and those dynamics quarter to quarter can be difficult for some investors um you know predictability reliability of those cash fls becomes very important so i say the fact that we've managed the cash well uh no debt in the company have not done any dilutive financings um so a lot of companies were sort of forced to do that given just the capital dynamics uh and um and these are all things i think as we've evolved the company that that investors um app appreciate and will appreciate uh and finally just the aspect of we've able to develop a solution that can adapt to the changes in the market very quickly with software meaning uh if we would have developed just a single product for example and the market shifts like in long duration things moved out a little bit um if we didn't have a platform that could adapt and allow us to deliver what customers wanted in short duration um you know we had a we would have had a much different type of growth path so i think that that innovation and flexibility and what we've built into our software um means there's more diversification for investors that invest in our company because of our unique ability to meet different technology and durations in energy storage that flexibility and innovation is already capturing attention of some big companies including that big $350 million deal you got in australia we saw lots of news coverage of that this october what does that mean and for your future as energy belt yeah i just spent a great week there and was in melbourne um where they had their all energy conference which is their largest one there and what a amazing opportunity there is there and amazing investments being there and supported by the local governments um given that the demand and the renewable buildout that's taking place so uh we were very excited to participate not only in the conference but we met with our local teams and brought a lot of our global executives there to look at um all the growth that that we see and we just announced our first project last may in australia a 400 megawatt hour with a um a group called ain uh and then just announced this second project a full gigawatt hour and just you know so much opportunity there and working in that case with a an earlier stage developer and you get those insights into a set of assets and and platform builds uh and to get involved early gives you that insight and ability to i think plan and and meet those customer needs and and make the announcements like we did so we see a tremendous opportunity there and we'll be um spending more time in building and and growing are actually going to be tripling the size of our team there um over the next 12 months given all the opportunity so so very excited about um participating in that market which is going to be um our most important market in particular in terms of growth over the next few years well aome very exciting things to be watching in the future and we will continue to watch it right here at market beat thank you so much for joining us today rob we really appreciate you sharing more about energy vault and a little bit about the company's future with our investors and thank you viewers for tuning in to watch the conversation today you can find many more videos with similar content featuring different companies and stocks you may not have heard of right here on our channel marketbeat media thanks

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,ls4K-lIY-8Y,MarketBeat,2024-11-01 16:45:03+00:00,Energy Vault Stock Soars 100%: CEO Shares Why in MarketBeat Exclusive,kind: captions language: en today we are excited to launch a brand new ceo series where we're talking to the heads of some companies you may not have heard of but could add some big momentum for your portfolio let's dive in today we are very excited to have robert picone the ceo of energy vault with us to talk about their exciting innovation in the renewable energy field and like most companies robert your company really started off by kind of solving a problem the industry was facing and that's storage share a little bit more about what energy vault does sure thank you virgin pleasure to make some time here and pleasure to meet you we focus on energy storage and we're founded with a mission around broadly decarbonization but very specific to solving a problem around the intermittency of wind and solar uh and enabling essentially what's intermittent power resources uh solar when the sun shining wind when the wind is blowing and storing that energy um to be discharged uh at times when there's high demand so we look at providing uh economic and sustainable energy storage solutions uh and we can provide them uh in a mechanism and through a software platform to integrate various terms of technology uh because there is no let's say silver bullet there's different applications and use cases and different technologies have different econ e omic profiles to solve those so we um utilize a very sophisticated energy management system and software platform to be able to deliver our own proprietary energy storage solutions as well as integrate other energy storage solutions in the market yeah you are a company that's also built on ai or at least utilizing it talk about what sets energy vaults storage solutions apart from maybe some other competitors in this field i think one thing that's very unique about us versus any other provider is is we do support multiple durations and multiple technologies so most energy storage companies will focus on for example lithium ion and the short duration market of two to four hours others uh have developed long duration technologies like like we have that's focused on eight hours to 12 hours um and even others are looking at developing much longer term even 100h hour batteries for example for longer or ultra long duration so what's unique about energy vault is that we um develop solutions to serve all of those markets through the development of our innovative software platform so um that's something that is unique to us and and something that also allows us to be a stronger partner of various customer sets whether that be public utilities uh that can be independent power providers or even um can be large industrial energy users um because we can sit with them understand what problem they're trying to solve and match the appropriate technology to it and deliver it and deliver that uh availability of power and we guarantee that through our software platform um so i'd say that's a primary differentiator um and i i think another secondary differentiator for us is we've been in the market now across many regions of the world in in deploying projects so in the us market in the china market with our gravity solution which is long duration we've gotten started in australia and just announced a full gigawatt hour project for example uh just uh one week ago it's a very interesting for us because we have a definitely a global view on what's happening and have even announced um licensed deals with our long duration gravity technology in 16 uh states in south africa um for example uh and just to complete the circle we just announced with petross in brazil at our last earnings a first gravity system for long duration there so i think this second area of both being global um and and actually implementing projects and delivering projects as a young company is uh also sets us apart absolutely definitely finding success across the globe that announcement with australia partnership last week help to boost your stock price a little bit but i think our investors are definitely interested in hearing about the long-term commercialization plans what is it going to take to get these products in more countries what's your plan as a company for that it's it's the right question question bridget especially for investors uh because we uh in our first year of revenue at 148 million so delivered pretty much right on what we said in our plan we had a a a nice second year where we more than double that growth um so we did almost almost 4 170 million in our first two years and have guided this next two years meaning this year and the next year at 500 to 700 million another large growth but i think investors really want to see that backlog fill up of projects hence to your point of the one gwatt hour in australia which we bounced at $350 million us plus uh as a as a single project um i think investors want to see that show up in the backlog formally now as we progress so they can get visibility into just the execution of those projects which will generate that revenue and also deliver on what we've also formally guided we did this at our first analyst and investor day uh in may earlier this year but we also guided on being ful year cash flow neida positive uh in what would be our third full calendar year having revenue and and as a public company so that's a a nice growth profile i think for us to have and and to get and achieve that uh here in our third um third year which will be next year in 2025 uh and and just seeing these announcements now come is what's driving some of that recent uptick in the in the stock because there's that confidence now that uh investors to enter when it becomes now just a matter of just execution of projects and that's one thing we've been very good at and and also done them very quickly and with quality across the board we delivered over a gigawatt hour in in 2023 and have um more projects now that we'll be delivering and uh and those have gone very well yeah you're just a couple weeks ahead of your next earnings reports will there be more project announcements coming or anything you can give a sneak peek to some of our investors yeah we're in a blackout period right now here before our earnings which which are coming up on uh on the 12th of november it's about a week later this year due to the due to the election but you know generally we'll be giving updates on uh on projects as well as on our guidance for the remaining part of the year now that we're going to be approaching almost mid november so we've got pretty good visibility into where we're going to be and um and we'll see also what we're going to be saying about the next year typically we do our q4 earnings in february later later in february where we would then give our formal guidance on a on an annual basis uh but uh i think we'll be able to talk about what these recent deals that we're announcing um will mean in terms of our plan for next year so we're looking looking forward to that let's go a little broader and talk about your industry as a whole what kind of growth opportunities and demand are we seeing in the energy storage industry yeah well it's it's large just and uh and large because of the the new renewables that are becoming more and more part of the grid and therefore the need to complement that with storage it's large because some countries like the united states have put in place incentives to be able to apply not only as historically to wind and solar on projects but now to storage via investment tax credits but also other incentives that was put in place under the inflation reduction act that um sought to incent localized or domestic content as well as incenting uh investment in communities where the uh the the employment may be lower than other communities and therefore around job creation so i think that's another um uh impetus that we're seeing and and other countries have followed suit to that and then generally the third thing i'd mention here which is very topical now especially in the us and and now becoming topical in other parts the world i i i met with the the minister uh in victoria the minister of energy there in australia about this uh topic of the hyperscalers and the demand on power and what's happening not only with generative ai i know that's getting a lot of the focus for the data center growth but actually a lot of that growth in need is coming from a lot of the applications now being developed natively for the cloud so you combine those factors and and you know the us specifically it's it's a very difficult lineup power uh now and you've seen some of the headlines so i think this this third area of growth is just around um also the need for storage to complement renewable as a power source um that's going to be serving this tremendous growth and power demand from the hyperscalers yeah getting more energy to the grid is a constant topic we cover here because it affects so many companies and especially the growth in many many profitable companies out there right now let's talk about a little bit more just about the risks that are in this industry we're hearing a lot about nuclear power and some of those big data centers partnering and turning towards nuclear are there any other factors like that that could impact the future of renewable energy and storage that you provide yeah sure certainly uh i think given that power demand a lot of the the larger companies the the so-called magna companies so ma microsoft apple um you know google or alphabet and and the larger groups and hyperscalers um they are looking at clean ways to meet that demand and having the large balance sheets they have to invest um you know interestingly what microsoft did my island um you know these are things i think two years ago we would just have never foreseen i'd say even a year ago they were um you know we we just recently i i

security and in various companies along the way and seeing how that technology how it evolved and the impact it had in um how businesses were run and how fundamental economics were achieved and how efficiencies were gained and to see that manifest itself in different regions of the world that that absolutely those experiences have supported what we're doing here at energy vault from the very beginning and this has been a this has been such a um you know such an amazing experience for me having started being one of a few people to start this company is a founder uh with bill gross from ide lab so out of pasadena based ide lab and then to build it through the rounds of funding and taking it public and just the dynamics of the last you know three to four years having something like co that that sort of brought the world to its knees at one point uh and then coming out of that with a a focus again on on renewables and and getting those deployed and and the dynamics we have today it's uh been a fascinating experience but for sure i'm i'm most excited about the potential impact that we can have as a company uh on on the world and the global dynamics and around renewable storage um and supporting um you know supporting sustainable ways to make the clean energy transition good i think there's plenty of investors out there who care about the renewable energy sources and want to invest in that now we do have other investors who are all about the dollars and the numbers and that balance sheet um what are some facts about the company and the way it's being run financially that you're proud of that you think investors would be interested to hear yeah i think right off the bat i i'd say that we've um managed our investors cash well meaning uh we've built the company and have taken actions to also have a very efficient cost structure proactively um we've not put any debt on the company so we're debt-free uh which makes it um you know uh i think from a management perspective you can uh have that cash to plan for growth as we've been and that's shown up in the fact that we're investing in projects and owning them so we aren't building things and then just flipping them um to to have a some immediate payback which is um you know might be a little smaller from a pure percentage or or margin perspective we're holding attractive assets on our balance sheet investing in them because the returns are much higher over the long term and investors will like that because we're going to have predictable much more predictable cash flows and streams uh versus relying on um a project based business that can be sort of lumpy quarter to quarter so typically especially is a public company um you know that that lumpiness and those dynamics quarter to quarter can be difficult for some investors um you know predictability reliability of those cash fls becomes very important so i say the fact that we've managed the cash well uh no debt in the company have not done any dilutive financings um so a lot of companies were sort of forced to do that given just the capital dynamics uh and um and these are all things i think as we've evolved the company that that investors um app appreciate and will appreciate uh and finally just the aspect of we've able to develop a solution that can adapt to the changes in the market very quickly with software meaning uh if we would have developed just a single product for example and the market shifts like in long duration things moved out a little bit um if we didn't have a platform that could adapt and allow us to deliver what customers wanted in short duration um you know we had a we would have had a much different type of growth path so i think that that innovation and flexibility and what we've built into our software um means there's more diversification for investors that invest in our company because of our unique ability to meet different technology and durations in energy storage that flexibility and innovation is already capturing attention of some big companies including that big $350 million deal you got in australia we saw lots of news coverage of that this october what does that mean and for your future as energy belt yeah i just spent a great week there and was in melbourne um where they had their all energy conference which is their largest one there and what a amazing opportunity there is there and amazing investments being there and supported by the local governments um given that the demand and the renewable buildout that's taking place so uh we were very excited to participate not only in the conference but we met with our local teams and brought a lot of our global executives there to look at um all the growth that that we see and we just announced our first project last may in australia a 400 megawatt hour with a um a group called ain uh and then just announced this second project a full gigawatt hour and just you know so much opportunity there and working in that case with a an earlier stage developer and you get those insights into a set of assets and and platform builds uh and to get involved early gives you that insight and ability to i think plan and and meet those customer needs and and make the announcements like we did so we see a tremendous opportunity there and we'll be um spending more time in building and and growing are actually going to be tripling the size of our team there um over the next 12 months given all the opportunity so so very excited about um participating in that market which is going to be um our most important market in particular in terms of growth over the next few years well aome very exciting things to be watching in the future and we will continue to watch it right here at market beat thank you so much for joining us today rob we really appreciate you sharing more about energy vault and a little bit about the company's future with our investors and thank you viewers for tuning in to watch the conversation today you can find many more videos with similar content featuring different companies and stocks you may not have heard of right here on our channel marketbeat media thanks

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,ls4K-lIY-8Y,MarketBeat,2024-11-01 16:45:03+00:00,Energy Vault Stock Soars 100%: CEO Shares Why in MarketBeat Exclusive,kind: captions language: en today we are excited to launch a brand new ceo series where we're talking to the heads of some companies you may not have heard of but could add some big momentum for your portfolio let's dive in today we are very excited to have robert picone the ceo of energy vault with us to talk about their exciting innovation in the renewable energy field and like most companies robert your company really started off by kind of solving a problem the industry was facing and that's storage share a little bit more about what energy vault does sure thank you virgin pleasure to make some time here and pleasure to meet you we focus on energy storage and we're founded with a mission around broadly decarbonization but very specific to solving a problem around the intermittency of wind and solar uh and enabling essentially what's intermittent power resources uh solar when the sun shining wind when the wind is blowing and storing that energy um to be discharged uh at times when there's high demand so we look at providing uh economic and sustainable energy storage solutions uh and we can provide them uh in a mechanism and through a software platform to integrate various terms of technology uh because there is no let's say silver bullet there's different applications and use cases and different technologies have different econ e omic profiles to solve those so we um utilize a very sophisticated energy management system and software platform to be able to deliver our own proprietary energy storage solutions as well as integrate other energy storage solutions in the market yeah you are a company that's also built on ai or at least utilizing it talk about what sets energy vaults storage solutions apart from maybe some other competitors in this field i think one thing that's very unique about us versus any other provider is is we do support multiple durations and multiple technologies so most energy storage companies will focus on for example lithium ion and the short duration market of two to four hours others uh have developed long duration technologies like like we have that's focused on eight hours to 12 hours um and even others are looking at developing much longer term even 100h hour batteries for example for longer or ultra long duration so what's unique about energy vault is that we um develop solutions to serve all of those markets through the development of our innovative software platform so um that's something that is unique to us and and something that also allows us to be a stronger partner of various customer sets whether that be public utilities uh that can be independent power providers or even um can be large industrial energy users um because we can sit with them understand what problem they're trying to solve and match the appropriate technology to it and deliver it and deliver that uh availability of power and we guarantee that through our software platform um so i'd say that's a primary differentiator um and i i think another secondary differentiator for us is we've been in the market now across many regions of the world in in deploying projects so in the us market in the china market with our gravity solution which is long duration we've gotten started in australia and just announced a full gigawatt hour project for example uh just uh one week ago it's a very interesting for us because we have a definitely a global view on what's happening and have even announced um licensed deals with our long duration gravity technology in 16 uh states in south africa um for example uh and just to complete the circle we just announced with petross in brazil at our last earnings a first gravity system for long duration there so i think this second area of both being global um and and actually implementing projects and delivering projects as a young company is uh also sets us apart absolutely definitely finding success across the globe that announcement with australia partnership last week help to boost your stock price a little bit but i think our investors are definitely interested in hearing about the long-term commercialization plans what is it going to take to get these products in more countries what's your plan as a company for that it's it's the right question question bridget especially for investors uh because we uh in our first year of revenue at 148 million so delivered pretty much right on what we said in our plan we had a a a nice second year where we more than double that growth um so we did almost almost 4 170 million in our first two years and have guided this next two years meaning this year and the next year at 500 to 700 million another large growth but i think investors really want to see that backlog fill up of projects hence to your point of the one gwatt hour in australia which we bounced at $350 million us plus uh as a as a single project um i think investors want to see that show up in the backlog formally now as we progress so they can get visibility into just the execution of those projects which will generate that revenue and also deliver on what we've also formally guided we did this at our first analyst and investor day uh in may earlier this year but we also guided on being ful year cash flow neida positive uh in what would be our third full calendar year having revenue and and as a public company so that's a a nice growth profile i think for us to have and and to get and achieve that uh here in our third um third year which will be next year in 2025 uh and and just seeing these announcements now come is what's driving some of that recent uptick in the in the stock because there's that confidence now that uh investors to enter when it becomes now just a matter of just execution of projects and that's one thing we've been very good at and and also done them very quickly and with quality across the board we delivered over a gigawatt hour in in 2023 and have um more projects now that we'll be delivering and uh and those have gone very well yeah you're just a couple weeks ahead of your next earnings reports will there be more project announcements coming or anything you can give a sneak peek to some of our investors yeah we're in a blackout period right now here before our earnings which which are coming up on uh on the 12th of november it's about a week later this year due to the due to the election but you know generally we'll be giving updates on uh on projects as well as on our guidance for the remaining part of the year now that we're going to be approaching almost mid november so we've got pretty good visibility into where we're going to be and um and we'll see also what we're going to be saying about the next year typically we do our q4 earnings in february later later in february where we would then give our formal guidance on a on an annual basis uh but uh i think we'll be able to talk about what these recent deals that we're announcing um will mean in terms of our plan for next year so we're looking looking forward to that let's go a little broader and talk about your industry as a whole what kind of growth opportunities and demand are we seeing in the energy storage industry yeah well it's it's large just and uh and large because of the the new renewables that are becoming more and more part of the grid and therefore the need to complement that with storage it's large because some countries like the united states have put in place incentives to be able to apply not only as historically to wind and solar on projects but now to storage via investment tax credits but also other incentives that was put in place under the inflation reduction act that um sought to incent localized or domestic content as well as incenting uh investment in communities where the uh the the employment may be lower than other communities and therefore around job creation so i think that's another um uh impetus that we're seeing and and other countries have followed suit to that and then generally the third thing i'd mention here which is very topical now especially in the us and and now becoming topical in other parts the world i i i met with the the minister uh in victoria the minister of energy there in australia about this uh topic of the hyperscalers and the demand on power and what's happening not only with generative ai i know that's getting a lot of the focus for the data center growth but actually a lot of that growth in need is coming from a lot of the applications now being developed natively for the cloud so you combine those factors and and you know the us specifically it's it's a very difficult lineup power uh now and you've seen some of the headlines so i think this this third area of growth is just around um also the need for storage to complement renewable as a power source um that's going to be serving this tremendous growth and power demand from the hyperscalers yeah getting more energy to the grid is a constant topic we cover here because it affects so many companies and especially the growth in many many profitable companies out there right now let's talk about a little bit more just about the risks that are in this industry we're hearing a lot about nuclear power and some of those big data centers partnering and turning towards nuclear are there any other factors like that that could impact the future of renewable energy and storage that you provide yeah sure certainly uh i think given that power demand a lot of the the larger companies the the so-called magna companies so ma microsoft apple um you know google or alphabet and and the larger groups and hyperscalers um they are looking at clean ways to meet that demand and having the large balance sheets they have to invest um you know interestingly what microsoft did my island um you know these are things i think two years ago we would just have never foreseen i'd say even a year ago they were um you know we we just recently i i think this year have seen this this massive uptick in in power demand so i think all of those things will have an impact on our ability to meet the power demand and uh what i can share is that from from our perspective i think meeting that with clean energy is fundamental um uh there is um this push in just securing any power including you know a lot of the natural gas because it is abundant in the country and uh of course that's fossil driven so i think there's a a balance here that um is going to have to be struck uh here so we don't start heating the planet up at a at a very steep rate again and that's going to be solved through a combination of technology some we see today by the way bridgid and some are coming uh getting some of the carbon capture technologies deployed for example the advancements in energy transmission meaning to reduce the the loss of that over over long distances uh and having certain parts of the world where there's abundant solar be able to serve through this distribution other parts of the world where there's that demand a lot of things you know evolving here it's a very evolving industry for sure now rob i wanted to ask this question you've been a part of a lot of fortune 5 or fortune 100 companies out there what makes you excited specifically about helping to lead energy vault in this season where there's all kinds of developments in the world of energy yeah well i think anytime you work and have worked for a larger company uh by n just by definition of its size typically they're global uh so i would say say uh you know that experience that i had in working early on in my career which i started actually in oil and gas and then in the later 90s uh as this little thing called the internet took off got into networking and and software and security and in various companies along the way and seeing how that technology how it evolved and the impact it had in um how businesses were run and how fundamental economics were achieved and how

taken actions to also have a very efficient cost structure proactively um we've not put any debt on the company so we're debt-free uh which makes it um you know uh i think from a management perspective you can uh have that cash to plan for growth as we've been and that's shown up in the fact that we're investing in projects and owning them so we aren't building things and then just flipping them um to to have a some immediate payback which is um you know might be a little smaller from a pure percentage or or margin perspective we're holding attractive assets on our balance sheet investing in them because the returns are much higher over the long term and investors will like that because we're going to have predictable much more predictable cash flows and streams uh versus relying on um a project based business that can be sort of lumpy quarter to quarter so typically especially is a public company um you know that that lumpiness and those dynamics quarter to quarter can be difficult for some investors um you know predictability reliability of those cash fls becomes very important so i say the fact that we've managed the cash well uh no debt in the company have not done any dilutive financings um so a lot of companies were sort of forced to do that given just the capital dynamics uh and um and these are all things i think as we've evolved the company that that investors um app appreciate and will appreciate uh and finally just the aspect of we've able to develop a solution that can adapt to the changes in the market very quickly with software meaning uh if we would have developed just a single product for example and the market shifts like in long duration things moved out a little bit um if we didn't have a platform that could adapt and allow us to deliver what customers wanted in short duration um you know we had a we would have had a much different type of growth path so i think that that innovation and flexibility and what we've built into our software um means there's more diversification for investors that invest in our company because of our unique ability to meet different technology and durations in energy storage that flexibility and innovation is already capturing attention of some big companies including that big $350 million deal you got in australia we saw lots of news coverage of that this october what does that mean and for your future as energy belt yeah i just spent a great week there and was in melbourne um where they had their all energy conference which is their largest one there and what a amazing opportunity there is there and amazing investments being there and supported by the local governments um given that the demand and the renewable buildout that's taking place so uh we were very excited to participate not only in the conference but we met with our local teams and brought a lot of our global executives there to look at um all the growth that that we see and we just announced our first project last may in australia a 400 megawatt hour with a um a group called ain uh and then just announced this second project a full gigawatt hour and just you know so much opportunity there and working in that case with a an earlier stage developer and you get those insights into a set of assets and and platform builds uh and to get involved early gives you that insight and ability to i think plan and and meet those customer needs and and make the announcements like we did so we see a tremendous opportunity there and we'll be um spending more time in building and and growing are actually going to be tripling the size of our team there um over the next 12 months given all the opportunity so so very excited about um participating in that market which is going to be um our most important market in particular in terms of growth over the next few years well aome very exciting things to be watching in the future and we will continue to watch it right here at market beat thank you so much for joining us today rob we really appreciate you sharing more about energy vault and a little bit about the company's future with our investors and thank you viewers for tuning in to

youtube_subtitles_MarketBeat 1(By Gemini).csv,youtube,ls4K-lIY-8Y,MarketBeat,2024-11-01 16:45:03+00:00,Energy Vault Stock Soars 100%: CEO Shares Why in MarketBeat Exclusive,kind: captions language: en today we are excited to launch a brand new ceo series where we're talking to the heads of some companies you may not have heard of but could add some big momentum for your portfolio let's dive in today we are very excited to have robert picone the ceo of energy vault with us to talk about their exciting innovation in the renewable energy field and like most companies robert your company really started off by kind of solving a problem the industry was facing and that's storage share a little bit more about what energy vault does sure thank you virgin pleasure to make some time here and pleasure to meet you we focus on energy storage and we're founded with a mission around broadly decarbonization but very specific to solving a problem around the intermittency of wind and solar uh and enabling essentially what's intermittent power resources uh solar when the sun shining wind when the wind is blowing and storing that energy um to be discharged uh at times when there's high demand so we look at providing uh economic and sustainable energy storage solutions uh and we can provide them uh in a mechanism and through a software platform to integrate various terms of technology uh because there is no let's say silver bullet there's different applications and use cases and different technologies have different econ e omic profiles to solve those so we um utilize a very sophisticated energy management system and software platform to be able to deliver our own proprietary energy storage solutions as well as integrate other energy storage solutions in the market yeah you are a company that's also built on ai or at least utilizing it talk about what sets energy vaults storage solutions apart from maybe some other competitors in this field i think one thing that's very unique about us versus any other provider is is we do support multiple durations and multiple technologies so most energy storage companies will focus on for example lithium ion and the short duration market of two to four hours others uh have developed long duration technologies like like we have that's focused on eight hours to 12 hours um and even others are looking at developing much longer term even 100h hour batteries for example for longer or ultra long duration so what's unique about energy vault is that we um develop solutions to serve all of those markets through the development of our innovative software platform so um that's something that is unique to us and and something that also allows us to be a stronger partner of various customer sets whether that be public utilities uh that can be independent power providers or even um can be large industrial energy users um because we can sit with them understand what problem they're trying to solve and match the appropriate technology to it and deliver it and deliver that uh availability of power and we guarantee that through our software platform um so i'd say that's a primary differentiator um and i i think another secondary differentiator for us is we've been in the market now across many regions of the world in in deploying projects so in the us market in the china market with our gravity solution which is long duration we've gotten started in australia and just announced a full gigawatt hour project for example uh just uh one week ago it's a very interesting for us because we have a definitely a global view on what's happening and have even announced um licensed deals with our long duration gravity technology in 16 uh states in south africa um for example uh and just to complete the circle we just announced with petross in brazil at our last earnings a first gravity system for long duration there so i think this second area of both being global um and and actually implementing projects and delivering projects as a young company is uh also sets us apart absolutely definitely finding success across the globe that announcement with australia partnership last week help to boost your stock price a little bit but i think our investors are definitely interested in hearing about the long-term commercialization plans what is it going to take to get these products in more countries what's your plan as a company for that it's it's the right question question bridget especially for investors uh because we uh in our first year of revenue at 148 million so delivered pretty much right on what we said in our plan we had a a a nice second year where we more than double that growth um so we did almost almost 4 170 million in our first two years and have guided this next two years meaning this year and the next year at 500 to 700 million another large growth but i think investors really want to see that backlog fill up of projects hence to your point of the one gwatt hour in australia which we bounced at $350 million us plus uh as a as a single project um i think investors want to see that show up in the backlog formally now as we progress so they can get visibility into just the execution of those projects which will generate that revenue and also deliver on what we've also formally guided we did this at our first analyst and investor day uh in may earlier this year but we also guided on being ful year cash flow neida positive uh in what would be our third full calendar year having revenue and and as a public company so that's a a nice growth profile i think for us to have and and to get and achieve that uh here in our third um third year which will be next year in 2025 uh and and just seeing these announcements now come is what's driving some of that recent uptick in the in the stock because there's that confidence now that uh investors to enter when it becomes now just a matter of just execution of projects and that's one thing we've been very good at and and also done them very quickly and with quality across the board we delivered over a gigawatt hour in in 2023 and have um more projects now that we'll be delivering and uh and those have gone very well yeah you're just a couple weeks ahead of your next earnings reports will there be more project announcements coming or anything you can give a sneak peek to some of our investors yeah we're in a blackout period right now here before our earnings which which are coming up on uh on the 12th of november it's about a week later this year due to the due to the election but you know generally we'll be giving updates on uh on projects as well as on our guidance for the remaining part of the year now that we're going to be approaching almost mid november so we've got pretty good visibility into where we're going to be and um and we'll see also what we're going to be saying about the next year typically we do our q4 earnings in february later later in february where we would then give our formal guidance on a on an annual basis uh but uh i think we'll be able to talk about what these recent deals that we're announcing um will mean in terms of our plan for next year so we're looking looking forward to that let's go a little broader and talk about your industry as a whole what kind of growth opportunities and demand are we seeing in the energy storage industry yeah well it's it's large just and uh and large because of the the new renewables that are becoming more and more part of the grid and therefore the need to complement that with storage it's large because some countries like the united states have put in place incentives to be able to apply not only as historically to wind and solar on projects but now to storage via investment tax credits but also other incentives that was put in place under the inflation reduction act that um sought to incent localized or domestic content as well as incenting uh investment in communities where the uh the the employment may be lower than other communities and therefore around job creation so i think that's another um uh impetus that we're seeing and and other countries have followed suit to that and then generally the third thing i'd mention here which is very topical now especially in the us and and now becoming topical in other parts the world i i i met with the the minister uh in victoria the minister of energy there in australia about this uh topic of the hyperscalers and the demand on power and what's happening not only with generative ai i know that's getting a lot of the focus for the data center growth but actually a lot of that growth in need is coming from a lot of the applications now being developed natively for the cloud so you combine those factors and and you know the us specifically it's it's a very difficult lineup power uh now and you've seen some of the headlines so i think this this third area of growth is just around um also the need for storage to complement renewable as a power source um that's going to be serving this tremendous growth and power demand from the hyperscalers yeah getting more energy to the grid is a constant topic we cover here because it affects so many companies and especially the growth in many many profitable companies out there right now let's talk about a little bit more just about the risks that are in this industry we're hearing a lot about nuclear power and some of those big data centers partnering and turning towards nuclear are there any other factors like that that could impact the future of renewable energy and storage that you provide yeah sure certainly uh i think given that power demand a lot of the the larger companies the the so-called magna companies so ma microsoft apple um you know google or alphabet and and the larger groups and hyperscalers um they are looking at clean ways to meet that demand and having the large balance sheets they have to invest um you know interestingly what microsoft did my island um you know these are things i think two years ago we would just have never foreseen i'd say even a year ago they were um you know we we just recently i i think this year have seen this this massive uptick in in power demand so i think all of those things will have an impact on our ability to meet the power demand and uh what i can share is that from from our perspective i think meeting that with clean energy is fundamental um uh there is um this push in just securing any power including you know a lot of the natural gas because it is abundant in the country and uh of course that's fossil driven so i think there's a a balance here that um is going to have to be struck uh here so we don't start heating the planet up at a at a very steep rate again and that's going to be solved through a combination of technology some we see today by the way bridgid and some are coming uh getting some of the carbon capture technologies deployed for example the advancements in energy transmission meaning to reduce the the loss of that over over long distances uh and having certain parts of the world where there's abundant solar be able to serve through this distribution other parts of the world where there's that demand a lot of things you know evolving here it's a very evolving industry for sure now rob i wanted to ask this question you've been a part of a lot of fortune 5 or fortune 100 companies out there what makes you excited specifically about helping to lead energy vault in this season where there's all kinds of developments in the world of energy yeah well i think anytime you work and have worked for a larger company uh by n just by definition of its size typically they're global uh so i would say say uh you know that experience that i had in working early on in my career which i started actually in oil and gas and then in the later 90s uh as this little thing called the internet took off got into networking and and software and security and in various companies along the way and seeing how that technology how it evolved and the impact it had in um how businesses were run and how fundamental economics were achieved and how efficiencies were gained and to see that manifest itself in different regions of the world that that absolutely those experiences have supported what we're doing here at energy vault from the very beginning and this has been a this has been such a um you know such an amazing experience for me having started being one of a few people to start this company is a founder uh with bill gross from ide lab so out of pasadena based ide lab and then to build it through the rounds of funding and taking it public and just the dynamics of the last you know three to four years having something like co that that sort of brought the world to its knees at one point uh and then coming out of that with a a focus again on on renewables and and getting those deployed and and the dynamics we have today it's uh been a fascinating experience but for sure i'm i'm most excited about the potential impact that we can have as a company uh on on the world and the global dynamics and around renewable storage um and supporting um you know supporting sustainable ways to make the clean energy transition good i think there's plenty of investors out there who care about the renewable energy sources and want to invest in that now we do have other investors who are all about the dollars and the numbers and that balance sheet um what are some facts about the company and the way it's being run financially that you're proud of that you think investors would be interested to hear yeah i think right off the bat i i'd say that we've um managed our investors cash well meaning uh we've built the company and have

heard a lot about sector rotation in the second half of 2024 but even more rotation could be underway after next week's election let's dive in today we have jeffrey beerman here to help walk investors through how to navigate potential rotations that could still be coming yet this year jeffrey is a finance professor at lyola university chicago and the chief market technician at theot trade jeff we are so excited to have you here at market be media today i'm just as excited to be here i've heard a lot of good things about market beat so oh good we know you have plenty of knowledge to share with our viewers here today too we're going to share some of your picks and where you think sector rotation could be headed no matter who wins the election we'll share your stock picks in just a little bit but first let's start out with the basics what exactly is sector rotation the just behind it is just is just this is that there are 11 different sectors in the economy or 11 different sectors that drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it back them if it pulls back and if not you could might move it into bonds or crypto or gold something of another nature where it's not as correlated the word diversification is misused people say i own 500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what product or assets you own so having something that's not correlated to the s&amp;p will actually offset and mitigate the risk in down times and that's something you can't prepare for by the time of the day but you can get ahead of the curve and say listen i know it's not expected but it's never too early that would be the approach i would take if i'd stay the course well some really good advice for investors out there who are looking at the uncertainty of the week ahead and are trying to figure out the best play for their their investments thank you so much for walking us through some of

heard a lot about sector rotation in the second half of 2024 but even more rotation could be underway after next week's election let's dive in today we have jeffrey beerman here to help walk investors through how to navigate potential rotations that could still be coming yet this year jeffrey is a finance professor at lyola university chicago and the chief market technician at theot trade jeff we are so excited to have you here at market be media today i'm just as excited to be here i've heard a lot of good things about market beat so oh good we know you have plenty of knowledge to share with our viewers here today too we're going to share some of your picks and where you think sector rotation could be headed no matter who wins the election we'll share your stock picks in just a little bit but first let's start out with the basics what exactly is sector rotation the just behind it is just is just this is that there are 11 different sectors in the economy or 11 different sectors that drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it back them if it pulls back and if not you could might move it into bonds or crypto or gold something of another nature where it's not as correlated the word diversification is misused people say i own 500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what product or assets you own so having something that's not correlated to the s&amp;p will actually offset and mitigate the risk in down times and that's something you can't prepare for by the time of the day but you can get ahead of the curve and say listen i know it's not expected but it's never too early that would be the approach i would take if i'd stay the course well some really good advice for investors out there who are looking at the uncertainty of the week ahead and are trying to figure out the best play for their their investments thank you so much for walking us through some of

money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it back them if it pulls back and if not you could might move it into bonds or crypto or gold something of another nature where it's not as correlated the word diversification is misused people say i own 500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what product or assets you own so having something that's not correlated to the s&amp;p will actually offset and mitigate the risk in down times and that's something you can't prepare for by the time of the day but you can get ahead of the curve and say listen i know it's not expected but it's never too early that would be the approach i would take if i'd stay the course well some really good advice for investors out there who are looking at the uncertainty of the week ahead and are trying to figure out the best play for their their investments thank you so much for walking us through some of

heard a lot about sector rotation in the second half of 2024 but even more rotation could be underway after next week's election let's dive in today we have jeffrey beerman here to help walk investors through how to navigate potential rotations that could still be coming yet this year jeffrey is a finance professor at lyola university chicago and the chief market technician at theot trade jeff we are so excited to have you here at market be media today i'm just as excited to be here i've heard a lot of good things about market beat so oh good we know you have plenty of knowledge to share with our viewers here today too we're going to share some of your picks and where you think sector rotation could be headed no matter who wins the election we'll share your stock picks in just a little bit but first let's start out with the basics what exactly is sector rotation the just behind it is just is just this is that there are 11 different sectors in the economy or 11 different sectors that drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and

rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it

is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it

500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what

heard a lot about sector rotation in the second half of 2024 but even more rotation could be underway after next week's election let's dive in today we have jeffrey beerman here to help walk investors through how to navigate potential rotations that could still be coming yet this year jeffrey is a finance professor at lyola university chicago and the chief market technician at theot trade jeff we are so excited to have you here at market be media today i'm just as excited to be here i've heard a lot of good things about market beat so oh good we know you have plenty of knowledge to share with our viewers here today too we're going to share some of your picks and where you think sector rotation could be headed no matter who wins the election we'll share your stock picks in just a little bit but first let's start out with the basics what exactly is sector rotation the just behind it is just is just this is that there are 11 different sectors in the economy or 11 different sectors that drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course

many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it back them if it pulls back and if not you could might move it into bonds or crypto or gold something of another nature where it's not as correlated the word diversification is misused people say i own 500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what product or assets you own so having something that's not correlated to the s&amp;p will actually offset and mitigate the risk in down times and that's something you can't prepare for by the time of the day but you can get ahead of the curve and say listen i know it's not expected but it's never too early that would be the approach i would take if i'd stay the course well some really good advice for investors out there who are looking at the uncertainty of the week ahead and are trying to figure out the best play for their their investments thank you so much for walking us through some of

heard a lot about sector rotation in the second half of 2024 but even more rotation could be underway after next week's election let's dive in today we have jeffrey beerman here to help walk investors through how to navigate potential rotations that could still be coming yet this year jeffrey is a finance professor at lyola university chicago and the chief market technician at theot trade jeff we are so excited to have you here at market be media today i'm just as excited to be here i've heard a lot of good things about market beat so oh good we know you have plenty of knowledge to share with our viewers here today too we're going to share some of your picks and where you think sector rotation could be headed no matter who wins the election we'll share your stock picks in just a little bit but first let's start out with the basics what exactly is sector rotation the just behind it is just is just this is that there are 11 different sectors in the economy or 11 different sectors that drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what

matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the

want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump

ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it back them if it pulls back and if not you could might move it into bonds or crypto or gold something of another nature where it's not as correlated the word diversification is misused people say i own 500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what product or assets you own so having something that's not correlated to the s&amp;p will actually offset and mitigate the risk in down times and that's something you can't prepare for by the time of

heard a lot about sector rotation in the second half of 2024 but even more rotation could be underway after next week's election let's dive in today we have jeffrey beerman here to help walk investors through how to navigate potential rotations that could still be coming yet this year jeffrey is a finance professor at lyola university chicago and the chief market technician at theot trade jeff we are so excited to have you here at market be media today i'm just as excited to be here i've heard a lot of good things about market beat so oh good we know you have plenty of knowledge to share with our viewers here today too we're going to share some of your picks and where you think sector rotation could be headed no matter who wins the election we'll share your stock picks in just a little bit but first let's start out with the basics what exactly is sector rotation the just behind it is just is just this is that there are 11 different sectors in the economy or 11 different sectors that drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe

cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for

november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it back them if it pulls back and if not you could might move it into bonds or crypto or gold something of another nature where it's not as correlated the word diversification is misused people say i own 500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what product or assets you own so having something that's not correlated to the s&amp;p will actually offset and mitigate the risk in down times and that's something you can't prepare for by the time of the day but you can get ahead of the curve and say listen i know it's not expected but it's never too early that would be the approach i would take if i'd stay the course well some really good advice for investors out there who are looking at the uncertainty of the week ahead and are trying to figure out the best play for their their investments thank you so much for walking us through some of

heard a lot about sector rotation in the second half of 2024 but even more rotation could be underway after next week's election let's dive in today we have jeffrey beerman here to help walk investors through how to navigate potential rotations that could still be coming yet this year jeffrey is a finance professor at lyola university chicago and the chief market technician at theot trade jeff we are so excited to have you here at market be media today i'm just as excited to be here i've heard a lot of good things about market beat so oh good we know you have plenty of knowledge to share with our viewers here today too we're going to share some of your picks and where you think sector rotation could be headed no matter who wins the election we'll share your stock picks in just a little bit but first let's start out with the basics what exactly is sector rotation the just behind it is just is just this is that there are 11 different sectors in the economy or 11 different sectors that drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of

rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump

right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it back them if it pulls back and if not you could might move it into bonds or crypto or gold something of another nature where it's not as correlated the word diversification is misused people say i own 500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what product or assets you own so having something that's not correlated to the s&amp;p will actually offset and mitigate the risk in down times and that's something you can't prepare for by the time of the day but you can get ahead of the curve and say listen i know it's not expected but it's never too early that would be the approach i would take if i'd stay the course well some really good advice

heard a lot about sector rotation in the second half of 2024 but even more rotation could be underway after next week's election let's dive in today we have jeffrey beerman here to help walk investors through how to navigate potential rotations that could still be coming yet this year jeffrey is a finance professor at lyola university chicago and the chief market technician at theot trade jeff we are so excited to have you here at market be media today i'm just as excited to be here i've heard a lot of good things about market beat so oh good we know you have plenty of knowledge to share with our viewers here today too we're going to share some of your picks and where you think sector rotation could be headed no matter who wins the election we'll share your stock picks in just a little bit but first let's start out with the basics what exactly is sector rotation the just behind it is just is just this is that there are 11 different sectors in the economy or 11 different sectors that drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it

pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can

drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it back them if it pulls back and if not you could might move it into bonds or crypto or gold something of another nature where it's not as correlated the word diversification is misused people say i own 500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what product or assets you own so having something that's not correlated to the s&amp;p will actually offset and mitigate the risk in down times and that's something you can't prepare for by the time of the day but you can get ahead of the curve and say listen i know it's not expected but it's never too early that would be the approach i would take if i'd stay the course well some really good advice for investors out there who are looking at the uncertainty of the week ahead and are trying to figure out the best play for their their investments thank you so much for walking us through some of these jeff thank you for having me it's a pleasure and an honor thank you yes and you can find many more market news stories talking about the economy specific stocks and much more market news right

to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd want to be if trump's going to win because he's going to pour money into those two those sectors at the same time if he does at some point not win and cala takes that re rain and winds you have to think about what she's trying to accomplish and what she wants effectively what she wants is you know she'll say okay we have to figure out new situations for immigrants well if more immigrants are coming in more help need for health care that could be a surge in human cardinal health could be a surge in mc could be a surge in lily all these companies that provide some sort of medical or service health plan to meet the needs of people who need it already and those new immigrants or people who migrate here into this country that's an area that she is probably it is probably going to get a bump from you might also get a bump from reits and you're like well why real estate investment trust remember reits believe it or not are the highest paying yielding asset class not not at&amp;t not dominion not next era energy not the utilities it's actually reats that pay the highest and if there is a fact that you know she wants to make for hous affording for everybody what does that do it sets reat on fire because people are going to go after the home builders they're going to go after being family homes renting if they can't own and that abets the reits it abets the home builders right so on that note that helps cala harris so you can play both sides of the fence by sector rotating into things where trump wins or in the event he doesn't win you can move to the other side of it it's just spreading your risk and playing on what their agenda is i think that's the key points that you've hit on there is there's two possible outcomes anyone trying to plan their investments even planning for risk the uncertainty that's out there right now is so strong how can you manage or plan for sector rotation and timing it well get you wait until after the election next week to really make a decision of where you want to rotate your own investments or are you better off to try and rotate maybe to both possible outcomes before the election starts well you could hed your bet and both rotate to both but i would more or less suggest this um there's an expression in the business that says it's okay to be late it's not okay to be too late so if you don't quite hit the bottom on buying pharma that's okay you could wait till it starts to surge and pick up some momentum and start to to to you know wait in slowly but don't wait until the last minute till it's run away 20 or 30% you can kind of dollar cost average in you put a little bit in here wait a week outcome from the election comes out it's uncertain they got to cut account the votes there's they put on hold okay it moves up a little bit add a little bit more you don't have to do it you don't it's called chunking you have to chunk it all in one time you can raise cash add little here rotate here and there and do it progressively you don't have to do it in one fullon shot that would be the approach i would take well we're advocating for sector rotation in this discussion but is there another strategy and that is just to stay with some of those long and solid stocks maybe it's the tech giants that uh could still remain strong even through the sector rotation that might be coming is there a safe vet to maybe ignore sector rotation and just stick with some tried andrue stocks that are out there i would say absolutely you could just say listen i don't want to get involved and have to do due diligence and research and hem andha and struggle over this and stay the course but if you're going to stay that course what i would say is make sure the companies that you happen to be invested in are well healed which means they're well capitalized good cash flow can pay you a stable dividend are not as susceptible to the business cycle so if somebody said to me well i own starbucks i i don't see the point to getting out of starbucks i mcdonald's well there's no reason to rotate you got defensive plays that are in there but you have to be able in this business even to be an investor to be a little bit flexible and sensible and say listen i think i'm over capitalized or i'm overweighted in a lot of large cap tech i don't necessarily want to sell meta microsoft i don't want to incur a tax you know uh cost okay tax bill from the government got it but cutting back and just scaling down the risk not just as a form of profit taking but but raising cash to like take it back and prepare yourself for some type of maybe 10 or 15 or 20% plain vanilla every four-year uh correction is never a bad thing i've never ever said to a client oh my god you're raising cash how ridiculous is that raising cash is always a good thing whenever things are overheated or a high but raising cash when things are at a low that makes no sense that's where you put it to work but at a high it's okay to stay the course just don't stay o too over weighted and those mega caps the googles the metas the microsofts keep them hold them but maybe take off 10 or 20% put the cash away and start to revisit maybe putting it back them if it pulls back and if not you could might move it into bonds or crypto or gold something of another nature where it's not as correlated the word diversification is misused people say i own 500 stocks i'm diversified that's not what diversification means diversification is asset allocation via correlation that's what it means you can't have it all in the same direction no matter what product or assets you own so having something that's not correlated to the s&amp;p will actually offset and mitigate the risk in down times and that's something you can't prepare for by the time of the day but you can get ahead of the curve and say listen i know it's not expected but it's never too early that would be the approach i would take if i'd stay the course well some really good advice

heard a lot about sector rotation in the second half of 2024 but even more rotation could be underway after next week's election let's dive in today we have jeffrey beerman here to help walk investors through how to navigate potential rotations that could still be coming yet this year jeffrey is a finance professor at lyola university chicago and the chief market technician at theot trade jeff we are so excited to have you here at market be media today i'm just as excited to be here i've heard a lot of good things about market beat so oh good we know you have plenty of knowledge to share with our viewers here today too we're going to share some of your picks and where you think sector rotation could be headed no matter who wins the election we'll share your stock picks in just a little bit but first let's start out with the basics what exactly is sector rotation the just behind it is just is just this is that there are 11 different sectors in the economy or 11 different sectors that drive the s&amp;p 500 index some carry more weight than the others nevertheless the 11 sectors represent areas of the economy in the economic cycle so for instance you've got the economic cycle will peak it will trough on the way up growth sectors tend to take off so stocks like you know financial stocks will take off housing stocks will take off uh caterpillar deer cyclical stocks will take off but as the economy starts to moderate money will then shift from one sector to another sector based upon where you stand in the economy so the idea is the sector rotation is a leading indicator that moves about one step ahead or three months ahead of the actual economy so if you actually watch the market bridget and you see money moving from let's say technology and you're like oh it's going to oil it's a signal that we're moving from one phase of the economy to another phase of the economy but here's the thing they don't always move in step the same time they used to do historically there's been kind of a hiccup in between where some sectors will correlate and all of a sudden it's like they're not supposed to correlate and they do and then they break apart but sector rotation has primarily driven the market since about july yeah did we see any kind of sector rotation come into play with the fed rate cuts that we saw earlier this fall too we actually did that fed ray cut juiced the small caps like the russell went nuts and it should go nuts because higher interest rates are not good for small caps large caps can tolerate higher interest rates small caps can't because of the discounting mechanism and the borrowing mechanism so the small caps got their juice but somehow bridget they've kind of like they've kind of like hit a wall and just in the last month alone like november uh uh pardon me september's like the fed comes in and says we're going to cut rates we get the rat cut markets off to the races the problem is it's been rescinded the 50 basis point cuts already been taken away and then some right now the long bond the 30-year has gone from a 3 37 handle up to a 45 that means three separate 25 basis point hikes have been reins stilled by the bond market now careful on not the fed the bond market and the fed can start to make its move if it wants to but the bond market trumps the fed and those rising rates okay are putting a kabash on the s&amp;p in other words if the rates weren't to go up we could see the s&amp;p above 6,000 but the s&amp;p has hit 58 5900 bridget eight straight days and can't break it because that interest rate is a prohibitive level and it's inflationary and if you don't believe me the housing stocks got ding this week hard yesterday it was dr horton the day before was kb holmes these home builders why are these stocks falling because mortgage rates are going up and the invest and home buyers are getting off the fence and backing away saying we can't afford this right now and that's the sign of an inflationary economy that's not going to necessarily top it won't topple the market but it will put a a cap on it that's what the market's telling you this is so interesting because a month ago maybe two months ago right after those fed rate cuts came in people were talking invest in housing it's going to boom once these rate cuts come come down um and this is kind of exactly the opposite of what many people were predicting expecting to see in the market right now um what do you say to investors who were planning one way and now we're facing something very different well i i would take it like this um you don't have to be allin you don't have to sit there and tell me i own 100% stocks or i'm all on the s&amp;p it's an all or none game you don't have to do that you can take risk off the table and say hey look i'm just going to put onethird of money away you know it's okay to be wrong everybody's wrong i'm wrong every day it's just that's the nature of it it's not being wrong that matters it's how you manage your risk that matters okay so the idea here for me is if you're thinking like well interest rates are going to go back down they might just very well go back down and the fed might instigate a rate cut but you always have to approach the market as if you could be wrong think risk first reward second the rest will take care of itself i always put risk above reward only because if you manage risk you can survive forever if you can't manage risk you cannot survive forever it's like the lifeblood of how the business runs so if you if you're wrong on the way housing starts are don't fret a lot of people were a lot of the analysts are wrong my attitude is do some hedging in other words do some cross cross asset you know tactical asset allocations move a little bit of money to bonds bonds have backed off they become cheaper the yields are higher they're very competitive at 4 and a half% with the 2% on the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield um move a little little bit of money to gold even though gold's at a high because gold may stay there for a while with uncertainty or if at worst case scenario rotate your money and say listen i have most of my money in tech and financials and i've made a killing that's fine but maybe you move your money to some more defensive sectors like healthcare so there's just different ways of approaching sector rotation and sector rotation from an asset allocation perspective as well i just heard you mention planning for uncertainty and risk but we have a big shot of both of those things coming next week with the election so i want to know how could sector rotation come into play no matter who wins the election next week well if trump wins you know one thing he's going to kick in the spending so think about this he's going to go after to build a wall down by texas construction home depot lowe's caterpillar deer heavy machinery cyclicals in that sector you're you're going to start to see a lot of contractual work be hired there's jacobs engineering there's all kinds of like you know construction service companies large cap mega caps that's one area you should investigate if trump wins because he's going to spend and you know he's going to spend the second is he's going to spend like crazy on defense he is not going to let this war go run a muck the biden administration has cut back defense spending he's going to ramp it up so you might start looking at rathon general dynamics lock heat martin any one of these three stocks mega caps defense stocks uh even cyberware malware stocks this is the place you'd

language: en investors are taking notice of a stock that's already starting to climb but it could go even higher let's dive in here to talk about a stock that's seen a big boost just after earnings is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas let's dive into this stock uh first off what's the company uh the company is intuitive surgical they're a medtech company they make robotic um surgical devices they're experiencing some market leading growth um in the placement of their machines but also in increased um increased um procedures and that's got a real tailwind globally with increased approvals for procedures and its existing jurisdictions and new jurisdictions so it's just got a lot of tailwinds going for it right now yeah healthcare in general very popular industry and investors are taking notice especially after the earnings report that just came out this week kind of talk about what happened with the stock after that report well so the report was really good and it spurred um a 7% increase in the share price but what's really significant is that that movement confirms a larger technical signal the stock's been rattling pretty strongly since earlier in the year um it was flying a bullish flag pattern which is just a signal of the market saying hey look at me we're getting ready to rally and then this earnings report confirmed that outlook the stock price surged to a new high and now we're looking at probably a 20 to 30% upside from these levels that's a very bright future ahead for this stock but it's really been a great fall for this company even before the earnings report came out kind of walk us back through when they started to really go up well this stock has been in an uptrend for quite some time uh periodic rests and pauses and corrections but basically an uptrend for quite a few years driven on its growth it is a market leading um medical device company it's got um the industry leading surgical device robotic surgical device it is an ai play for ai assisted surgeries remote surgeries and it's got a lot of tailwinds in the expanding global population deepening penetration of healthc care services and then its own placement of devices it's broadening its base it's also increasing procedure volumes so it's really building and has been building leverage for itself for quite some time what else about its q3 earnings report had investors and analyst so excited well it just continues the trend this company is in such great shape it's got no debt it's got very low liabilities its cash position is increasing it's building equity for investors while investing in the company it really can do whatever it wants to do um at this last report it's got8 billion dollar in cash which is up from the previous year uh so this all just plays into the investor value and investor sentiment well let's talk about analyst sentiment for a little bit i think that's why many investors are excited about this stock talk about what analysts are saying well the analysts really like the report uh the trend before the report was positive with upgrades and price target revisions that trend has continued following the report they are definitely leading the market to new highs uh the high end of their target range is in alignment with some of the technical targets so i would really be surprised that this that this stock didn't continue higher for 20 to 30 per. now you've mentioned this a little bit thomas just about part of the the boost for this business is how much there's a need for health care across the globe um is there any other factors that could impact this company when way or another or is it just one of those companies and a product that everybody's going to need um i think it's one of those things that everybody's going to end up using uh because it's getting new approvals and in new territories on a regular basis but also within existing territories new approvals for expanded uses um people are leaning more and more into health care this company is certainly um servicing needs and it's got the ai the ai factor so i think those are all just real positive tailwinds for the business over time any advice for investors looking to get in on this stock maybe for the first time when when to get in well i'd wait for a price pullback they're they're sure to come uh you don't want to tra chase a market higher but as i said this stock has got a pretty bullish uh trajectory got a pretty bullish story got some clear momentum so those pullbacks might not be too frequent and they might not be that deep when they come so it sounds like their innovations in healthcare are really paying off in a field that has so much demand right now are there any other companies that are getting close to what intuitive surgical is doing right now well there is quite a bit of competition i would say that most of the large medtech companies are trying to get into the robotic surgical um segment but they're all playing catchup none of them are pure plays so that's two advantages that intuitive surgical has it's that that first player advantage and market leadership well thank you very much for diving into the stock with us today thomas you can find more about this stock and many others on marketbeat.com and learn more info about any of these stocks right here on our channel watch our next video and see if

big boost in the stock after yesterday's earnings report here to dive into the details is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas that stock really went up yesterday after this report yeah it it did shoot up quite remarkably i think about 15% that was uh pretty unexpected but i think the move is a lot of optimism and enthusiasm um over the margin which is you know was really good but i think that ultimately the gains will be capped for 2024 at the top of a trading range so uh investors should really be careful about chasing this market higher yeah this is a a big reaction obviously coming out after this report let's dive into some of the things that investors are reacting to what has them excited let's start there well i think what has them excited more than anything else is the margin uh the company was able to widen its margin significantly um on lower cost and cost controls but also on a boom in selling tax credits um and in strengthen their other businesses they're growing by double digits but they're about 15% of the total so they're not going to be a significant growth driver over the next year the core business only grew by 2% that's like 80% slower than the rest of the industry so this is a sign of loss of market share and a serious headwind for the business that will continue to blow over the next year while it might be a while before it comes investors seem to be really excited about a couple of products specifically that tesla has plans for coming out in the next two years right so they're expecting to launch the uh the code name model 2 the lower price models um early next year and then the cyber cab is supposed to be real viable uh by early 2026 uh but it is questionable that either of those things will happen according to the timeline and that's just a factor that will help support the price over time but also make cap gains um in the near term as we wait to see what happens let's talk a little bit more about the cyber cab and kind of the company's move towards automation it seemed like investors were excited to hear about that too uh hoping to kind of broaden their potential for revenue growth in the future well right uh so in the words of elon musk himself this automation the cyber cab is the company's future the market's been expecting a model to come out in the $25,000 range and he says that's going to be unlikely because the cyber cab is expected to cost $25,000 he doubl down saying that automation is the company's future growth trajectory so eventually once um the fsd technology becomes real viable um he expects all cars to be automated and in that world um only cyber cabs will exist because we won't need to have our own cars we can just say hey cybercat come pick me up and they'll be one ready for you well investors who might be excited about that kind of future might be behind some of this big runup in the stock right now um let's talk about what's currently happening with tesla and that's not the cyber cab that's the cyber truck starting to see more of these all over the place talk about the profitability of that line well it's improving uh but it's it's still one of the drags on the margin but ultimately the margin news was real good they achieved their lowest cost per vehicle on on record so across the system they're doing a very good job to reduce their cost and that is really critical for the long-term uh trajectory of the stock price and the company's profitability let's get into how long you think this runup might stick around all of the the things about the company we just talked about do you think this 15% run up is sustainable is it going to go higher or are we going to see a little pullback coming soon well i think that it could go a little bit higher but the stock is trading within a well-established range it probably has about another 10% to go to hit the top of the range but i would expect to see the gains capped there um the analysts i mean they're pretty optimistic about the news they're looking towards the future as well and they have been increasing their price target since the news was released but they didn't upgrade the stock it's still pegged at a hold and the price target increase were pretty minimal uh they're still um within a pretty tight range and the consensus is still below the critical resistance point so i think that that is another factor that will limit the upside potential this year yeah do you think in a couple of years we might see some more swings this stock as they do move to making that more automation a reality i think that there'll be some pretty big uh price wings in tesla but uh the thing with this company they're very successful they're on a good trajectory trory the only question is timing so i would uh i would be prepared to buy it when it dips and to sell it when it rips all right well thank you very much thomas for coming on to talk about this stock that everyone is talking about right now this week we have more on tesla on this channel we've covered this company lots of times so go ahead and dig into some of those other videos that we've done talking about tesla and as always

big boost in the stock after yesterday's earnings report here to dive into the details is market beat analyst thomas hughes thomas that stock really went up yesterday after this report yeah it it did shoot up quite remarkably i think about 15% that was uh pretty unexpected but i think the move is a lot of optimism and enthusiasm um over the margin which is you know was really good but i think that ultimately the gains will be capped for 2024 at the top of a trading range so uh investors should really be careful about chasing this market higher yeah this is a a big reaction obviously coming out after this report let's dive into some of the things that investors are reacting to what has them excited let's start there well i think what has them excited more than anything else is the margin uh the company was able to widen its margin significantly um on lower cost and cost controls but also on a boom in selling tax credits um and in strengthen their other businesses they're growing by double digits but they're about 15% of the total so they're not going to be a significant growth driver over the next year the core business only grew by 2% that's like 80% slower than the rest of the industry so this is a sign of loss of market share and a serious headwind for the business that will continue to blow over the next year while it might be a while before it comes investors seem to be really excited about a couple of products specifically that tesla has plans for coming out in the next two years right so they're expecting to launch the uh the code name model 2 the lower price models um early next year and then the cyber cab is supposed to be real viable uh by early 2026 uh but it is questionable that either of those things will happen according to the timeline and that's just a factor that will help support the price over time but also make cap gains um in the near term as we wait to see what happens let's talk a little bit more about the cyber cab and kind of the company's move towards automation it seemed like investors were excited to hear about that too uh hoping to kind of broaden their potential for revenue growth in the future well right uh so in the words of elon musk himself this automation the cyber cab is the company's future the market's been expecting a model to come out in the $25,000 range and he says that's going to be unlikely because the cyber cab is expected to cost $25,000 he doubl down saying that automation is the company's future growth trajectory so eventually once um the fsd technology becomes real viable um he expects all cars to be automated and in that world um only cyber cabs will exist because we won't need to have our own cars we can just say hey cybercat come pick me up and they'll be one ready for you well investors who might be excited about that kind of future might be behind some of this big runup in the stock right now um let's talk about what's currently happening with tesla and that's not the cyber cab that's the cyber truck starting to see more of these all over the place talk about the profitability of that line well it's improving uh but it's it's still one of the drags on the margin

has been a fall of volatility in the stock market but as the election approaches things are starting to change today we have don kaufman the co-founder of theot trade here with us today to talk about this season of volatility and what you can do to protect your investments and maybe benefit during the season we're going to give those tips coming up in just a minute but first let's talk about where we are in the market right now as far as volatility how does this compare to where we've been before yeah you know one of the uh surprising aspects right now about volatility is it's relatively high given the fact that the the marketplace the market being s&amp;p 500 is at our near all-time highs so you know even markets are sitting you know skyhigh levels volatility is still relatively high and that's relative to where it has been over the last uh the last few years and for those of you uh not necessarily familiar with volatility we can reference vix i mean vix very comfortable talking about vix and in and around that 20 region is you know uh you know 20 years ago was was average but now that's that's relatively high volatility in today's marketplace yeah we saw vix really spike earlier this year has it come down sim since then yeah actually there's a really interesting phenomenon going on uh well right here right now in front of us with uh with volatility although it's still high it's actually come down quite considerably just in the last uh week 10 trading sessions and it has to do with some of the election risk starting to finally aate to some degree yeah what exactly do the markets say about this election well there's there's actually quite a bit they say i mean there's a few aspects i would look at one of them is obviously volatility so volatility coming down just says all right the nature of the election has less uncertainty because as volatility comes down you know markets are just you know a little bit more certain about who and what the outcome could actually be now to get really specific in terms of like what the market is saying i would look a lot at the us dollar and the us dollar over the last three weeks is exploding to the upside i mean there's been like one down day uh some phenomenal moves right now though inside of that dollar market so along with the american dollar going up there's another field and that's gold that's really getting new highs right now you know what's incredible about that is it's a little bit of a cat22 usually when you see the dollar going up that's actually going to hurt some of the commodities because they're priced in dollars gold to me it's it's rally right now it's unfortunately one of the scariest trades that i'm seeing it's inflationary there's just no question because uh the dollar the us dollar going up as dramatically as it is it should put pressure into gold meaning gold actually seeing some sell-side activity on the contrary we're actually seeing gold rally with that uh now there's constant you know the drum beat of the us debt and the uh the interest on that debt is getting louder and louder and we're seeing gold rally uh rally with it um you know frankly look the situation might not necessarily be coming to a head like you know tomorrow or a week from now but the debt situation in the united states the situation is actually coming to a head and uh it's evidence there's going to have to be something done about it but you know what is gold going to hit 3,000 before anybody starts to listen quite plausibly it's so interesting to see the dollar and gold going up at the same time very interesting combination um let's talk about another area you're talking about debt but interest rates in general we saw the first fed rate cut in years uh what has the market done since then you know it's ironic that you mentioned that as well because it also relates back to the election if you uh if you listen to some of the uh the election the campaigns are like and interest rates are going down uh on the contrary interest rates specifically the five year the 10 year the 30- year have actually soared higher since the fed has cut i'll give you specifics in here so if we were to look at the 10-year that's the 10-year obviously treasury and the interest rate associated with it a few weeks back right when the fed was cutting by 50 basis points right um the interest rate was actually in the 10 year was sitting right around 3.6% uh today it's actually over 4.1% so most of your mortgage mortages even though you have a 30-year mortgage even a 15year mortgage those are actually based off the 10year and uh the rates are actually soaring on them um uncomfortably so uh the speed to which it's going up and you know we haven't seen a too dramatic of an impact to a home builders yet but that's actually a trade opportunity that could be there where you know the home builders could start to actually come down but so you've got uh asset classes that don't typically trade in these correlations we're all over the place right now gold up the dollar's up interest rates are up s&amp;p are almost at all-time highs and elections coming up um it's not the most comfortable marketplace it's probably one of the reasons volatility has been higher she not one of the more comfortable marketplaces that i've been in in the last you know 25 plus years all of the things you just mentioned are why a lot of investors are looking for some guidance how to you manage your own portfolios your own investments in the middle of this uncertainty so in in two very definitive sides of me so i have an investment side and then i've got a little bit more of the trader side the trader in me if i'm going to get bullish or bearish i'm going to use spreads i'm going to use spreads i because i want to mitigate the total exposure spread basically says like look if i go out and take a trade inside of apple i know exactly what my risk is going to be you know it's it's a150 getting in here or it's a dollar getting in there i know exactly what that's going to be so i'm going to take measured just you know pokes at the marketplace looking okay for specific upside opportunities andor downside opportunities now that would be the trader in me the investor look investment right now with snps at all-time high makes me nervous but the s&amp;p have been continuously hitting all-time highs i am really okay avidly into what we term long short okay there are areas that for instance i own you know uh a few of the tech companies right now but i'm also heavily short for example the financials there's nothing wrong with creating short positions when i say short that means in the financials uh i use the xlf and i may actually substantiate a position okay where i'm actually short shares or okay using a deep in the money option uh to simulate a short share it's what we call a synthetic that would be for somebody like that traded inside of an ira but in no uncertain terms like i'm just not comfortable in these markets just saying like okay i'm going to buy the s&amp;p 500 and uh buy and prey is is not going to be a good strategy for the foreseeable future and we've actually heard uh some of the largest banking institutions in the world just in the last 24 hours talk specifically about that that future returns for like the next decade are going to be largely mitigated due to higher volatility higher interest rates okay debt issues um this going to be a challenging time this is going to be a time where you're going to have to learn more than just throw money at the market and uh and pre that's unfortunate but that's you know what what firms like theot trade do is re-educate uh specifically around those logics absolutely i think we've heard that from our analysts here too at market beat that this is just the start of volatility a lot of people in the market a lot of analysts are expecting this volatility to continue um and no volatility means you can't predict it right anything could happen and that's why we're in this uncertainty but if you were to give traders some advice here on the next two weeks we've got an election coming up when do you see the markets reacting most when do you see the most volatile moves in the market surrounding the election you know uh ironically is i don't think we're going to hold out to the election i think we're uh you know days maybe even hours away from larger bursts of volatility coming out and uh that's specifically you know uh again once we the markets have kind of subsided like that election risk that fear starts to go away like look um there's a lot of areas that are going to get wild and wild in a hurry uh tech being one of them i mean look there's uh you know situations where tech may actually be in trouble in the very near term um with a republican nominee um and going back into the white house so that unto itself could actually create degrees of volatility uh moreover i mean look we have an explosive dollar right now that is going to be uh exporting inflation in a big way so um whether you you know believe what uh you know republicans coming in there or not push that aside for a second the dollar rallying is exporting inflation so what the fed is also going to do right after the election is going to be fairly critical and they very well may not actually cut interest rates like that inflation again that that drum beat is also getting louder in this marketplace where inflation could come raging back in here and the markets could actually again come to the assumption look if republicans are actually nominated that clearly means inflation's actually coming back let's uh let's actually see some sside activity to uh to markets but uh either way you want to put this this is not going to go quietly off into the night after the election like you mentioned we do have a fed rate cut still or a fed rate decision coming up after that too so there's more factors than just the election but do you see the volatility coming down at any point post election and when might that happen if so on the contrary i think we're actually seeing the low in volatility right now so we had a bit of a volatility spike the last few trading sessions it backed off as we start to come closer to the election though i think it may take back off to the upside and uh after the uh in a postelection marketpl i think we're going to see considerably more volatility look um there's going to be a whole lot of chaos coming into this marketplace the uncertainty okay of a nominee or even better than that maybe we don't have clear results for two to three weeks after the election which is even if we think we know who's going to win this okay clear and concise results okay are anything but a certainty of uh especially in today's day and age so that unto itself i mean everything that you want to look at like the deck is kind of stacked right now to see more volatility not only coming into the election but uh thereafter so let's speak more to those long-term investors as we close out today what can they do or should they be doing something to protect their investments right now are there safer options they can do um to try and escape some of this volatile time that we're going to have coming up in the next couple of weeks and months especially you know there's there's uh there's no shame in actually you know reducing some of the overall exposure you know the easiest hedge and hedge is risk reduction the easiest risk mitigation tactic is to actually pull like you know onethird of your capital put it in cash for a period of time that's the great thing about being an individual investor is that you can do what you want when you want how you want um you know not like a mutual fund that has to stay fully vested okay you have the opportunity to to mitigate some of your exposure and with snps at all-time highs why not i mean what are you going to do oh if we do explode to the upside miss a little bit more put that capital back to work a little later but there's no problem okay this business does not have to be all or none you don't have to be allin or not you know cut your risk by oneir one half um be able to at least sleep at night because we are going to come into a bit of chaos in this marketplace right here in the near term some very good advice no shame and being a little safer right now thank you so so much for your time today don and you can find more of don's and theot trades information we'll put a link to their website right here are you working on anything special coming up soon don absolutely actually we're uh we're definitely discussing uh volatility trading in more volatile markets this is uh does

momentum in your portfolio here's three stocks that could help joining us now is market bead analyst thomas hughes he has three picks for us that we're going to get to in just a little bit of stocks that are really gaining some momentum in the fourth quarter of 2024 but first thomas let's just give a quick overview of what momentum trades are all about i would say that momentum trading is the core trading anybody that's doing directional trades especially is using momentum to their advantage and even people that are doing non-directional trading using option strategies are still using momentum to some degree and in that case possibly a lack of it so momentum trading is really foundational to all trading strategies well let's get to your three picks of stocks that have a lot of momentum for the q4 of this year uh what's your first company well the first stock is meta platforms and i got these stocks off of market beats list of most upgraded stocks and i don't call them good momentum trades simply because they're on this list but because the trends and analyst sentiment combin with the news cycle and the fundamental stories all tie in together and as far as the analysts go the analysts have been raising their estimates on meta platforms and the other stocks on this list and have lifted meta from lower down in the rankings to the number one spot so coming out of the the q2 reporting cycle going into q3 meta platforms is the the most upgraded stock on the market uh which shows a high level of support from analyst and analyst support can be extrapolated to mean market support because a lot of us traders and investors are following what the analysts are doing right now they're leading meta to new all-time highs and they're still boosting their targets the earnings reporter is throughout end of the month they're still boosting their targets um i would expect that trend to continue meta story right now is that its year of of efficiency which started two years ago with is compounded by ai improvements that have boosted user metrics and revenue metrics now we have the virtual reality story starting to come into a little bit more of a fruition with some new product releases and some technology advances i would expect the upcoming report to be very strong and to continue that momentum of analyst sentiment all right so meta is your first momentum pick what's the next pick you have for a stock that could see a lot of momentum this winter uh the next pick is poo alto networks now poo alto networks is in a long-term uptrend driven by analysts earlier in the year their camus took a bit of a dip when they announced a lean into platformization that lean in the platformization included offering some free and reduced price products which impacted the outlook for revenue and earnings thereby impacting the analyst sentiment the story now though is that paloalto networks is outperforming due to strength and the cyber security um industry as well as the effects of its own efforts at platformization the analyst sentiment has shifted back towards upward revisions and they're driving the stock price higher that company also releases earnings pretty soon and i would expect it to be another good solid report extending that trend of upward revisions this stock is one of those that's gaining a lot of attention from some pretty bigname investors right that's true um one of the stories this year is the interest by congress palo outo networks is one of the most bought stocks by congress and uh nancy the biggest whaling congress has made couple purchases this year i see that as being supportive for the market over time let's move on to your final pick of a stock that you see having a lot of momentum this winter right the last pick is oracle oracle's only fifth on the list of most upgraded stocks but that's from being like in 25th or 35th place earlier in the year it's certainly seen a huge boost and sentiment and that is completely tied to it shift to cloud-based services oracle was a legacy software provider now it's emerging as a cloud hyperscaler and critical to ai infrastructure the last report came out only a month or so ago but it was better than expected and included a new deal with aws that deal is critical because it means it's now got to deal with microsoft amazon and google to embed its products in their cloud which makes its products available to like 95 or 98% of all cloud users that is a huge tailwind for the business and certainly is an affirmation of its position as an ai services and and infrastructure provider those sound like three great stock picks for some momentum ahead this winter season thanks for sharing some details on those thomas you can find lots of videos just like this one right here on our channel marketbeat media we cover all kinds of stocks that maybe you haven't heard of or some you have heard of but could have a big upside potential still ahead check out some of our videos

momentum in your portfolio here's three stocks that could help joining us now is market bead analyst thomas hughes he has three picks for us that we're going to get to in just a little bit of stocks that are really gaining some momentum in the fourth quarter of 2024 but first thomas let's just give a quick overview of what momentum trades are all about i would say that momentum trading is the core trading anybody that's doing directional trades especially is using momentum to their advantage and even people that are doing non-directional trading using option strategies are still using momentum to some degree and in that case possibly a lack of it so momentum trading is really foundational to all trading strategies well let's get to your three picks of stocks that have a lot of momentum for the q4 of this year uh what's your first company well the first stock is meta platforms and i got these stocks off of market beats list of most upgraded stocks and i don't call them good momentum trades simply because they're on this list but because the trends and analyst sentiment combin with the news cycle and the fundamental stories all tie in together and as far as the analysts go the analysts have been raising their estimates on meta platforms and the other stocks on this list and have lifted meta from lower down in the rankings to the number one spot so coming out of the the q2 reporting cycle going into q3 meta platforms is the the most upgraded stock on the market uh which shows a high level of support from analyst and analyst support can be extrapolated to mean market support because a lot of us traders and investors are following what the analysts are doing right now they're leading meta to new all-time highs and they're still boosting their targets the earnings reporter is throughout end of the month they're still boosting their targets um i would expect that trend to continue meta story right now is that its year of of efficiency which started two years ago with is compounded by ai improvements that have boosted user metrics and revenue metrics now we have the virtual reality story starting to come into a little bit more of a fruition with some new product releases and some technology advances i would expect the upcoming report to be very strong and to continue that momentum of analyst sentiment all right so meta is your first momentum pick what's the next pick you have for a stock that could see a lot of momentum this winter uh the next pick is poo alto networks now poo alto networks is in a long-term uptrend driven by analysts earlier in the year their camus took a bit of a dip when they announced a lean into platformization that lean in the platformization included offering some free and reduced price products which impacted the outlook for revenue and earnings thereby impacting the analyst sentiment the story now though is that paloalto networks is outperforming due to strength and the cyber security um industry as well as the effects of its own efforts at platformization the analyst sentiment has shifted back towards upward revisions and they're driving the stock price higher that company also releases earnings pretty soon and i would expect it to be another good solid report extending that trend of upward revisions this stock is one of those that's gaining a lot of attention from some pretty bigname investors right that's true um one of the stories this year is the interest by congress palo outo networks is one of the most bought stocks by congress and uh nancy the biggest whaling congress has made couple purchases this year i see that as being supportive for the market over time let's move on to your final pick of a stock that you see having a lot of momentum this winter right the last pick is oracle oracle's only fifth on the list of most upgraded stocks but that's from being like in 25th or 35th place earlier in the year it's certainly seen a huge boost and sentiment and that is completely tied to it shift to cloud-based services oracle was a legacy software provider now it's emerging as a cloud hyperscaler and critical to ai infrastructure the last report came out only a month or so ago but it was better than expected and included a new deal with aws that deal is critical because it means it's now got to deal with microsoft amazon and google to embed its products in their cloud which makes its products available to like 95 or 98% of all cloud users that is a huge tailwind for the business and certainly is an affirmation of its position as an ai services and and infrastructure provider those sound like three great stock picks for some momentum ahead this winter season thanks for sharing some details on those thomas you can find lots of videos just like this one right here on our channel marketbeat media we cover all kinds of stocks that maybe you haven't heard of or some you have heard of but could have a big upside potential still ahead check out some of our videos
