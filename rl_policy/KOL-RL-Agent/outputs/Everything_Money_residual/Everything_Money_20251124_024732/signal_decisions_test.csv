2024-10-02,SKZQGX8av0A,"kind: captions language: en guys i created a shortcut that would allow me to look at a company from a very high level very quickly to see what kind of questions and what my next steps are for analyzing the business and i called that my eight pillar process here are the eight pillars and what they each mean i'm going to pull up an example with microsoft so we pull microsoft we pull up the eight pillars in the eight pillars tab first one fiveyear pe ratio less than 22.5 what i did here was take the current market cap of the company 3.22 and i divide it by the total earnings of the last five years you can get that by going to the net income adding up all five years of net of net income and if it's less than 22.5 it's a check if it's greater than it's an x fiveyear return on invested capital basically the invested capital is how much cash flow the business is making based on the money invested in the business in terms of equity and debt take the last five years of the free cash flow divided by the current equity and debt and the last quarter that's our roic for the last 5 years shares outstanding very simple high the shares outstanding this last quarter versus 5 years ago quarter that's simple if it's less than it's a check if it's greater than it's an x cash flow growth in the last 5 years very simple has there been more cash flow this last 12 months versus five years ago the answer is yes check mark 5year net income growth again is there c is there net income growth in the last 12 months versus 5 years ago answer is yes check mark revenue growth is there more revenue in the last 12 months versus 5 years ago very simple now long-term liabilities divided by 5year free cash flow divid by five so i take the total longterm liabilities on the balance sheet i take the average fiveyear free cash flow i divide the long-term liabilities by the fiveyear free cash flow if it's less than five it's a check if it's more than five it's an x for microsoft it's around two so basically says two out of the last 5 years average free cash flow could pay off all the long-term liabilities and the final pillar fiveyear price of free cash flow less than 22.5 take the current market cap this is similar to the pe ratio take the current market cap divided by the total of the last five years free cash flow is that less than 22.5 if it is a check if it's more then it's u an x but these are the things that made sense to me i want to see companies that had a good roic why it means they have a moat as the ro is higher and they can invest the money to higher rate of return so it means they can go compound their profit even faster than others okay shares outstanding now this is a tricky one i want to see shares down but the most important part is the story we're telling ourselves combining this with these two is always a little bit of reservation i don't want them buying back expensive shares that's what i mean when i tell people the eight pillars are telling a story i'm combining the pillars i'm coming up with questions okay so they're buying back shares but their stocks currently expensive have they been buying back shares recently at an elevated valuation where they only buying back shares when things are cheap these are the questions to ask and this goes very quickly i'm spending the next 10 minutes talking about these but you'll get to the point where you're looking at them blink of an eye and saying boom and one of the most annoying things in the world to me on twitter is when i see people who are so thirsty for attention they say i spent the last 300 hours researching this and this is what i found well then you're inefficient that's stupid if you truly know something well you can do it very quickly guys i want to stress anybody who brags about how much research they've done let me put it this way i've never met anybody who brags about how much work they've done and i've been impressed with them to me it's just an excuse in the future for oops i made a mistake but look all the research i did it's not coincidental that charlie munger and warren buffett some of the best investors of all time say if we can't do it very quickly in the back of a napkin we're not doing it yet you have everybody else has all these excel sheets and things open and blah blah blah guys you'll see shortly our stock analyzer tool is a very simple discounted cash flow model that's it because the point is to keep it as simple as possible as you go through these things you'll understand very quickly the things that gra that you gravitate towards but it's super super important to remember that simple is better in investing all the news is going to follow the stock price when it's going up to say how awesome it is all the news is going to follow it on the way down it says how bad it is what's important for you is to think longterm and say i don't care about these short-term decisions and i did my quick research and i realized this is a good company at a great price i use my eight pillars to pre-screen that's how i use it if i see a lot of x's here unless there's a reason for that like go okay move on find the next one cuz guys there's 10,000 plus companies out there for you to buy go weed them out to the 20 or 30 that you actually want to spend time researching don't go sit there and research every single one of them if you do that then you will waste a lot of time and you'll get nothing done all right so few things also cash flow growth and net income growth are they growing do they have more cash flow net income today than they did five years ago revenue are they growing do they have more revenue they did today than five years ago remember i want to buy companies that have growth doesn't matter to me how much growth it is this is a very important factor but remember if it's like southwest and disney during the covid this is going to be x's right here x right here x right here it's all part of a story and you understanding that story next and probably one of the more important ones do they have reasonable debt this is one of the few that if there's a lot of debt on there i immedately run away from it guys debt is awesome it's a great way to grow but a well-managed and well- growing business doesn't need debt to do better it's just an excuse for whatever reason listen i'm not going to say who it is but somebody i know r runs a5 billion dollar company and he loves taking on debt why because he loves paying himself a dividend and that to me is the most selfish thing you can do as a ceo and these two things right here can lay a lot out there is what how does the management think how is management going to run their company to me i have eight or nine business upstairs the only ones that have debt are the real estate ones you can run a good business without a lot of debt or any debt at all now every story is going to be different different x's different checks this one is i don't remember what company i picked microsoft this one tells me that this is a well-run company low debt not buying back a lot of shares which is okay at these high valuations so it may just be an expensive company but remember if they're have a high return invested capital if they have a lot of growth potential these could be x's for no reason other than they're just above 22.5 it could still be a good investment that's why you don't make decisions just based on these eight pillars you make a decision based on screening out from here deciding what am i going to do with this information what do i need to look at next this is exactly why we have all these tools in our community this exactly why we have the community now you may noticed if you've looked at our website everything money.com we only have a limited number of daily spots for the everything money community and software including the eight pillars and the reason for that is the software as it exists today currently includes everything for retirement stocks in real estate we now have four youtube channels and probably growing even further from there so behind the scenes it's very important that we make some big changes as we continue to expand our offerings now these offers are going to be separated all these are going to be separated very soon and the current offer of everything is going away now you may remember if you've been watching us from the beginning this software started as literally me on excel sheet and people asking hey how do i get that excel sheet how do i get that software and i finally said let's just make it for everybody so i use this software every single day to make better decisions and for my team to make better decisions in all aspects of my money but the channel's growing the community is growing and they've grown immensely since we started i remember the first day we offered the software we had 2200 youtube subscribers we now have 270,000 youtube subscribers so it's becoming less about me and more about how i can better serve you in the community members but the good news is these changes haven't been made so if you join today you'll be grandfathered in for life with all these tools all this data and you'll be in your price tier forever you'll get all of this and your price tier forever it's the best deal we've ever offered so if you're serious about making better financial decisions probably increasing your returns but more importantly sleeping better at night click on the link in the description below and you'll get everything we have here and i'm very confident it'll be a great decision you're making now once i find a company here that i've sat there and said okay even before i do research i like all of this before you go any further what do i do i go to the stock aner tool now what is stock analyzer tool stock analyzer is an incredibly powerful tool that helps investors evaluate and analyze stocks using key financial metrics and i use it daily its purpose is to simplify the investment process by allowing users to make assumptions about a company's future performance such as revenue growth profit margins free cash flow and price to earnings ratios it analyzes data based on investors expectations and desired returns the key thing here is that it saves you so much time with the right assumptions you can know within seconds of a stock is worth doing more research on if you need to wait until the price falls further or if it belongs in the twoo hard pile am i going to pass on things that end up being great investments for sure because a lot of companies in their early early stages that can compound have a great story and it might feel like you're overpaying based on the numbers but it's about if it's so egregious let's say microsoft was 405 and it should be selling for 50 is my value why go further why go any further now if you came with a value of 350 i would sit there and say hang on a second this is pretty close maybe there's things that put you over the edge saying you know i think i'm gonna buy this or maybe you find things out saying you know what 350 is my price i'm just gna be patient there the next step to your analysis is use the stock analyzer tool sit here how many years you want to analyze it for you can do one to 20 years sit there and put that in there put your revenue growth assump i love when people say value investors don't care about growth when my very first input is growth put your profit margin your free cash flow your multiples your desired return if the numbers at the bottom even if they're all red even if they come out all red but they're close do more digging get yourself ready let's pull up the last time i did microsoft last time i did microsoft here are the numbers i got we're at 405 and my fair value is 350 to 325 guys it's getting pretty close so what does that mean hey be ready to pull the trigger cuz guess what two or three years ago my fair value on microsoft was 150 to 180 it's gone up significantly since then so it's about understanding where the company is right now relating the story with the numbers but you've got to be able to do that once you put it in stock analyzer tool and see how close you are then if it's close go do more due diligence go into the community have the conversation see what others have said about it because we have thousands of people in here and i guarantee you're not looking the stock that nobody else has gone through so guys if you want to see the 18 stocks that i own watch our next

2024-10-04,XOtH7989y8c,kind: captions language: en schwab asset management has announced a three for one stock split for 20 of their etfs including the ever so popular sc chd to make it cheaper for investors to purchase shares now on paper sd shares will look cheaper but i'm going to share the truth about stock splits and how this may actually affectd currently sd trades at $84 per share which means the split where to happen today on 3 for one the share price would be closer to around $28 per share sc is a blend of the higher yield dividend companies matching the dow 100 dividend companies the current dividend yield ond is 3.5% sd has a total of 103 positions and the top 10 holdings alone make up 40% of the etf now here's actually the list of the top 25 holdings ford and as you can see there companies you know home depot verizon black rock cisco texas instruments all the way down here this is their percent weight from 4.3% all the way down to 1.14% now it's very important to remember dividends are a fun thing to get i recently did a video about how i'm coming into some money from the sale of a company and i plan on trying to live off this money the rest of my life now since then i've gotten so many messages on instagram on twitter and by the way follow me on those if you want to interact about people saying finally you see the point of dividend no i'm taking taking a portion of my net worth to live off of to get a little bit of capital growth to generate income through dividends and options to live off of this is not my investment remember guys dividends feel wonderful and great but dividends are one of five things that a company can do with its free cash flow you have to remember dividends are highly tax inefficient in order to pay a dividend the company has to have cash flow that cash flow is generated after they've already paid their corporate income taxes then you get the dividend and you know what you do from there you pay another tax on top of that so whenever i hear people say oh it's unfair that dividends are going to rich people and they're only taxed at the lower capital gains rate yeah but if they own the company they're being tax twice there so it's really important to understand that although dividends are wonderful and great to feel they don't actually make you richer you're taking from a company that you own a piece of and put it into your pocket but you've also paid taxes on that when the cash stays in the company a lot of people have a hard time remembering and understanding this when the cash stays in the company you have an ownership stake in that cash so theoretically you're actually less wealthy because you've already paid that dividend now of course a lot of people would say well no wait a second paul i get that cash it can ever be taken away from me i'll give you that of course the money sits in the in the company's accounts they can go spend it on bad things or good things the point is a company should only pay a dividend in my opinion if it's the last resort for the company because remember there are five things you can do with a company's cash flow pay a dividend buy back shares invest in yourself make ac acquisitions or pay down debt i do believe that dividend should be the last thing done with the company's money now remember a lot of brokerages have fractional shares of stocks and etfs so you might be wondering why would schwab do this split remember what a stock split actually does it takes a piece of pie if you have a piece of pie right here cut into four pieces this is the size of the pie all stock split does is if it's a two for one makes it into eight pieces has the size of the pie changed not at all but people always think that makes the stock cheaper it does not it makes the price of the stock lower so you can buy more shares but now instead of buying with sd's uh purpose instead of buying one share you're getting three shares that's it so everybody who owns a hd right now if you own one share of stock you get an additional two more if you own 10 you get 20 more it's taking your ownership and 3x in it that's it the fundamentals behind the companies in the portfolio have not changed they're still generating cash flow they're still doing it on their own basis all you're doing is allowing the stock and etf to be able to be accessed so you can feel richer by owning more shares that's it it is not actually making you wealthier it is not making the etf for the stock better especially with an etf none of these companies have changed none of these companies did a stock split because ofd stock split none of this happened now remember going back to this i love the fact that these etfs low expense ratio this actually lower than spy great dividend yield and this assumes that the stock state these current levels of pricing so you look at as going let's say the market pulls back quite a bit lot of these stocks fall 30% this dividend yield is going to jump up this could jump up close to 5% that's a big dividend yield and it feels good and i always tell people if you're closer to retirement you want some capital growth and you want some income this is a great option i'm not going to lie to you though i do chuckle when i see people who are younger investing in sd if you're young you should want to invest in companies that can take their cash and keep compounding high returns on invested capital is what you should want to get so let's look at the history ofd relative to the performance of the s&amp;p 500 because it's really really important understand that since sd started back in 2011 this is its performant versus the s&amp;p 500 the s&amp;p 500 total return including dividends has been 52% sd 407 this is a big difference but i want everybody to keep in mind the split started basically in 2023 until then it was pretty close but as you can tell sd was always tra trailing and i think that's going to be the case ford in the future it is going to trail the s&amp;p 500 why because the companies that pay a lot of dividends tend to be very very mature companies that can't really grow their earnings per share and their revenue at high rates with the s&amp;p 500 though there'll be a lot of companies in there that aren't paying dividends that are reinvesting their cash to generate more and more profit so naturally their profit should go faster their revenue should go faster and therefore the market cap of the company should grow faster you're seeing that here now since this occurred what's happened here you've had nvidia you've had all the mag 7 absolutely pull away so we really don't have a bare market really to look at here but i will tell you this this bare market here scd did not do as bad as the s&amp;p 500 during the covid crash so i do think it's a way to kind of even out some more returns don't don't get me wrong this still went down a lot during co but it wasn't as bad as the s&amp;p 500 and my guess is when there is finally a bare market the max 7 and all the highflying stocks that drove the s&amp;p values up will probably fall a lot bigger than the scd numbers but again if your goal is capital growth which it should be allow yourself to compound at high rates of higher rates of return without paying taxes i don't know if sd is the right move for you now everybody's position is totally different and as you remember from our last video i am putting a portion of my net worth in scd to live off of the rest of my life because i don't want to touch the cash of my real estate i don't want to touch the cash that i generate from this youtube channel i want to reinvest it to get higher higher rates of return i want to be able to take a portion of my net worth have it sit there and do nothing with it except live off of it that way i can focus my business on reinvesting and building a bigger business that's the big key there i don't want to have my businesses pay me out dividends when i can reinvest that money at high rates of return so if you want more det detail on why i'm buying sd i really encourage you to watch our next video but i also want you to remember that it is not me sitting there saying thatd and dividend stocks are the way to go i'm still being consistent if you told me to put 100% of my net worth in sd at this point in my life with all my businesses going i'd say that's not even worth it but there's a time and place for some investments and you might find some value in that thank you for your

2024-10-07,Un_qvK2Tjug,"kind: captions language: en i started buying alibaba stock back in 2021 and i've dollar cost average down over the past three years as it fell now along the way i also had shares taken away from me from covered calls this year in the last 52 weeks alibaba's low was $66 per share and i continued to hold on my shares and there was a lot of criticism of it there's a lot of criticism of alibaba yes it's in china there are a lot of fears out there but you have to remember that alibaba is now skyrocketing and has started to sell at a 52e high $116 per share and news follows the stock price when alibaba was over $300 per share nobody could ever talk about the fact that it's an adr you don't actually own the company you always own a piece of the cash flow blah blah blah blah blah taiwan then became a big issue as the stock started to fall and the adrs became a big issue now recently as you can tell here's the performance of alibaba up 55% in the last six months up 48% in the last 3 months up 50% in the last year since the beginning of the year does that mean i'm right absolutely not in fact recently as alibaba surged i got a lot of messages from people paul you did great guys i'm not right on alibaba yet i even wrote this twitter post i received many comments about baba asking me if i feel good that i was right first thanks to everybody who said it but one i don't know if i'm right yet nor do i think i'm right yet two i can't say i'm right if it goes up 30% just like if the stock went down 30% that wouldn't tell me that i'm wrong guys remember the goal here is to sit there and buy companies at great prices in the short run people's sentiments and feelings are going to drive up the stock or drive down the stock what we have to look at is the fundamentals and if you look at all of our past videos alibaba i focus on the fundamentals did the gross story match what everybody was paying for before absolutely not i want you to become an investor who looks at the fundamentals of the business in relation to the price the market get a set to determine if you should make an investment you have to remember in that short run stocks can go up and down a lot guys you cannot find me a stock that just stays that as the company fundamentals go up like this the stock price goes right in tandem here's what actually happens fundamentals go like this stock price goes like this the question you have to ask yourself is when it's down here are you are you willing to buy because remember when it's down here the news in the company is gonna be very bad because news follows the stock price not the other way around and every time i kept looking at this company don't get me wrong did i have worries about china being a communist state yeah but i thought to myself okay if i were to make a bet on china for the next 20 years are they going to become more capitalistic or communist and i thought to myself well the last 20 years have been more capitalist and the world's more and more capitalist why would this revert back i don't know population decline is it bad yeah but also look at what's the average income in china they still has a lot of growth there for the average income in china that's very very important another thing i looked at after the 50% run up in the stock price it's currently only selling for 14 times its price of free cash flow 14 times that's after the recent runup you look at pe it's 28 times why look at the free cash flow in the last year $20 billion in the last five years it's averaged 20 billion yet its net income is only averaged it was only averaged 14 a. half billion the last 5 years and 10 billion last year this market cap was a lot lower it was $150 to $180 billion generating $20 billion in cash flow and not only that even all the negativity out there let's look what analysts were saying yeah it wasn't good in terms of eps but guess what it wasn't declining overall even the analysts who are going to sit there and follow what people are doing you sit there and look at this and saying if i can pay singled digigit price to free cash flow for a company that goes nowhere in terms of growth of it earnings as long as they buy back shares i'm happy and speaking of buying back shares what has alibaba been doing they've been buying back a ton of their shares why because they're smart and say wait we have the stock selling in a single digit price of free cash flow let's buy back our shares and don't also forget about how many major investors have started to pile into these companies now keep in mind guys this stock right now going back to it is at $112 a share down 2.8% today guess where it's going in the next 3 months i have no clue guess where it's going in the next six months i have no clue in the short run we have no idea where these stocks are going but if you're going to make your determination on buying a company whether the stock price goes up or down you're not an investor i want you to be an investor and you want to be an investor that's why i need to understand this a lot of the stocks i buy are based on buying when the sentiment of the company has shifted i bought nike recently i bought starbucks recently why because the sentiment around these companies has absolutely changed as the stocks have fallen same thing with alibaba now alibaba has a lot more fear behind it right well of course it does and in a few minutes i'm going to show you the stock analyzer tool and why the returns are offering that potential to match those fears remember the more fear the lower the stock price the lower the cost of the investment and the more potential doesn't mean it's going to work out all the time but if you're able to buy 20 or 30 companies that have immense fear in them but the fundamentals tell a different story you're probably going to do very well now let's look at the eight pillars of this company guys net income not worried about that because we looked at the free cash flow it's down a little bit but not nearly as much as net income net income's down 15 billion free cash is laying down 1.8 billion this is the metric that matters most i love the fact that their free cash flow is higher than that income revenue growth 57 billion in the last five years low debt low price to free cash flow still a low pe even though the price of free cash is lower this is one area i'm not a big fan of low return on invested capital i'm hoping that's because they've been getting themselves back together getting ready to keep regrowing and putting more money back in the business to grow but even with that you'll see shortly in our stock analyzer tool that there's still a lot of potential for this company even if they just maintain and grow to a slow pace now all of these things that i've done this is why i created the software i want to be able to look at the high of these companies cu i truly believe that a lot of people over research their investments that's a very common theme my biggest fear whenever i look at anything is am i overthinking it but that's why i've changed my investment philosophy to buy big name brands big companies that probably are not going away the reason i do that is i want to make i'm okay making less return as long as that return is more stable and as long as i'm taking advantage of other people's emotions and that's the same thing i want you to do that's the same thing a lot of these people in our commun the thousands of people in our community are doing now if you thought about joining and you've gone to our website you've probably seen that we have a limited number of daily spots for our community and software and the reason for that is the software as it exists today includes everything we have to offer for retirement for real estate and for stock analysis to be fully transparent we currently have 4,000 people who have taken us up on this offer and after we reach 5,000 we're going to update the software to make the changes we are going to change these offers and split these off separately so we're only a thousand users away the current offer of everything is going away now if you remember when we first started this channel i just got a message uh yesterday in instagram from a guy who said paul i've been watching you since it was an excel sheet from y chart and i was like oh my god this person's been on for so so long because i built the software for myself through y charts but as i started to use this people would say how do i get that software how do i get that excel sheet and i said you can't it's a it's a it's a data feed from white chart that cost $500 per month but it got us thinking wait a second people want to be able to analyze people want to be able to be part of a community talk let's give it to them and as the community has grown we've become less about me and more about how i can better serve you and the other community members so the good news is these changes haven't been made we're not at 5,000 users yet but we're working on them every single day so if you join today you'll be grandfathered in for life with all the data all the tools everything so if you're really serious about making better financial decisions probably increasing your returns but more importantly sleeping better at night and making less irrational emotional decisions click on the link in the description below to get access to our software we have a great $7 for 7day trial so go take it up now let's go look at the stock analyzer for alibaba and we're going to do two different analyses we're going to do one having to do with one assumption so i'm doing a 10year analysis here but i'm only putting one assumption for this first one stay with me for the three assumptions i did 6% revenue growth guys in the last 10 years i did 33% last 5 years 18 last one year 6% but as china grows as the world grows they will grow to better clip i'm still comfortable at 6% profit margin i put in 15% remember this profit margin is net income it's been heavily kept down i'm focusing on free cash flow here free cash flow i'm putting in 22% it is down over the last year but let's then and actually put just be conservative let's go 18% pe i put in 18 and price a free cash flow of 18 and my desire return of 9% now remember guys this is my intrinsic value return intrinsic value this is not the return i want you should not be buying individual stocks to match the market n9 or 10% is going to match the market you need a premium but i want to show what the market return would make the stock worth boom 177 based on multiple of earnings 212 based on a dis discounted cash flow model that gives that the current price not at the 66 or the 70 that we started that we were adding more and more shares at gives it an 18% return now the three stock return the three stock assumptions now again i'm going to change my assumptions on the free cash flow much much lower i did 36 and 9% revenue growth i did 12 15 and 18% profit margin 15 18 and 21 one free cash flow pe and price of free cash flow 16 18 and 20 and 9% return hit the analyze button

2024-10-08,YMDsMl5I7fk,kind: captions language: en hey guys we just started the fourth quarter and there are four stocks that i'm really interested in buying i actually own three of them and i hope and i pray that they drop even more in price so let's dive right in now before we go further remember just because i or anybody else in this world i don't care who it is even if it's warren buffett if they own a stock it's absolutely important you do your own research and buy it for reasons that make sense to you but stock number one is nike recently fell hard just changing some things out everybody thinks nike is dead why is nike really dead or is news following the stock price three years ago the stock was at 179 it hit a low of $70 back in august this is the prime example of news follows the stock price nike is an incredible brand nike has got a hold on so many sports they have lifetime contracts with kevin durant lebron james michael jordan the basketball version is incredible for them their brand becomes cool the old nikes are coming back to i own four or five pair guys i don't think nike is going away i asked the question what kind of world do we live in where nike doesn't exist in 10 20 30 years doesn't mean it won't happen but you have to ask these questions when looking at companies to determine do you want to own them the long run my personal opinion is my investment ideas have shifted to this sort of thinking that i'm willing to make less return but to buy great companies at great prices now the key to that is you have to buy great companies when people are misunderstanding their numbers so for a dying company let's quickly go to analyst estimates and again analysts are going to be wrong a lot of times but let's look what analysts think about the profit earnings per share on nike for the next five six years 377 this year going to 636 over the next four or five years does does a dying company increase its profit by 70 or 80% maybe well what about revenue yeah not as sexy 52 billion to 67 billion but again dying guys nike can't grow their revenue 20 30% a year it would be very difficult to do that why they're a very mature business but as they grow as they get bigger and bigger the world if i were to ask somebody right now i say 100 people right now name me the best shoe business sporting goods business how many would say nike now that same question was probably asked about blackberry in 06 and 07 what's the number one phone company out there so i do get the idea of saying well wait a sec second but nike here i just think it's such a valuable piece of the world in the us economy and in terms of the sports apparel they got these great athletes on lifetime contracts that's something to really think about you really got to remember that when looking at these companies don't follow that stock price follow what you think about in the future but we look at nike here and a lot of people will probably follow it and go wait a second look at nike it's down a ton therefore it's a buy not necessarily not necessarily but i do want to show you one thing this is the fourth quarter of 2021 let's go look at their financials by quarter 2021 fourth quarter they did revenue of 11.36 billion they're now doing 12.6 billion so again the revenue is up not a ton but the stock is down over 50% i repeat stock down over 50% revenu is up and remember guys don't look at a company only on the short-term results nike just reported last week and those short-term results mean nothing the question i want you to ask the question that makes sense to me that you can might probably incorporate your investing for all these companies is is this company going to be round for a long time if so do i think their revenue and profit will be higher in that time period than today and if so can you pay a reasonable price for the company today that gives you an adequate return on your money that's what really matters if nike fell in half today but its future was the same as it is that we perceived today why would you not buy it so let's go look at that stock analyzer and determine what the reasonable price for nike is 5% revenue growth i love this this is great it's nothing crazy it's not low it's not high it's reasonable profit margin i did 11% across the board they've been doing they've had higher free cash flow and profit margin over the last five and 10 years which is great pe impr price of free cash flow guys what are you going to pay for nike 15 times multiple is the market average historically but for nike it's a top branded business it's got a moat it's got a high return on invested capital this means they get a good great return on the money invest in their business and companies like this deserve a premium i put in 23 times earnings you might think it's high you might think it's low that's the beauty of doing this yourself and when we do our three assumptions next you'll see the difference there and finally my desired return of 9% this should not be your desired return this has zero margin of saving in here i'm just doing 9 or 10% the market average so what's this thing worth if you were to compare it to the market again you have to put your margin of safety i hit the analyze button i have 86 here which gives you about a 9.85% return now for the range i did three and 7% the low and high for our revenue growth i did 10 and 12% for profit margin and free cash flow margin i did a low pe of 20 a high of 26 but i kept the 9% return again for margin of safety hit the analyze button so guys on the low side it's probably still pretty overpriced high side massively underpriced this is somewhere in the middle now i have my watch list here at 70 only because it went low so i added my watch list at 80 bucks per share doesn't mean i'm going to buy it at 80 it means i'll take a deeper look and probably sell some puts at lower prices company number two ulta beauty guys retail is tough again a company that i own don't buy it just cuz i or anybody else in the internet has has it but retail has been tough that's what i like about ulta they're still able to have some organic real same store sales growth i really like that a lot they cater to women they have good margins their gross margin is almost 40% bottom line margin of 10 or 11% what i think i love about them $18 billion market cap and a $21 billion enterprise value this right here this three billion is essentially their debt which is mostly their leases so i look at this saying man for a retail business that seems pretty low and look at this free cash flow a billion 5year average of $88.87 look at this return on invested capital 5 years is 22.3 one year is 27 a business that does well making money and its own money they do a good job of handling their cash flow they don't pay a dividend so they're using it hopefully to buy back more shares over time but look at this company another one that's fallen precipitously in the last few years all-time high back in march of 575 hit a low 5 months later of 318 guys in the short run stocks are voting machine the long run they're weighing machine even if if you believed 575 was the right price for this company why would you not think it's 318 5 months later what could have materially changed in the business in five months in a company like this does it happens but in this business we haven't seen anything material happen to it all right so i still like ulta for many of these reasons i'm just looking at here is retail tough yes but they cater to women and they cater in areas that women want to still go and see traffic and have foot traffic in which i like a lot let's see what the analysts think about this company that's in retail look at this growth $26 a share and profit this year going to $42 according to analysts in the next four or five years and revenue growth all right 3 to 6% a year nothing to write home about but impressive either way now the internet gets bigger and bigger and bigger are they going to sit here and be like the other ones who died or they the ones going to continue to do better continue to adapt to make sure they can cater to the women who love their work i will tell you they've done a great job with same stores um sales growth over the last few years and the number of stores they have they're not opening a ton they're being a smart about it that's what i like about them now what is the company worth according to our stock analyzer tool now one reason it jumped up recently was birkshire hathway took a position them wasn't necessarily warren buffett but somebody at birkshire did it now something to look at here 10year roic 20% 5 years is 22 one year is 28 a growing roic a growing moat getting better at handling the money that's in the business this is wonderful and this kind of company who does this if their stock fell in half they'd probably be buying back a ton of shares and adding immense value to investors by doing that so low and high assumptions on revenue growth i did 3% and 7% profit margin i did 9 1 half to 11 same with free cash flow even though free cash flow has been lower than their profit consistently okay so uh pe i did a low of 15 a high of 21 the current pe is a little under 15 the current price to free cash flow is 18 and again my nine% returns so guys remember when we're investing in companies we come up with a range of prices because we don't know the future and we make mistakes so it's really really important that you look at that range and say do i feel comfortable here or do i need to wait boom a low price of 346 high price of 670 so somewhere in the middle it's a decent buy right that could be today because look 346 to 670 it could very well be a high 400 $500 stock at which point if to ask yourself are you okay buying it at 375 that's the big question to ask and when is it 318 this is a green all day right here but again you have to understand the quantitative and qualitative parts of a company what is the story that makes this company a good purchase it's about incorporating those two together to find the right investment now ulta's beaten up stock but em our community members have been talking about ulta as it was fallen and that's the reason why the community is great they share ideas they share research so if you're looking to be part of this like-minded community i need you to go to everything money.com and when you do go there you'll see that we have a limited number of daily spots for our software in community and the reason for that is that the software as it exists today includes everything we have to offer for retirement for stock analysis and for real estate which is a big part of our entire investment i own over a thousand apartments myself as we expand though we have to make changes and the offers that we have are going to be separated the current offer of everything is going to go away very soon you may remember when we first started this channel and by the way i get messages on twitter and instagram of people saying paul i've been with you since since day one since you had 700 subscribers i really love seeing those i built that software all the software was built for me i was using it for myself on a computer but i use as i did in the in the videos people would say how do i get that software and i'd always say listen you can't get it it's expensive you have a data feed it costs a lot of money but then it got me thinking well people want the software let's give it to them let's build that community and the community has grown immensely the channel's grown immensely so it's become less about me and more about how i can better serve you and the other community members who use this software so the good news is the changes haven't been made but we're working on them every single day so if you join today you'll be grandfathered in for life with all the data and all the tools that we've made so even we separated for everybody else you'll still get them and you'll stay in your pricing tier forever so if you're serious about making more money making better financial decisions more importantly though sleeping better at night click on the link in the description below to get access to our software before we make this changes and i'm very confident it'll be one of the best decisions you ever made stock number three this is an interesting one this is paypal so paypal has become interesting because it's had a recent surge up in pricing it's at $80 a share hit a low just a year ago of $50 per share okay i've been buying it sub 85 or so for a while now and it was a commonly criticized stock which we want to see it was interesting people were saying paypal was dead do you hear a common theme here this company's dead this company's dead and there were some issues with paypal the number of users was declining had just started declining but the number of transactions per user were up the amount the dollar amount were up and the total transaction revenue was up a lot so i look at that going all right so yeah the number of users declining but it seems like they're getting better users and the people who use the co this the company are using it more and for higher dollar amounts that screams trust to me whenever i want to buy something on the internet that i don't trust i use paypal because i know they're going to have my back okay now this is an $84 billion company a lot of debt on there because they probably owe money to people that hold their cash with them good profit margin 14% 45% gross margin okay decent return on invested capital not the best in the fiveyear but getting better they have a new ceo who's trying to make this a much more much more versatile company they have venmo guys venmo is the verb venmo me venmo me so let's go look at the revenue growth of this company that's really important to understand look at this revenue growth guys dying company 13 billion 15 a2 17.8 21 a2 25 27 and a2 30 31 how much of this is dying explain that to me and i've literally go search it you will see people saying paypal is dying okay it's dying that's what you need to be successful investing you need the perception of the market to be inaccurate and you got to be right that's the big thing so let's see what analysts are saying about paypal they're looking at profit of $452 a share going to $7 in the next few years and that's a good dying company right there and another dying metric 7 to 10% revenue growth for the next four or five years again they're analysts they have their bias i get that completely so let's go look at our stock analyzer assumptions about paypal so i did four 7 and 10% revenue growth for the next 10 years i did 12 and a half 14 and a half 16 a half% profit margin free cash flow on paypal is huge way higher than the profit margin so i did 16 20 and 24% pe i did 14 17 and 20 and again my 9% return hit the analyze button guys you see how crazy it was at 50 bucks a share the low price is 58 to 75 high price of 150 to 220 guys i look at this company and for me personally again i own this company and i want to buy more i look at this saying this looks like a pretty good deal for me but you've got to understand that you've got to understand it in your own way to make sure you can make those assumptions stock number four the googly mly now mo you have google stock you were smart enough to buy it at 140 i was not smart enough to buy it i think 136 is the basis that's your basis for you hit an alltime high of 193 just 3 months ago back in july of 2024 it hit a low of 121 just one year ago so from the low to the high over a 50% return in less than seven or eight months and remember back when it was like an $88 a share mod when was that that was um that was $86 a share back in december of 2022 that was the low of that bare market that year people were calling for the ceo's head guys you got to remember just because the stock is down does not mean the company's doing worse does not mean the ceo needs to be fired and shot in the head no and because it's up doesn't mean it's doing better and just because it's up does not mean it's doing better yeah so company $2.1 trillion market cap my biggest fearo it's hard to make outsize returns on on the largest companies in the stock market correct right yeah that's just math yep it's hard for the largest company in the stock market to grow at 12 133% a year yes that's why when you see these opportunities like meta was at $82 88 a share dirt cheap when google was at $86 a share you got to look at it and say you have to be aggressive when the time calls for it especially on large companies this is not for the faint of heart but i looked at it saying google owns the top two search engines in the world google.com and youtube.com and google shorts have been absolutely killing it yeah so what is what are the analyst estimates for google look at this revenue growth mo the eps growth 789 to 1440 in the next four years huge growth potential there according to analysts revenue growth dying company 133% 11% 10% 846 and 9% yeah decline because as it gets bigger and bigger it's hard to grow it's going to be it's going to be a $500 billion do revenue business at that point it's hard to grow that but if you're smart about buying it when it's down and the company is smart about buying back shares when it's down you can make outsize returns the market cap i want to say something very very interesting here the market cap can stay flat and the stock price can go up if they're smart about buying back cheap shares there will be an opportunity at some point where these companies are going to become stupid cheap the question you have to ask yourself is are you ready to buy them because every past bare market looks like the opportunity every future one looks like a risk and when you're in it it feels like a risk so let's go to our stock analyzer tool and see what is the googly moogly worth to us okay only company of these four i don't own i did a 10-year analysis 4% 7 and a half 11% revenue growth and mo this what i like look at this growing roic yes 12.75 14 a5 15.7 profit margin i did 22 24 and 26 i can make the argument that's too low mine's higher what's yours 23 26 29 okay i don't blame you for that is it higher than history yes but maybe not and it's growing and it's growing pe i did 20 23 and 26 what' you do uh 21 24 27 again i look at that going i can see that like that that's the thing about investing that's interesting guys we could have disagreements on the exact numbers here but mo would you and i disagree that there should be a premium paid for google no and that's why like i look at this and say let's say they do 7% revenue growth which is low for them i'm still paying a premium for google yeah absolutely so that's that number comes from and again our no margin of safety 9% return i hit the analyze button boom low price of 113 high price of 280 middle price of 180 so guys this is where we are if you if you want to see the five stocks that our community members are buying watch our

2024-10-10,kIsoOP2s2Xo,kind: captions language: en with global tensions on the rise and military spending continually hitting record highs defense stocks are set to soar today we're breaking down the top five potential defense stocks to buy before the next big wave of conflict shakes the world before we get into those stocks let me show you some stats on military spending worldwide and some of the potential we see in that space this is a breakdown of worldwide spending on defense as a percentage of their own gdp and percent to global spending it's no surprise the us leads 3.4% of our gdp is spent on defense 916 billion but we alone account for 37% of entire worldwide defense spending this is the us military spending since 1960 in dollars as you can see consistently going up but this is a percentage of gdp this is what actually surprised me as a percent of gdp declining that's a good sign i like seeing that obvious see cold war years right here and then as we started to get decrease in cold war concerns it started to decrease so there is silver lining here gdp is going up much faster than defense spending and therefore as a percentage of gdp it is declining for the us but look at this we're going to surpass a trillion dollars here very soon in fact there's a lot of estimates by 2034 that military spending in the us will be 1.1 trillion defenses guaranteed contracts for a lot of these companies that's the reason a lot of people like like these as government gets bigger we spend more and more and these are guaranteed contracts my guess is a lot of these companies have very little bad debts a lot of these companies 70 80% of their revenue comes from the us government but now let's get into those individual stocks stock number one lockie martin lmt look at this chart last 10 years 242 not including dividends currently pays about a 2% dividend yield so a lot of people like these military companies defense companies because they pay dividends why how do you really grow the business by reinvesting back in the company that's a lot what a lot of people are saying out there makes sense i mean at the end of the day lockie martin is a leader in this area $144 billion market cap $191 billion enterprise value free cash flow pretty consistent you have 6.95 billion last year 6.45 over the last 5 years and very much in line with net income so this is looking pretty consistent across the board low 20s pe in price of free cash flow profit margin 95% i wonder how much of these companies they actually just are very much structured profit numbers i think that's probably a big part of it but look at this really high returns on invested capital so to me the first thing that pops in my head is boy i really hope these guys are buying back shares when the market shifts on them because it seems like a very consistent business let's go look at their income statement to see how consistent they are going back 10 years 40 40 and a half 47 50 54 60 65 67 66 67 billion in the last 12 months $71 billion in spending not a grower but obviously you're sitting here you're looking at it going nice and consistent let's check out the eight pillars here what's the story telling us the eight pillars guys this is almost an eight pillar thriller it's very close all it needs is a somewhat small downturn extra from today and you'll be at eight pillars right here reasonable debt buying back shares 15% high roic revenue growth 8 billion net income 287 million cash flow this what i'm surprised about 8 billion revenue growth only led to 287 million in net income increase and only led to $62 million in free cash flow increase not as much as you would have thought i would have thought a much bigger increase especially with a gross margin here actually the gross margin kind of sucks 12% in the last 12 months just goes to show they bury a lot of the expenses of the company into these contracts now let's see what the analyst estimates are in this business not again not a grower 2671 to $32 edps over the next three or four years revenue growth 71.8 to 78.6 you're not buying this for those of you out there who love dividend stocks this might be the play for you because when the stocks are when they're paying dividends and the stock falls in price they might be able to take the extra cash flow buy back shares giving you a bigger and bigger percentage of the the company that might be a good thing for the company now let's go see stock analyzer tool now guys remember stock analyzer tool we use this as a way of taking our estimates to the future and giving us a price today to pay for the company based on our desired return that's all we're investing in we're investing in a future stream of cash flow but we don't know the future so we have to make estimations on that this is why we do three assumptions we do three assumptions because we want to make sure we we have a low middle and high assumption level now for those you out there who have our stock analyzer tool you can pick one two or three assumptions it all depends on what you're looking at my personal belief is to use three because with three you can do a low middle high and see a range of outcomes all right so i did a 10-e analysis guys some of the things i love here increasing roic i did two four and 6% revenue growth nothing to write home about might be low might be high but that's what i like about doing this wide range profit margin i'm going to go 9 9.5 and 10 pe now i did 12 14 and 16 guys that's too low this is a high roic business government contractor probably going be around for a long time i'd be very surprised if loed martin was gone years from now i'm going to do 14 17 and 20 okay and i'm going to do a 9% desired return now guys this is no margin of safety but we need margin of safety cuz we don't know the future and we're humans when we make mistakes i'm putting n or you can put 10% in basically the market return to get your intrinsic value for the company but again if you want to get intrinsic value just buy the s&amp;p so i highly encourage you to put a higher number than 9% in what return do you want to make i hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 605 i have a low price of 370 a high price of 680 a middle price of 500 guys this also includes all the dividends so based on today's price i'm looking at 2% to 10% return based on what my assumptions are stock number two general dynamics guys fun stat on general dynamics it was one of the first stocks i bought back in 1997 let's see if i'd kept it it was at $19 a share it's currently at $296 that's 15x my money plus the dividends along the way now i don't know why i sold it or when i sold it but back then i didn't have the process that i have today but let's take a look at general dynamics higher gross margin than locked martin but a lower profit margin so 15.5% gross margin but about 8% profit margin you've got a higher price of free cash flow 25 and 23 you've got better market cap to enterprise value differential 82 billion market cap 114 billion um uh enterprise value free cash flow now the five-year free cash flow is very consistent with a 5-year net income like almost exact 3.3 billion and 3.3 billion the net income is has deviated the last year versus free cash flow not going to worry about that lower return invested capital 7 or 8% i i'm already liking um locked martin more than general dynamics just something actually i think locked martin looks better in every aspect let's go check out the eight pillars here okay eight pillars high pe high price of free cash flow low roic and cash flows down over the last five years versus uh revenue and profit being up haven't bought back as many shares okay so medely i'm like you know if you're comparing companies you got to sit there and say and by the way if you disagree with me on this mention in the comments below why you think general dynamics is better than looh martin i'm only looking at the numbers here i haven't looked at their potential contracts anything like that i'm only looking at the numbers all right let's see what analysts are saying about the growth potential for these okay well here's a here's a differential looks like the growth potential and profit as a percent is much better 15 to 21 a half and revenue growth yeah about the same consistently 50 billion to 56 billion low single digits which you'd about expect here so again let's go look at the stock analyzer tool to determine what have i ever done general dynamics oh my gosh back in 2022 and this is going to vary greatly from what i did before okay so if you remember back then i looked at stocks a lot different i like my process now more than back then i was beating up the stocks immensely i did two four and 6% revenue growth but one thing i want to notice guys is roic is declining here 10% down to 7% profit margin 7588 and a half and i kept the same thing for free cash flow i did a 15 pe across the board let's go back and do the 14 17 and 20 that we did for locki martin and then let's do the 9% desired return hit the analyze button guys i got a low price of 167 high price of 316 middle price of 230 those are looking like based on today's prices if you bought today you have a better potential return it was over 6% in the middle for locked martin but that's general dynamics for you stock number three northrup grumman that's a hard one to say but that is the correct way to say it let's check this company out tenure 321 per not including dividend 1 a half% dividend yield okay a little bit more expensive in terms of price of free cash flow at 30 currently 34 pe um but they 5year pe look at this the 5-year net income of 3.9 billion versus 5-year free cash flow of 2.3 okay there's probably a reason for that but something to keep in mind low return on invested capital 89% nothing great but it's going to be a check mark it's still over 9% uh gross profit a little bit higher than um the first two companies 5year profit margin 10 and a half% 10 half% 5year profit margin that's the highest one we've seen so far um 1 a half% div dividend okay let's go check out the eight pillars here oh sloppier on the board decrease in free cash flow high debt level 8.8 times its 5year free cash flow is a debt level low pe high price of free cash flow that means lower free cash flow than earnings buying back about 12% of its shares i'm not really feeling this one very much that's my personal opinion from that's the story it's telling me let's see what analysts are saying consist growth on eps $25 to $35 as you can tell here from percentages mid to high single digits pretty solid revenue growth boring 3 to 5% 42 billion to 50 billion slow and steady wins the race on these ones i guess guys but remember i think on these companies it's about the dividend surprisingly and buying back cheap shares let's start our analysis here i'm going to do two four and 6% revenue growth i'm going to do profit margin of so it's been pretty consistent at 10 10 and half% so i'm going to do 9.5 10.25 and 11% but look at this free cash flow consistently lower guys 6% range so i'm going to focus i mean i don't like the fact the free cash flow is so different so if you're in a community i really want you guys to have the the conversation there about this free cash flow differential because the other companies did not have that so why are these guys different this is what's so great about comparing companies within an industry this is why you need to do that you need to sit there and understand wait a second everybody else had good free cash flow relative to earnings this one is sign 40% lower why is that i'm going to go six 6 and a half and 7% now for pe i'm going to do the same thing 14 17 and 20 and my 9% desired return hit the analyze button boom i've got a low price of 230 high price of 443 middle price of 320 i'm focusing on free cash flow here whenever there's such a big difference between free cash flow and earnings that i don't know the reason cuz i haven't researched it yet i'm going to focus on the discounted on the cash flow here so at 532 it's still a ways away now remember guys you might sit there and say 532 it's got to fall below 300 yeah that happens all the time don't get discouraged by that that's what's so important about using the stock analyzer tool to the best of your ability you have to sit there and give a wide range this allows you to make that wide range of values and you have to remember the more consistent the company the more it's been around the narrower the range is going to be the earlier the company the the younger the company the wider the range going to be don't be intimidated by that that's what's important have the conversation in the community with the other members out there to sit there determine though i love when i go in the community and see people taking screenshots even on twitter people will share screenshots with me of their stock analyzer tool that's the best now if you're interested in getting that and you go to everything money.com you'll see that we have a limited number of daily spots for the software in the community and the reason for that is the community as it exists today currently includes everything we have to offer for retirement stock analysis and real estate analysis but

the offers are going to be separated these are all going to be separated into different categories so the current offer of everything is absolutely going to go away very soon now you may remember when i started this whole software and this whole site the software was built for me it was an excel sheet i'd be using on a computer and then i' get comments how do i get your software how do i get your excel sheet and my response was guys you can't get it but it got us to think so if people want this let's give it to them the community is grown the software user grown the channel's grown so now it's become less about me and more about how i can better serve you and give you the tools and the community members the tools who use the software to make better decisions now the good news is these changes have not been made yet but we're working on them every single day so if you join today you will be grand in for life with all of this all the data all the tools you'll get all of it and stay

and it gives you the software to make better number decisions go sign up now i'm confident it'll be the best decision you've made all year and guys it's $7 for s days go try it out stock number four how met aerospace $42 billion market cap here's what i like so far $48 billion enterprise value that difference right there is their debt of about six5 a. half billion dollars now here's what's kind of poopy they have a billion dollars in free cash flow versus 933 million in net income but their fiveyear average is 385 versus 533 so their 5year free cash flow is significantly lower than their net income but i'm glad this that their free cash flow is greater over the last year really high price of free cash flow 43 5year average 110 dividend dividend of 0.2% high gross margin of 30% probably because they have a lot more commercial jobs so they're not bearing those expenses in the cost of good sold um profit margin 133% last year 9% 5year average let's go check out the income statements to see what the heck is going on here 12 a. half billion 12 a half billion 12.4 13 6.8 7.1 5.3 5 5.7 6.6 so you look at this in immediately and think oh my god the division is declining i think did they sell off some divisions so let's go find that out we're going to go to the cash flow statement in the cash flow statement it'll tell us their acquisitions and dispositions and in 2014 h this is interesting 2.4 bill so this needs more the only the only net acquisition dispositions most recent one was 2016 they sold 2014 they bought 2.4 billion yet the revenue is down a lot that absolutely needs to be figured out absolutely needs to be figured out out i'm jumping right to analyst estimates to see what they're thinking oh wow over double eps growth from 260 to 550 in the next four years and revenue growth wow pretty solid from 7.5 to 11.2 billion i guess again it's analysts but let's do our stock analyzer tool let's go see what the analysts were seeing again pretty solid revenue growth okay so i'm going to do 3 six and 9% revenue growth profit margin look at this profit margin 10 years is 2% 5 years is 9% one year is 133% you g have to have a wide range here i'm going to go 5 10 and 15 same with the free cash flow pe 14 17 20 14 17 20 and 9% return guys this is a hard one because revenue is down about 50% in the last 10 years you've got i mean look at that minus 6% a year for the last 10 years in revenue but last 5 years have' been seeing some nice growth huh yeah it's a tough one this is what i need a lot of margin of safety for so the stocks at 103 my range is a low price of 13 a high price of 75 middle price of 35 guys this for me is the two hard pile i wouldn't even look at this right now because i just don't know i mean it's just too hard for me to understand because the wide range okay you have to really do some more research to understand the qualitative aspects of this business and again if you're in the community and this is interesting to you go talk about it stock number five joby aviation guys these guys do air taxes for commercial passengers they have a few contracts with the government very small revenue of them but the point is they do have contracts now let's immediately go to the income statement annual this is a pass for me immediately revenue is crap a million dollars and the market cap is 4 billion $3.3 billion enterprise value so great balance sheet but let's go look at their shares outstanding they're just diluting they keep on diluting guys for me i mean look at this this is the analyst estimates loss loss loss loss loss i don't see the path to profitability you might see it and more power to you i can't even run a stock analy on this one now for those of you who don't want to make individual plays on defense spending there's an etf and this etf has done pretty well compared to the s&amp;p going back to 2005 838 versus 583 now the one thing i will say is i don't think this includes dividends and neither does this so this is quite the outperformance here but as you can tell during big dips look at the big drops right here but it's starting to spread apart right here so for those of you who say you know i don't know if i can make an individual decision on individual stock great etf here p pa by invesco it has a higher expense ratio of about 6% but maybe that's worth it bas on this performance that's a decision you need to make as you sit there and decide you want to buy individual stocks so guys if you want to watch a video on four stocks we're looking at potentially buying before the end of the

2024-10-11,KhmoicLjRCw,"kind: captions language: en guys there are three potential undervalued stocks selling at a potentially great discount now let's analyze all three of these to see which ones are the best buy i have a feeling these stocks might be lighting up green on the stock analyzer since they they recently hit 52 week low stock number one dollar general guys this stock is down 40% year-to date only 18% one year 6 monon 47% guys look at this alltime high $262 back in april of 2022 that is 2 and a2 years ago it is down 70% almost that's a big drop for a company like dollar general now reason being they recently came out on their earnings call and they revised guidance and they said we're feeling like our consumer is buying based on needs not on wants which is kind of interesting because they're already the lowcost seller so you would think that as people as we saw with walmart walmart same story sales were up while target home depone lows were down now you might sit there and say what the heck does target home depone lows have to do with walmart dollar general well my idea was that people go to target people go to home depot and people go to lows when they want to do something they go to walmart when they need something because they want to save money i would have thought the same thing about dollar general but that doesn't necessarily the case now they have plans to open 700 stores this year which might shock you and i say it's considered a low number as you can see from their 10k which i got directly from our website by year 1,50 1,39 97 and 700 plus so it's still a declining number of stores but guys that's okay and this to me this is one of the negative thesis i see about this company but i look at it going so when it was opening a ton of stores you thought that was going to continue forever that's what i want to be different in the way in which we think you have to assume that the best years as you're smaller are going to decline and that's okay you can still have a great company at a great price with slower growth this is still a crap ton of stores 700 stores is still a lot of stores when you have 19,000 stores in 2023 they just opened their first stores in mexico which is probably be a great market for them so i'm looking at this thinking to myself okay here's a stock that's down 60 70% which is a great place to start for value so back to dollar general free cash flow in the last year of 1.7 billion relative to net income that's great 5year average free cash flow of 1.5 billion significantly trails their 5year net income though of 2.15 billion they pay a handsome dividend it's really nice now that the stock is down 60 70% it's 2.8% and the best part is it only eats up $500 million of their free cash flow that's less than a third of last year's free cash flow and almost a a little bit over a third of their 5year average free cash flow so to me a apart from there being issues with a company that's a relatively safe dividend now the attractive part look at this five look at this one year price of free cash flow of 10.9 and fivey year of 12.5 huh now there's where i look at going interesting very very interesting but there's debt in the company because of all their locations $18 billion market cap $42 billion enterprise value that difference right there is their essentially their net debt so my guess is when we go to the eight pillars here there's going to be a big fat x on debt and sure enough our debt metric is big now does that mean you should avoid it not necessarily you got to sit there and understand like they need the this debt in order to operate their business the question is what are they paying for that space if they had to exit it are they going to be able to sublease it things like that that i would sit there and question because if you saw on their number of stores they close about 100 stores a year that's i like the fact that they're aggressive about closing the stor saying listen this one's not working out move on that's what i like seeing some other things big drop in cash flow in the last five years and net income even though revenue is up 8.4 billion okay so one of the things i want to look at is their same store sales so if you guys look here net sales in 2023 increased 2.2% that's for the entire company same store sales only increase .2% okay primarily due to an increase in customer traffic average sales per square foot in 2023 was 264 gross profit decreased 94 basis points that's 0.94% primarily due to increased shrinkage and inventory markdown so guys they are dealing with the same issues that a lot of retailers have dealt with but my same thesis with target when i was buying target from 130 down i said they'll figure out the theft issue they'll figure out shrink we'll figure out all these things and guess what they're starting to make progress on that there is no way they're going to allow everybody to steal from them forever so i look at this saying is this a temporary problem for dollar general or is it a permanent one because at 10 times free cash flow it's pretty attractive to take a look at it okay so let's immediately right now let's go to our analyst estimates to see what the analysts are saying about this company so pretty decent growth a big drop in earnings per share year-over-year but you still have you have a clim back up here to $126 the next 5 years and revenue growth 5 or 6% so i would have thought more revenue growth but maybe they're being conservative here but i like the fact they're being more conservative potentially so let's go to stock analyzer tool now guys if you're new we have to make assumptions about the future i'm making three assumptions here low middle and high and what the stock analyzer tool does is it tells me based on those assumptions and based on my desired return at the end what's the price to pay for the stock now keep in mind guys does not include the balance sheet and the balance sheet here is something to consider because they have so much debt on there but remember the debt is probably based on retail leases now if you have our software you know you can make three two or one number of assumptions just hit this drop down menu and i'm doing a 10-year analysis you can do 1 to 20 so i did three five and 7% revenue growth i do want to make note i don't like seeing a declining return on invested capital from 11 a half% down to 108 down to 8 but revenue growth low three three high seven middle five profit margin 5 and 1 half 6 and a4 7 and free cash flow significantly lower than their profit margin so on my numbers that come out i'm going to focus on free cash flow 4 and a qu 4 and 3/4 5 and a quar pe i did 13 15 and 17 not going to lie to you i don't know why other than that the roic and the lack of growth i mean that seems reasonable to me to sit there and discount that p e and price of free cash flow for that reason and finally this is not my actual desir return but 9% i put in here to get basically what would it be worth what's the intrinsic value what's the market value if i want to match the market on this company but remember if you buy individual stocks you need a margin of safety you need this desired return to be higher how much higher that's according to you hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 83 guys look at this all green 109 to 211 guys there's potential here if you're in our community i strongly encourage you engage people in the community this is exactly where you need to sit there and grab your attention and say okay maybe dollar general has been beaten up a little too much let's take a look at it stock number two atore this company makes electrical nodes other electrical things the interesting part about this company first off besides the fact alltime high of$ 195 and it's currently sitting at $84 over a 50% drop year to date 48 % drop 48% drop year to date in the last 6 months 55% of that it's a big drop guys now seems like there's pretty good reason for it and here's what it is declining revenue so you had a big jump in revenue from over the last you had 1.8 1.9 1.8 2.93 3.9 3.5 and now in the last 12 months it's been 3.3 so there is declining revenue so first off the bat is okay is the declining revenue continuing is it close to stopping what's going to make it turn around this is part of the qualitative analysis you need to do when looking at companies this is why you're going to be so much further ahead in understanding investing than everybody else just by watching these videos because you see a company that's down over 50% and it should like i said before it should be a trigger for you to go this is interesting and i want you to be interested in it but you have to understand why is it down because a lot of times companies are stock prices are down for valid reasons you've got to make sure that you're looking at it from the perspective of is this temporary is it because they had such a big surge that now they're just going back to normal perhaps let's go check out their net income their operating income over the last few years as well this is a great way to look at a company's profitability 180 230 240 800 1.2 900 and now it's 700 so guys before covid they were pretty consistently in the 200 million $ 150 $200 million range so is this just a fluke until they get back to that level if so maybe the stock has further to go so let's go see what analyst let's go see what the eight pillars say about the company oh wow eight pillar thriller i was not expecting this oh look at this pe and price of free cash flow oh my gosh but again it's based on potentially a really inflated 5year free average free cash flow and 5year average earnings so you've got to remember these things and say is this a permanent fixture for the company they've bought back a ton of shares ton of shares now one thing i want to see are they still generating cash flow on a quarterly basis yeah they still are guys look at this 73 million 58 114 so it's not it's not like it's a company that's not generating cash flow it is generating this cash flow so let's look at the analyst estimates i'm going to go right to the revenue part so analysts think that we're pretty close to the bottom 3.26 billion this year 3.23 and then 3.4 so it's not a big grower but analysts granted only eight of them believe that we're probably close to the bottom in their revenue and earnings per share should be evening out here but guys if they're right on these earnings per share you're looking at five times i mean eps here that's incredible i think this company deserves another look deeper look again in the community have a conversation about it i know that we've had i've seen the term i've seen the ticker at court in the community so make sure you keep talking about it now obviously if you want to join that community use these tools be able to talk to people go to everything money.com you see though that we only have we have a limited number of daily spots for our software and community and the reason for that is it's an incredible community it's an incredible software we want highquality people using them and getting better every single day in addition the community and tools that we have right now include everything we have to offer for retirement real estate and stocks but that's going away soon and the reason being behind the scenes we're going to change this to separate these all out so the current offer of everything is going away very soon now you may remember when i first started the channel i was using an excel sheet with a data feed and people would always ask how do i get that excel sheet how do i get that software i was like guys you can't it's an expensive data feed you're not going to be able to get it but it caused us to say okay well how do we give it to people so we created the software created the community and this is software i use every every single day for myself every single day mo uses it every single day dalton uses it every single day but as the channel grows it's becoming less about me and more about how i can better serve you and the community members especially as we grow so much now the good news is changes haven't been made yet we're working on them every day so if you join today you'll be grandfathered in for life with all the data all the tools everything we've made so far and you'll also be able to stay in your pricing tier forever so if you're serious about making better financial decisions probably increasing your returns but more importantly sleeping better at night and making less emotional decisions click on the link in the description below to get access to the software we have a great $7 for 7day trial i assure you it'll be one of the best decisions you've ever made so let's go back to our stock analyzer when was the last time i did atore so i did 3 five and 7% revenue growth is that reasonable i don't know maybe it's too high over a 10-year period let's let's let's be a little more conservative here let's call it 2 4 and 6% profit margin i did 1014 and 18 and free cash flow i did the same thing now if you look the last five years there's been a difference between free cash flow and net income but in the last 10 years there's actually been more free cash flow than net income so i'm going to keep it the same hoping it goes there the pe currently at 5.7 and the price of free casal at 7.8 just to be conservative i put 103 and 16 but guys look at these roic's over 20% maybe i should give it a higher roi a higher multiple here on the pe let's say i do 12 15 and 18 again my 9% desired return so let's analyze this below oh boy look at this low price of 115 high price of 346 middle price of 208 guys potential big returns if these numbers work out the way i that way i wrote them there but we don't know the future but is there enough margin of safety here perhaps again have the conversation in the community stock number three cvs guys cvs is quite the business there's been a lot of struggle lately look at the thing that drives me the most crazy about cvs 82 billion market cap $243 billion enterprise value that difference there is that debt now obviously they have really prime locations and they pay a premium to be in those locations but look at this drop in free cash flow the 5year average of 12.8 billion last year 5.3 here's the cool thing fiveyear net income 6.8 versus the it's it's almost half of the 5year free cash flow so this fiveyear price of free cash flow of 6.5 6.5 last year is a 15.66% if you're one of the original viewers of the channel i liked walgreens years ago i got super lucky and sold it and it has plummeted since and the reason being is i hated the debt and i hated the roic and i said this doesn't fit my long-term goals complete and pure luck on that one this company is currently at $65 a share all-time high of 113 back in july of 2015 let's look at the eight pillars it's actually better than i thought got big revenue growth1 billion do revenue growth cash flows down 8.4 billion that didn't comes down 1 billion roic is crap debts high obviously because of retail buy back a little bit of shares 6.4 times free cash flow 12 times pe so guys this is a conundrum for us because you look at these metrics and you say yeah this is awesome but then you got to look at it and say man that's a lot of debt and look at the margin on this business business 5year average is 2.2% one year is 2% so it's basically a 2% margin business it's like a grocery store i don't know it might be a screaming deal but for me i mean you look at dividend people are going to be checked this dividend almost 4% and they can afford it $3.26 billion is their dividend payments off of last year's free cash flow of 5.3 in the 5year average of 12.8 so if you want this for a dividend that's fine i don't know it's just a it's a tough one for me to get around because i just look at that debt i look at that low roic and i think to myself so where's the upside here now you might sit there and say well paul there's tons of upside and if something's cheap enough yeah something's cheap enough and like walgreens i'm wondering if walgreens is so cheap because are they being priced in for bankruptcy that probably won't happen i don't know these are this is what makes investing difficult because i'm i'm going to show you right now if we go to analyst estimates there's grow 662 to 1060 per share revenue 4 5% this makes me go like oh this is a grower this is great now let's go pull up our stock analyzer and figure out what this thing could be worth to us so guys here are the assumptions i made for the next 10 years i did three 4 and a2 and 6% revenue growth i did two 2 and a quar and 2 and a half% profit margin now guys free cash flow apart from this year was way higher than the profit margin so i put 3.75 4.25 and 4.75 pe because of a low roic and low growth i put 13 16 and 19 and again my 9% desired return but guys you definitely need margin of safety on the companies that have low roic's and low growth hit the analyze button scroll down 80 to 150 highight of 160 to 304 boy makes you think so guys you want to watch our last video on three stocks near the 52e low watch right here thank you very

2024-10-15,B61fq6gim_Q,kind: captions language: en guys we have three potential value stocks to look at today they're currently selling at or near their 52e low now remember great place to start to look for value and we're not just learning about these stocks we're strategizing on how to beat the market during both bull and bare markets stock selling around their 52e low is a great way to search for potential value stock number one and probably the most requested stock i get on instagram and twitter celsius now guys this company was a hype company for a long long time ticker symbol c lh all-time high on march 14th of this year $100 per share the low two days ago of $28.20 it wow it's currently up 12.8% today alone up $4 and i think there was rumors of pepsi buying them and that could be the reason why they're up so much but it's a fall guys of 72% in a matter of 6 months it happens this is a company that's currently at $8.2 billion market cap and even better a 7.73 billion enterprise value what does that mean this difference here is essentially the net debt of the company they have a net cash position about $400 million that is incredible okay some other metrics price to free cash flow 33 so even though it's fallen 70% it's still selling for 33 times price of free cash flow one thing i do love return invested capital this year 15.3% return on equity 23.5% now 5year profit margin 6 and a half% one-year profit margin only 20 almost 20% huge difference and a great gross margin of 50% guys let's go look at the income statement on this thing because you're going to see some amazing amazing growth here look at this they did 15 million in revenue in 2014 17 23 36 53 75 130 314 6 650 1.32 and in the last 12 months they've done $1.5 billion in revenue now one thing i will say that i don't like 61 million shares 99.5 million 115 133 150 183 210 they are diluting the shareholders and i do not like that and it's still continuing on they ended the year last year with 231 million shares out standing and now they're at 233 guys when you dilute shareholders yes this is a growing company somebody who had the stock a long time ago has probably done fine but you're still diluting people there's four there's four times more shares now than back then which means before you had a share out of 10 you're now one share out of 40 you went from 10% ownership to 2 and 1 half% ownership that is dilution it stinks luckily this company has done done very very well in its growth so they've only recently started making a lot of money that's probably why they were diluting shareholders they were raising cash by doing equity now let's see what analy let's see what the eight pillars look like okay four x's four checks obviously the growth portion and the no the very small debt portion is the big number so long-term liabilities is a is uh 2.8 times their 5year average free cash flow but look how low their five-e average free cash flow is it's 60 million versus last year's free cash flow of 245 million so not much debt there obviously the metrics over here for shares outstanding there's a lot of celsius is most common question i get and i think the hard part for me on celsius is fast growing companies easy come easy go maybe it's in a very very very competitive market drinks right especially energy drinks this is a market that's very diluted a lot of people entering it it is considered a more healthy choice versus the typical energy drink like monster and red bull but nonetheless it is still carbonated energy drink take that for what you want let's see what analysts are saying about the company so a dollar in profit this year going to 274 in the next four years some big jumps there guys and revenue growth still big time guys look at this 20% 18% 18% 35 8 and a2 big time revenue growth numbers this is what you want to see great balance sheet great growth potential the only thing that stinks is dilution now i will be honest the dilution this year has been a lot better a lot lower than past years but be careful about dilution make sure they get to the point where they're not diluting anymore i mean if they're generating cash now it's increasing there should be no reason to dilute any further so let's see what the stock analyzer tool tells about this company because it's a fast growing company i don't even know if i've ever done it before ever i've never even done it before you guys are watching me lose my virginity on celsius so remember stock analyzer tool is a great way to sit there and say excluding the balance sheet what are these cash flows worth i'm going to make assumptions low middle and high about the future on revenue and profit margin and say what's this company worth to me today does that mean you buy it if it's green and you don't buy if it's red no there's nuances here it's a great starting point to say okay this is all green i need to get deeper look so revenue growth we saw those revenue growth potentials i'm going to go with it's a very competitive market anything can happen i'm going to go with 6 12 and 18 i might sit there and say paul that's a wide range yeah i know it's a very wide range why it's a young company young companies have very wide ranges of what can happen very wide ranges that's why they're riskier that's why your return should be higher that's why you should expect a higher return easy come easy go profit margin now look at this in the last 10 years it was 5.6% last 5 years 6 and a half% last year your 19.5 so here's what i'm going to do let's go with 15 20 and 25% free cash flow i'm going to do the exact same thing even though free cash flow last year was lower than the profit look at the last 10 years higher than the profit so i'm just going to keep this the same now for pe 28 current pe 33 price of free cash flow fast growing company great balance sheet but we're trying to get a pe and price of free cash flow 10 years from now when it's a more mature business so you can't give them the same pe that you think of today so i'm going to sit here i'm going to put 15 20 and 25 i still think 20 and 25 are high but that's okay now finally for our last metric what's our desired return now i'm going to put nine across the board remember you can't expect nine nine is the market return you're buying a company individual business you need margin of safety because we don't know the future and we're humans and we make mistakes but in addition to that this company is small the smaller the company the faster going it is the more things that can go wrong it's not an established company you need a higher return than 9 or 10% what you put in up to you i hit the analyze button boom i get a low price of 18 a high price of 108 and a middle price of 45 yeah i mean this is probably justifying a deeper look because at 45 bucks at current value of $35 a share you're going to get about 12 half% return my question to you is is that worth it for celsius maybe maybe not that's a decision you have to make stock number two mad guys madna is at $58 per share 52e low of $55.72 years they go generic the price plummets so there are people in our community who are really really good at looking at the pipeline the pipeline is what drugs are they working on which ones are in phase one phase two phase three which ones are waiting for approval etc if you can look at that and you see a lot of things in the pipeline the next analysis you need to do how marketable are these drugs it's all great and dandy to sit there and create a drug that gets rid of a disease but if that disease only has four people in the world who have it how marketable is that that's the key now i'm going to an extreme by saying that but it's really really important when you're looking at these drugs to understand that component now from this standpoint some of the things i like market cap $22 billion enterprise value 23.66 on traditional methods 17.65 on my formula so very very good balance sheet with a low price to free cash flow of around nine um yeah it's pretty interesting here this is pretty pretty interesting 5year profit margin average 28% last year's profit margin negative 117% big loss last year let's see and by the way why did madna hit all-time high 497 in 2021 please go watch our past videos if you care we kept saying guys this is a covid driven company same like fizer when the covid thing came out it's like what's the revenue going to do you can't look at temporary jumps from temporary events just like you can't look at temporary falls from temporary events and sit there and declare the company going under temporary is a good thing if you're able to buy in the low side this company is now down almost 90% from its all-time high because how much of the revenue came from co let's go look at their income statement just to show this revenue over the years 101 milon 177 122 48 275 17.8 billion 18.9 billion last year 6.75 and the last 12 months $5 billion without going into stock analyzer i'm just going to sit here and tell you guys this is all about their pipeline because as you can tell revenu shut up with co have they been able to take this cash flow and do better things with it have they been able to generate new and new drugs maybe make acquisitions this is especially important to have this conversation especially in the community with a thousand investors so if you are interested and join the community and you want access to all the tools if you've gone to everything money.com you've seen that we only have a limited number of daily spots left for the community and software the reason we do that is that the software as it exists today it gives everything for retirement stock analyst analysis even real estate but as we expand we're making changes and the offer of everything is going to be separated out you may remember when we first started this that i built the software for myself for my team and iid use and then people saw the videos and said hey paul how do i get that software and i said guys you can't get it it's an expensive data feed etc but it got us thinking so wait a second if people want the software why don't we give it to them why don't we take that data feed create software so they can use it we did that and it grew immensely but as the community has grown and the channel's grown it has to become less about me and more about how i can better serve you but don't don't forget one thing guys i dalton mo everybody in our company andrew my business partner upstairs we use this software every single day to make all of our investment decisions so if you join today the best deal we're offering is you'll be grandfathered in for life with all the data and all the tools we made you'll get it all and you'll stay in your pricing tier forever so if you're serious about making better financial decisions most likely increasing returns but more importantly sleeping better at night click on the link in the description below to get access to our software before we make the changes of separating things out i'm very confident it'll be one of the best decisions youve ever made and even better you can try it out for 7 days for $7 stock number three advanced auto parts currently selling at $38 per share 3640 was a low less than two weeks ago all-time high of $88 guys in march $88 per share down to 36 just a couple weeks ago in less than 7even months the stock fell well over 50% about 60% in price okay now some metrics $2.3 billion market cap 11 half billion doll enterprise value that's a big difference especially that's a $9 billion difference which is essentially your debt especially when your free cash flow is averaging around $350 or $400 million per year that is a very big difference so let's go check out even though the price of free cash flow is only six there's a lot of debt here if you look here on our eight pillars this is what worries me the most now granted it's retail so i'm sure there's a lot of a lot of this is retail but low roic buying back some shares my question to them is why aren't you buying back more shares but look at this revenue growth of 1.65 billion but only seeing $30 million increase in free cash flow in that time that's a little puzzling to me but again six times free cash flow so the first thing i would do go figure out let's go figure out how much of that debt level is retail leases versus normal operating debt and once you do that you can sit there and say okay how good are these locations because a $2.3 billion market cap let's let say this was 23 billion hypothetically i'm not saying it should be then all of a sudden $9 billion in extra debt doesn't feel so bad as a percentage we just look at this saying this is five times more now five times more enterprise value than market cap it's a lot of debt to have in the company but looks like pretty consistent cash flow 375 million over the last 5 years 350 last year let's go check out that cash flow statement i want to see how this thing looks overall one year last year was a big drop look at these two years co and the year after co big jumps in free cash flow before then man this is a declining business maybe so be careful of this 480 470 260 411 600 395 700 817 310 45 in the last 12 months $350 million in free cash flow wow a good way to look at the business itself and how it's operating look at their operating income on their annual statement their income statements so we've got 850 882 25 790 570 640 677 750 820 670 114 and the last 12 months 33 this feels like a declining business i wonder why that is let's go see what analysts say about their growth levels i mean look at this oh wow doubling their eps in the next four or five years from 359 to 738 over a double and they do have revenue growth of a couple percentage points i want you know what i'm going to do a little bit deeper guys let's go to the 10k and see how many location they currently have so i'm clicking on the 10k on our software so in 2023 61 stores and branches were open and 40 were closed or consolidating resulting in total of 517 stores that's your big debt okay that's a lot of stores now i want to see what same store sales growth was so i can look up comparable sales store okay net sales during 20123 were 11.3 billion an increase of 1.2% compared to 2022 driven by new store openings and favorably profit product favorable product miss partially offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales that's interesting look at this gross profit for 2023 was 40.1% a decrease of 400 basis points that's 4% decline that's a big decline but it's interesting because above they said hey things are good because comparable sales stor growth has been good well just last year they had a decline so guys you don't want companies that just open stores to get sales growth but the stores that they have are declining in revenue that's not a good thing you do not want that that's something you want to avoid does that mean that's the case here not necessarily the job here is to look at previous years and see how their yearly comparable sales store growth was so i'm pulling up the 20202 annual report from early 2023 to see what the comparable store sales were 3% comparable store sales increased 3% led by primarily by the professional business now guys the other thing is inflation's going up so in a year that we saw a lot of inflation of 2022 they only saw 3% comparable sales store growth i don't know this one i'm kind of i think there's better retailers out there than this one based on what i'm seeing initially but of course if you think different that's the reason to use the software in the community to talk about it so guys if you want to

2024-10-16,axDXnl-Sj00,"kind: captions language: en today we're going to analyze the top five stocks that investors in our everything money community are buying stock number one atkr at core we've talked about the stock before they do electrical nodes and devices and little things but look at this here's the interesting part and this is what i love about our community alltime high 195 back in april now on september 11th 2024 never forget it hit a low of $8 per share and it's currently at 84 bucks so it's up 5% from its low back in september this is a company that's been beaten up from a share price perspective but remember we want to find companies that even though the share prices are down the fundamentals are getting better so some highle metrics $3.2 billion market cap 4.3 enterprise value that difference there is essentially the net debt so about a billion a billion dollars in debt but here's the good news they're free cash flow 400 million last year 450 million the last 5year average it's lower than their net income so first question is why is that but here's what's getting every's attention pe of 5.8 price of free cash flow of eight this is what's getting everybody's attention a small ply dividend of 36% my question is why funny thing is even though their net income's down profit margin is down significantly so that tells me revenue is down let's go check that out yep revenu is declining 1.5 1.5 1.8 1.9 1.77 2.9 3 .9 last year 3.5 last 12 months 3.3 so revenue is dropping the first question you have to ask for those in your community the first question you guys got to discuss is go do the research on is this a decline that's on its way to get worse or is it understandable because of this big jump during covid remember you don't want to buy a company based on its best years and the best your are behind them you want to buy a company based on what they're going to do during a normal cycle and the question i ask yourself by atore is is this a normal cycle and the stock has been has fallen so much so quickly even if it's not the normal cycle hasn't been beaten up enough that could be the case so let's see what analysts are saying about that go to our analyst estimates on our software not much there but a 23% drop this year on eps another 15% drop expected for next year but rebounding according to the six analysts who are following it in 2026 revenue 10% drop this year 1% drop next year 5% growth so it's something you definitely need to spend more time looking at now remember every investment is the present value of all future cash flows that's why we use stock analyzer tool the stock analyzer tool allows us to make assumptions about the future and it tells us based on those assumptions what the right price to pay is today not including the balance sheet okay so for atore let's go use a stock analyzer i did a 10-year analysis now the first one thing i do like about this high return on invested capital so this company hases a great job of managing the money investing the business and using it to generate more profit i did two four and 6% revenue growth what i think we need to do though is -2 one and 4% revenue growth so guys this is what's so great about stock analyzer tool you can do the low middle and high to put in a wide rate of range of assumptions and if it hits your greens you do more research to see which one's more likely profit margin i did 10 14 and 18% same with free cash flow and for a pe guys i just unless the company is permanently declining it has a high roic i don't think five and eight times earnings in free cash flow is reasonable i did 1215 and 18 and finally what is my desired return i did 9% now do i think a company should get 9% return no if you want a 9 10% return invest in a lowcost etf but this allows me to say what's the intrinsic value you need to add your margin of safety in there by increasing that desired return okay what's that right number i don't know what it is for you so let's hit the analyze button guys they're b it's actually exactly on the nose 86 8637 8637 on the nose have we ever seen that happen i don't think we have that's incredible exactly on the nose if this goes up one penny it's going to be red middle of 166 to high of 297 my opinion is take a look deeper into this bas on today's price and by the way you saw it just change right here 9% 20% returns in the middle 30% in the high if you bought it at today's price assuming your assumptions here are correct that's the big part so this one tells me go take a deeper look it's worth the work to go put in there to make 20 or 30% a year stock number two one of my favorite stocks out there one that i do not own but one that i can't wait to own the googly mly it's twice its low from just a few years ago all-time high of 193 back in july 10th only 3 months ago 52e low of 121 back in october of last year just a year ago shows you how much things can change guys great balance sheet $2.1 billion trillion dollar market cap essentially the same thing for enterprise value very little debt in the company look at this free cash flow now here's the interesting part free cash flow 61 billion an income of 88 billion big difference there 5year average free cash flow net income are much closer 57 billion and 63 billion now this is a lot of money and it's harder to get really good deals on large companies but the important part about google is to sit there and say this the quality the story behind it is incredible they on the two largest search engines in the world google.com and youtube.com this company owns the this is an advertising business they own the advertising space but the story has to match the numbers and that's what's really important if you only follow the story you're probably going to end up overpaying at some point but if you mix the story and the numbers together that's what's going to make you a great investor okay so let's look at the eight pillars for google guys six checks two x's and the two x's are valuation but remember we don't know if the valuation too high google is a premium company that deser a deserves a premium valuation how premium that's the hard part so let's see what analysts are saying and i'll show you this look at this earnings per share growth for google 33% 14% 15% 14% 22% this earnings per share is growing so much you got to pay a premium for that absolutely have to you'd be doing google disservice and yourself a disservice by paying 15 times free cash flow for this company okay revenue growth big time also high single digits low double- digit revenue growth again same thing so stock analyzer tool and i am only doing a one assumption here because it's a pretty large company so i'm okay just starting here 7 half% revenue growth now you saw on the 5-year revenue growth it was higher than that so i'm probably being too conservative here let's call it 9% let's do the profit margin at 24 same with the free cash flow and i put my pe in price of free cash flow of 23 that's the premium i'm paying a big premium to the market hit the analyze button i have the stock currently worth 2011 at current price today 11 a half% return assuming everything above is correct because their balance sheet is great so i don't have to worry about the balance sheet here so based on today's price again i think it's something to take a look at i think our our users of our software are doing a great job of sitting there and finding a potential opportunity there stock number three one that's been surging lately alibaba alibaba if you look right here last 6 months up 54% 40% in the last 3 months year to date 45% one year 30% now this is a company i've owned for a while and i don't think i'm i think i'm a little bit still in the loss for it but that doesn't bother me why because i look at alibaba and say what's the future of china now a lot of people say oh there's a war there's going to be a war with t yeah maybe there will be a war but i look at it what's 20 years from now and that's a hard thing for investors to do it's not hard for me but i can sit there and say where is alibaba going to be in 20 years now i don't know the future but if i'm betting on china will china be a bigger company country economically in 20 10 or 20 years from now yes i do and if alibaba is around will they do very well if that happens yes they will so i look at that saying okay let's take a look at this company because it is 320 is its all-time high it was a low of $66 back in january of this year the previous low i think was 58 bucks that we saw a couple years ago back here in $581 in october of 2022 two years ago 50 50 $58 it's up almost 100% in that time remember paying more hurts you versus paying less as long as fundamentals are getting better that's the big key so let's go look at the cash flow fundamentals on this company that's what's interesting guys 13 14 19 27 12 a2 23 21 19 and a half in the last 12 months so there's a decline in the last few years but it's still a very high free cash flow business it is currently selling for 13 times free cash flow after going up 100% almost in 2 years after up 45% year-to date after you're up 30% in the last one year it's still selling for 13 times free cash flow let's see what analysts are saying about eps not much growth here according to analysts i have a hard time believing this but maybe they're right there's a lot more analysts here following the company and there's a lot of uncertainty in china but that uncertainty is what led to a lower stock price that's what the benefit of uncertainty is that's what the benefit of fear is as an investor sitting there and saying okay what's that going to do because look at the eps look at the revenue growth here 87 8773 man i have a hard time believing that they grow the revenue like that the profits going to be basically the same but these are the same analysts who are doing this and i talk about this all the time i like i like looking what the analysts are doing but you have to sit there and understand it as a company now as you guys know when stocks fall if you're alone at home investing is that lonely journey watching a st stock fall saying what is going on here it is very crucial to surround yourself with a supportive community of likeminded individuals to limit the emotional pitfalls of investing because remember investing isn't about the numbers it's 90% about the stomach and the emotions and that's what makes the everything money community so incredible everyone is dedicated to achieving financial success together and everyone has realized it's more about the emotion than the numbers now i remember when i first built this software for my own journey i did not expect to see how many people would be interested i built it for myself and i was using it on the channel people would say hey how do i get access to that and i said listen you can't do it it's an expensive data feed you're not going to be able to do it but then it hit us there's demand for the software we kept hearing it over and over how do i get this so we said okay this is realizing how important it is for us to serve the community better so we made the software and we're currently working on some changes but the good news is these changes aren't live right now the software includes all these tools for stock real estate and retirement and if you join now you'll be grandfathered in for life to get these features that we've created and keeping them in the pricing tier that you're locked into but these changes are going to happen and we're going to start splitting these things off and having to buy them separately so if you're committed to making smarter financial choices and more importantly reducing the emotional stress in your life click on the link in the description below to secure access before these changes happen and just just reminder we have a limited number of daily spots available for our software and community so click on the link and sign up before it goes away it's only $7 for 7 days to try it out it's a no-brainer so go ahead and do that so let's do the stock analyzer tool for alibaba i did 10 year of analysis i did 3 six and 9% revenue growth i did profit margin of 12 15 and 18% i did a higher free cash flow 1518 and 21 cu as you see free cash flow is consistently higher than earnings which we love now remember a lot of people i i've worried about fraud in china a lot but if there was fraud this is what they'd be lying about unless they're the ultimate fraudster which could be the case and they're lying about the free cash flow to throw people off but everybody follows profit margin not free cash flow margin so why would they show a higher free cash flow than profit margin okay pe currently 27 and price of free cash fl of 13 i put 16 18 and 20 and again my 9% no margin of safety return hit the analyze button guys i got a low price of 105 to 130 high price of 285 to 330 middle price of 175 to 210 that's why i'm not worried about my cost basis right now i'm very excited about alibaba but remember don't buy a company just cuz i or anybody el else on the internet has it what's important is for you to do your own research and find a company that fits your thought process stock number four nike guys great brand great company going through a lot of public problems right now have a new ceo starting today all-time high of 179 back in november of 21 three years ago now and it's currently at 81 bucks and trust me go back and look at videos of us on nike i guarantee people were saying that stock would ever fall below 100 blah blah blah blah blah we've heard it before we'll hear it again it hit a low of $70 a share back on august 5th a mere two and a half months ago that's what's incredible guys great company great brand they own the basketball world look at their eight pillars check marks all the way around except for valuation but this is a premium company as much as the news is negative about nike i have a question of like what really is negative about nike their allegations of having child children working in factories that's been going on for decades people have been saying that i look at this saying this is a great brand they have kevin durant lebron james and michael jordan on lifetime contracts they're doing a great job making great shoes with immense demand okay i'm looking at this i'm looking at their let's look at their analyst estimates let's look at revenue first not some big revenue growth it's such a big company but 52 billion to 66 billion in the next 5 years that's some big time growth for a company of the size earnings per share growth almost doubling in the next five years so everybody's talking about nike i've literally heard people say nike is dead that's when you want to be looking at a company i look at nike and say this might be a great example of a stock price that's down a lot while the fundamentals continue to get better so let's go to stock analyzer tool guys i didn't do major assumptions 35 and 7% revenue growth 10 11 12 on free cash flow and profit margin 2023 and 26 for my multiples why premium company i don't care what anybody says it's a premium company with a high teens and 20% roic this means moat this means good of capital and my 9% market return hit the analyze button i have a low price of 60 high price of 119 middle price of 85 for me i have in my watch list below 80 not to buy it below 80 but to sell puts at lower prices i'm excited about nike and i hope it falls to 40 i repeat i hope it falls to 40 and hopefully there's a big stock selloff and this bare market of 874 years finally ends we'll be able to buy nike at even better prices than today stock number five the final company celsius celsius is the healthy energy drink it has if you saw right here it's skyrocket it's still up 3,000% the last 5 years after being down 55% in the last 6 months that's incredible this company has absolutely killed it absolutely killed it great balance sheet $7.8 billion market cap 7.4 billion enterprise value look at that that great balance sheet here great balance sheet here return invested capital last year 15% still even though it's down so much it's still selling for 31 times free cash flow and 26 times earnings so okay it's a little bit needs some work here but of course it gets everybody's attention because alltime high of 100 bucks was just back in march 14th pi day march 14th which was 7 months ago 52 we low last week of 28 bucks that's a fall of 72% down and still selling for 30 times which means it was selling for 100 times free cash flow it's attractive because it was a very exciting company going up and that it was exciting going down look at that down you're telling me that the company changed its fundamental 70% in the last seven months i doubt that because look at this look at their revenue in the last 12 months 1.5 billion of revenue previous years 1.3 650 34 they basically doubl their revenue every year year for like i don't know a long time that's incredible now is that going to continue on it's not possible it's not possible w your revenue forever let's look at the eight pillars here interesting four checks four x's 5year pe fiveyear price of free cash flow guess what i'm doing with these not even paying attention to them why massive growth company five years ago they did $14 in revenue not literally but i'm being funny about that you cannot look at their 5 years of free cash flow and 5 years of earnings and say oh that's reasonable it's a massively growing company that's grown a ton in the last 5 years 5 years ago the revenue was $75 million it's 20x from today it is you'd be hurting yourself by looking at the 5year pe so i don't even look at these things return invested capital growing business probably skewed low i like the fact that this year's return invested capital in the last 12 months is 15% shares outstanding are higher i don't like that so much fast growing business they use the excitement of the stock i don't blame them get those shares out get the cash in your balance sheet make it better i just don't want them to the habit of doing that that's the issue here so let's see what analysts are saying about the company eps a dollar a share going to 274 great growth an eps and revenue doubling from here for the next four years that's 20% a year so guys what's the story about celsius well it's a great option for energy drink i will say this though this is a very very crowded space you've got to have a little bit more margin of safety in this one in my opinion that's what i'm doing i would have a little bit more margin of safety because i look at it saying these companies come in come out go in go out i will say this as the stock price falls start watching for somebody to acquire them now back on august 1st of 2022 it was announced that pepsi made a $550 million investment in celsius okay okay now terms of that deal are out there on the internet internet but as you can tell pepsi wants in on the celsius bandwagon they see this and say let's add this to our portfolio to compete more with coke so let's go look at monster beverage to see how this company could compare to that monster last year did revenue of 7.4 billion five times larger than celsius the great news is about celsius great balance sheet same with monster great balance sheet essentially no debt on hand which i love seeing but monster is a lot bigger than celsius so it shows the potential growth potential for celsius as time goes on so what is celsius worth to us let's go look that up right now based on the stock analyzer tool now wide range for the next 10 years i did 6 12 and 18% i'll be honest with you i don't even know how much i like these i'm actually going to go a little bit lower i'm going to go 4 8 and 12% now you might be sitting there saying paul it's so freaking low maybe it is that's why if you have our software you can put it in yourself and come up your own numbers 15 20 and 25% for profit margin and free cash flow i did a pe of 1520 and 25 again this is at the end of 10 years that might be on the high side and i did my 9% return so there's a lot of numbers here to analyze i have a low price of 15 high price of 67 middle price of 33 so for me right now it's not obvious enough for it's like i got to go take a look so if you guys want to see a video on the 18 stocks that i own watch this next video thank you for your

2024-10-17,iqILnuwrfKo,"kind: captions language: en there are three etfs that i'm never going to sell ever and i'm going to share with you why you should never sell these because they can help you secure your financial future in retirement my goal in life is to live off of my brokerage account so when i put money into these things i want to make sure that it generates me enough income where i can live the life i want to live and keep reinvesting in the future for you your job if you're saving for retirement is to make sure that your money goes into tax efficient accounts that can grow and compound for decades to come so that way when you're ready to retire you have all the money you need now even though our situations are different our goals the same we want to be able to have enough to live the rest of our life and not worry about things and that's why these three etfs will be added to my portfolio these three etfs are sc hd spy and qqq so what are they hd is the schwab dividend portfolio it tries to mimic the dow jones 100 dividend portfolio spy s&amp;p 500 very simple and if you only do this one you're probably going to do very well in life but if you want to get some extra returns i think you got to add qqq into your portfolio this is the nasdaq 100 which is highly concentrated in high growth high compounding companies like adobe microsoft nvidia and that takes the guesswork out of what companies to pick that can grow for the future now you guys know me i have 18 individual companies and i want to have 30 or 40 but it's not mutually exclusive i'm still going to add these to my portfolio along the way why because these do a good job of hedging myself and smoothing out my returns so if some of my stocks are laggards for a while and these things are up a lot boom if some of my stocks are doing well because they're more value plays while these are down boom i'm hedging myself in a certain element now you might think well that's over diversification maybe but my position in life actually is very similar to yours because i want to live the rest of my life with my money and you don't need to touch that money until you're 65 and then at that point you'll live the rest of your life off that money but the goal for you is to make sure you're putting it in tax efficient accounts like your ias and your 401ks so it can compound and compound and compound for decades to come so let's break down these etfs to see what's in them and why they're attractive to me so this isd again this is the schwab dividend portfolio expense ratio look how low that is 06 that means let's break down the math if you put $1,000 into this 1% would be 10 bucks 1% of 1% would be 10 cents so this is 60 cents a year for every ,000 you put in there that's nothing the average mutual fund charges around 1% if not more so this is going to can pound on you for a long period of time next thing people love dividends 3.39% current dividend yield and i argue the market's massively overpriced so when the market falls this dividend yield is going to go higher and higher and higher all right turnover ratio 28% that means they keep their stocks on average about four years not bad total assets under management this is a good siiz fund $64 billion a lot of money in here a lot of net inflows right now and guess is as stocks fall these are more reasonably priced stocks giving a good dividend my guess is this will not suffer the same outflows that qqq or spy might get so it's a great place to get some dividend if that's what you want and you can in your tax deferred accounts this can grow your dividends and compound on itself and reinvest it at higher rates of return here are the top 25 holdings ford home depot black rock cisco chevron locky martin bristol meers verizon fizer tech the point is it's all companies you know i would be surprised if any of these were gone in the next 10 years these are high quality businesses now i'm not breaking down their balance sheets i'm not breaking down their price to free cash flow the point of an etf is you dollar cost average markets are up markets are down it doesn't matter you keep reinvesting etf number two spy follows the s&amp;p 500 very simply higher expense ratio which surprises me than sd lower dividend yield which makes sense especially in this recent market where the magnificent 7 that don't pay much in dividends if at all are surging turnover ratio 2% that means once every 50 years the thing turns over completely 592 billion in assets under management adding 40 billion now guys there's another s&amp;p 500 etf called vu vo with vanguard the difference is expense ratio is 03 now it's lower and i believe in that but again every ,000 we're talking about 60 cents difference it adds up but again for some reason i'm just committed to spy because i owned it in the past and i've always owned it but vanguard is a phenomenal company and i probably should switch to that now guys here are the top 25 holdings for spy and they're going to go in order of market cap apple nvidia microsoft amazon meta google broadcom birkshire another google these are the same company don't worry about that eli lily guys the bottom line is these are companies that are great these are large companies they're going to drive the markets these are the top 25 holdings and they probably make up 40 or 50% of the market value if not more of the s&amp;p 500 these are ginormous businesses your goal your benchmark everyone's benchmark is spy so if you're always investing in spy always investing in chd how do you beat the market well here's how you do it you add qqq to it but you got to add it at the right time now here's qqq stats higher expense ratio 2% dividend yield nothing 6% turnover ratio 22% similar tod and 300 billion in assets under management and inflows of 22 billion which i think are a lot based on where the markets are these at the high tech companies it's going to look very similar to spy at the top apple nvidia microsoft broadcom meta amazon tesla costco you might look at it going costco yeah costco it fits its criteria amd netflix google pepsico there are some companies here that pay nice dividends this all about the nasdaq 100 and some companies are in the nasdaq but aren't necessarily high-tech but most high-tech companies are in the nasdaq and the reason qqq can do so well tech companies are able to generate much higher returns on capital than other companies they don't have to invest as much to get high growth returns you look at a company like google not much growth in there but they can grow their earnings per share by big leaps and bounds double digits per year because their ability to generate more and more returns on less and less money that's how you generate a lot of wealth quickly that's how you get the multi bagers so as i was saying let me compare qqq and spy to show how you can outperform the market by buying qqq at the right time so this is how you can use qqq to beat the market guys this is a chart of qqq's total return versus the s&amp;p 500 from june 1st of 2003 which was basically the low after the market market had crashed for three straight years now obviously this is the low and it's a massive beat now remember after co big drops and there's a huge surge in these tech companies but again even going back they outperformed now let's check how they did from the peak of the 2000 bubble because there's a lot of interesting data here i really want you to see this is essentially from the peak of 2000 march 31st of 2000 i think the peak was like march 20th or march 10th here's qqq here's the s&amp;p 500 again the peak but remember look how much it fell the nasdaq fell 83% from its peak the s&amp;p fell about 50% big time difference and it took a long time took a long time it got close to even at co but guys this is huge now you might look at this and go well paul i can't time the market and it goes to show that i shouldn't be investing now because valuations are so high well wait a second what we discuss all the time is dollar cost averaging let me tell you this i went back personally and i did the numbers from the peak of the 2,000 bubble so let's say you started investing literally at the absolute highest point and you absorbed that 83% fall if you dollar cost average $200 per month in the s&amp;p and qqq today you know what your returns would be let me show you your qqq return would be 13.5% annualized while your s&amp;p 500 would be 10.5% and this is after watching an 80% fall that's the power of dollar cost averaging and letting things compound so you'd have looked so bad along the way but as the stock as stocks fell you'd be adding more and more money and as they started to gain momentum all that money that you added would keep growing and growing and growing and look at this massive outperformance so this is why i believe that you can beat the market using just etfs basically just using two different etfs spy and qqq and this is exactly why i'm going to include those as my three etfs that i never want to sell now the last one scd i've made a video before and i want to explain to you why i like sd one less volatility it tends to do better during bad times why it's dividend etf tends to be more boring companies with less volatility less hype so when things fall they're going to go down a lot less when things are up they're going to go up a lot less here's proof from the start of fchd back in 2011 it's the worst performer qqq is up 891 per s&amp;p 500 518d 415 but look scd and spy only started to shift apart really substantially back during this mag 7 huge monster rally apart from that they were pretty much in lock step along the way so it's a good way to get some dividends less volatility and grow your money now you got to keep in mind my situation's different if you watched our video about sd i told everybody guys the reason sd works for me is i have a thousand apartments upstairs and growing we're going to have 5 or 10,000 units in the next 10 years i've got five or six business upstairs two or three of them which generate big revenue and good profit okay i don't need my money to kill it for me so i'm okay getting less returns i'm okay being a little more conservative and don't forget i'm still buying stocks individual companies that fall into my category that i really want to own at great prices i can be pickier on my investments in individual companies as i have these etfs in my portfolio now in full disclosure i don't own any of these etfs yet i'm trying to decide how i start dollar cost averaging because that is my plan i will dollar cost average into all three of these etfs at a certain point and just start going month to month history has shown that putting the lump sum in tends to do better but for my psychology and the fact that i can still get 4 and a half% of my cash i'm in no rush so for me i'm going to dollar cost average into these and if stocks fall there might be some individual companies i want to keep adding to and that'll do really well for me over time and on top of that all three of these etfs have a lot of volume and a lot their big so i can sit there and generate extra income on my money by selling covered calls and cash secured puts in order to buy and to generate income along the way that income can generate 1 to 3% extra per year and a lot of our community members are doing way better than 1 to 3% in fact mo and i tend to do a lot better than 1 to 3% since we've been doing this for the last four years now guys i did a further video on why i'm buying scd so do me a favor click on the card to watch that video thank you for your time",AAPL;ADBE;AVGO;BLK;BMY;BRK-B;CVX;GOOG;HD;LMT;META;MSFT;NFLX;NVDA;PEP;PFE;TSLA,GOOG:OPEN;AVGO:OPEN;BRK-B:OPEN;META:OPEN;NFLX:OPEN;PEP:DECREASE;TSLA:OPEN;AAPL:OPEN;PFE:HOLD;LMT:CLOSE;ADBE:OPEN;MSFT:OPEN;NVDA:OPEN;BMY:HOLD;BLK:HOLD;CVX:HOLD;HD:CLOSE,GOOG:OPEN;AVGO:OPEN;BRK-B:OPEN;META:OPEN;NFLX:OPEN;PEP:DECREASE;TSLA:OPEN;AAPL:OPEN;PFE:HOLD;LMT:HOLD;ADBE:OPEN;MSFT:OPEN;NVDA:OPEN;BMY:HOLD;BLK:HOLD;CVX:HOLD;HD:CLOSE,BRK-B:0.0038;DG:0.0432;GD:0.0076;HD:0.0432;HWM:0.0139;LMT:0.0108;LOW:0.0432;MNST:0.1694;MRNA:0.1004;MSFT:0.0013;NKE:0.2296;NOC:0.0135;NVDA:0.0013;PEP:0.2296;PYPL:0.0044;SBUX:0.0014;TGT:0.0244;ULTA:0.0044;WMT:0.0548,AAPL:0.0876;ADBE:0.0842;AVGO:0.0842;BRK-B:0.0842;DG:0.0042;GD:0.0007;GOOG:0.0709;HWM:0.0014;LOW:0.0042;META:0.0842;MNST:0.0166;MRNA:0.0098;MSFT:0.0876;NFLX:0.0842;NKE:0.0225;NOC:0.0013;NVDA:0.0876;PEP:0.0884;PYPL:0.0004;SBUX:0.0001;TGT:0.0024;TSLA:0.0876;ULTA:0.0004;WMT:0.0054,BRK-B:0.0024;DG:0.0389;GD:0.0058;HD:0.0389;HWM:0.0099;LMT:0.0083;LOW:0.0389;MNST:0.1921;MRNA:0.0960;MSFT:0.0006;NKE:0.2413;NOC:0.0099;NVDA:0.0006;PEP:0.2413;PYPL:0.0027;SBUX:0.0007;TGT:0.0220;ULTA:0.0027;WMT:0.0469,AAPL:0.0889;ADBE:0.0855;AVGO:0.0855;BRK-B:0.0855;DG:0.0030;GD:0.0004;GOOG:0.0719;HD:0.0009;HWM:0.0008;LMT:0.0002;LOW:0.0030;META:0.0855;MNST:0.0147;MRNA:0.0073;MSFT:0.0889;NFLX:0.0855;NKE:0.0185;NOC:0.0008;NVDA:0.0889;PEP:0.0898;PYPL:0.0002;SBUX:0.0001;TGT:0.0017;TSLA:0.0889;ULTA:0.0002;WMT:0.0036,1.0322005800225704,1.0329456304489721,0.032200580022570424,0.03294563044897214
2024-10-21,MhZxlNox2vc,kind: captions language: en paler has skyrocketed 620 per since december 2022 that's less than two years and the question on everyone's mind did i miss out is it too late to buy paler well it depends if you bought paler at the all-time high on january 27th 2021 at $45 per share and held on you're still down on your investment even though the fundamentals have significantly improved since then you all also would have had the stomach a fall from $45 all the way down to 6 very reminiscent of amazon going from $113 a share down to six back in 2001 and in some cases a business is a better purchase at a higher price because there's more clarity on the management and the path to profitability so let's analyze paler as a business and see if that's actually the case for paler so before you buy any company there are two things you have to look at the story and the numbers merging them together is how you get the best investments because like buffett and munger always say some of the best companies to invest in on general metrics will look expensive from a normal valuation perspective guys this is palente teers customer growth this is not year to year this is quarter to quarter starting at the beginning of 2022 277 304 337 367 391 421 453 497 and the best part about paler is they've done a great job diversifying their customer base they used they started an o3 to help the government with their war on terrorism and since then they've realized listen we need to get more contracts with more commercial use that way we diversify our cash flow and aren't ryant purely on hoping there are wars and hoping there are issues in the government that they have to tackle now let's look at pal's most recent quarterly report paler reports revenue growth of 27% year-over-year but here's the best part us commercial revenue grew 55% year-over-year that's incredible the number of customers grew 83% so what that tells me is they're getting more customers at a lower price now you might sit there and say that's not good well necessarily it's about diversifying the bigger and bigger you get in order to grow you have to take less and less revenue on that's okay in my opinion and on top of that us government revenue still grew 25 4% year-over-year that's still solid growth for their biggest metric commercial revenue 33% year-over-year and total government revenue not just us grew 23% year-over-year and they closed 27 deals over $10 million each now guys the other benefit is paler is big on the ai space and ai has a lot of great growth potential great here is the global artificial intelligence market size accounted for 638 billion us 2024 expected to go to 3.7 trillion a compounded annual growth rate of 19% in 2034 now these are estimations but guys that is a huge growth potential now i don't know whether it's going to happen or not but i will tell you if you told me it was higher than this in 2034 i'd believe you now guys this is their breakdown of revenue bye and segment government versus commercial now as of late as of late government's been a lot higher but when it first started government was 255 million commercial was 340 million back in 2018 look how much has grown commercial has grown about 3x since 2018 but government's grown almost 5x since 2018 so i'm looking at this saying hey this is getting pretty good here there's getting some more diversity here in their revenue let's get about there and guys this is where i'm now going to show you some of the financial metrics that are important and the biggest one i like look at their current gross maret margin 81% that means those $10 million contracts are signing 8.1 million roughly goes to basically pay their overhead and their taxes 81% gross margin can i compare that to another big software business let's go look at microsoft microsoft's gross margin currently is 69% palente has 12% more margin on every dollar they sell versus microsoft that's a huge huge difference that can really add the bottom line and really create more and more growth in their profit and free cash flow now the interesting part is you look at the stock hitting an all-time high of 45 bucks on january 27th 2021 and where the stock is just now maybe going to get an all-time high but yet you've seen how much revenue and profit increase in that time why guys valuation here are the things that kind of concerned me about the valuation m metrics for pal here first off price to sales ratio it's over 40 right now now nvidia is pretty high but nvidia has a much faster growth rate than paler so you might sit there and say well wait paler is software nvidia is hardware there's different yeah but their gross margin is actually pretty similar it's like 75% for nvidia 81% for paler yet paler is selling for the higher multiple of sales and a higher free cash flow 144 times free cash flow it's a big number guys big big number but one of the benefits of paler 10000 billion market cap enterprise value on any metric basically my version or traditional is about the same they have a great balance sheet and another good thing that people don't feel pay attention to they've really done a good job of decreasing the amount of stock based compensation that means that as they're having this free cash flow a lot of people subtract out the stock based compensation kind of saying listen you're giving out all these shares to people to people in your employee it's diluting our owners it's got to come from somewhere so how much potential is there in palente here let's go see what analysts are saying about the company it's actually surprising not that much growth on earnings per share 36 cents 44 53 58 and 71 cents but pal here is not about earnings not about net income it's about that free cash flow let me show you guys what i mean here is the income statement annually for paler 580 million nega 580 a billion 500 373 finally last year showed a net income of 210 and in the last 12 months 44 million but let's go look at their free cash flow which is a much more important metric in my opinion ne 50 versus negative 580 negative 180 versus nega 580 nega 300 they were cash flow positive in 2021 300 million 183 700 million and still 700 million the last 12 months so free cash flow is significantly higher than its net income and at the end of the day that's how you pay your bills through free cash flow so the interesting part about paler is their free cash flow is getting better and has been better for a while and that's what i love about it but remember the question every astute investor out there has to have is is there a price that's too high to pay for a good thing and the answer is always yes so is that the case with paler well we're going to get into that in two seconds on our stock analyzer tool and the reason we use a stock analyzer tool is guys we don't know the future but i have three assumptions i make on stock analyzer tool because my goal is to make a low middle and high assumption on a lot of different ranges first foremost is revenue growth you have to use these tools to at some point build a model to say okay if this happens what am i willing to pay if this happens what am i willing to pay some of the people in our community have had paler and held on to it not only bought it the lowe's but held on to as it fell and i respect that very much just like you may have felt yourself there has been uncertainty of paler being a good value but using the tools inside the software and have our conversations inside the community our users were able to ignore the price movements and determine a value for paler the theme inside of our community is that valuation matters and ultimately price is what you pay and value is what you get i understand everyone is always on the lookout for the next microsoft the next google the next nvidia but back in 2012 i didn't have a community and i made mistakes like not letting microsoft run after i bought it and just like everybody out there i bought a company in 2000 that went to zero because i was buying into the tech hype global crossing go look it up i believe the ceo was the fastest ever billionaire in 11 months from start to billionaire was 11 months of time and sometimes solid growth stocks like pounder might be right in front of you but you need to understand that price and value in the long run are tied to the hip as value goes up price will go along with it but if you overpay it's a lot harder for the value to jump up versus price to fall down now we don't know the future what's going to happen but investing can be a lonely road so if you saw a stock go to from 45 to 6 but the fundamentals are getting better even with the fundamentals getting better it's hard to sit there and say that's okay when the stock was at 45 and other youtubers were saying it was $500 stock i sat there and said listen i don't get this i'm interested around five bucks and guess what it went to $5 90 or something like that i never pulled the trigger because it didn't hit my buy price i was probably being too strict and in all cl in all fairness i was probably being a little biased against paler why not going to lie to you the way the company's ceo looks and acts but he talks about these short seller stone and coke and all these other things and it kind of gives me an icky feeling that's what makes the everything money community so incredible everyone in there is dedicated to achieving financial success together so i invite you come join in our community but we're currently working on some new additions and changes as software but the good news is the changes haven't been put live yet so if you join now you'll be grandfathered in for life with all the features we created and all of these tools for retirement stock analysis and real estate but even better you're going to be locked into your pricing tier forever just as a reminder we have a limited number of daily spots in the community and the software so click on the link in the description below go to everything money.com to get access to our community and software before we make these changes i assure you it'll be one of the best decisions you ever make so now let's go check out the stock analyzer tool to determine the right price for us to pay for paler now i'm going to pull up some previous paler analysis and i'm going to show you guys what i thought put in for a 10-year analysis my low middle and high revenue growth rates i put in 8% 16% and 24% guys 10 years at 2 4% that's not easy to do but i put on the high side because we're looking at 19% compounded annual growth rate potential for ai in general so if paler can do a little bit better than that and take more of the market that's very achievable right there okay profit margin i put 15 25 and 35% guys for all i know this could be low why because look at microsoft they do less gross margin as we talked about 12% less and they have a higher profit margin than 20 they have about 30 or 33% profit margin so i could be conservative here so i did that in the free cash flow i put 20 30 and 40% i put a higher free cash flow margin okay now pe remember this is the pe in price of free cash flow at the end of year 10 not today's end of year 10 and if it's able to grow at these high rates it should be a higher pe in price of free cash flow i put in 15 20 and 25% because i'm also sure by that point the ro will be a lot higher and finally i did a 9% desired return now obviously for a company like this for any company you should probably have a higher than 9% return but i put this in here to kind of give me my intrinsic value what's the market return i would get if i want to b pay this price and from there you need to put a margin of safety in or if you want just put a higher desired return in here you want 12% put in 12% you want 15 put in 15 the higher your return the lower the price so put these assumptions in hit the analyze button and here are my numbers i have a low price of 350 to 6 high price of 40 to 44 middle price of 12 to 15 i have in my watch list currently at 15 bucks not to buy it there but to do more research to say what am i really no pay now before you go i want you to remember that in the short run stocks are voting machine and long run their weighing machine paler weight is getting better and better but if you overpay too much now it'll cost you in the future can you still profit after stock surges absol absolutely you can still make money on stocks even after a significant rise if they're mispriced in the moment it's not just about when you buy but what you're buying do your research and focus on value over price to make smarter investments so guys if you

2024-10-22,MyQDHaPIzyQ,"kind: captions language: en we have four stocks that are up on average 43% year to date that crushes the s&amp;p 23.6 1% year-to date now the question on every investor's mind is can i still buy these companies at reasonable prices and get a market beating return in the future now we're going to analyze them to see if there's any mispricing and determine a fair value for each stock stock number one paypal pay pizzle a company that i own that's got a lot of flak over the years but we're going to take a look at it right now to check it out so let's pull it up in our software pypl paypal holdings now this is a company that i hear a lot of people saying this company's dead it's dying this compan is losing okay there is a metric that is not great and they saw number of accounts created declining okay makes sense but there are other metrics that more than make up for that so let's do a highle look at paypal so first first off paypal surged to $310 over 3 years ago and has fallen since i think the low was about 50 bucks i know the 52e low was 50 bucks about one year ago now in the last year in the last one year it is up 50.64% and year-to date 31% now this is directly from their quarterly report to show the declining business that paypal has total payment volume $416 billion up 11% how is a dying company have payment volume up 11% okay what about revenue 7.9 billion up 8% quite the dying company transaction margin 8% non-gaap eps at $119 is up 36% guys i get it i do not deny that active accounts declining is not a good thing but then you see other metrics like this and you think to yourself wait a second first off active accounts is about even monthly active accounts is up 3% to 222 million number of payment transactions 66 billion 8% growth transactions per account up 11% so people are using people who have paypal are using it more and more and remember they own venmo and venmo is extremely popular okay okay and they even point out over here monthly active users driven by venmo and paypal consumer accounts so i love to see that it's both of those i have venmo i love it i like being able to pay businesses now with venmo that's really helped me out a lot in terms of the company now i don't care much for guidance i don't think companies should guide because i think when they guide they sit there and focus too much in the short run but look at this change transaction margin low to mid- single digit growth slightly positive uh before now they're much higher non-gaap non-transaction operating expenses no change non-gaap effective tax rate no change eps their previous is mid to high single digits now they're the low to mid teens growth so they've increased that gap eps prior was 365 now they're doing 388 to 398 and increase from there free cash flow prior was about 5 billion now they're expecting $6 billion in free cash flow share repurchase before was at least 5 billion now they're expecting 6 billion and guys remember share repurchases are a wonderful thing if a company is buying back cheap shares let's go see if paypal is cheap well guys i look at the pe 19 price of free cash flow of 12.6 seems pretty cheap to me and this is after it's up 51% in the last year 30 some 31% year to date so they're buying all along the way they're buying back cheap shares for their investors to give them a big piece of the business now let's go check out what analysts think about this company not that it really matters a ton but eps growth 450 to 691 okay pretty consistent growth and revenue growth high sevens high sevens mid sevens eight 10% so for this dying company they're still expecting above nominal gdp growth all right i like that so let's go take a look at stock analyzer tool what is this company worth to us today the last time i did this oh look i got points for using the uh the software i did a 10-year analysis now remember guys our stock analyzer tool that we're going to use on this company and the another three is intended to sit there and say listen every investment's the present value of all your future cash flow so whatever you pay for it today the future cash flows you get are going to determine your rate of return but we don't know the future that's why i have three assumptions here make low middle and high assumptions on your revenue your profit margin your multiples and it'll tell you a range for what the company might be worth it's impossible to sit there and say this is exactly the price of the company and the value it's about a range warren buffett and charlie munger always said that if you would ask them individually what birkshire is worth they're probably going to come up with different answers they'll probably be in some sort of range together but they're going to be different answers valuation and buying stocks is about buying when you sit there and say this is probably a good deal so my 10-year assumptions on paypal i did a low revenue growth of 4% 7% for the middle 10% for the high profit margin i did 12 1/2 14 1/2 162 now free cash flow as you can tell always higher than profit i like that a lot so i did 16 20 and 24% for free cash flow margin now what pe and what price to free cash flow would you assign to this company in 10 years well as it gets bigger as it gets more immersed in our life as the return on invested capital increases you're going to put a higher pe i put 14 17 and 20 and finally my desired return i put 9% this is not the desired return you should put in here this for me is to determine my intrinsic value what's the company worth today then i have to add margin of safety because we don't know what's going to happen in the future and we make mistakes because we're humans so you got to have that margin of safety hit the analyze button boom let's focus on the cash flow here i have a low price of 75 high price of 222 130 in the middle which means at today's current price based on free cash flow i can get about 16% return of my money now again this doesn't mean you go buy it just because this happens this is a great starting off point but to me this says go take a look my low assumptions still show an 8% return go take a further look company number two fortnet this company in the last 5 years is up 444 one year 48% and like we said year-to date 43% this come has killed it another thing i love compounded revenue growth 23% in the last 3 years 23% in the last 5 years 23% in the last 10 years whenever i see a fast growing company i want to check out is it growing organically with itself or they make acquisitions to grow it so let's first go to their cash flow statement and look at their acquisitions guys look at this 8 million 30 million 235 million 40 million 35 million 21 1 million yeah it's money but look at their they're they're not adding that much it's not like i mean this is to me they're probably adding a few million dollars a year in revenue to this so this is probably a company that's growing organically very well and fortnet has physical goods as well as services we're going to check out those revenue differences here but let's go check out some of the other the eight pillars right here guys look at these eight pillars six check marks buying back shares super high return on invested capital revenue growth leading to great cash flow and net income growth lower debt just these two metrics right here price the free cash flow and the 5-year pe now remember these are x's but these alone do not tell the story because at the end of the day if i were to tell you fort nut's going to grow its profit 100% a year for the next 20 years i would absolutely buy it today at these valuations you've got to remember that a pe and a price of free cash flow in and of itself does not determine if something's cheap or expensive what determines that is what's the future of the business how's the balance sheet this is part of looking at a company okay so let's go look at the analyst estimates for the company to see where they have revenue eps growth going $2 to 355 over the next four years that's a lot of growth that's 70% growth in the next four years revenue growing well over double digits for the next 5 years well over double digits a lot of potential there let's go look at some of the things they wrote in their last quarterly report fortnet secures over half a million organizations right now over 755,000 enterprises service providers and government organizations top four of four 73% of fortune 100 and 69% of global 2000 depend on fortnite to stay secure guys that's huge that is huge these are the different areas business services financial services healthcare manufacturing retail look at the top top four of four top eight of 10 top nine of 10 top nine of 10 n of 10 n of 10 top four of four guys that's huge that is belief in this company that's belief in their security that is very very impressive and i look at this and i couple that with some of the metrics on the main page guys look at this return on invested capital this is absurd return on equity absurd we're talking about 80 plus per. what does this mean this means that this company does a great job of getting profit the money that's invested in the business these are companies you want to pay a premium for it means as they add money to the business their profits going to grow a lot that's huge that means there's a moat there and these companies should always have a premium paid for them how much of a premium that's the hard part we don't know exactly so no dividend which i like it means they have other opportunities to invest and great profit 78% gross margin that means every dollar they sell leads to 78 cents to go pay overhead and taxes 20 and 23% profit margin now here's the thing guys they have a lot of physical products but let me show you something about their phys physical products here look at their billings versus revenue and how much is product revenue versus service revenue product revenue has been declining the last few quarters while service revenue is skyrocketing 20 some per every single quarter for in fact look at service revenue year-over-year change since q2 of 2022 25 28 27 30 30 28 25 24 and this last quarter 20% when it comes to year-over-year change for product revenue they were killing it and then boom i don't know what happened here but that's something to find out guys because products are great but if this world and security is becoming more and more digital let's more and more about the cloud this is going to matter less and less so that's the important part to look now one thing i'm not a huge fan of billings versus revenue billings are if they sell a contract for a million bucks and it's going to be earned out over the next five years it's $200,000 per year in revenue but $1 million in billings so billings are going to lead to revenue down the road we're looking here and they had decline and it's even from q2 of 2024 to q2 of 2023 so is there a slowdown happening now this obviously leads us to our stock analyzer tool again a 10e analysis and remember you can do up to 20 years if you have our software look at this growing roic 44 81 97% revenue growth i did 6 10 and 14 for the next 10 years profit margin i did 15 20 and 25 probably too low on the 15 number but i'll keep it right there and look at this free cash flow margin much higher i did 27 32 and 37 now how did they get to 37 less and less product more and more service cuz i assure you the service gross margin is way higher than the product so this will really can help drive up the bottom line free cash flow and profit margin now pe and price of free cash flow i did 15 18 and 21 only because it's a it's a pretty competitive space it's not in and of itself a huge moat if this were the number one company by far we would have no problem thinking about it i would sit there and say go to higher pe in my opinion i'm keeping it a little bit lower but still a premium the market because of this and because of this so i'm looking at the return on invested capital saying they deserve a premium and again our 9% return the stock's currently at 83 hit the analyze button we have a low price of 37 high price of 120 middle price of 67 so guys for me right now i'm looking at this saying i'm not going to spend any more time looking at this i'm just going to sit here and wait for the price to fall now you might sit there and say well paul come on prices don't fall look at this thing it's on a tip yeah i know it's on a tear but it went sideways for a while end of 2022 to now it's pretty much even for a company that's growing still like crazy now we just analyzed these two companies and we're going to analyze two more but this is just a sample of the stocks we analyze in the last month alone inside of our youtube channels we've we have analyzed over 40 stocks and that doesn't even include the exclusive content that's only available to people in our community better yet this is an insane number our community members on their own have analyzed 1,592 stocks using our stock analyzer tool in the last month guys that's incredible that means that our community members are looking at so many different ideas they're not just looking at what we do on the channel they're sitting there trying to find other companies and they range in values market caps probably from 20 million all the way to 200 billion or 2 ion that's what amazing now imagine having the confidence of making these informed financial decision the thrill of increasing your returns and the comfort of knowing that you're on the right track countless others have already joined this community and are experiencing those exact same benefits so if you aren't a member of our community and you've visited everything money.com you've probably seen that we've limited the number of daily spots available for the software in community and that's because our community our software currently provides everything we have to offer for retirement stocks and real estate but this comprehensive package is ending very very soon with our everything money channel expanding and our major behindth scen changes under way we're going to be separating these office offers this means that the unbeatable deal of getting everything

and everybody said hey how do i get that excel sheet how do i get that software and i kept saying guys you can't you got to go spend $500 a month to get the software so what we decided to do was we finally one day said listen enough people are asking for this let's go create it and i had to go spend way more than $500 a month to get the data feed but this was especially important because now it's allowed me to make better software for myself and my team and these are the decisions we use every single day now this is not a real estate channel we have another real estate channel this real estate calculator we just used to buy a $22.5 million apartment building and we're on contract on another $7.5 million apartment building i've also used it to buy a $2.25 million vacation home this is what i use for it there's no hidden software that i use personally this is exactly what i use my stock analyzer tool we use it every single day as time grows on and our community and audience grows the focus is more about serving you better as opposed to us so here's the great news if you join today you'll be grandfathered in for life you'll gain access to all the data and all the tools we've built so far this is the best offer we've made and it's not one you're going to want to pass up so click on the link in the description below go to everything money.com to get access to our software before we make these changes and guys even better it's $7 trial for seven days you get to work it for $1 per day go check it out stock number three another company that i own i've owned for a while and it would have been hard for people to say this company's going to do well 3m it's even over the last 5 years it's up 88% in the last year they settled some lawsuits they handled their business that way they took their hits and moved on 3m makes a ton of different products let me show you guys guys this is 3m's page for their other products these are just the categories of products if you want to see all 10,000 products look at these look at all these categories and numbers here guys these guys make everything they make sticky notes they make everything now the plus side to that is they have a lot of consistent revenue the downside is they make everything it's hard to maintain and watch that and even grow from that one specific product killing it is not going to move the needle much so those are things to consider with 3m this is not going to be a grower in fact if you look at 3m since 1990 over 50% of its returns to investors have come from dividends the stock growth loans is only like 750 or 800 % it's not as much but if you add dividends in there it goes to like 2,200 per. so the dividends are very very very exciting for this company and they recently reen their dividend that 2% here and it eats up a big chunk of their free cash flow last year's free cash flow was 4.3 billion the 5year average is 5.2 and dividends at about 2.9 billion now look at this their net income of a billion dollars last year and 2.9 in the last 5 years is very different than free cash flow why when they have these settlements for the lawsuits they take the net income hit but it hasn't hit their cash flow yet so they take it up front hit on the earnings and they'll pay it out in cash flow in the future okay profit margin last five years is average 9% but again over double almost double the free cash flow so their free cash flow margin is closer to 20% 177% that's a lot of exciting things there but look at this revenue not great on the revenue growth so when you do this company you have to sit there and look at it and say i'm going to get my returns from very small growth of revenue and profit but hopefully they're going to buy back a lot of shares because they're cheap and they're going to sit there and pay a nice dividend because right now the price of free cash flow is 17 after being up 80% in the last year and their five-year price of free cash flow is 14 so remember when you don't get revenue growth when you don't get a bunch of earnings growth you have to get your money some other way buying the stock cheap having them buy back sh shares and also getting that dividend so let's go check out its eight pillars right now o that is gorgeous it's only three checks buying back shares relatively low debt and a low price to free cash flow everything else is absolute poop free cash flow is down revenue is down net income is down significantly i'm not as worried about this one roic is low so guys let's go see how how good the stock is based on what analyst think i mean look at this eps growth from 730 to 1010 still growing their earnings per share and they actually have revenue growth here after falling a big percentage because they did a spin-off by the way that was the other thing they did they did a major spin-off you're looking at low mid single digit revenue growth nothing to write home about but again if you have good margins you have a good balance sheet you can make investors a lot of money by doing that and that's my thesis with 3m so let's go pull up the stock analyzer tool history on 3m okay remember guys on all of these it does not include the balance sheet 10e analysis i did 1 3 and 5% revenue growth profit margin 10 12 1 half 15% free cash flow 12 14 16 pe i did 15 17 and 19 i might go lower on this one i might go to 13 15 and 17 because like i said it's not going to have much growth potential but it's a company that's been around for a long time and still makes a ton of great products so my 9% desired return hit the analyze button all right i got a low price of 81 high price of 170 middle price of 118 now remember these returns down here include the dividends so don't go add the dividends on top of it it includes the dividend here so i think it's something to take a look at and be ready for pullbacks in this company to see if you buy it stock number four door dash incredible company year to date up 53% last one year 2% and guys look at this it's max chart going back to 2020 it's only up 48% so all that return has been year to date that's what's incredible it was down at the start of the year overall as a company but door dash has been growing like crazy let's go look at this income statement by let's just look by year 290 million 85 2.9 4.9 6.6 8.6 in the last 12 months 9.6 billion and of course big jump during covid that was the big jump it was a great time for these delivery businesses i use door dash i use grubhub both of them it's they're incredible services and i'm not going to lie to you my personal opinion is i'm very fortunate to be able to go pay $10 fee to go have $20 of food delivered to me i love that it allows me to sit at home home and enjoy my time just last night i used door dash to order wings and some um buffalo chicken sliders for my wife and i of course i ate most of the food but the point was i was sitting there we watched love is blind we watched a couple episodes of that i just got a chuckle over here on season 7 we've been watching it but allows me instead of going out there and picking up the food and spending 30 to 35 minutes of my time doing that i sit at home with my wife with my dogs we're watching love is blind we're making fun of all these people on there it's way better than sitting in the car for me to do it now let's go see analy estimates guys look at the skyrocketing 11 cents a128 303 and there's a lot of analyst here on the earnings per share analyzing this company for the next three years that's some big money $33 per share the stock's currently at 15 so here's the scary part right now based on two to three years from now is selling for 50 times earnings but again it's growing a lot but i'm not going to lie to you this is not as much growth as i would expected for a company that should be that's selling for an infinite almost um pe right now and 50 times earnings for the ne over the next two years 20% 16 16 8 and 10 it probably still grows substantially the question is whenever you have an expensive company is does the growth does the balance sheet does the company justify a very high pe like that so let's sit here and skip right to stock analyzer have i done door dash in my history i've never done door dash you guys are going to see me pop my cherry here 10year analysis revenue growth okay i'm going to go with 8 16 and 24% over the next 10 years just to tell you guys how much that means 24% for the next 10 years would have their revenue going up 8 six times that would take their revenue to $81 billion 10 years from now is that possible sure it is are there other aspects of the business that i love yes before i fill out the rest of this let me show you these total orders year-over-year this is from their quarterly report 25% 24% 23 21 19 so it's still increasing at a decreasing rate okay marketplace value now this includes all their fees all the all the ordered the total market value of all this 26% growth 24 22 21 20 you see a trend here so i think 24% revenue growth is going to be very difficult for the next 10 years very difficult gross profit margin gross profit up not profit margin grow gross profit overall other thing i don't like is shares outstanding increasing so guys they're diluting the owners of the company so if you buy the stock you're going to be sharing it with you're going to be sharing your revenue and profit with other people at an increasing rate not a fan of that in fact there are many value investors who won't even buy a company that's increasing its shares outstanding am i in that same boat i'm very much against that but i can understand why people do it so let's go sit here and go back to this now the problem we have with profit margin is we haven't had profit margin we've had free cash flow which is great the cash flow has been there that's what i like to see so let's go look at that cash flow over the last few years free cash flow negative negative 93 mil4 55 positive 21 1.35 billion last year and 1.7 over the last 12 months so they're growing their free cash flow and in the last year their free cash flow was 17% of revenue so i'm going to focus my profit margin and free cash flow for long periods of time they should be very similar so i'm going to focus these numbers on the free cash flow number so i'm going to sit here and put 15 20 and 25% now let's see something here real quick their gross margin is 47% so 25% free cash flow might be difficult with a gross margin of 45% that gross margin as i said before means that's the profit on every extra dollar they sell it goes to pay for the overhead and frankly what's their overhead it's probably going to stay pretty set so maybe the 45% 25% is reasonable pe guys i think if you ask people the number one if you surveyed people they're going to say grubhub and door dash and probably door dash is number one so for pe i'm going to go with 13 17 and 21 now you might sit there and say paul why such a wide range well it's still a new business there's a lot of things i don't know here and we haven't seen an roicc yet we haven't seen stable cash flow there's still increasing number of shares outstanding diluting people so i'm going to go low 113 and let's say they crush it and they become the leader by far and away everything gets great i'll put 21 10 years from now and finally as you guys guessed 9% desired return now i want you to be able to do this on your own and it's going to come in two ways it's going to be from watching more videos which is our free content and it's going to be by joining the community don't forget to join the community you'll be able to test these things out like the thousands of people in our community who tested out the other 1,592 stocks they wanted to analyze and after this video video watch our previous video of should i wait for the s&amp;p 500 to crash before buying stocks and here is the value i'm giving to dor dash i have a low price of 71 high price of 550 a middle price of 206 so guys get in the community and start talking about this because this looks pretty interesting based on these numbers thank you very much for your

2024-10-24,6ciiUqaOHOI,"kind: captions language: en the masses would tell you that nvidia is the top stock to buy right now but is that really the case we're going to dive in right now and find out but stick around because after nvidia i'm going to share with you four other stocks that highly touted investors see a lot of value in right now nvidia cannot stop making alltime new highs it just keeps on climbing guys look at this thing up 2800% in the last 5 years up 234 % in the last one year up 198% year to date 200% that's tripling your money in the last 11 months it's really hard to ignore that and the best part about nvidia is it goes beyond just the stock price guys look at these income statements look at this you've got five billion 5 billion 7 9.7 11.7 11 17 billion 27 billion 27 billion 61 billion in the last 12 months 96 billion dollar it just passed $3.5 trillion doll market cap that would make it an expensive 35 to1 on price of sales but as you guys know it looked pretty expensive probably back here as well and it's really grown into that value in all likelihood why because as i say in so many videos it's not just about ratios and you might sit there and go but paul you're a value investor the right value investor the value investing i'm trying to teach is looking at every company is a stream of cash flows every investment is a stream of cash flows the faster those cash flows are growing the more you must pay for the company two companies exactly al with the same revenue and profit today if one's growing 20% a year for 10 years and one's growing 5% you must pay more for this one if you don't you are missing out these are the mistakes i made in the past i looked at a company's current revenue and profit and said this is what it's worth that is absolutely wrong now let's go look at the eight pillars guys everything's a check look at this 5year pe of 219 5year price of free cash flow of 238 you know what i want you to do with these i want you to ignore these these are useless why because the company's making so much more money now than they used to their 5year average free cash flow 15 billion their last 12 months has been $47 billion over three times more than the average of the last five years which includes this past year to sit there and say this company is worth 15 or 18 times free cash so is a ridiculous statement that even i a person who believes in not overpaying would definitely pay a big premium for but before we go first further what assumptions have to play out for nvidia to be a buy today and not only that how likely is that to occur those are the questions that the proper investor asks it's not just what's the potential it's how likely is that potential as an example if i sat there and said there was a 10- set of dice and i said you roll the dice if you pick the number right i'm going to give you $5 for every $1 you you give you would tell me paul that's stupid i would never do that why because if you're paying if you're getting $5 for a one in ch 10 chance of winning you're essentially getting 50 cents every single time you roll so you pay dollar to win 50 cents you're going to lose but what have i said every time you get the number right i'm gonna give you $50 now you're like wait a second if i have a one in 10 chance of getting it right if i win 50 bucks that's 10% of 50 i'm getting $5 for every time i roll versus the $1 you're charging me the exact same odds different payout is a totally different investment that's the same thing with stocks everything in the investments everything you do in the world is about likelihood that's why when you go give the money to your government for 90 days they give you 4.2% because they're like listen you're going to get this money back but here's an example i had somebody the last couple years reach out to me and say paul i got a great land deal i'm going to buy this land i'm going to do this i'm going to sell it i'm going to flip it i'm going to give you a 10% return and i immediately just started laughing i said 10% return you're going to buy the land you're going to control the land you're not putting any money all these listed things i'm like guys i have i'm like the guy knew what i did for a living i'm like you know many apartments i have right he goes yeah i said if i go put that money into my apartment buildings i'll make 15% why in god's name would i give somebody i can't control into a deal that i can't control to make 10% when i can put it into my own asset making 15 that's the world of investing it's about understanding what are your opportunity costs and with nvidia there's a lot of potential here a lot of great potential growth-wise and a great balance sheet look at this debt level this is nothing this is absolutely nothing and guess what it's actually lower than this because this is based on their five-year free cash flow so the first thing i would say to you is how much more growth does the company have let's see what analysts think about it we go to analyst estimates guys they have a127 in earnings per share right now going to 583 that's almost 5x that's like four and a half times so if a company's going to grow their earnings by four and a half times in the next four years five years got to pay attention to that let's look at their revenue growth potential 120% 111% 42% 19% 5% 11% growing from 60 billion last year to 250 billion in the next 5 years 4x that as well so what do we do well guys that's we have to go to a stock analyzer tool and the the big key on this video isn't just about nvidia what i want to show you is after we do the stock analyzer tool some other value investors and what their top picks are for stocks from the value investors club and the reason for that is i want to sit there and offer a perspective of saying the best investors out there don't jump on the most popular items they jump on the most overlooked why because the popular one by the masses are the ones that go high high high and keep going for the masses i was on a crew recently for my honeymoon three people on the cruise i only met like nine or 10 guys three of them kept asking me every day hey what's nvidia at what's nvidia at now they didn't know i have this channel i didn't want to take a dump on their investment but if three people out of eight or nine are asking me every single day what's nvidia at does that seem euphoric yes does that mean it's not going to be a great buy not necessarily is it harder to be a great buy absolutely that's the hard part so when was the last time i did nvidia in our stock analyzer tool i did a thre level analysis for 10 years and guys i did 10 20 and 30% revenue growth in the next 10 years that's a lot could it be greater it could be but at 20% revenue growth for the next 10 years that would make their revenue six times greater in the next 10 years it's currently 96 billion because this goes based on our this goes based on the trailing 12 months so it would take it from1 billion essentially to $600 billion in revenue which is far greater it would require a doubling again from year 5 to 10 based on analyst estimates and if you saw analyst estimates were actually decreasing in their growth rate could they be wrong absolutely i did 30 40 and 50% profit margin i'm going to assume over time that it's not going to stay this high at 55% why because more people enter the markets there'll be a lot more competition margins are likely to contract pe what pe do you sign on this company 10 years from now the hard part is we take bias of seeing the growth recently and the domination recently and apply it to the future nvidia is a great company been around for 35 year 30 some years great company 20 25 and 30 i thought that was high but it could be right i'm adding my 9% desired return in here again no margin of safety just the intrinsic value of 9 or 10% return to match the market you need to add a margin of safety in here i hit the analyze button guys i have a low price of 36 high price of 385 a middle price of 125 keep in mind this price is skyrocket this middle number is skyrocketed over time so it assumes that the growth rate continues to keep growing no per this a permanent plateau of nvidia's revenue which i'm going to assume going forward and they're going to grow from here but it still seems a little rich if i want to add some margin of safety let's say i put in 12 and a half% i'm putting a higher return in hit the analyze button guys a low price of 28 high price of 285 middle price of 93 so what's the right price i don't know i'm probably going to add it to my watch list here at 80 bucks a share because i also believe that if if it starts to fall because the market turns there'll be a lot more downside but keep in mind guys just a year ago i wasn't valuing this company at $8 a share very difficult for me to get around that but they have absolutely outperformed so that's what the masses think the best stocks out there are but let's go to the value investors there's a club out there started by joel greenblat called the value investors club it's so exclusive you have to give them a pitch of a company for then me to let you into the club and they also offer $5,000 prizes for the best pitch now if you're not a member of the club you can still see the postings but the postings are 90 days old it is an incredible area now my personal opinion is people are a little too detailed in that area i haven't looked at people's returns over long periods of time and you guys know me i like to stay very high level and a lot of people do these small small companies to check into remember top investors look at companies in a combination of a ben graham and philip fischer method what that means is give your margin of safety but value growth people always think that value investors don't value growth and growth investing and value investing are different things they are not everything here depends on your perspective and here's how i view the top stocks to buy right now i view them as one of the most overlooked and misunderstood opportunities out there that's where you get value is misunderstanding that's also where you get hype misunderstanding that's the scary part you can have misunderstanding you have to have misunderstanding on both areas in order to have those extremes because when things are flying high like crazy the misunderstanding is this will go on forever this can't miss and they don't look at a stock as buying a piece of a business we went looked at the five of the top 15 stocks talked about in the value investors club let me show you these top 15 right now here are the 15 most frequently posted ideas in the last 2 or50 days the number of posts you guys recognize these lemon intel sketchers dollar general alibaba match group tesla nike apple atore crocs paycom no idea what daco new energy corp is we all know five below and excelis technologies no idea what that is so there's a lot of posted about things on things we understand but the question is are they misunderstood from an investment perspective the one i was most shocked to see tesla and apple thought to myself wow they're posting about this that's interesting and of course guys i love alibaba i own alibaba i own intel i own paycom so for me seeing these was kind of like oh this is kind of nice to see other people are seeing value here but remember i don't go in here and just buy what they have and you shouldn't buy what i have or anybody else in the internet the key that we're trying to do is teach a process of thinking and if you apply that process of thinking in a way that makes makes sense to you to investing you're likely to do better than copying anybody else in the world so one stock is tesla here are the ideas behind tesla tesla stock will be the most valuable company in the world if it solves autonomous driving and if it doesn't this person says it's probably worth 90% less so let's recap that from this from the just a start for me that's an onut i'm out because to have such a high market cap that relies on such a big big but such a small piece of the business being the reason why the company can justify it going higher that makes me scared i look at going you know it's not for me it's not for me at all could it be for you absolutely could it be a small amount of money sure but i look at tesla and i think it's a car company i look at the revenues does it have potential for everything else for the autonomous driving absolutely i've always said that it has this potential but to value it at almost a trillion dollarss off of something that hasn't even occurred hasn't even generated the revenue yet that's a scary thing for me they continue on in 2020 the full self-driving was crap and everything changed beginning in 2022 it was noticed a few months ago when they shifted from a code-based system to a neutral net design which removes human imperfection on performance now what they're sitting there're saying is that was a big issue with self-driving how do they make decisions on what decisions are made while driving versus a human's decision now i have a tesla cyber tru i've got my updated self-driving i haven't used it yet but these are the important questions if to ask to sit there and see will this be taken now remember tesla is a phenomenal company they've doubled their revenue overd doubled their profits since hitting a high of 414 as a stock price but it fell 75% to 100 now it's back up to the 200s their thesis continues on people will choose a second best smartphone think like android versus iphone the battle there but every year 40,000 americans die 2 million people die every year from car crashes worldwide if there's a best inclass full self-driving people are likely to pick it every time and not number two it becomes a win or take all business which i think is a great point to make but again to my point if they're right if fsd doesn't work is this company worth as much as it's worth today probably not and if it does work is it worth 10 times what it's worth today probably not so i look at that saying where's the juice versus a squeeze that's the hardest part for me company number two match group this is the largest player in an ever growing online dating industry trading for single digigit free cash flow multiple down from its high in 2021 of $160 it's $37 today and since that time revenues have grown 16% cash flows are up 93% and earnings are up 134% since 2021 and shares outstanding have been purchased back down almost 10% in the same time that stock has fallen and fundamentals have improved here's what they got 57% of revenue is tinder 15% of revenue is hinge 8% of revenue is asia 20% of revenue is evergreen and emerging apps in terms of total growth 70% of singles in the us are not on an online dating app so there's immense runway for this growth guys think about that i meet people now and when i ask them where' you meet if i hear anything but online i'm like really why and yet 70% of singles in the us are not online dating right now now i don't know what their data is is it eight-year-olds who aren't online whatever it is there's a huge potential there also the bulk of their debt is due between 2076 and 2031 so they don't have much in terms of near-term maturities that's always a concern for a lot of places why you have to make sure that they can refinance those maturities as they come do because this is a cash crunch and they have to refinance that's going to be a problem look at this chart for match group $182 is the high 52 we low is 2766 and it's currently at $ 3780 analysts overd double eps in the next five years four years according to analyst big time growth there and revenue 5 6 7% a year and guys that's all you need for for a great business you don't need to sit there and grow 20% a year to make a good return what you need to do is find a great company that's overlooked and selling at a price it's very good so let's go see what is the stock analyzer tool for us let's see if i even agree with this thing i i did match group back in august 29th of 2022 now guys when i went and pulled up the match group i did in the past i was super conservative i had not yet bought into the whole idea of philip fiser go buy better go buy growth and pay a premium for it i was way too conservative and i was responding to a recent report they had had so i went and redid it 10 years analysis 3 six and 9% revenue growth profit margin i did 10 14 and 18 and free cash flow is always significantly higher here look at that so i did 22 25 and 28 i did a pe of 15 18 and 21 and a 9% desired return again no margin of safety hit the analyze button guys 20 to 44 70 to 110 40 to 70 i don't blame people for looking at this thing at all i look at this saying if you believe this price this looks like a screaming deal you're looking at 50% margin of safety here and that's what's incredible now one thing i don't like even though their debts aren't mature for a while it's still a lot of debt for their free cash flow 770 million free cash flow average they have about 3.5 3.6 billion in debt now their balance sheet overall could still be fine because this doesn't factor in their cash on hand they've got 1.3 billion in cash on hand as well that definitely helps out a lot cash and cash equivalents that definitely helps out a ton so for me i'm going to look at this and probably sell some puts at a lower price but again don't do it just because i do you have to do your own research and i'm not going to buying this at today today's price i'm going to put puts at a much lower price and go do more research because you got to remember online stuff online dating even though match group is awesome it's going to be competitive now over time a clear leader will re will come up to the top and it's probably going to be match group but you got to factor in is it possible it's not is 18% potential return enough for that maybe it is i would say it is stock number three dollar general now dollar general obviously goes after a lower income consumer and there's been a lot of decreases in snap re funds and taxes that directly hurt dollar general customers while the rest of the economy on paper seems to be doing quite well in 2016 6% of dollar general sales came from customers using snap benefits and that remain constant which seems unlikely given the stimulus headed out handed out over covid the 20% decrease in snap in 2023 would result in a 1.5% decline in revenue alone and also labor shortages have kept this sgna cost higher for dollar general since 2017 than its usual historical average another thing world customers make up 70% of dollar general customer base and they're hurt the worst during economically tougher times than the urban consumer who are typically trading down from higher cost stores to take advantage of dollar general cheaper goods now here's an impressive number the company is currently targeting 12,000 more stores to reach a total capacity with 80% built in rural communities and new store economics are still strong with management citing a two-year cash payback period twoyear cash payback and 18 to 20% returns thereafter so this company dollar general has absolutely gone through the ringer let's look at this chart all-time high of 262 back in april of 2022 it's currently at 80 hit a 52 we low of 78 so it's pretty much right there at the low mark for the uh for the year a big big drop almost a 70% drop now come look at couple things i don't like 5ye free cash flow 1.5 billion 5year net income 2.15 significantly different now last year's free cash flow was 1.7 billion versus 1.42 in net income so it's maybe it's flipped tier okay same store sales growth we have to go look up let me go look up the same store sales growth on their 10k that i get from our website directly comparable sales stores now same store sales growth has occurred every single year since 1990 for dollar general in 2023 same store sales only 0.2% so they almost lost that record of 34 year 33 years in a row last year but they got it let's go see what our stock analyzer tool says about dollar general going back to the last time i did it i did 35 and 7% revenue growth one thing to point out roic declining for those who don't know what roic is it's the return on the money that's invested in the business you want a high return invested capital that means they take the cash in the business and they're able to invest it and make more and more money at a higher rate higher rates of of capital returns on capital you need to pay a premium for it shows there's aote and it shows they're very good at handling their money the fact that it's declining even when they're trying to open more and more stores doesn't really match up with that two year cash payback period and the 20% returns when they open a store but either way let's continue on i did 5 and a half six and a quarter and 7% profit margin i did free cash flow four and a quarter 4.75 and 5.25 now i did a pe of 13 15 and 17 i might actually go lower but either way i did 9% return let's h the analy button i really want a big margin of safety here wow okay low price of 100 to 140 high price of 210 to 280 middle price of 150 to 200 so actually 19% return based on the current price that might be enough margin of safety that could very well be enough that's the beauty of using this that's the beauty of using our stock analyzer tool keep in mind guys i repeat this till i'm blue in the face remember the principles that i talk about they have to be repeated over and over i want you to realize that when i sit in my office looking at investment i repeat the same basic principles over and over every investment is the present value while future cash flow is this company going to be around in 10 years is the revenue profit going to be higher can i pay a reasonable price today factoring that future and getting adequate return on my capital i repeat these till i'm blue in the face why because the second i stopped doing that it's like you gotta you're gonna miss that just like swinging a golf club you get golf for two years it's going to be very difficult just today i gave up golf six years ago i played once or twice a year today and and my brother always says i have the best swing that he thinks that he he's seen and today i swung the golf club in our simulator and it was absolute junk i shanked two shots now was the swing still look good yes but i have to tweak some things same thing here for investing you got to repeat these things every investment the present value of all future cash flow and the great part is we got our own little value investors club here in our community these are the people in our community talking about their ideas and we're going to get more of those people into this community use the tools here to sit there and calculate your your returns based on the ideas you're making now i didn't sit here and say anything i'm going to go buy this i said i'm might i'm to sell puts on match group and even that i'm going to do a little more research to make sure i want match group to show that they're owning the market more and more but at the end of the day these are the things that i use on a daily basis we have retirement things i have retirement calculator i'm the number two user of retirement calculator in our community even though i'm not retiring i use real estate calculator every single day we just bought a $22.5 million property and we're in contract with a $7.5 million property and i just ran a $4 million vacation home rental today on using our real estate calculator we use these tools every single day to make better decisions more importantly to sleep better at night because i know that as long as these companies that pay a reasonable price for them as long as i pay a reasonable price for my real estate the future will take care of itself i just need to operate them well in the real state front and i just to make sure these companies stay on the right path and if that ever changes i can make a decision from there i can have the conversation in the community now guys we're making changes to the software we're going to separate all of these out very soon and the reason being is i made this software for me originally started people asking us how do i get that software we made it for me but then sold it

now it's $7 for s days to try it out and afterwards it's it's it's about a dollar day you cannot go wrong so go sign up now now guys final stock is crocs i know you might be laughing my my grandson has the most adorable green crocs boots that he's absolutely obsessed with he refuses to leave the house let's see where is these bright green crocs boots it's absolutely the most adorable thing in the world now some benefits to crocs because guys if you look at this chart right here the alltime high is at 183 it's at 133 which isn't as bad as you'd think and the 52e high was 165 so in the last 52 weeks it was within 10% of its all-time high from 221 from almost three years ago that's pretty impressive but right now a lot of insider buying by the chairman massive buybacks and the earnings improvements versus a cheap price on an absolute basis is what the value investor club seems to think to be an interesting setup so look at this guys this is actually an eight pillar stock here are their share buybacks reasonable debt mid teens on the price of free cash flow and the pe ratio high return on invested capital i like the fact they're diversifying their their products versus just the ugly croc shoes that mo loves the company has been very opportunistic in doing partnerships with other retailers which included a $750 balenciaga stiletto croc and the company also acquired hey dude which closed in february of 2022 which has been massive for the company ever since they paid 2.5 billion for 500 million in sales at the time that's grown from 20 million four years prior that company absolutely crushed it and now crocs owns it in 2021 the company announced a$1 billion buyback which is a lot considering their market cap is only $8 billion and as of today there remains 700 million left to plow back into shares so where's this company going eps according to analysts $13 a share going to $18 here kind of a big drop here i don't know why that is but it's there and revenue growing 4% 5% a year yeah 2% here 15 s but let's call it four or 5% a year not a ton but remember guys the goal is to buy a future stream of cash flow for as cheap as possible whenever i think something i don't want for whatever reason i think to myself would i buy this for a dollar if the answer is no then i know i have to move on because i don't understand it if the answer is well of course i would okay okay i want to determine the right price for it then because there are things i would not buy for a dollar like if somebody told me right now to use warren buffett's analogy buying all the bitcoin in the world for $25 he said no of course i would buy it and immediately sell it but if somebody said to me paul buy all the bitcoin in the world for a million bucks but you can't sell it for 20 years i'd say no because then i look at going if i think bitcoin is going to zero why would i do that with crocs this is probably a company that's going to generate profit for a long period of time even if it lines so let's go see what this company is worth to us before we go any further so even though analysts have it growing my personal bias is going to show up here in my assumptions and that's the reason why you need to have your own because you need to be able to come in here and do this yourself if you understand the retail world more than i do go do this i did 0 three and 6% revenue growth i did profit margins of 17 20 and 23% same with free cash flow for my pe i did 13 16 and 19 even though they had a growing roic i still sat there and said i think it's just something about crocs itself i sit there and say is it too much of a one brand thing i love the fact they own hey dude and it's funny whenever i go anywhere involving a lake i look at people's men's shoes and there's all hey dudes in there so it's a very popular shoe growing like crazy of course i did my 9% desired return hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 133 i got a low price of 130 high price of 340 guys a middle price of 212 which is giving a potential return of 16% do you guys see a pattern forming with value investors club remember guys the value investors club goal is to look at companies that might seem out of favor but see fundamentals improving every investment is the present value of all your future cash flows when you buy a stock you're buying a piece of a business even though they don't give you that cash flow it's still going to be in the company's coffers for you to do i have no idea where stock prices will but i do know if i pay a reasonable price today for a company and it grows my investment's likely to grow with it and obviously the more margin of safety i have the better it'll do so guys the entire goal of an investor is to focus on buying any investment below their intrinsic value that's why i do 9% returns for that intrinsic value the value comes from finding stocks that are priced significantly below what they're worth as you guys saw from our nvidia analysis it take some very optimistic assumptions to make a great buy right now why because the market's paying a lot for potential future cash flow unknowingly probably but remember just like market sentiment on the high side makes things hard to buy on the low side it'll create immense opportunities look at china right now there's probably a lot of potential in china because the fear is so prevalent and so widespread you have investment houses saying i'm not even going to touch china but remember in my opinion the fear in china has existed for a long time and china's getting better i was just on a trip this last week and everybody's saying oh no china is never going to recover i'm like wow never going to recover sounds good but that's why i'm investing in alibaba again don't buy it but as you saw value investor club likes it as well now guys there are lots of lessons in history and i people tease me for talking about microsoft all the time it's because it's the first time i realized the disconnect between people who are supposedly knowledgeable and the markets a tech ceo telling me in 2012 that microsoft was dead because it was selling for nine times earnings even though the revenue and profit went up every single year now a harder example is apple because apple in the early 2000s was almost dead microsoft was not it was growing every single year and remember also that even when microsoft was $52 a share at the market peak in 2000 and got as low as 11 or 12 in 2010 or 11 steve balmer still was able to triple the revenue at microsoft remember the retail investor the people out there are going to overreact on the high side and low side to the market and what's going on there this top stock to buy today is where there's the biggest disconnect between value and price and that happens because of market perception my goal my personal strategy is i'm trying to find a portfolio of diversified stocks that fit this criteria and these include there are 18 companies in there that currently have alibaba sprouts farmers market even though that's probably overpriced right now target get american express probably overpriced right now but for me i'm more important for not overc concentrating a single stock but really that's the real way to get major returns remember you want more investment ideas join this community go click on that link you're going to get a lot more insight and a lot more ideas i go in there and scan there for ideas you're not going to be right on every stock but if you have a diversified portfolio of undervalued stocks that you buy with the same criteria you're going to likely do very well over time as long as you can stomach the ups and downs when i ran back tests 25 27 years of just systematically buying value plays based on a few criteria they always outperform the

2024-10-28,8VPlYa0RWz0,"kind: captions language: en there are four stocks that i really desperately want to buy in the next bare market if and only if it hits the price that i need it to hit stock number one adobe adobe is one of the most incredible businesses out there this company look at some of the metrics that i love $215 billion market cap 223 or $230 billion enterprise value that difference there is eight or 15 billion in debt net debt and guess what they make 6 and a half billion dollars a year in free cash flow they have such little debt high returns on invested capital and getting better let's go look at these eight pillars to see this guys we love this check mark check mark shares outstanding i will get into that cash flow increases revenue growth and cash flow growth in the last 5 years is larger than the net income 1.65 billion versus 1.5 billion now two x's price of free cash flow and pe ratio but the i like these is their five year average free cash flow 6 and a half billion their fiveyear net income five billion so higher free cash flow the net income which we love and don't forget just because these are x's doesn't mean it's expensive this is a fast growing company very high gross margin 89% that's better than microsoft that's better than all the companies that i know of 89% of every extra dollar they bring in goes to the bottom line this means this company canow greatly increase their profit and free cash flow as they grow guys there's a lot of great things about adobe adobe products are in a lot of cases mission critical they integrate extremely well with people's businesses and though the company does not share its turn rate or retention data it has to be good because every single time the company raises its prices management ends up reporting flat to higher user growth this shows that the customer is happy to pay the higher price given the value of the sweed the products now adobe contracts with his customers range from 1 to 36 months on average giving adobe the flexibility to reprice and add features as needed in addition they're leaning into the subscription based model heavily and revenues in that segment have grown from 14.5 billion in 2021 to 18.3 billion by the end of the full year 2023 and that's 30% growth guys photoshop alone is used by over 81,000 different companies in adobe stock not the stock itself their stock of photos have 200 million unique assets in its database and at last count the company had 30 million users of its creative cloud service offering and not only to mention that adobe acrobat reader which we all use was used in a single year to open over 300 billion pdfs which is up from 50 billion in 2016 adobe also has a history of acquisitions dating back to 2005 and it's going to bring other businesses in as it makes sense doing 55 in total since the company's founding which actually isn't a ton and tells me that hopefully they're being more strategic about their acquisitions so what are analysts saying here about adobe let's see what they're saying guys look at this double digit earnings per share growth every year for the next four years from 1850 per share to 30 this is why they deserve a premium multiple this is fast growth for such a big company there's a lot of eps growth what about revenue growth double digits as well i'm actually surprised that with double digigit revenue growth their eps growth isn't way higher because their 88% gross margin adds so much extra cash flow and earnings is that bottom line i'm actually very surprised by that but as you guys know every great company i'm going to mention today and every great company i've ever mentioned there's still a price that might be too high so the question we have to ask ourselves is what's the right price for adobe now we don't know the future all we know is we can make assessments about the future and that's what the job of an investor is every investment is the present value of all the future cash flows that includes cash flow coming in and selling the company at some point so that's why we use our stock analyzer tool the goal for stock analyzer tool is to sit here make assumptions about revenue growth profit margins multiples and our desired return but we're going to make low middle and high assumptions three different assumptions cu guys we don't know the future we want to put in low conservative assumptions aggressive ones on the high end hey they really kill it and ones in the middle that probably is going to end up being where they end up going and it's going to give us our values to determine the right price to pay but keep in mind does not include the balance sheet but we saw before that adobe's balance sheet is real strong so let's look at adobe from this perspective the last time i did adobe was back in may and these are the assumptions i made but keep in mind guys their return on invested capital is increasing this means they get better and better returns on the money invested in the business and this proves mo status this is why this metric is the very top because i wanted to sit there and keep in mind that premium unit pay down here so i did 610 and 14% revenue growth six seems low 14 seems like it's going to be tough but 10 seems about reasonable profit margin they've averaged about 26 to 30% so i did 26 29 and 32 free cash flow i did 3840 and 42 and i love the fact that their free cash flow is always higher than their profit margin because the lame investor out there not you is only going to look at this you're the astute person who says yeah but this is what really matters that free cash flow is what matters that's what's great about you watching this channel now for pe and price of free cash flow guys this is a subjective thing this is why for those us out there who have our software you got to be this is the the tough part have a conversation with the community what what premium does adobe deserve i put 18 21 and 24 if the historical average is 15 that middle 21 seems reasonable it's a 40% premium to the market 40% premium okay and finally guys i did my 9% desired return for those of you who are new to the channel i always put 9 or 10% in here because that's basically to find the intrinsic value what's the value here but remember you need margin of safety you got to put in a higher desired return for your margin of safety but here i just want to show this is what i think the company is worth so i hit the analyze button boom all right low price and free cash flow of 380 high price of 960 middle price of 600 guys and at 480 that's 20% margin of safety if you believe these middle numbers now does this mean go out and buy it no but what it means is go have these conversations go do more research cuz this is definitely worth a look if the current potential return is 12% based on today's price for a company like adobe that might be enough and we don't know where the stock's going to go so the stock price falls for this company or any of the other three companies we talk about it's an opportunity to buy as long as the company is still a great company company number two our good old friend microsoft now microsoft another great company now here's the issue with microsoft $3 trillion doll market cap how do you make outsize returns on a company that's the second largest market cap business that's hard it's it's a very generic statement that has no basis but remember the company is a great company that probably has a lot of runway and a lot of a lot of potential down the road but if that potential is facted in too much here just be patient but this is why i want you to be doing this analysis now so that when things do settle down you're the first person to say i'm ready that's what's awesome now small thing different from um a obe $60 billion 5year average of free cash flow $66 billion net income okay but also great returns on invested capital 23% over the last five years so let's go look at this eight pillars and what story it's telling us a very similar story to adobe but actually a higher pe and a higher price of free cash flow than adobe and i would argue that maybe this maybe adobe has better growth potential but let's see what analysts are saying about this yeah pretty similar actually $12 to 22 do is still a little bit better with double digit growth here on earnings per share revenue growth also double digits becoming almost half a trillion dollars in 2029 now that's great you got to remember that what's the story behind microsoft so monish p who we've interviewed on the channel has said that if he would make a wage on he'll be the biggest beneficiary of ai he thinks it's microsoft in fact we interviewed him few couple years ago three years ago now i don't remember the bottom line is when we interviewed him microsoft was the example i gave as a no-brainer if it was at a certain price and he conceded that now microsoft has a million different use cases for ai but recently it's been using its new ai assistant called co-pilot to improve their own internal operations and the results have been amazing they reported a 12% faster resolution in customer service complaints 10% faster revenue per seller for each of the salesmen 215% faster rates conversion for azure.com 42% faster resolution to faqs in their hr department and hiring process 60% reduction in time to collect cash per transaction and guys that was a huge one because when you're doing hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue that's a big number 5% reduction in legal spending and finally a 30 % increase in their it department getting answers to difficult questions about their code implementation guys they're a coding company they just got a 36% increase in their it department what's the equivalent of that what would it take for that to be able to be done with humans so internally ai is making a huge impact but for the end users they're going to be integrating ai and excel to help suggest an execute formulas commonly used and other small functions within excel that had to be manual before as of late aer is integrating with chat gpt to increase their product offerings as well the use cases for ai are absolutely endless for microsoft and we're in the very early innings of that transformation guys i just look at excel and how much better it is from when i was in college it's incredible finally microsoft is engaged in a con contract with constellation energy to start back up the three mile island nuclear plants in order to meet the high power demands for ai guys bill gates who's not active with microsoft anymore but he's a big proponent of nuclear plants and we absolutely need better cleaner energy and nuclear power has a bad reputation but it's actually one of the safest methods and most powerful methods of getting our power needs handled so again what's the price to pay with that amazing story for microsoft because there's so much good stuff there so the last time i did it was actually in march so guys i did 6 n and 12% revenue growth did 3 2 34 and 36 for profit margin 28 to 34 in free cash flow and guys i actually gave it a bigger premium than adobe 20 to 26 on the pe with 23 in the middle and the reason being is it's a much bigger staple of our of our lives in adobe is yes we need adobe guys google drive is very convenient for a lot of people i use one drive with microsoft it is 10x better in my opinion yes i pay for it versus google drive being free i don't care it's well worth it to me so we hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 424 all right so we got to be a little bit more patient low price of 210 to 240 high price of 500 to 525 middle price of 325 to 350 so we got some patience and again i have it on my watch list at 325 not to buy it then but the software will notify me and that way i can do more research or sell puts at lower prices and re-evaluate the company now as you see we just analyzed two stocks that i really want to buy and we're going to analyze two more in a minutes this is just a sample the stocks we've analyzed in the last month on our youtube channels we've analyzed a little bit over 40 stocks and that doesn't include any of the exclusive content we make within our community up here better yet our community members have analyzed 1,592 stocks using the stock analyzer tool in the last month guys there are tens of thousands of stocks out there 10,000 that are reasonable for people to buy are users in the last month have looked at 16% of them that's incredible imagine that confidence of making informed financial decisions and the thrill of increasing your returns and putting numbers to your investments to say what do i expect to make from this this comfort of knowing you're on the right track is exactly why i made the software for myself originally that was requested by by people out on youtube countless others have already joined our community and are experiencing these massive benefits if you're not a member of our community but you visited everything money.com you've seen that we are limiting the number of daily spots for our community and software and that's because the software currently provides everything that we have to offer for stocks retirement and even real estate in fact somebody in the live stream yesterday just said they got 30% more money analyzing their piece of real estate in real estate calculator for when versus what the real estate agent wanted them to list the property at they sat there and said yeah but this thing is worth way more they made 30% more guys how much was that $180,000 this person invested in themselves and they got $180,000 extra can i ask you a question how much you think they're going to spend in our software and community for the rest of their lives nowhere close to $180,000 and with our everything money channel expanding and major behind the scenes changes underway we're going to se separating all these offers this means that this deal right now that we're giving including everything here will have to go away soon and for those youve been with us from the start as i said before we created the software for my use but as we saw people requesting it we decided to make it for everybody else and right now our team can't imagine working without it i use i use three of these basically every single day stock analyzer real estate calculator and retirement calculator pretty much every single day so here's the great news you join right right now you'll be grandfathered in for life you'll get all the tools all the data everything forever you won't have to worry about getting separated out and you're going to stay in your pricing tier forever this is the best offer we've made and it's not one that you're going want to pass up so click on the link in the description below and get our your spot before our day spots run out stock number three the good old googly mly google love this company company alphabet $2 trillion dollar market cap $2 trillion doll enterprise value essentially no debt big difference between their net income and free cash flow like microsoft lower free cash flow than net income but a lower price to free cash flow of 33 and a five and a one-year pe of 23 and i love this adorable dividend of 0.12% eating up $2 and a half billion dollars of their free cash flow google why the are you paying a 0.12% dividend that doesn't make sense to me but people like it i guess i don't understand it so let's look at the eight pillars look familiar guys adobe microsoft good old google all check marks big jumps in cash flow and net income but the net income jump was a lot higher 56 billion versus 28 29 30 billion and then the fiveyear price of free cash flow of 35 5year pe of 33 so again feels expensive what are analysts saying about it double digit eps growth you guys seeing a pattern here great companies great growth potential great everything we just have to wait for the right price and it doby actually might be at the right price already that's the interesting part here um revenue estimates declining but 13 down to 8% 9% all right so guys one of the things that's great about youtube about google is they own the top two search engines in the world google and youtube the fall of tv programming and a shi to streaming is a huge tailwind for google a lot of my friends have youtube tv so as a type of entertainment we enjoy changes and companies look to meet a younger audience where they're at digital advertising on platforms like google and youtube are only going to increase as companies look to find new ways to connect with a consumer that's no longer flooded with tv ads with their sunday morning cartoons statistically youtube is the largest beneficiary of this move to digital spending why they have the ads they have the google network and we're in the very early innings of this transition in addition to this large tailwind of new digital ad spending it's never been cheaper for a company to create a targeted ad than it is today and it'll only get better in the future in fact you know thing i love about google and youtube they reward you for being a great advertiser what that means is i talk about this all the time when you go to google and type something in the first three or four lines it'll say add because they know 85% of clicks come in the first three links but guess what that first link could actually pay less than the third link why because if this is highly relevant that first link if people stay there they find their use there google rewards the seller by saying thank you for making the life of our user better we're going to charge you less and there's a whole calculation about how they do it in addition ai has made it so simple to create targeted ads and these companies can do it cheap and get an enormous audience to view these ads which is almost a certain way to pull a response from your target audience since you have the data on what they search what they buy and they what what they might be likely to buy in the future youtube rewards everybody on their platform by saying if you make content that people stick around to watch we will reward you that is what's great this is a consumer first user first experience that leads to a better company for google because they're able to make more money in the long run they get exploited by charging a ton of money today but they don't they sit there and say what's good for the user will reward people for making it good for the user so what's the right price to pay for google let's pull up the googly moogly in our stock analyzer tool all right revenue growth on a 10-year number i said four 7 and a half and 11 and again increasing roic profit margin i did 22 24 and 26 i could argue it' go better because they have a good gross margin and and as they grow these ads i think it'll probably get better pe in price of free cash flow a low side of 20 high side of 26 23 in the middle all right 9% desired no margin of safety return analyze button boom wowza look at this 113 on the low side 280 in the high side 180 in the middle this 10% return all these returns include the dividend but guys we don't know where the stock is going to go but if you're interested in making a 10% return and you agree with these assumptions and you're comfortable with it go into the community have a conversation and see if it's the right buy for you now stock number four might shock some people nvidia guys nvidia is an incredible company there is no doubt about that i've been saying that from the early in the late 90s when i was a computer nerd building computers nvidia was the go-to graphics processor they're incredible but of course you have to sit there and analyze is the company worth it now the thing about i love about nvidia but it's also worries me about nvidia look at these financials look at this revenue growth going back 10 years 4.7 5 6.9 9.7 11.7 11 16.7 27 27 61 and the last 12 months $96 billion guys let me tell you a little story back in 2020 we went through covid afterwards when the world opened back up again we were importers of goods from china and asia other parts of asia we used to import a container shipping cost was about $4,200 it jumped to $25,000 and people were asking us in the channel look at these shipping industries and we said guys is this just a temporary blip in the revenue and it was i don't know if this is or not this is part of the analysis you have to do on nvidia is this temporary or is this permanent because there's a lot of great stuff behind nvidia there's a thing called moors law what that says is driven by the transistor count on semiconductors every 18 to two every 18 months two years basically you should double the speed of our conductors of our of our chips you want to hear something crazy nvidia's is every 3.4 months so mo's law of 18 months to two years nvidia does it every three and a half months that's incredible nvidia's biggest turning point on this was in 2012 when a grad student won a contest at the university of toronto with a model trained on the nvidia like gtx 580 or whatever it was after 2012 their gpus were doubling every three and a half months rather than those three rather than those two years from a grad student at the university of toronto nvidia has gained 4.3% market share per year every single year for the last six years not to mention large tech company spending on this kind of tex was less than 10% of total spend which should ramp up significantly nvidia chips are also powering a fleet of jaguar land rovers to come out in 2025 love land rover as well as a fleet of mercedes which should propel the automotive infotainment and safety growth guys what this means is this company's incredible and they're going to continue to be incredible me questioning this should not take away from the fact that company is amazing but when you see a three trillion doll company growing like this you've got to ask is this a permanent plateau if it's a permanent plateau this company's worth a lot more than if it's not a permanent plateau and that's all i'm bringing up here remember they could see a decrease in revenue here and still be an unbelievable business they have a great balance sheet look at these eight pillars right here look at these eight pillars balance sheet here's the crazy part this balance sheet is based on long-term debt divided by the five-year free cash flow their five-year free cash flow average is 15 billion their last 12 months has been 47 billion so really if you base it on the last four last uh 12 months it should be about. 25 to3 guys this company's not going away anytime soon and rightly so it's an incredible incredible business no denying that let's see the analyst estimates here now analyst estimates look at this a127 growing to 583 i want to hear what's causing this so according to them this is a permanent plateau they're only going to start making even more money revenue growth look at this revenue growth 120% 111 42 18 42 11 going to $250 billion in revenue in 2029 remember in 2019 they did 11.7 billion that's 25x in 10 years that's absurd but remember you can't extrapolate that out forever if you did then then nvidia would be bigger than usa the world economy at some point that's not possible so of course it's not to be debbie downer but to ask the question of what's the right price to pay for nvidia based on this amazing company and its growth potential now you're probably going to disagree with me on some of these assumptions i love it please disagree with me come in the community share this if you're on twitter share with me your assumptions about nvidia because i really want to hear it i did 10 20 and 30% revenue growth i did profit margin of 30 40 and 50% free cash flow margin of the exact same amount pe i did 20 25 and 30 i did a 12 and a half% return just to show with margin of safety let's go back to 9% return hit the analyze button guys it's actually not far off from its middle number low price of 36 high price of 385 middle price of 125 guys i have it on my watch list at 80 bucks because i look at it going hey i don't know if it's a permanent plateau or not but if it falls back maybe this maybe this 125 price will be 80 so i can do more research on it so guys if you want to see the 18 companies that i do own watch this next video thank you for your

2024-10-29,GfzyDA9oH3A,"kind: captions language: en guys these are three stocks that are reporting earnings this week let's analyze them to see if they potential stocks to buy even before the earnings get released first stock paypal now as you know i own paypal and that's no reason to ever buy a stock never buy because somebody internet owns it or even warren buffett owns it we're trying to teach a process here that you can imply to your own investing now paypal reports today and analysts are expecting a17 earnings per share and 7.88 billion in revenue now the interesting part about paypal or as i call it pay pizzle is that it's a company that a lot of people have said is dying but why is that well this is the stock price and as i say a billion times a day news follows the stock price what this means is where the stock price goes the news will be reported to justify that movement as it was going up paypal is amazing as it's going down paypal sucks interestingly enough i hear all the time payp hell is dying like i said they're supposed to report 7.88 billion in revenue for the quarter let's see how that would compare to other the the previous quarter they did 7.42 billion in the same quarter last year is it massive growth not at all but guess what is this a dying company doesn't look like it to me look quarter to quarter here comparing past quarters 6.85 7.42 7.38 8 .03 7.04 7.7 7.29 7.89 i don't know if you guys are aware or not but dying usually means it's getting smaller now are there issues with paypal yes one of the benefits they have is they have venmo and the number of active accounts has decreased but they're already seeing a slowdown in that but the transactions per account has increased the transaction dollars per account have increased so you're looking at this saying again what is the emphasis here is the emphasis here that we just don't like where the stock has gone remember there's a lot of reasons to not buy any stock but whenever i see a stock go from an all-time high of 310 to a 52- we low about a year ago of $50 per share it's got to at least pique your interest why because to lose 85% of its value or more in a matter of in a matter of two years at that point that's pretty interesting to me now let's look at the story that the eight pillars are telling so if you look right here there's one x right here and that's the 5-year pe but interestingly enough the 5-year price to free cash flow is actually way better this means that their free cash flow is reported higher than their net income and we'll see that right here on the data right below their 5year average free cash flow is 4.84 billion while reporting net income fiveyear net income of $3.6 billion i love it when a company reports a higher free cash flow than net income because it's easier to manipulate this net income number than the free cash flow number another nice little metric here gross margin of 45% that's pretty healthy so what this means is every extra dollar they bring in revenue 45 cents of that is going to go to pay the overhead taxes and go to that bottom line with a bottom line margin pretty consistent around 14% but again this is based on net income not on free cash flow so their free cash flow is actually significantly higher than this profit margin which i absolutely love okay 5year roic nothing to write home about buying back shares i like the fact they're buying back shares as a stock has fallen that's really really important we don't want to just blindly buy back shares now look at this revenue growth 11.8 billion led to 2.4 billion in free cash flow growth and 1.86 billion in net income growth so again more free cash flow than net income this is stuff we absolutely love and if they can keep doing that remember cash flow is the lifeblood of the business here this is the kind of stuff we want to focus on now guys remember it's not just about the numbers it's about the story and then how we put the story and the numbers together paypal has been known for a really long time it was founded by the guys that were elon musk peter theal and those guys and it was part of ebay for a long time and then split off recently they've had new management change and of course whenever there's new management change there's going to be a lot more excitement about the future prospects but i think this one's actually warranted so previous to this new management tak taking over a lot of people would believe that the company was mismanaged because of a lack of focus now this new management is purely focus on profitable growth branding their checkout via paypal and focusing on building out venmo and making it bigger the last team was really focused on making this some sort of super app similar to wechat in china this new company this new management team is focusing on trying to make what's called fast lane which basically integrates out like brain tree and customers can simply enter their email address all their information is going to be populated and ready to check out now here's another interesting part i mentioned before about the company having this perception that it's a dying business but here's something interesting outside of amazon it has the fastest us ecommerce growth for any company outside of amazon paypal has over 35 million merchants integrated to use their checkout and it's a payment option for over 80% of all us e-commerce merchants now remember story numbers putting them together so we saw the numbers pretty good the story sounds pretty good but of course we have this perception of story but at the end of the day every investment is the present value of all future cash flow so in order to make determine what kind of return we're going to make we've got to estimate what those future cash flows are and it'll bring it back today this is exactly why we use our stock analyzer tool but before we get there let's see what analysts think about the earnings per share growth for paypal 450 per share this year going to 691 here in the next 3 or four years so pretty decent growth it's a little over the board all across the board here but look at this dying business revenue growth here dying business 7.8% 7.8 7 and a half 8 10% revenue growth so much for dying i guess now again anything can happen here but this doesn't look like a dying business to me i'm hoping it's a misunderstood business and a business that people are in on because the stock prices fall so what is the right price to pay for paypal let's go pull up the last time i did it in our stock analyzer tool just back in june oh look i got points again for using my software years of analysis guys started with a 10year analysis like i usually do now remember i love the reputation that value investors have they don't care about growth the very first line revenue growth and remember i'm going to put low middle and high assumptions here because when you're we don't know the future we have no idea what's going to happen so we have to make conservative and more aggressive assumptions and somewhere in the middle and i'm doing it for all of these metrics down the way and this is why guys if you have the software it's really important to be able to do this to understand where you guys are in the company so what were my assumptions this company i did 47 and 10% revenue growth okay i did 12 1/2 14/2 and 16 1/2 on profit margin but remember the free cash flow margin was bigger so i'm really going to focus on free cash flow here i did 16 20 and 24% and then for my pe now guys i actually went a little lower on the low side of 14 because this area is getting a little more competitive so i want to be a little more conservative here and i did high side of 20 and middle of 17 and guys if you're new to our channel i did a 9% return the historical compounded going back to 1871 return on the market with dividends is about 9% okay the average is about 10% so if you put or 10% in here it gives you the intrinsic value for the business what's the business if it were selling for a normal price in the market but remember if you're buying individual stocks it's important that you put a higher return here than the market return because then why not just buy the market buy a lowc cost etf so if you want an individual company you got to put a higher amount in here but i'm showing you guys what my intrinsic value is i hit the analyze button boom i've got a low price of 60 to 75 high price of 150 to 220 and guys middle price of 96 to 130 and here's what's interesting even though the stock is up from a low of 50 bucks that's 66% growth from the low you still have some if this if my middle assumptions are true and this actually works out you have about a 15% return potential on your investment so there's still room there for a company that's up 60% from its low in the last year stock number two sprouts farmers market they report on wednesday analysts are expecting 76 cents earning earnings per share and revenue of 1.87 billion guys this another company i own this is a company that i'm uh little aggravated about i bought in the low mid-30s and now it's at $120 per share rather quickly look at this very quick rise in the stock now remember just because a stock goes like this doesn't mean you should buy it you need to sit there and analyze it say is there still room and guys if you're if you're if you're the kind of person who got lucky and bought this company very very low priced and it grows in value you have to sit there and don't be afraid to pay a higher price for it if it's warranted that's extremely important in investing if the fundamentals have gotten better and you bought at a great value before like we just did in paypal the if you bought it a year ago you're up 60% of your investment don't get attached to that purchase price it's all about that's already done what's important is where is the stock going this company is growing like crazy they have 400 plus stores their goal is to get to 12 to 1300 so they still have 3x growth there they are they got a new ceo in the last couple years that came from dollar tree or dollar general and did a really good job of focusing on per square foot revenue profit margin of 4% in the last 5 years last year 4 and a half% and that's really high go look at kroger and all those other companies those are one or two% profit margin businesses so here's the eight pillars on sprouts farmers market high 5year pe high fiveyear price of free cash flow you know what i love they're pretty much exactly the same which means their fiveyear average free cash flow 268 million versus 263 on net income so very very similar now their free cash flow last year wasn't so solid but they're opening more stores and it takes time for those stores with the money invested to get into a profitable profitable kind of revenue stream what's interesting to me about sprouts though look at this $12 billion market cap and the enterprise value of 14 billion that's not much difference for a retail business usually i'd see a much bigger difference there now when it comes to retail sprouts has avoided many of the major pitfalls that have crushed from an operational standpoint other competitors their goal is to do about 10% annual store growth per year and the most important part for them is building out distribution because remember the more distribution they have the better they'll have products coming in staying good for longer and being able to make more money on that and their goal is to have a distribution center within 250 mi or less from all their stores this also helps them because now it allows them to drop the number of miles on the road for their trucks by 4% while still opening 30 new stores now this might not sound like a big deal but their average store used to be 30,000 ft now it's 27,000 ft 10% less square footage 10% less rent more efficient and of course sprouts realizes that even though their customer has a higher more than 74% of their customers shop and store they still realize after co that they have to be very aware of the e-commerce growth so they have partnered with door das in the other places that can allow people to shop online and most importantly for me on the sprouts brand they know their customers so well they have their own sprouts branded products which has a much higher profit margin than any of other products to sell and that could really drive up the overall profit margin and gross margin for the store look at this gross margin 37% and it's going up and up and up as the percentage sales of their sprouts brand keeps increasing as that goes higher and higher this could become 45% or more if that becomes 45% where does this go so you have a couple things working to the tail for this company you've got an increas in gross margin which will drive profit margin and they they can still 3x the number of stores they have we always talk about these multi-baggers they need to have a long runway with a lot of good reinvestment opportunities that's combined right here but remember before you go out there and go in your account and say let me buy this remember you have to analyze it yourself and understand it and second you have to make sure you're paying a reasonable price for the company and we will get into that shortly the stock analyzer tool let's get into what the analysts think about all this growth potential here's what's interesting and this is what baffles baffles me 340 per share to 347 per share in the next four years for eps doesn't sound like a company that's growing its stores 10% a year and growing and it has profit margins and gross margins increasing i don't know about this i'm very confused by all this not going to lie to you now you know i go look at the analyst estimates for some sort of guidance but i look at this saying where is this coming from is it coming from a lack of analysts probably i have no idea why but this ain't the best here for re for eps growth but then interestingly enough look at this look at this revenue growth 9% 9 and a half 9.9 5 and a half 5.3 so i look at this thinking okay so they have great revenue growth they have increasing margins but that eps growth was non existent but of course analysts have their own bias and they have their own pressures from other people and i'm not sitting there saying that you should only take good analyst estimates i like going to analyst estimates to see where are things falling here this is a great place to sit there and start asking questions and if you're in our community start talking about things but let's go look at the stock analyzer tool because of course if we're right and the analysts are wrong what's this company worth so i did 6 8 and 10% revenue growth because remember you're going to get 3 or 4% revenue growth naturally because of cost increasing and if you're increasing your stores by 10% a year this is pretty conservative but i put the 68 and 10% remember our profit margin increasing last 10e average 3.7 5 years 4.07 1 year 4 and a half% it is increasing as time goes on now free cash flow is a different story but remember as they open 20 or 30 stores that's eating up$ 7 to100 million of their free cash flow every year just to open those stores so that free cash flow number i'm not as concerned about here even though they've done a pretty good job in the last 10 and five years keeping it very close to profit margin and of course rp here's the issue it's about looking 10 years from now and i look at it saying okay in this business their roic will probably be higher and higher and they have a higher and higher margin than other companies in their industry does that deserve for premium i think so i put 16 19 and 22 for both these multiples and our 9% annual desired return hit the analyze button so guys remember low price of 56 high price of 120 middle price of 83 so remember what was a great buy at 32 a great investor knows that if you pay the wrong price you're overpaying so for me even though i'm very happy with my position and old paul would have probably sold this saying it's too overpriced let me take some profit new paul says you know what great company growing their revenue growing their profit i'm just going to keep writing it out where's the stock going to go i have no idea but my goal is to own great companies at what i perceive to be great prices and i think my basis is very good and they can grow into this value very easily as long as i just let them keep operating the business and as long as my thesis stays the same i'm a happy guy now obviously i talk about having discussions about this company this has been a very popular company in our community we've talked about and if you've been to our website you've probably seen that we are absolutely limiting the number of daily spots to our community and software and for the reason for that is we're solely interested in having like minded investors who can help each other out with the data the analysis and most importantly the emotional part of investing you look at a company like sprouts and we have people in our community who bought sprouts 30 bucks or even cheaper well then the emotional reaction comes do i sell it now remember emotion isn't just about the downside the em motion isn't just about oh my god the stock is falling it's also about the upside remember you you got to let your winners run and the emotional part of sitting there and staying with a stock as it goes up is very important successful investing and a successful life is about surrounding yourself with people who are where you want to be and our community has thousands of members who are exactly that as a community has grown it's become less about me and more about you and how i can make this life easier and more profitable for you and my team and i use every aspect of the software on a daily basis whether it's running our retirement calculator doing our stock analyzer for figure out our stock investments or more importantly the real estate calculator real estate calculator i always give this example we recently bought a $22.5 million property using it we're in contract on a $7.5 million property and i used it recently to buy $4 million worth of lake houses for myself for investment this is how you use these things and guys there was a member of our community who on a live stream recently said he used real estate calculator to make an extra what was it $180 or $300,000 i don't remember the exact number but i'll show it to you right now on a real estate deal because he realized the value of it versus what his real estate agent said it was worth if you're new to everything money you might not know this but i used to work on an excel sheet and the most common question i got i had this excel sheet for my stock analyzer tool was how do i get that software and at the time it wasn't possible because it was expensive data but it a phenomenal idea why not just create this for those who are asking for it so here we are and the great news is we are working behind the scenes

number three is the company that has owned my brain for a long time amazon they report on thursday andal expecting a113 earnings per share and $17.3 billion in revenue for the quarter but here's what's interesting about amazon look at where the stocks been and this company has crushed it this is going back to 2020 and this company has absolutely crushed it since 2020 so this is a good learning experience for people who are new to the channel back in august of 2020 it hit a high of 175 we're currently at 190 2020 did 386 billion this last 12 months they did 605 billion that difference there is 218 billion on 386 so what is that 65 to 70% more revenue we have 65 or 70% more revenue than in 2020 yet the stock is pretty much flat why is that why is that guys we don't know what's going to happen with stocks in the short run but you have to look at this and you have to ask that question because we talk about this all the time don't look at stock price for are you right or wrong what we want you to do is look at what you paid for the company and are the fundamentals getting better let's look at the eight pillars here not as sexy as people would believe for for a company like amazon revenue growth check incet in growth check free cash flow growth check something i don't like about this is the free cash flow is lower than the net income growth however let's go break down their free cash flow and see why that is guys look at their capital expenditures let's go back to 18 13 billion 17 billion 40 61 64 53 and in the last 12 months 60 billion they have started pumping money into these distrib distribution centers the trucks airplanes everything they're doing to make life easier for you jeff bezos has a great interview where people people he always says people always asking me what's going to change in the next 10 years my goal is to focus on what's not going to change in the next 10 years people are always going to want faster and they're always going to want cheaper and that's amazon's goal they're going to be a lower margin business but the point is they're willing to go out there and make investments in other things 20 years ago maybe 18 years ago they made a big investment in aws that is now a big driver of profit it's their cloud computing now a little bit more story 2022 89% of us buyers said they'd rather buy a product in amazon than anywhere else guys they have 300 million active users 197 million of them are monthly active users guys i'm an hourly active user on amazon the other day i needed to buy deodorant i just go on amazon i buy it and i think people made fun of me like why do you buy deodor i'm like because it beats going to the store i don't want to go to the store i'd rather do that and they have 200 million amazon prime members guys that alone is how many billions of dollars a year in revenue tens of billions and it's growing which isn't even surprising considering the average prime user spends $1,400 per year shopping on amazon platforms since inception amazon stock has been one of the best performing stocks of all time but remember from 2000 peak to the low of the market they dropped 96% from $113 a share to about $6 per share but in that time jeff bezos said he looked at the fundamentals he goes but all our fundamentals are getting better that's probably when he realized that you have to worry about the fundamentals and the market is going to do what it's going to do since the company's ipoed even with that 96% drop it's returned 31.78219 151 which is a cumulative return over 26 years of 155% amazon is literally the ultimate disruptive company anytime they enter a new market they take huge amounts of market share and crutch competitors for example when amazon bought whole foods that day the market cap of all major us retailers fell by over $10 billion in one day and because of the large number of users visiting the website amazon is an extremely powerful advertising business that will continue to scale that's something that people don't realize yet they have rights to thursday night football and they understand that life sports is a great place for prime time ad placement and folks will pay top dollar so what's amazon worth today that's a wonderful story but again we have to remember story numbers we got to put them together so let's go see what analysts are saying about amazon guys this is a multi-trillion dollar company and look at this eps growth 482 to 1055 76% 23% 26% 20% 17 and a half% not going to lie to you guys i would have never thought that was possible for a company that did $600 billion a year in revenue let's look at the revenue growth still double digits 11 11 11 11 10 and a half huge revenue growth doing almost a trillion dollars in revenue in 2028 on average by the uh by analysts big big growth internationally locally everything they have so much growth potential so what is the right price to pay for amazon this is why it's hard on amazon it's hard to value amazon because what is the profit margin for amazon they've shown look at this profit margin 10 years ago last 10 years 4% profit margin 3.3% free cash flow last 5 years 2.3% free cash flow 4.7% profit margin now 7 and 8% is it going to get better i would imagine it would but their gross margin is not very good their gross margin currently is 18.2% but guess what a lot better than it was before so that's the hard part about companies even a large company like this that reinvest in itself so much they're putting money into this machine to make it bigger and bigger and bigger but where is the profit going to end up we don't know my guess is a lot higher than it is today so the question is when you're doing your low middle and high what assumptions do you made well i did 47 and 10% revenue growth i did 7 12 and 177% profit margin on free cash flow and keep in mind this low side was just achieved this year for the first time that's how much upside i'm giving to amazon here 712 and 17 pe guys if it's the everything company 2023 and 26 absolutely give it to them absolutely and finally a 9% return hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 190 a low price of 78 high price of 363 middle price of 185 guys i don't know what the right price for it is but i'm going to have it on my watch list to look at it at 150 but guess what it it's going to go higher from there so guys if you want to see the stocks to buy before the end of the year watch our next video thank you very much for your

2024-10-30,efOUIj9T-8Y,"kind: captions language: en tesla stock has skyrocket 150% in the past 5 years and the question that should be on your mind is did i miss out did you miss out is it too late to buy tesla well it depends if you bought tesla at an all-time high on november 4 2021 at $415 per share and held you're still down in your investment even though the fundamentals have significantly improved since then not just marginally significantly you also would have had the stomach fall from 414 all the way down to 101 that's over a 75% drop now to get into this i want to show you guys 4:14 november of 2021 guys in 2021 for the full year they did 53.8 billion in the last 12 months they've done 97 billion damn i thought they would be 25 billion exactly falling in a half oh more than falling in half i me you sit there and look at this think guys there's something i really want to shape the way in which we think if new to the channel your goal is not to look at the stock price determine if you're right or wrong i talk about the examples of ccl and walgreens i made money on them and i realized i was wrong and i sold them you're not to determine you you're right or wrong on the stock price in the short run what we're trying to teach here is look at the fundamentals buy at a good price sit in your hands and wait and let the company do what they do if you overpay for something doesn't matter how great the company gets you you might still lose money look at intel and cisco from 2000 to now now you might sit there and go intel they're such a loser company yeah but they weren't in 2000 intel was the tesla of 2000 cis exactly cisco they wrote an article and said cisco will be the first trillion dollar company let's go look at them right now because it's a really important learning lesson look at cisco now look at this alltime chart guys it's never hit its all-time high from back here never hit it since then and guess what revenue and profit they did revenue last year of 53.8 billion and profit of 10.3 let's see what they did back in 2000 in 2000 they did 19 billion in revenue and profit of 2.67 they have four times more profit they did back in 2000 they have three times more revenue and guys intel is the same way and there other companies are like that and my guess is that there be a lot of companies like that from here looking out 20 years from now and you might find that hard to believe but if you overpay for a good thing you can still lose money or not do as well yeah think about the companies during co your pelons how the story was perfect everybody was buying the product it was an abs it could not fail look where they are now you've got to merge the story with the numbers not only pelaton mo tattooed chef all those electric car workhorse all those other car companies that everybody was jumping on the tesla train think about the companies that are still around lucid rivon they're just decimated from what they were supposed to be and they're still around and they're still around that's the thing that's the like tattoo chef we can't look at anymore yeah but lucid and and rivon we can look at and say damn it's tough yeah but remember that's what makes investing hard if have to sit there and not follow the stock price in fact we wanted you to look at tesla 101 saying wait a second this is a great company that's down 75% there's no doubt in my mind that tesla is a great company they've changed the world 100% they're in a tough industry though now tesla also is incredible because their cars are regenerative what that means versus other vehicles is the only thing that might actually have to be replaced according to them is their wheels the braking the battery everything are designed to regenerate on their own so they don't need replacement and we don't even follow that in terms of looking at the cost of ownership of tesla now one part of electric vehicle adoption is that people always get worried about the battery most you guys have a tesla i have a cyber truck which is currently going to be guys i'm not going to lie i think the cyber truck is cool as hell it's awesome it's not for me so i'm thinking about getting rid of it but musk has come out and said that an ev battery they have should be able to last almost 500,000 miles before needing to be changed out but though he believes there'll be a time and i agree with this where an ev battery can do a million miles before it needs to be maintained in any serious way so mo what's your experience with that so the way way that elon explained this once in an interview the battery is call it this big yeah you're using 10% of the battery so theoretically you could probably have a 4,000 mile charge is that true yeah but they only open 10% of the battery so one 10% degrades they go to the next 10% they go that's how you get and it's 100,000 miles per 10% so that's how you get to the million miles where'd you read that at elon said that in an interview on youtube long time ago because people somebody asked him about the battery and he was like how are you getting to million miles and he goes this is it's pretty simple no we haven't even talked about robotaxi yeah or the robot the oh yeah by the way it was so i i can't wait to get one of those robots and lisa is freaked out so excited what's nicole think about that she's like oh i'm all for it oh lisa's like totally freaked out by it she's like there's no way i'm like i'm gonna tell you right now lisa there will be a robot in this house the second we can get one and rely on it to do our tasks definitely tesla management thinks that they can run a a tesla robot taxi for 18 cents per mile jeez while the typical uber lift cost2 to3 per mile today guys that's over for a 90% reduction in costs musk and tesla management thinks that the robot taxi will do 65 cents per mile in gross profit and assuming 50% empty miles and an annual mileage of 990,000 when you all work it out that each robo taxi will generate $30,000 in gross profit and you couple that with the 1 million mile batteries you have a massive profit potential for that company and that's a big reason why tesla is getting a massive premium to the normal car company now now i've always said to people and in many videos tesla's a car company today you can't deny that there is a story and there's a path to much much more in this company but all i'm encouraging people to do is don't value it today for the most optimistic things of the future tesla's goal is to give the average person a great car they can afford which is also different mo if you look back at our past videos when people were talking about tes i said guys they can't sell 15 million cars a year at $100,000 a car right you've got to be going into the masses and we've seen that lately with the new models coming out yeah the model 3s the model y's yeah by the way did you notice the way they nam their cars s 3 x and y yeah i didn't know this until recently probably three months ago least they told me about this yeah yeah yeah so we got full self-driving on the model y have you used it it's sick is it really it's absolutely sick so we took it from home to somewhere 40 minutes away did not touch the steering wheel one time what pulled into the location and as the car pulls in it can go park itself now so it scans the parking lot for open spots it dropped us off at the door we got out it went to park itself and we came back we clicked summon it came back picked us up we did not touch a steering wheel one time it was spooky so can i ask you a question we're friends right yeah how's this the first time hearing about this i don't know when did you do this um probably two weeks ago it was we realized we went to the browns game yesterday and sat next to each other for four three four hours tesla wasn't a topic though it doesn't matter that's a really cool thing you want to come and try it i do because on the cyber truck even though i have it on a cyber truck i haven't used it yet only because the cyber truck in general is pretty intimidating that's a big car that's sick wow it's it's weird so tesla of course they're the pioneer of electric vehicles they have some of the best combination of price and range versus competitors lucid boasts a high range but the price is really high that's like a starting at $90 000 car now obviously when it comes to self-driving wh through google is a competitor there and in a report by a san francisco user in a two-hour trip the driver never had to intervene whereas in a 45 minute ride in the tesla model x the driver had to intervene two times to fix mistakes made by tesla fsd obviously maybe san francisco is a little bit different busier city yeah weo uses remote operators along inside the fsd so its p performance should be scrutinized a little bit tesla fsd is operating on any road type whereas weo as of now avoids driving on the freeways that's kind of a big deal because i'm assuming where you went 40 minutes away was the free yeah tesla's been able to do this because there's always a driver behind the wheel versus weo who originally started on a simple street in phoenix has gradually improved technology over time they have no driver there there weo seems to be playing more of a long game and it's believed that that once tesla moves to no driver behind the wheel they'll have to roll back further adoption and be more mindful of how they operate something that wayo has done from the beginning so that is a big difference between the two tesla's obviously doing better there but if they want to get to no driver that's going to change the game they might have to pull some things back wayo is obviously a lot smaller they have a few vehicles in its fleet versus the plan to have 82,000 by this time six years ago so weo has not hit their targets which is another thing we talk about this channel don't just assume all the optimistic targets and i think this points the learning that weo has done through the process and it's taking its time with development remember it's still google and google's still an incredibly brilliant company and the big reason for the slowdown is back in 2018 they found that wayo vehicles had trouble making left turns into uncontrolled intersections as well as knowing the difference between people and cyclists now guys in this video it shows that tesla's full self-driving 12.3 come is coming across the same issues we mo had back in 2018 so yes tesla's still huge but they're going to have the same issues the other thing to note is that as the software gets better fixing mistakes does become more costly as you begin driving around you notice mistakes every 10 or 12 miles you document the mistakes correct them and move on but as the tech gets better you might not notice those same mistakes for 10,000 miles which means that an engineer has to drive around that car for a lot longer to catch a mistake that other people can catch much sooner and this is exactly why wayo has moved to remote operators rather than a driver correcting the car directly wayo knows when it's confused and asks questions the operator who in turn gives hints for the car to learn here is a video showing this in action right now now another big difference between tesla and whmo is tesla's getting people to buy the car and buy their fsd in order to test the vehicles for tesla at no cost to tesla versus weo who is paying someone on a per mile basis to test their vehicles it's an extremely different approach obviously google with tens and tens and tens of billion dollars in free cash flow and growing can keep doing that the con of that approach for tesla is that the data is random and not documented and labeled therefore it's not as useful as when it's done by a tesla driver a weo driver who's out there testing it specifically so even though weo has less data you could argue it's more instructive now let's go look at the eight pillars for tesla here another one that's kind of like me one thing i like low debt reles to the free cash flow in the last five years their free cash flow is actually down in the last 12 months versus the five-year average the free cash flow in the last last 12 months was 3.6 billion versus 4.12 in the last five years shares outstanding up slightly about 5% roic not very high guys here's what worries me a little bit you look at the net income their net income is a lot higher than their free cash flow which is fine but their pe for the last 5 years is 123 their price to free cash flow is 232 normally i would tell you on the price of free cash flow it's a fast growing company don't worry about it but we actually have lower free cash flow now than we did in the last five years so that doesn't mean that the company's going to be crap it just means it's these premiums matter at some point so even though it's a car company mode and the average car company sells for 0.5 to one time sales and they're cent here at almost 10 right you still have to remember that it's still the present value of all future cash flows and these cash flows have struggled lately but i think i'd argue that net income growing this much cash flow will come with it because remember they still have to reinvest a lot of their money into plants and all these other things to keep they're only doing a million and a half or a million eight in cars this year so if they want to get the 10 million cars how many more plants if to build i mean how many do they have now and then probably multiply it right exactly so you have to sit there and say they have a lot of capital intensive investments to make over the next five or 10 years and i still get worried about you know a gross profit of only 18% yeah these are car company gross profits right so even though there's a lot of really great potential for the software and the business i'm still worried about what it is today and if we're paying too much of a premium for the future let's see what the analysts think here for this company 238 per share in profit this year growing to 631 here almost triple in the next four years and revenue growth little over double 100 billion to 205 billion that's with a pretty slow year this year yeah but again they've had their hurdles that they have to overcome five years ago if i told you tesla would be dropping its price on cars to sell cars you said you're crazy and they did that last year seven times that's what it was okay i was i thought they did it a ton of times last year seven times i think it was right and that's something to understand now before i get in stock analyzer if you've been to our website you have definitely noticed that we are limiting the number of daily

decisions that you've ever made when it comes to investing so back to stock analyzer mo i did a 10-year analysis okay i did 7 17 and 27% growth okay in revenue thoughts things work out perfect then they're probably going to do 27% for the next decade 27% revenue growth takes their revenue from 100 billion to $1.1 trillion in 10 years and i think if robo taxi fires the way that they say maybe even better humanoids fire that way they sell 15 million cars then sure right even 15 million cars alone that would probably take up so 15 million cars average price of $50,000 a car what is that $750 billion is that right you're the math guy i'm the i'm the quant let's see let's see so 50,000 you're my walking times 15 million $750 billion do in cars okay so there's a path to that yeah then you add on the other stuff yet on the other stuff okay this isn't absurd no it's not real what we're saying yes but that's thing guys you got to remember like just because it's possible doesn't mean it's probable right and that's why we have a range of outcomes here and 7% growth is doubling their revenue in 10 years that seems kind of low yeah wouldn't you say yes yes so i'm being extreme here yes okay profit margin i did eight 14 and 22 same with free cash flow and i'm gna focus on free cash flow because we said before look at this mo it seems pretty likely i agree it's moving in the right direction moving in the right direction average this might actually be low if the if the software is a really high margin business yes pe pe 10 years from now it'll be a trillion dollar it' be all these huge things you can't put a 30 40 50 pe on this no i did 18 21 and 24 that's fine and a 9% desire return now why i do 9% well guys since 1871 the s&amp;p 500 and its equivalents have compounded at 8 point n basically 9% return with dividends since then but the average turned about 10% so 9 10% seems about the right number but remember if you want the average return go buy an etf i'm putting this in here for the intrinsic value for the company then i have to add my margin of safety in because if i'm to buy an individual stock i need to have margin of safety so hit the analyze button drum roll plasmo i have a low price of 50 okay high price of 83 okay middle price of 216 so guys i look at this saying we're not terribly out of the ballpark no but you have to remember these are assuming

2024-10-31,BS8GsWKWfYk,kind: captions language: en many analysts and brokerage houses have come out lately and said that the next 10 years in the stock market returns will not be as good as the last 10 years and guys after looking at a lot of data i could not agree more in fact in many past videos you will find me seing this exact same thing we've had an amazing 10year run in the stock market but history points out what could happen next when starting at these current valuation levels so let's see what happened in the last 10 years this chart right here is qqq on the top and spy on the bottom total returns what does that mean that includes the dividends paid a long way over the last 10 years you took 5.4 extra money in qqq and 3.5 times your money in spy for qqq that's 18.5% per year and for spy s&amp;p 500 13.5% per year again this includes dividends now now what is that guys that's an insane amount of money if you go back and i'll show you right here this is my stock market the gdp ratio these historical returns do not include dividends but the best return ever over 10-year period was 16% you add in dividends for the s&amp;p roughly 2 to 3% extra over time that's 18 or 19% the worst was negative 7.19% okay guys the nasdaq was pretty much at this level and that 16% return came on massive lows in the stock market remember the more you pay the less your returns going to be and every investment is the present value of all future cash flows in the long run the fundamentals of the market are going to drive the value in the short run it's popularity now 10 years ago we were still coming off of the great financial crisis there's still a lot of people timid about investing and that's when the real bull market started and that's why we've seen such a big return going back back to 1929 we're actually 112% overvalued not 112% ratio 112% overvalued and here are the returns based on undervaluation and overvaluation and you know what what a what a what a shock the more undervalued are the bigger your returns as you get more and more fair valued and overvalued what happens to your returns they decline it just makes logical sense the more you pay for something the less your return is going to be now the question becomes can we expect decent returns in the future i don't know now i want everybody to keep in mind i did the i took the data from schiller at yale and went back to 1871 and since then the annualized return on the s&amp;p 500 not including dividends was 4.8% per year okay if you add in dividends the average dividend over 150 years is 4.3% that's a high dividend yield by the way for a total of 99.1% per year here that's annualized now if you take all the data going back and you just take the average return it's about 10% per year between 10 and 10.2% per year that's the average now remember annualized and average are different the annualize about 9% the average is about 10% to 12 10.2% so when i look at these returns and i sit there and see that the last 10 years the s&amp;p has done 13.5% and the nasdaq's done 18 half% and just makes me go are things just too good now what are reasons why returns would be a lot better in the future than the last 10 years what would be those reasons it's pretty obvious you have massive gdp growth you have companies doing amazingly well really though the best returns have always come off of bad times because when bad times occur people sell prices drop and those drops and prices usually overe exaggerate the actual potential in the future the same thing happens on the upside when things are ry and great and bull market everything's everything's awesome people pay more than what they should pay and what happens in subsequent returns they drop so what does some of these analysts say well goldman is projecting 3% a year in the next decade that would rank in the bottom desile of comparable periods in the last century it also puts the odds that stock will fall failed to outpace inflation at about 33% now goldman's forecast and fairness is far below the consensus of wall street but i want to ask you you a question why do you think wall street has such a rosy consensus guys it's their job they're trying to tell people give us your money to manage if they really went out there and said give us your money to manage and by the way returns are going to be terrible why would you give them the money you can get 4.2% on a 98 treasury according to their analysis of the publicly available capital markets of 21 asset managers the other 10-year forecast for the s&amp;p range from a low of 4.4 to a high of 7.4 with the average being about 6% now again though going back to these valuations on the stock market gdp ratio we're 112% overv valued now a very common thing i hear about the stock market gdp ratio is it doesn't matter anymore because so much money is made overseas well it's not as much as people believe what i always tell people is remember we always want to look at data and i have the same bias i'm sure but i then sit there and say okay let's take the 10-year cyclically adjusted pe ratio what that does is it takes last 10 years of earnings on the s&amp;p brings it to today it doesn't care where the earnings were made overseas outer space here in the united states says the companies in the s&amp;p how much they make let's bring it to today's dollars and today's number and our current pe is about 37 on the 10-year basis which is 115% overvalued the historical average is 17.1 that's incredible both of these metrics have the fair value of around 2700 or 2800 on the s&amp;p now does that mean it's going to go there not necessarily the we've been overvalued for a very long time and markets val some fundamentals keep getting better i mean look at this our stock market gdp ratio is based on the gdp and how has gdp gone in the last six years up over almost 50% that's an insane number when you have gdp growth that's one of the benefits of inflation it drives up that gdp number so high that companies eventually catch up and people are making more money they're paying more for products their costs go higher etc it's a vicious cycle does that mean we should be rooting on inflation i'm not here to say that but what i am here to say is valuations are still at levels that are hard to stomach if you look back at the stock market gdp ratio back at the tech bubble which a lot of people still consider the worst bubble ever we were at overvaluations of 55% half of where we are today less than half of where we are today and look at the return over the next 10 years without dividends we were negative nega -4.4 that's hard hard pill to swallow but keep in mind in 1996 997 valuations were still a little bit rich compared to that previous history but then compared to now they're actually pretty reasonable and stocks did what they were supposed to do so i'm not here to be a fster because i don't believe in trying to time the market you all you should care about is where stocks going to be when i retire and the longer outlook you have to that the better you're going to do so the most common question i get is well paul valuations are so high shouldn't i sell should i just wait to buy stock should i hold cash guys i'm not here to tell you the right answer there's no way i can tell you in a video however history shows that that's not the right idea history shows that you need a dollar cost average and a lowc cost etfs in fact so much that i've actually announced in other videos that dollar cost averaging a low cost etfs will be probably a big part of what i do because i had a big thing to sit there and say i don't really need to make 15% returns i don't need to crush it what i need to do is invest when it makes sense now does that mean i'm buying spy qqq andd today no but you shouldn't mimic me because my situation is different than yours and your situation might be different than somebody else who also is watching this video remember what this means stock market values over the long run but this is where prices go we are according to history higher than the average price but i can see reasons why we should have a premium paid now for companies in the future it's it's we have higher returns on invested capital you can invest a lot less money to get a higher return but at the end of the day it's going to be relative to your opportunity cost and right now we look at rates and where they are you have to sit there and say what premium do you need to get in the next 10 years in the s&amp;p to justify buying the s&amp;p versus a 10year treasury cuz usually during very high valuation metrics like we're at today stocks will underperform the corresponding treasury notes from the us government for that same time period when will it happen we have no idea valuations can stay skyh high for a very long time but finally when valuations do matter they will matter with a vengeance we already saw the market start to break down from the outside the cannabis the ev all the junk stocks that all went to zero but now we're stuck with this magnificent 7 and this magnificent 7 is doing so well and nobody can imagine in a world in which these companies don't do well but i want to remind you look at tesla tesla hit an all-time high of 415 and since then has not recovered yet the business revenue is almost doubled the profit is more than doubled and the stock at one point was down over 75% and it's still down 40% or so from its all-time high that's a big difference for a company that's up that much in terms of revenue and profit why because in the short run stocks are a voting machine in the long run they're a weighing machine and i have some other great news for you guys i love talking about qqq because not many people on youtube talk about it qqq is the nasdaq 100 etf great etf and guess what in 2000 from its peak to its bottom it dropped 83% but if you dollar cost average from the very top of the market then until now you'd have made 13 1.5% return on your money versus the s&amp;p of 10 12% doing the exact exa same thing of dollar cost averaging but the hard part about investing is sitting and doing nothing watching a stock fall 83% watching an index fall 83% but this is the time you need to be buying and if you don't want to sit there and guess what's the right time to buy awesome just stop just start dollar cost averaging today it's a great way to get in and if you dollar cost average with diligence you're going to do very well i want to shift your focus from being worried about the next 10 years but being aware of it to protect in yourself to going on the offensive and taking advantage of the opportunity that you will see likely in the next 10 years no one in this world's coming to save you and the people around you are going to be scared and they will make emotionally charged investing mistakes and they will justify that with what's going on in the world you can't afford to stop investing and you should never interrupt your investments from compounding that means at times watching stocks fall very very hard and very fast it's more important than ever that you need surround yourself with like-minded people who are calm and excited to box buy stocks at cheaper prices in our community on red days it is amazing the excitement that occurs in the community another red day this is awesome i wish stocks would fall more isn't that the mentality you wish you'd have and if you already have it awesome but it's not easy to do that you shouldn't be alone in doing this understand what you're buying when you buy a stock and surround yourself with people who are headed in the direction that you want to go so the question is are you going to join

2024-11-04,UBBCed8wrf0,"kind: captions language: en there are three stocks that i am buying in november as long as they hit the price i need them to hit which is the most important aspect stock number one good old nike and nike has been falling lately $75 hit an all-time high of $179 on november 5th 2021 so almost three years ago exactly alltime high of 180 now it's a 75 people are starting to come out and say oh guess what nike's dead they're losing market share blah blah blah blah okay well nike is not dead as is evidenced by the p&amp;l yes their revenue the last 12 months is lower than last year 50 billion versus 51.4 billion but there's a lot of other things i like about them one gross profit of 45% and increasing 45% gross margin means every unit they sell every $100 they sell $45 of that is profit that goes to pay overhead and the bottom line so the faster and faster they grow this the more units they sell the higher and higher the profit will go second you look at this and think to yourself okay they're doing more direct to consumer selling that's a higher margin because before they have to sell to a wholesale you have to sell to a retail spot all these other places and the margin's a lot smaller so this margin over time should increase now for those of you who love dividends the last 12 months this dying company has done 7.2 billion in free cash flow while their 5year average free cash flow is 4.7 that's a huge increase there puts their current price of free cash flow of 15.8 but remember guys this 15.8 could be a fluke this $7.2 billion could be a fluke we don't know exactly yet but we have an increasing return on invested capital this is a sign of a moat it means that every dollar they invest in the business they get a good return on you absolutely need to pay a premium for these kind of companies so the question is what kind of premium should nike get but before we get the numbers let your uncle paul tell you some stories about nike the first thing to note is they don't manufact their own shoes that's split between vietnam indonesia and china this matters because from a supply chain perspective china's not the end all beall that everyone assumes it is with vietnam actually being more important supply chain from nike from 2005 to today revenue is up 3.7x net income is up 4.7x and eps earnings per share is up 6.7x so you might ask the question how is net income up 4.7 earnings per share up 6.7 buying back shares so as they buy back cheap shares i would argue these are cheap and getting cheaper hopefully they're doing a better service for nike investors guys apparel is a tough business shoes are a tough business all that change all the fads that come and go nike stays pretty consistent yes they have a blip going right now but let me ask you a question do you think nike is going to be around for the next 10 20 or 30 years among athletic brands nike is number one with market share at 43.7% and the brand value is number one ahead of number two louis vuitton and number three gucci nike has a desire to constantly spend to keep its edge and so far of course this has worked nike has $10.6 billion of endorsement obligations with 1.7 billion of that due in the full year 2024 but some of the biggest currently listed via sports brief are ronaldo lebron kevin durant nadal all these people guys they have a great roster of athletes and it's only going to help them keep their competitive edge guys and tim cook the ceo of apple has been on the board of nike for 19 years well before he was in c even ceo of apple so let's go look at the analyst estimates for nike guys this dying company 377 to 636 earnings per share pretty impressive here revenue growth yeah some fall here but going from 52 billion to $66 billion in revenue again these are analysts we don't know if they're right or wrong we're sitting there assuming these guys are going to look at the at the future of this company deciding from there based on conversations where it's going but like i said if you think nike is going to be around 10 20 30 years from now where do you think their revenue is going to be 10 or 20 30 years from now where do you think their profit and free cash flow would be that's what's important so of course guys the most important thing to do is what is nike worth to us and this is why the stock analyzer tool is so important for us as investors you don't shouldn't live and die by this tool but the point of it is the future is unknown we have to make assumptions about them we have low middle and high assumptions to make you need to put these in there i'm going to put my assumptions in here and it's going to tell me paul based on your assumptions this is what you need to pay to get an adequate return on your capital that's all i'm doing here and from there i put my margin of safety in but it's a great way to apply the numbers to our purchasing so first off pretty consistent roic which i love revenue growth first line here of revenue growth low middle and high i did 3 five and 7% revenue growth over the next 10 years profit margin i did 10 11 and 12% and i assumed they were going to go a little bit higher due to the fact that they're doing more direct sales to consumers and i did the same thing for free cash flow pe guys this is a premium company i think it deserves a premium pe i don't think this is one of those things where it's a fly by night company i think it deserves 2023 and 26 but of course you're the investor you're the one has to make the purchase decision not me i own nike i want to own more nike but the goal for you is the goal i'm trying to do is teach a process never buy anything because somebody on the internet says they have it even warren buffett if they have a stock don't buy it just because he has it do your own research i'm trying to teach that process and guys i put a 9% return in here i don't want 9% but the historical average for the s&amp;p is 9 to 10 per. so i'm looking at this saying what is this company worth and from here i put my margin of safety in i hit the analyze button wow guys i got a low price of 60 high price of 120 middle price of 85 i want to keep in mind when we did nike videos in the past when it was at 1 50 plus we were coming up with pretty similar numbers and people are saying paul it's never going to go there well we're at 75 today if you bought it today based on the middle assumptions you can expect about a 10 and a half% return if these middle assumptions occur and that includes dividends stock number two paycom software another company that i own that i'd like to buy at lower prices and ironically we're doing the video today and look what happened to paycom it's up 23% while the market is down big right now so they just announced earnings and they crushed and guys this is a company that had an all-time high here of $560 per share back in november of 2021 3 years ago similar to nike all the way up here fell all the way as low in the last 52 weeks of 13950 i was fortunate enough to buy it sub 150 hoping for it to continue on did not happen but that's okay paycom has 36,0 820 clients and it focuses its products on hiring engaging payment management and tracking of payroll at the business's core it just makes managing your business a lot easier and guys customer retention rates are very high clocking at 90% at the year end 2023 and even though they have a lot of business relationships and clients not a single client makes up more than one half of 1% of their revenues that's a very diverse client base paycom has a huge amount of white space for growth given they only have 36,000 37,000 clients and there are hundreds of millions of small businesses in the world that would benefit from pcoms offerings so again we go to the eight pillars here guys it's a six pillar thriller not an eight pillar thriller and we do have really high multiples here okay but we also have a high return on invest capital that's growing so there's a lot of potential here does this feel expensive absolutely absolutely does but i do love the fact that they have a high return on invested capital a high return on equity that's a little bitty adorable dividend but even better billion market cap with only a $14 billion enterprise value so there's not a ton of debt there in fact their long-term debt to free cash flow is about 1.67 times that's really low not buying back a ton of shares which you know they were pretty high for a while doesn't bother me at all but you have revenue growth of a billion led to net income growth of 300 million led to cash flow growth of 200 million with a lot of potential down the road so let's see what analysts are saying $8 per share eps growing to 14 bucks in the next four years that's big growth guys that is 75% growth and revenue growth double digits 11 11 11 14 and 11% revenue growth so guys there's a lot of potential here and on top of that they're software based look at this gross margin 83% 83% gross margin almost double what nike is well they also don't have a physical product so that helps out a ton now guys there's a lot of data here there's always a lot of data there's always a lot of things to think about and a lot of people who may have bought this company at500 some dollars see it fall and your initial reaction is i paid all this now it's i want to bail but remember it's about what's the company worth where you're currently at and that's what our software in our community helps you to understand now if you've been to our website you've probably seen that we are limiting the number of daily spots to our community and software and the reason for that is that we're completely and solely interested in having likeminded investors who can help each other with the data the analysis and more importantly and this is very important the emotional part of investing i just had dinner yesterday with a great value investor friend of mine and i said to him i think value investing is like 95 98% emotion and he laughed and said yeah you're probably right any investing is successful investing and a successful life is about surrounding yourself with people who are where you want to be and our community has thousands of members who are exactly that and the community has grown a ton and as it's grown it's become less about me and more about you and how i can make life easier and more profitable for you my team and i use every aspect of the software every single day we use it by running our retirement calculator and make sure i keep my focus on the right things analyzing our stock potential investments with our stock screener and our data and also guys buying our real estate deals whether they're big or small i use it on single family homes and i recently use it to buy a 200 unit property in louisville kentucky that costs over $22 million now if you're new to em you might not know this but i used to work from an excel sheet and the most

what is paycom software worth to us well again we go to our stock analyzer tool to give us a brief idea of it so guys i did 6 8 and 10% revenue growth over the next 20 years let's go back to 10 years i don't know why it's 20 there but i'll go back to 10 and guys this might be low that's probably why i had as numbers for 20 years analysts are expecting 10% 11% plus growth for the next 5 years so maybe this is low now profit margin 20 23 and 26% they did 26% last year they've done 22% for the last few years so i sat there and said hey with such a gross margin that so high maybe it can get better now free cash flow i'm going to assume it gets better but i don't like the fact that it trails the profit margin so it's something to consider here and do more research on before you own the company to make sure you're comfortable with it now for pe i put in 17 20 and 23 because they have an above average roic and a great gross margin so i'm going to pay a premium for that and finally a 9% desired return again no margin of safety but it tells me what the company be worth to me today the analyze button 115 to 130 on the low side 260 to 280 on the high side 175 to 200 in the middle guys you can see why it jumped all over at sub 150 so i look at this saying all right based on today's price it's probably going to be hard to make a decent return unless they really hit the high numbers of these assumptions which i don't really like to make purchases based on that now guys keep in mind it's up almost 40 bucks today so before literally yesterday this would have been a much better buy at what is that 170 or so it would have been green all the way over here but guys that's what happens but it's a good company to keep your eye on because it has has a lot of volatility and if we hit a recession i imagine a company like this is going to be hit pretty hard and it's an opportunity to buy a great company what i proceed to be a great company at a better price for myself stock number three southwest airlines guys i think southwest airlines is the best run airline in the airline industry not only is southwest a well-run operator financially but their customer service is high class coming in second place in customer satisfaction in 2024 just behind alaska airlines now even though southwest is smaller they are tied for second in total domestic passenger miles traveled delta has 17.8% southwest and american are both at 17.2 united at 16% and everybody else at 7.7 now southwest currently operates 8117 planes versus 1273 for delta united has 940 with plans to add another 700 by 2023 plus they have another 400 lease planes another thing southwest does well as they keep their cost of fuel low here's how they hedge they're very big on hedging their fuel cost they're like listen this is our biggest cost let's just operate a good business let's hedge our fuel costs here are some of the examples here profit margin has been negative for the last 5 years if you look at before covid they were between 10 and 15% very consistently so my theory is okay they have record revenue they've had some short-term problems that are i believe temporary and once they get back up to their 10 or 15% level of margin what's the stock going to be worth that's what's key for me on southwest it's purely a margin play i look at it going there's no way they're going to be losing i don't how can the company who made money 48 years in a row never declared bankruptcy suddenly permanently not be able to make money maybe they're just becoming another airline that could be my flaw there if i wake up 5 years 10 years from now in the southwest investment didn't do well i would say okay well probably based on that it just became another airline so let's see what the analyst estimates are for this company well they have it going from 21 cents per share this year to 330 in a few years the stock is currently at 31 bucks so it has it for a single digit pe a few years from now and guys look at this revenue growth 3 to 9% 3.7 6.6 6.3 9.3 5% % have them growing very very consistently all right so there's a lot of potential here according to analysts but again i'm looking for short-term problems on great companies and this is one of them so stock analyzer tool time baby all right guys i did two four and 6% revenue growth i did 6 8 and 10% profit margin and free cash flow and guys keep in mind this is lower than their than the the years before co so i'm being conservative here even more so i still think to be honest with you we should have it at 6 10 and 14 i'm going to do that because i look at the saying 10 isn't like a home run for them 10 is still on the low side of their previous um numbers pe premium airline in the sense of they're the best run one i'm giving them a better pe than normal i'm putting 16 19 and 22 but let me be a little i i went higher on their profit margin and free cash flow margin so i'm going to go more conservative on the multiple i did 15 17 and a half and 20 and for desire return i did 9% hit the analyze button guys low price of 39 high price of 15 145 middle price of 82 so i look at the saying i wish i had 30 companies exactly like this to invest in with these kind of numbers cu i would do it in two seconds guys if you want to see the 18 stocks i currently own watch our next video thank you for your

2024-11-05,YEqlRyAR59U,"kind: captions language: en there are two stocks that the members of congress have been buying this year the question on our minds is what do they know that we don't know and what do these stocks have in common guys one thing that these stocks have in common is they're at the forefront of semiconductor and chip manufacturing and congress is definitely in the know on those things they have a combined $156 billion in free cash flow and have already spent 41 billion in research and development the last 12 months which is a 10 per times increase from the previous decade there is a race to semiconductor dominance going on with more at stake than the space race back in the 1950s so let's analyze these companies and see who bought them the first stock apple nine members of congress bought apple goshh do heimer marjerie taylor green morgan mcgarvey laurel lee kathy manning pete sessions jared moscowitz tommy tuberville and mark wayne mullen now some of these congressional members have violated the stock act which is a law that prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit including insider trading by members of congress and other government employees in august of 2022 representative gimer was reported to have violated the stock act by failing to disclose a stock transaction involving independent bank corp within the required time frame in addition he had been noted for aggressive trading in microsoft shares raising concerns about his potential conflicts of interest given his committee roles it doesn't stop there representative manning was reported to have been late in filing several dozen stock trades that could have been worth up to 1.25 million combined her office stated that the third-party professionals managed the investments that the error was promptly rectified upon discovery which very well could be the case but again why do we even have to ask these questions and it's not done representative mtz made over 80 late disclosures of trades in companies like pepsico t-mobile and nike at various points in 2023 and 2024 not too long ago a spokesperson for them attributed delays to technical problems and the required fine was paid can i ask a question what the is a technical problem that would get somebody to not report very simple trades was your email not working was your typewriter not working was your hand not working where you couldn't scribble here are the things we bought on the dates we bought them senator tuberville should have properly disclosed nearly 130 separate stock and stock option trades worth at least $900,000 and as much as $3.6 million and of course a complaint was filed against him for these violations so you know what's interesting guys the best investor of all time has been selling apple and what have members of congress been doing they've been buying apple now you sit here and we talk a lot about should congress be allowed to trade tr and out of stocks guys my personal opinion is i don't know necessarily yet if there's insider trading going on but to me what i have to say is why even have the question just ban them from trading any sort of stocks force them to own etfs or hey you guys are the ones responsible for government debt only buy government bills but at the end of the day when i look at apple stock being the most purchased stock i think to myself they're no different than us they just buy whatever is really exciting and going up in the big hype stock now remember apple deserves the credit they get it's one of the best businesses the world has ever known and with its current market cap it' be the fifth largest country in the world only behind the us china japan and germany imagine that guys in addition apple has seen their margins explode since 2014 going from 28.7% to 31.5% today now you may sit there and hear that going that's barely 3% that is huge for a conglomerate like apple with how many fixed cost they have that's a massive massive increase and a big reason for that is the rise of apple services which is a very high margin product and one of their fastest areas of growth since the first quarter in 2018 apple services have gone from 9% of revenue to 26% of revenues today and guys as you see it's not just because of some other area dropping it's not like iphone sales and ipad sales are down by 50% quite the opposite since 2007 apple's worldwide smartphone market share has gone from 3% to 177% but i got to think in the us it's way higher than that they have become totally ingraining our lives they currently have 2.2 billion active devices around the world and 3.84 million apps in its apple app store which attracts 650 million weekly visits guys think about that the us population is 330 million they attract 650 million weekly active visits and it just came out last week that apple is rumored to be buying intel which is in the process of a massive turnaround and a move to a foundry system that includes billions of government and subsidies and this might explain why members of congress have an interest in buying apple what do they know now apple's one of the biggest companies in the world right and it's hard for those companies to grow but look at this amazing thing these are what the analysts think about apple's earnings per share over the next few years 684 growing to 1138 guys that double digit growth every single year for a company this large to be able to grow double digit on their earnings per share is incredible guys they did over100 billion doll in free cash flow in the last 12 months and guys look at the funny thing about their revenue not much revenue growth but bigger than you think mid to high single digits but you don't need when you have high margins especially with services growing so much this can lead to major earnings per share growth so the best is not done yet for apple in all likelihood now guys you may have noticed that we have a waiting list at everything money.com today's software includes everything we have to offer for retirement stock analysis and real estate all of these tools right here that we made for me to use every single day now behind the scenes we have to make some changes so this offer of everything is going away very soon now if you remember from the very beginning of this channel i built this software for myself and for my team so we could use it to continually make the right investments in stocks in real estate in fact in real estate we've closed on a $22.5 million apartment building a $7.5 million apartment building and i've purchased two houses worth 4 million bucks using this software i log in and go into it just like you would but as we grow it's become less about me and more about how i can better serve you and this is why we are updating our software to give you exactly what you need now the good news is these changes haven't been made yet so if you join today you'll be grandfathered in for life with everything everything you see here and this is the best deal we are ever going to offer i'm telling you this now because there's still time for you to sign up as long as you join our everything money community before we make this changes you'll be able to keep your plan even after the changes have been made so click on the link in the description below to get access to everything we have to offer including our investing tools and the community and i very confident will be the best decision you've made all year and a lot of people in our community talk a lot about the pelosi and the congressional people of the world and what they may know these are the conversations you need to have about this and if it's not about them and you want to analyze apple this is why we have the stock analyzer tool so guys when it comes to stock analyzer what we're trying to do here is figure out what is the right price for us because all the great stories about apple we can go on for days about these great stories apple's a phenomenal company but you're here because you probably understand that it's possible to overpay for a good thing and as great as apple might be there's still a price where at some point it just doesn't make sense the hard part is what's that price well the stock analyzer tool can help give you a glimpse into that it it asks us to make low middle and high assumptions for our revenue growth and we can do analysis up to 20 years so in this one i did a 10-year analysis look at this return invested capital guys 10 years of 38% 5 years 53% 1 year 68% you know what this screams moat that's what this screams and when a company has such a high return on invested capital and such a big moat what does that mean you got to pay a premium for it apple's a premium company you have to pay that premium for them now for revenue growth i was very conservative three five and 7% revenue growth i didn't go crazy because it's going to be harder for them to do 7% revenue growth than people think profit margin i did 21 24 and 27 and for free cash flow i did 24 26 a5 and 29% i went higher on free cash flow because their free cash flow is higher than their profit margin so i want to give them that premium finally for pe now guys this is the hard part and people are going to disagree with me till i'm bleue in the face some would argue that apple's a 15p because it's too big it can't possibly be blah blah blah blah blah understandable others would argue no this a remot business it's huge high returns on capital you got to give them much higher pe don't agree disagree with that it's very difficult to come the with the right multiple to pay but this is the important question i ask that's why we have these ranges and that's why this tool has been used to analyze over 1,600 companies in the last month and this tool has been used almost a million times this year by our users for exactly that reason you have to sit there and make your assumptions so i put in 1922 and 26 went a little bit higher on the high side now finally desired return guys i don't think you should buy apple for a 9% return but i put that in here because that's the market return 9 or 10 per. so this is going to tell me here's what apple is worth paul based on your assumptions then from there i have to give a margin of safety because guys we're human we're going to make mistakes and we don't know the future so you must have a margin of safety just like the bridge builder who wants to get a a 10,000 pb truck across the bridge they built it ready for 20,000 no different make sure you have that so based on no margin of safe to hit the analyze button and i have a low price of 108 high price of 221 middle price of 154 so guys it seems a little expensive right now but all you to do is be patient add it to your watch list and get ready for it stock number two guys nvidia i laugh at this just nvidia while we're recording this video nvidia became the number one market c business and that was 11 people in congress buying it pete sessions margerie taylor green nancy pelosi guys the most common question we get about nancy pelosi is does she had inside information now i will say this i don't blame people for asking she's in silicon valley but before we get to them margerie taylor green has reported significant trading activity including apple and nvidia and while her trades have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest there have been no formal allegations or reported violations of the stock act against her and that's something to not be taken lightly however we still need to ask these questions i think it's an important question to ask like guys in congress what are you here to do why are you so active at trading if you say it's somebody else doing it for you that's not separate enough for me i want to make sure that you're there to make the country better not to make your pocketbooks bigger you'll have plenty of opportunity later to make your pocketbooks bigger but why are you doing this but until then until that changes until they self-regulate themselves spoiler alert not very likely nvidia is a great great company it's the most remarkable stock today and it's not by accident a lot of people may believe and at me one point as well i thought this that nvidia got lucky with the ai tailwind that's not true remember i also believe that luck is when preparation meets opportunity nvidia has great products they have a record of profiting from the major industry trends since its founding when when they came on the scene in the early mid 90s during the rapid growth of gaming chips they were the leader in that when when i was a nerd in high school building computers nvidia was the gaming chip there was no question about that even back then as the company was four or five years old then in the last 10 or 15 years as bitcoin had its major runup they were on the forefront of cryptocurrency and they absolutely planted themselves as the largest beneficiary of the ai revolution on planet earth controlling 80% of that market they are a proven operator with a great balance sheet and they understand where the puck is heading since they went public nvidia's compounded at 33.382520 guys there is no denying the company of nvidia is amazing but whenever one company has such a massive rise in stock price even even with the growth this company's had you still got to ask the question is it too much look at the growth this company's had look at their income statement look at this revenue 4.7 5 6.9 9.7 11.7 11 16.68% 27 61 and 96 billion in the last 12 months jesus that is huge guys and guess what analysts they think even more is coming revenue growth going to 250 billion by 2029 250 billion that'd be four times larger than last year and 2 and 1 half times larger than the last 12 months and where are their earnings going to go according to analysts from a127 to 583 that's over 4x that's actually almost 5x it's like 4.7 times more that is huge for a company that just surpassed 3.5 trillion dollar market cap now is over a 35 to1 price of sales ra ratio reasonable it can be if the company's going to grow at 30% a year for the next 20 years pay that all day long without a doubt the question is is this an example of too many people chasing a good thing because when everybody's chasing it what's happening what's happening to the stock price it's going up and up and up and at some point there's a disconnect from reality i'm not trying to be a fudster here i'm just trying to teach the process of understanding as the people in the community understand we sit here and talk about is it possible to overpay for a good thing if the answer is yes you found the right channel everything has a price and there is a price that's too high if your price that's always too high is a price above today then i want to teach i want you to understand that there's a fundamental price that's right for a company and guess what that price should factor in the potential of the business as we have in our stock analyzer tool because guys look at our stock analyzer tool for nvidia look at my assumptions for nvidia i did 10 20 and 30% revenue growth for the next 10 years guys 30% revenue growth for 10 years you know how much that is that is 14 times their revenue that's taking their revenue from 90 billion to what is that 1.3 1.25 trillion dollars that's a huge number is it possible sure is it probable and that's the question i have to ask so that's why there's going to be a very wide range of prices here for this company but you have to sit there and understand understand that profit margin i did 30 40 and 50% for both profit margin and free cash flow keep in mind their free cash flows about 50% right now and their profit margin is 55% but it's been driven a lot by the fact they're the only ones in the market right now is that going to continue maybe maybe could continue i would rather not make those assumptions pe for the end of 10 years i put 20 25 and 30 and then my 9% return i hit the analyze button guys and before i show you the prices i want you to remember that these are the questions you need to be asking about companies if you don't already think that way go sign up for the community because these are the questions you have to be asking these are the questions that thousands of people ask i'd rather have you make reasonable assumptions than have your investment rely on the best possible outcomes because guys look at tesla as a prime example tesla nobody thought tesla would ever drop prices they dro prices seven times in the last year to sell more cars it's reality it happens so what are my values for nvidia a low price of 36 high price of 385 middle price of 125 so guys for me it's a little too rich for me making these assumptions and if you want to see more about what stocks congress is buying watch this next video on the five stocks

analyzed and talked about inside joel greenblat highly touted and exclusive value investors club stock number one tsm taiwan semiconductor let's pull it up right here now taiwan semiconductors getting a lot of um news lately uh it's the world's largest foundry and i'll get into that in just two seconds but first let's just look at some high level things first off it's currently at 192 per share alltime high was just a few weeks ago at 212 the 52 we low was 90 and that's only the last 52 weeks so look at how much volatility in this stock price last 5 year up 300% last year 111% year to date 92% so of course naturally a lot of people are going to be very interested in this company and it gets a lot of attention but remember a stock at all-time highs isn't necessarily a bad deal it could be on its way to higher highs because the fundamentals are getting better this is a company with a trillion dollar market cap and a trillion dollar enterprise value that means there's essentially zero debt in the company okay some other things that um i i look at here that i don't really like big difference between the free cash flow and the net income one year free cash flow of 22.3 billion compared to 33 billion in net income and the five year free cash flow 11.8 billion versus $24 billion in net income now it could be easily explained away this could be because of massive investments that they're making which will drag down their free cash flow but in the long run net income and free cash flow they should equal out and a lot of investors especially value investors will ignore a company where the discrepancy between free cash flow and net income is so big another thing i find very interesting this 1% dividend yield eats up about $10 billion their free cash flow guys i look at this going that's a big chunk of their free cash flow here that is not small and i look at it also saying this company probably has a lot of growth potential why are they paying out such a big dividend here of 10 billion i have no idea uh great profit margins here fiveyear profit margin of 40 last year's profit margin of 40% another thing to look at guys the growth rate this company is growing a lot as of late why because the chip industry in general has a lot of growth in it so just like nvidia this thing is growing like crazy along with net income and free cash flow their net income alone went from 8 billion to last year at 26.72 billion in the last 10 years now the question i have is have they been doing it naturally or through acquisitions so how do you figure that out you go to the cash flow statement in the cash flow statement there's a specifically aine for acquisitions and dispositions no i mean this is nothing 128 ,000 net $17 million in their pocket so i look at this saying okay this company has done it largely through internal growth that's an incredible feat which i love now here's the eight pillars of taiwan semiconductor guys look at this it's like a lot of the companies we see now again the one thing i don't like is the pe fiveyear pe is much lower than the fiveyear price of free cash flow now you might sit there and say paul that's a good thing if the ratio is higher it means the amount is less so they're reporting a lot lower free cash flow like we said here before versus their net income high return invested capital shares about the same $42 billion in revenue growth now one thing i do like is net income has grown 17 a half billion off of that and cash flow has grown 18 a half billion so there might be a very very valid reason why their fiveyear free cash flow and one-year free cash flow is so much less because i see the revenue growth led to a bigger free cash flow growth than net income growth that's very very important here i like this a lot okay and of course very little debt now this eight pillars are supposed to tell story so what's the story on taiwan semiconductor it's the things to look at here why are why is the free cash flow growth so much higher and better than their 5year average free cash flow you need to understand that reason now in terms of the story behind taiwan semiconductor this is the world's largest foundry with 70% market share and in the most advanced kind of chips they have a near monopoly have almost 90% share the only other companies that are able to manufacture these kinds of nodes are intel and samsung now tsm is making chips for companies like nvidia and amd that have no capability to manufacture their own chips and the other segment is known as idm or integrate device manufacturers similar to intel now tsm is in a winner take all kind of business it's really hard for samsung or intel to break through which allows tsm to gain market share and reinvest heavily in new r&amp;d further widening this exact mode now as you know intel is building their own foundaries but a lot of companies have expressed a concern about buying into intel's foundry out of fears of they're competing they're having the same competitor make their own chips that's kind of a problem for them so these are the things that give tsm kind of a leg up to the competitors so how much growth does tsm have according to analysts well very simply i'm actually surprised $1 134 to $2 that's about a 50% growth in the next four years still ample still 10 12% a year and in terms of revenue looks a little choppy here look at this graph 90 billion to 130 billion substantial overall percentage growth but in terms of why is there this drop i have no idea it could be due to a low number of analysts here only three analysts so of course guys any sort of time you have an investment the question is what's it worth to you today and for those of you who in our community have our software this is why you guys use a stock analyzer tool so much for those of you who don't have it i want you to understand that every investment is the present value of all future cash flows so whatever you price you pay today your returns will be based on all the cash flows the company receives in the future because even though you buy a stock and you don't get all the cash flow from it the balance sheets gets better by either increasing cash or paying down debt or they're going to use that cash to grow the business you're getting the growth in some way but since we don't know the future we have no idea of knowing what the right price to pay is that's why the stock analyzer tool is so useful you can put in your low middle and high assumptions on revenue growth profit margin your multiples at the end pe and your desired return and it'll tell you based on those assumptions what is the right price to pay so let's go take a look at the last time i did tsm back in july oh look i points now guys i did a 10year analysis and the hard part is we don't really know there's a lot wide range of what the growth rate could be in this company so i did 1 seven and 133% revenue growth you might sit there and say well paul look at the last 10 years they've grown significantly and get their growth has gotten faster yes but the question is is that going to continue maybe i'm being too conservative that's all the more reason why you need to use this tool yourself profit margin did 35 38 and 41 free cash flow i did 17 half 20 and 22 and a2 probably on the light side but i'm still going to keep it there anyhow now for pe and price of free cash flow it's what is this going to be in 10 years not today in 10 years i put in 16 18 and 20 only mostly because it has a higher roic and it has that competitive advantage that we saw in the story about taiwan semiconductor so i'm okay doing 16 18 and 20 and finally for pretty much all companies i put 9% return in now guys this has no margin of safety in there but you need margin of safety how do you give yourself margin of safety in the stock analyzer tool you make your desired return higher because the more you return the lower your price and remember 9 or 10% is just the market return and if you just want to get the market return no reason to buy a stock so i hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 192 we have a low price of let's focus on the earnings 77 high price of 260 middle price of 140 so in the last year it was as low as 90 bucks which was pretty close to our even low number so i think this is just a matter of being patient but again if you have an other other insights i was probably more conservative on the revenue than i should have been so obviously by all means go on a stock analyzer tool and do it yourself stock number two marvel technology currently selling at $85 a share its all-time high was december 8th of 2021 at 94 bucks now again good balance sheet $73 billion market cap 78 billion enterprise value very very good balance sheet especially considering their 5year average free clash f is 800 million one year is 1.4 now look at this how different is this than taiwan semiconductor look at the difference here they're showing net income losses over the last one year and last five years but they're showing cash flow plenty of cash flow in that time pretty interesting there okay so i'm going to focus on the free cash flow of this business business and look at this volatility guys all-time high $938,000 out their income statement where the shares outstanding will be at the bottom and we look at the shares outstanding and we see um some big jumps here 668 to 7 s to 800 million to 850 so there might have been an acquisition here how do we verify that well it was between 21 and 22 let's go to the cash flow statement and look at their acquisitions yeah acquisition right here 3.56 billion my gu so my guess is they're sitting there making acquisitions with shares that could be fine if the stock is massively overpriced the end of the day you have to remember if you're a shareholder that when you get diluted you own less and less of the business even though the number of shares you have stays the same if a if there's a company with 10 shares outstanding and you own one you own 10% of that business if they increase the number of shares to 15 you now own one share still but out of 15 shares you now take your ownership from 10% down to 6.66% you've been diluted 33% and that's something important to remember if the company is obsessed with diluting their owners so what's the story on marvel well guys they're a direct beneficiary of ai where 70% of the company's business comes from semiconductors made for data centers and as you guys have heard a lot data centers are the talk of everything they make custom chips for large companies like amazon microsoft and google i don't know if you ever heard of those people in addition they have 70% market share in a special kind of chip that moves data around within the data center it's called a digital signal processor now the revenue breakdown by market is as follows 40% to data centers 22% with enterprise networking 19% on carrier infrastructure 11% to consumers and 8% to automotive industrial companies now here's where the big growth comes from for this company all the big major tech companies know that as the hyperscalers they want to develop their own custom chips they want to do it for ai and non-ai uses and they have to partner with one or two companies marvel or broadcom that's it now it's a super complex problem and it's expensive to do this but marvel is the one that has the infrastructure already in place to do that now as i said earlier they've already done work with amazon they've already done work with microsoft and they're doing work with google but it's basically just a fight between the two companies broadcom and marvel to earn all the liar text businesses and make their chip so what are the analysts saying about broadcom well let's pull it up right here oh boy so a dropp in their eps but look at this growth a154 to 645 in the next five years according to the analysts look analysts are going from 33 down to three so it could be skewed and remember what i feel about analysts let's go look at revenue growth 5.6 billion going to 13.54% pretty impressive growth and of course guys you have to know when you have a company with good margins a lot of growth potential and potentially in its own moat you have to pay a premium for that now guys we just analyze these two

that's kind of a lot of guessing i did four seven and 10% revenue growth that's basically doubling every 10 years in my middle assumption now for profit margin as you guys can see negative so i'm basically going ignore this i just put four and a half five and a half six and a half it's probably all baloney free cash flow look at this free cash flow growing over the last 10 years from 14 and half% 17 and a half% and 26% the last year but i don't know if this 26% is sustainable for a long periods of time there's a lot of demand for chips right now what do that demand wains what have more competitors come in there's a lot of questions to be answered here so i put 1317 and 21% now for my pe and price of free cash flow i did 13 16 and 19 even though there's a lot of growth potential here roic is low so i'm just being a little more conservative and i did my 9% return i hit the analyze button $85 stock right now i'm going to focus on cash flows i have a low price of 12 high price of 40 guys for me i just look at this saying it's not in my wheelhouse i don't understand this and the other thing is they're diluting investors like crazy so i don't even know how many shares are going to be outstanding in the next five or 10 years if you have a better understanding of it please please go do it because i currently don't and i'd love for you to engage in the community about that stock number three in the value investors club is disney stock this is a stock i own remember don't ever buy something just because i or anybody on the internet or even warren buffett owns it we're here to teach a process of understanding what you're buying and why if you apply that process to the things you understand you'll probably do quite well i own disney for one reason and one reason only well not one reason only it's the mode of all modes i would guess but look at this profit margin 5.3% last year 2.6% the last 5 years but yet before covid their profit margin was 10 to 15% and look at their revenue alltime record highs we're at 90 billion in the last 12 months and before covid the peak was 70 billion so i'm looking at us thinking okay this is pretty incredible and their their profit margin has been quite suppressed since disney's stock has underperformed for a decade investors are just getting completely sick of it they've sort of started to move on i hear the negativity even our community about disney and a lot of the recent margin problems they've had can be attributed to that massive shift from disney media as a tv company to a direct to consumer model guys this kind of shift is huge and can take a really long time maybe even five or 10 years to work itself out as it's a major disruption to an underlying industry that's been the same for decades at disney's current price of $95 a share bas in our analysis you're basically only paying for the parks business and the rest of the company is free parks did roughly $9 billion in pre-tax earnings which is expected to grow to 12 billion by 2027 so after tax let's assume $7 billion if you apply a multiple of 20 times that you're at $140 billion and i would argue maybe even a bigger premium because of the moat so you're seeing at $180 billion market cap and 140 to 180 of that can be attributed just to parks so the rest of the stuff in the company might just be free obviously it's not necessarily free they have to start generating more and more profit from it but there's a lot of profit potential based on the assets that disney currently owns also one of the benefits is the direct consumer model seems to be making some progress right now after years of increased spending and losses in order to compete with companies like netflix it was break even for the first time and the earnings potential for this branch of the company is very high and disney's content is super high quality and family love it now obviously i watch hulu i watch espn which part of the disney family but my brother and his daughters all watch disney plus our analyst dalton he watches disney plus nightly so i think there's a lot of potential there for upside for such a large company so let's see what the analysts are saying about this company right now $5 per share going to 773 in the next four years so double- digit growth every year nothing to write home about but nothing bad revenue growth 92 billion this year to 112 three to 5% a year and that's about what you're going to get from a company like disney how do they really really move that needle much faster so of course it goes back to what's the right price to pay for disney stock and the last time i did this analysis was on may 7th and here is my 10-year analysis that i did i did three five and 7% revenue growth i can understand if somebody said paul it should be two four and six whatever you find beneficial but here's one thing this roic has been beaten down by the last four or five years so i'm not worried about this r ic being lower profit margin i did 9 12 and 15% look at this with the margin beat up over the last four or five years they're still at eight and n% on profit margin and free cash flow margin so this is a company that can easily do 12% and of course pe and price of free cash flow i actually wonder if 1821 and 24 is too low it's freaking disney if i give you $200 billion right now to compete with disney on all the businesses they have the parks disney plus all the content they have how would you do it be very difficult i don't think you could so maybe this premium should be higher i'm just putting 18 21 and 24 in here just to be a little conservative and a 9% return hit the analyze button i got a low price of 75 high price of 210 middle price of 130 and if you pay today's price based on my middle assumptions it's a 133% return including dividends that seems to be a pretty decent opportunity out there for me but of course do your own research now guys if you want to find the top stock to buy

2024-11-07,hickNCT4B5Y,"kind: captions language: en the viewers here on youtube are always looking to find stocks with future growth potential every great investor will do a great job finding that we use our everything money software to find stocks that are potentially undervalued but small enough to have a lot of future growth potential as you know in order to find multi-baggers not only you have to find companies that are great at compounding they have to have a lot of runway left to allow them to really expand in that growth stock number one sprouts farmers market guys this is a company that i own and it makes me chuckle now remember don't buy any stock because i or anybody else on the internet does it i'm here to teach a process that you can apply to your own investing i don't care if you're jimmy buffett or warren buffett the goal is to find the right process for you sprouts has absolutely killed it now not goingon to lie i was buying it from 32 to $35 a share so i've killed it with that said i did not get my full position it just skyrocket from there but this company has absolutely crushed let's take a look at some highlevel numbers first off $14 billion market cap compared to a 16 billion enterprise value the difference there guys is essentially their net debt so this is a company with a very reasonable debt amount so guys this is extremely expensive here it's 48 times 5year free cash flow 40 times it's current free cash flow but wait it might not be that expensive i'm not saying it's not for me i own the company and old paul would have said i'm going to sell this because i feel it's run up too fast and move on but new paul says listen let your winners run let a great company that's executing continue to execute instead of getting in and out in and out in and out and i've done that several times in the past and i've regretted it every single time now sprouts is an amazing story literally overnight this company has led the execution that's made everybody on wall street absolutely love it investment banks have been piling in also raising their price targets sprouts is actually a top five holding by weight in the russell 2000 index and guys their attention is absolutely warranted it posted 88.4% same store sales growth in the most recent quarter as a comparison kroger did 1.6% in the third quarter sprouts also has a 38% gross margin versus krog gr 22% what does that mean means every unit they sell has 38% going to pay their overhead and they get good to their bottom line profit while kroger is at 22% guys these numbers are not only incredible they're getting better because the company has grown to 428 stores in 23 different states and with all their new stores are being built they're 23% smaller in square footage they're packing in revenue on a much smaller basis being much more efficient now also don't forget they have their own brand that has much higher margins of 50 or 60% versus the 30 8% and that is a percentage of the revenue is growing so this company their goal is to get is to basically triple in size so they have the growth in terms of expansion number of stores and they have a growth in terms of gross margin as well as net margin compounding on itself this company really has a lot of growth potential now let's see what analysts think i don't i don't remember what analysts think about this company which goes to show you how much i don't care 340 to 347 which boggles my mind over the next four years they expect basically flat earnings per share growth of the company i don't know what they see cuz interestingly enough they have 10 9 and2 10 5 and a half 5 a half% revenue growth taking their revenue up to 10 billion yet earnings per share being flat i don't know why that is but remember i look at this and it's okay to be different than analysts because analysts have their own bias whenever they're looking at a company so of course it leads us to our last point which is what does the stock analyzer tool say well remember guys we use stock analyzer tool to give a low middle and high range on our assumptions a revenue growth profit margin earnings multiple as well as our desired return this allows us to give this range because it's going to give us a range of values as an investor we don't know the future and we're humans and we make mistakes that's why we need to make multiple different estimates when we do our stock analyzer tool now i'm doing a 10-year analysis here and again you can do up to 20 years on this company i did 68 and 10% revenue growth i did four four and a half and 5% profit margin guys i could argue this is very low for free cash flow and profit margin because as they grow they're going to make more efficient decisions decrease their cost overall as well as increase the percentage of revenue coming from their own in store brand which has much higher margins i could see this being five six and a half and 8% but i'm sticking at four four and a half and five pe what's the pe in price of free cash flow in year 10 i put 16 19 and 22 only because by that point they're a mature business and they're great business but they don't have the growth expansion that they do today and finally i did a 9% return you're going to see me put 9% in for everything this has no margin of safety i put this in because the historical average is 9 or 10% on stocks so i'm sitting there saying what's it worth today based on getting the stock market return but again i don't want the stock market return on an individual companies i want margin of safety so i hit the analyze button guys i have a low price of 60 a high price of 120 middle price of 85 so it's well above my middle range but again i'm not here to jump in and out of great companies i'm going to sit here and stick with it even though it's much lower price than today based on my intrinsic value stock number two guys go easy they're an installment lender and i'm going to go over this this is on the tsx on the toronto stock exchange has a three billion doll market cap big enterprise value enterprise value though 6.45 so a lot of difference here and their free cash flow was 455 million in the last 12 months that's a big jump compared to the last 5year average which is negative so from a one-year perspective they're selling for seven times free cash flow the question is is this sustainable they paid a dividend of 2 and a half% for next year 2.1 this year they can afford that it eats up $61 million to their $450 million in free cash flow the first thing i'm going to look at guys is why was their 5year free cash flow so low in the negative let's go to their cash flow statement it actually looks pretty consistently negative 70 74 these are negatives -30 positive 1225 negative 230 negative 170 positive 45 negative negative negative and the last 12 months they've done $120 million in profit they're an installment lending company which means their typical customer they service has not enough bad credit to need a payday loan but also not good enough to obtain loans from banks and other higher-end institutions the company has vastly outperformed the market in history it hit a low of $26 or so in 2020 and since then it is basically up five times since then i mean look at this $181 it's actually skyrocket even more than that it's actually six or seven times more now since 2019 they have compounded at over 20% loan growth of 35% and ready for this one an average average interest rate of 30.3% charge the customer go easy currently has 400 locations across canada making them absolutely front of mind with their customers given the physical number of stores so the difference between canada and the us is in the us anybody can buy credit data about any customer they want in canada that personal privacy is way more strict so the only way to get that data is to write and compile the loans yourself and guess what that's what go has been doing for decades so the more loans they write the more data they get and the better they underwrite even better the former ceos and board chairman don johnson and dave ingram they own 20% of the outstanding stock so you might sit there and say why does that matter well guys we love when individuals own a big chunk of companies why because you better believe they want to become even richer so they're going to sit there and put their money where their mouth is and they're going to sit there and do the right things for the company cuz their net worth is tied up in that now guys here's the 10-year chart just to show how this company when you're sticking with companies big surge fall back down big surge again the this is the thing you have to remember when you find great companies at great prices they're going to have their falls the question is is this fall dramatic or not this is why we're teaching on this channel the idea of buying a company is buying a piece of a business and sometimes the market can overvalue the business and sometimes it can undervalue it and i'm not saying this is overvalued this undervalued but look at every great company in history there's a great book written about hund baggers and in there christopher mayer the guy that we actually interviewed talks about the fact that you have to absorb big drops in stock price as this company goes to 100 ducks that's hard to do it's hard because the emotional side of investing you're sitting there and you see a stock go up then you see you feel so great then you see a stock fall look at sprouts sprouts is at 140 and everybody's seeing it go up and i'm like okay in my head i don't think it's $140 stock even though market's telling me it's that in i had i think it's an $80 to 90 stock i want you to attach yourself to the value of the company not the price listed by the market and that's a very tough thing to do but that's what we're teaching on this channel that's what we do in our community that's why we have these tools the stock analyzer tools for exactly that reason because if the stock is selling too expensive you can go okay even though it's at this price it's probably not worth that and if it's really cheap okay even though the market is selling at this price it's probably worth more because remember price is what you pay value is what you get now if you've gone to our website to join our community you're going to

even know what free cash flow is so i'm going to ignore free cash flow here i'm going to put it in here just because i have to but i'm going to ignore this completely i'm going to focus on profit margin and the price based on those profit margins and the earnings of multiple earnings so first guys the 10-year analysis i'm doing revenue growth of 7 10 and 13 now for profit margin again the one we have to focus on i'm going to do 16 18 and 20 now guys in the last 10 years they did 16 so i think it's a reasonable number because you see it skewing up here and it's got a lot higher since then so 16 18 and 20 still might be conservative and again even though i say ignore it i'm putting the same thing in for free cash flow because i have to put something in now pe current pe is 12 and a half i'm assuming just to be conservative i'll stick with that 12 i'm going to do 12 14 and 16 same on free cash flow multiple and again my 9% desire return now guys if you really want to look at this company like for me personally i'm going to put in a much higher number here i'm going to be putting in like 14 15% because you know why i don't get banking i don't understand it it's not in my circle of competence but if the numbers still work i'm going to go in the community and find somebody who is smarter than me in banking and there's a lot of people out there so i hit the analyze button guys look at this a low price of 212 a high price of 493 a middle price of 325 based on to's price in my middle assumptions that's a 175% compounded growth rate on 10 years so in my opinion it's worth a deeper dive if you feel comfortable with banking and guys if you're in our community reach out to dalton he's wicked wily in the community you guys all know him he works on the channel he owns the stock but again don't buy because he owns it but he'll talk you through your analysis his analysis of it to get you to understand it better from his perspective guys stock number three another stock that i own again the disclaimer don't buy anything cuz i own it paycom software i got very lucky this stock fell hard to 150 or so back in july i picked up some shares not as much as i'd like it's currently at 231 guys it's up 32% the last six months 46% in the last three months 41% in the last month it is really surged as of late this company has a $1 13 billion market cap with a measly 14.5 billion enterprise value now one thing i don't like the free cash flow is trailing the net income here one year is 305 versus 470 5year free cash flow of 220 million versus 280 so that's something to consider here but great returns on capital 82% gross profit margin with a bottom line of 21% the last 5 years 26% last year now pcom has almost 37,000 clients and it focus its products on hiring engaging payment management and tracking of employees now they stated in their last earnings report that it wants to get to the point where all the redundancies of running and operating your business are fully automated and guys as a business owner i can't tell you how much i love that idea their ceo claims that they're already the most automated offering in their entire industry now to demonstrate the strength of its product offering pcom actually conducted a study showing that its automated processes returned an average of 821 per return on investment over a three-year time frame 821 % in addition they have an offering called gone and on average at saved organizations's 10% in labor costs that would typically go overlooked or mismanaged guys think about a small business that has a few employees and let's say they have $200,000 in payroll that's 10% at $20,000 a year in savings how much would you pay as a business owner to get $220,000 per year in savings this is exactly why their customer retention is so high clocking at over 90% at the end of 2023 the business is incredibly diversified with no single client making up a single percent of revenues and a half percent at most remember if you go to these 10ks and you see a lot of these companies they're going to sit there and say hey one of our risks is our we have a client that makes up 18% of our business not a single client makes up a half percent of their business so guys let's see what analysts are saying about paycom look at this growth $8 per share this year in eps going to 1377 that's double digit all across the board let look at the revenue growth potential 11% 11% 11% 14 11% going from 1.9 billion to three billion guys let me ask you this question based on what you're seeing here and the number of clients they have in the growth potential worldwide do you think this compan is going to be bigger 10 or 20 years down the road the answer is probably yes both in revenue and profit and free cash flow so the question you ask yourself is what's the reasonable price to pay for the company and that's why the stock analyzer tool is so useful i like to focus my investments on companies like this that have growth potential or they're so big they're not going away or a combination of both that way i just realize it's just about paying the right price i have to be patient so the last time i did pcom let's see what assumptions i made here okay i did a 10-year analysis i did 68 and 10% revenue growth and keep in mind guys way lower than the last 510 and even last one year but i'm okay with that profit margin i did 20 23 and 26 lower free cash flow and i'm okay with that pe because of their high return on invested capital i put 17 20 and 23 remember this high return on capital tells us that they get a good return on compounding their money and that's what you want to pay a premium for it also tells you this kind of a moe happening now it's not apple's return invested capital but it's pretty solid and again the 9% desired return hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 232 low price of 120 to 135 high price of 270 300 middle price of 180200 now you see why i jumped on it sub 150 now guys if you want to see a next video on top undervalued stocks check it out thank you for your

2024-11-09,qONIwOZN6ak,kind: captions language: en warren buffett has accumulated a record $341 billion in cash which makes up 56% of berkshire's portfolio and an astounding onethird of their market cap many believe that he's timing the market and signaling that a stock market crash is imminent we looked at warren buffett's cash holdings from 1999 all the way through today which included the tech bubble and the 2007 great financial crisis and what we found even though he says he never tries to time the market he was holding similar percent cash positions which led to profiting greatly in allocating $20 billion of his cash pile into businesses and securities in 2008 now you're probably wondering what he knows today that you don't know and whether you should sell your stocks and go to cash and we're here to discuss that right now now remember warren buffett is a totally different position than you and i so even though we can look at him to understand where we are on the market he is going to make very different decisions on investing than you and i one of the biggest ones is in order for him to move the needle on birkshire hathway he has to make very large acquisitions and it's hard to find very large acquisitions selling for massive discounts in fact he has said that if he had $1 million today he guarantees he could get 50% returns per year because his world of investments are much larger he can find companies that are 5 million all the way to5 trillion doll market cap so you have to remember that when you watch his behavior but again it is nice to look at that behavior since the market is driven by so many large cap companies to see what he is buying and what he's doing with cash now in the last year buffett has been a net seller of stocks reducing his apple position from 175 billion on december 31st to 70 billion as of september 30th of this last quarter in 2024 bank of america was reduced from 34.8 billion to 31.7 billion and chev run from 19 billion to 17.5 billion just to name a few so what do he do with his cash back in 2008 well buffett writes his annual letter and in his letter back then he begins it by explaining the free fall in stock prices he's seen he said stocks were falling at a pace he'd never seen before in his business history and that was back then since then we had a 40% drop just in one month of co now buffett goes on to say that the pace and extent to which the government has had to step in is unthinkable and it would cause an onside of inflation the funny thing about that was we didn't see that and the reason i believe we didn't see that and i thought the same thing back then was i said well the money wasn't put in the people's hands it was put in the hands of the banks to support them and he thought it would be absolutely impossible to wean companies and the american public off government aid now just because he said that prematurely doesn't mean that's not true because we saw that since co handing money out to people really drove up prices and got people really excited about getting that government money now he compares the events of 2008 with the early 80s and prime rate of 21 half% the great depression which we had unemployment got as high as 25% but he still believes overall that america has gotten through worse and this would be no different and he was right in his letter he does say that he thinks that the economy will be in shambles throughout 2009 and probably a little bit beyond that which he was right about but he didn't think the stock market trend of going lower would continue in fact he wrote an oped piece if you're going to make a make a bet on the us economy in the long run you will do well and he explained the whole stock market to gdp ratio which we talk about a lot on this channel and saying where the metrics were back then meant you're going to get a great return on the money if you invested in the us economy buffett goes on to say that capital allocation which is what ceos do their my primary job how they take the money that's in the business and invest it was great that year that the disarray in the markets allowed for that tailwind and that pessimism is a to birkshire in these times remember it's this whole adage of be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful everyone was fearful back then buffett was greedy and in 2008 he made three large acquisitions in their insurance business which he claims added 1.5 billion dollar to pre-tax income he also states that in 2008 he made mistakes of omission and commission which led to buffett buying kico phillips in a large chunk that was when oil was at 140 and he said even back then he's like yeah i didn't think oil price would fall that much from 140 but he still believes that that purchase would was going to play out favorably for burkshire shareholders however in the interim he feels he is wrong and has lost the company several billion dollars on that investment and guys i really want to accentuate this he bought two irish banks that year for 244 million at the end of the year he had to write that investment down to $27 million a loss of 89% that just shows that even the best investor of all time gets it wrong later in the note buffett claims he owns puts $37 billion worth of puts in the s&amp;p 500 the ftsc 100 in the uk the the eu stocks 50 and then nik 225 in japan which pays them premiums of almost $5 billion in expires between september 9th 2019 and january 24th 2028 what he was doing there was he was sitting there telling everybody oh you're so negative on this fine i will own those puts i will own your insurance bet that you think stocks are going lower because i believe so much in stocks rebounding and he got 5 billion in premiums for that and when they expire he's probably going to do quite well on that but remember that is an example of banking on people's pessimism and fear so what does this data tell us well he's always believed in holding cash in fact he always says that he wants to have at least $20 billion in cash and as the company grows i'm sure it'll be higher because he never wants to be caught with his pants down in the insurance business the thing about an insurance business is that one cat drop for gear can require a ton of cash he never wants to sacrifice birkshire hathway's ability to operate because of one outlier year now guys this is an excel sheet going from 1999 to 2024 breaking down his stocks and his cash in the total the average is 49.32 per in cash and right now he's at 55.68 per of cash so it's not that much higher than what he's always been and as you can tell here here was the tech boom and bust h cash higher cash he hadit 70% in o2 guys o02 was in the middle of the crash stocks had already been down two years in a row by double digits he didn't go deploy more here the great financial crisis a little bit different 04 he had 66% going down to 50% but guess what that was before the financial crisis even started that was 2006 so as the businesses generated more money then he started to invest more and you sit there and look at this cash pile and it's going up and up and up and up and up up up up up up up up up $340 billion now guys over time this cash pile is growing at a huge rate huge rate the question is is it going to grow faster than this than this clip of stocks but as he sell stocks and adds to his cash pile it throws things off a little bit but remember the big key to all of this is how does he deploy 341 billion in cash he spoke before the great financial crisis about his belief that markets were overvalued i remember him doing an interview saying h over the next 10 years you probably expect 5 or 6% returns including dividends based on where the stock market the gdp ratio was now you might be wondering okay why did he put so much money into work in 2008 versus 2001 to 2003 guys if you remember back in the tech boom he always said i don't understand tech i have no idea of understanding what a good investment it was a bad one how are they going to grow their business but you know what he does understand financials he understands finance business he understands banks contrary to his investments in irish banks he understands banks very well so in the great financial crisis that affected banks a ton so he was able to make a lot of investments in companies with a lot of balance sheet issues because he understands balance sheets he's very big on staying within his circle of confidence banks insurance companies are a circle of circle of competence not tech in fact as of late what's the only tech investment you've seen him make apple and his reasoning is if you ask somebody to not have a car for a year versus not have their iphone for a year they would rather not have a car for a year they can do everything else with their iphone so he even looks at it it's not necessarily tech it's about a way of living life now guys understanding buffit and talking about these things i find to be very interesting and a lot of people in our community do as well we have conversations like that because it's interesting to understand where are the people that we respect the most where are they in their investing journey and even waren buffett who's 93 94 years old it's important to understand that not only that guys i love going to stock analyzer tool and putting warren buffett's investments in here to see what he sees i've said in other videos like he did verizon years ago i remember doing the analysis and going i don't see it i don't see what they see in verizon having these conversations and using these tools will help humanize warr buffett for you we all put him on this pedestal but guys at the end of the day we saw he makes those mistakes in investing he will have those same mistakes he to understand the things that you understand and if you understand something that's why these tools help the most to get your value out of it and with thousands of people in our community someone there understands every sort of industry probably multiple people so if you're interested in joining the community and having the software to help you better understand and analyze companies click on the link in the description below or go to everything money.com signup go sign up there $7 for 7 days our trial i think you're going to love it guys this is from his 2002 annual report so imagine what's changed in the last 22 years but this just goes to show you how big his require requirements for investing are now in order to move the needle for birkshire in 2002 he needed at least $50 million of before tax earnings demonstrating consistent earning power but the thing i'm going to focus on if there's a lot of technology we won't understand it the larger the company the greater will be our interest we'd like to make acquisitions in the five to20 billion range guys that's when they had 30 billion in cash they have 340 billion in cash now using that same multiple they're looking at 500 sorry 50 to $220 billion in acquisitions now i used to look at warren buffett's balance of cash and say look it's obvious that market's overvalued and i think it is but it doesn't mean that there aren't good buys out there because he has to avoid the small buys that investors like you and i can take advantage of you know one of my best investments in the last year and a half has been sprouts farmers market it went from a$3 billion market cap to a1 billion market cap if he bought the entire company back then he would still only have made9 billion on a1 trillion doll company which is a 0.9% increase in value in a year and a half guys he can get 4.25% from treasuries he'd have made $60 billion in that same time frame just by holding cash that just goes to show you how much how big than the investment needs to be to move the needle for xing an investment would have been a home run for so many people for him it would not have moved the needle needle at all so remember don't follow buffett learn from buffett's mentality don't time the market you need a dollar cost average into longterm etfs you're not going to outperform the market in all likelihood if you see opportunities when markets are down to buy companies that you love and understand go for it but the way you beat the market is by buying lowcost s&amp;p 500 etfs and buying qqq at the right time when valuations are reasonable and dollar cost average into there because i've told people before that if you dollar cost average into qqq from the peak of the market in 2000 after before it fell 83% you still made 13.5% annualized return versus 10 a half% of the s&amp;p in that same time period so stick to the lowc cost etfs but it's hard to do that and if you want to buy individual stocks take a portion of your money and do so and we're here to teach a way of thinking that will help you become a better investor and smarter at doing that so to our original question is he trying to time the market guys i don't think there's a smoking gun here saying he's trying to time the market i just buff i just think buffett's being buffett what does that mean is it means that if he understands it and there's a great opportunity he has no problem pushing the chips in as an example if we had an ai crash internally we've discussed this and our thought is he's not going to go buy ai companies probably because he doesn't understand the future of ai but i'm willing to bet 20 or 30 years from now there will be people in birkshire buying those tech companies that do ai why cuz look at apple he would never touch apple back in 2001 2002 but now he's buying apple my guess is at some point he'll buy google why because the world has changed in how it makes money i don't think google is hard to understand i'm surprised to even hear him say that but the end of the day he understands what he understands but there's a reason why every single day he gets a phone call about how many policies and how much money they spend on advertising over a geico why because he understands advertising google is advertising he doesn't understand chips he doesn't understand how one chip is better than the other and how they're going to dominate that market it's too early in this ai boom down the road when things are more mature probably so i don't think he's timing the market i just think he's fine sitting there saying hey we have tons of cash here we're earning 4 and a half% with 98 treasuries why take on any undue risk i will say one thing i'm extremely surprised that he's selling apple that to me is a sort of timing the market kind of thing i'm very shocked about that and going back to the treasuries guys in 2007 if assuming 5% yield your treasuries he was making $3 billion back then on annual income from treasuries that same number today is almost $20 billion it's a game changer so at that point you might he's going to sit there and say we're making more than we need anyhow why go put money in things we don't understand i don't think he's trying to attend the market but i understand why people might think that as i used to think so as well when he was holding a lot of cash but to me it's just him saying i don't see values on the size of companies we need to buy which makes also wonder why not buy s&amp;p 500 etfs why not buy back even more of your shares of birkshire as the stock falls which is what i think he will be doing so on that note should you wait for the

2024-11-11,ZpyBVXh6vLQ,kind: captions language: en guys we have three stocks trading at or near their 52e low now remember the reason we look at 52- we low stocks is because they're a great place to start looking for opportunity if a stock is down a lot there's probably a reason for it but the question is is it down more than it should be stock number one hershey's hsy guys this company is on my list of companies i want to own forever this stock is at 176 a share it was at 27688 back in may 1st at 52 we low was just yesterday at 173 so this company we all know what it does they all sit here and this is at a low and i love the fact that it's sitting there first off $45 billion market cap 53 billion enterprise value8 billion difference is essentially its debt but it generated 1.38 billion in free cash flow last year and 1.5 billion in the last five years each year now why does that matter well we want to sit there and have companies that generate a lot of free cash flow that can pay down their debt that can afford their debt hershey's has a great brand and they're probably not going away imagine the world that we'd have to live in that hershey's went away that's what's incredible they pid dividend last year of 2.25% eats up a billion dollar their forward dividend is 3% this is a big dividend company but they're eating up that free cash flow with a lot of return on invested capital what that tells me is they don't see much room for growth so this is gna be a this is going to be a slow and steady buy it at a good price because if they're eating up so much cash flow to pay off that dividend i look at that saying they obviously don't see much opportunity for investment that's okay but it just means you got to get it a lot cheaper to get that return for yourself now a couple other things i like very consistent last five years profit margin of 16.12 last year of 16.76% nice and pretty but their earnings net income is much higher than their free cash flow last year but in the last five years very very similar they're selling for 30 times free cash flow and earnings over the last five years 30 is a lot especially for a company doesn't have a lot of growth cocacola when warren buffett started buying it he paid 30 times back in 1987 he still made 11 and a half per return on his money with dividends does that make this okay are hershey's and coke very similar companies and brands i don't know that's the question we have to ask ourselves let's look at the eight pillars here shares outstanding jumped a lot 23% my guess is some sort of acquisition so we got to take a look at that and apart from that they've got their we already went over their 5year pe and pre price of free cash flow let's go check out their acquisition so we go to their cash flow statement go to acquisitions and 1.22 billion right there 480 million 87 million 1.73 billion right there so really that's probably where it was the the 1.73 billion back in 2021 so let's go to their income statement at the very bottom of the income statement it'll show shares outstanding now with the global chocolate market hitting a jaw-dropping 1227 billion in 2024 the average american is dropping $150 on chocolate every single year that's a lot of action for that sweet tooth guys so when it comes to the us hershey is straight up dominating the scene they're not just the number one player in the c game they're also number two snack brand in the entire country but wait a second globally chocolate consumption isn't slowing down anytime soon the world inhales a staggering 7 and half million tons of chocolate every single year now of course nothing's all sunshine and chocolate bars for hershey the whole chocolate industry is filling the heat recession worries are real people are being more healthc conscious slash weight loss meds like oic that may be stealing the spotlight from chocolate oh and also did i mention cocoa prices they've been in a roller coaster ride hitting all-time highs earlier in 2024 only to drop by more than 40% since that's a big drop now despite all that hershey's is still rolling with the punches sure their earnings and revenue are down but here's the kicker they're investing big to keep things running smoothly they've slashed some of their stock buyback plans to make room for a whopping $600 million investment to upgrade their erp the enterprise resource planning system so you might be wondering what the hell is that well basically this high-tech software will help hershey manage its cash and resources like a pro making sure they stay on top of their game in this everchanging market so of course heres is going through some challenges a lot of people are but i don't think they're out for the count so let's see what the analysts think about them so their earnings per share according to analyst 960 to 1180 not much growth there guys not a lot of growth and if that's true all the more reason you need to buy it for an inexpensive price but look at this revenue growth 1% 3% 3% 7% 3 and a half% okay about inflation which what i probably expect probably a little bit better than worldwide nominal gdp growth that's what i look at when i think with hershey's so remember guys this is a great story this is a great company with a very addicting product the question is what's the right price to pay it can be the most amazing company in the world but if you overpay for it you end up in a bad situation i don't care how great the story is if you pay 10 trillion for it you're going to end up not doing well that's why the stock analyzer was created we created the stock analyzer tool specifically to be able to put in your assumptions about the future both all low middle and high assumption to get some sort of price that's right for you today we start with revenue growth i did two three and a half and 5% revenue growth nothing huge in fact i could argue two three and four whatever it is but i wanted to go a little bit higher on the high side profit margin good news is we see profit margins increasing from 14% on average for the last 10 years all the way to 1676 in the last year so i did 13 and a half 15 and 16 and a half probably a little low in this middle range i could understand somebody saying no paul that's wrong in fact i'm going to change that myself i'm going to go with 14 16 and 18% now for free cash flow it's about the same it's actually higher in the last 10 years and about the same in the last five years this might just be a fluke so i'm going to keep it the exact same pe now guys 17 20 and 23 that's probably too low i'm actually going to put it a little bit higher i'm going to go 20 23 and 26 guys this is a wonderful product they do very well if i asked you to name the number one chocolate brands in the world you'd probably mention hershey and a lot of people would so that deserves a premium with such a high return on invested capital of 21% these are the things you have to factor in and this is what makes investing hard this is a subjective part of investing but you've got to pay better higher premiums for top quality brands and moes hershey's as part of that and finally i put my 9% desired return in guys this is basically to find out what is my intrinsic value what do i think the company is worth itself today so i basically put the market return of nine or 10% in there but remember you should probably put a higher desired return in there that will increase your margin of safety and you need margin of safety because we don't know the future and we're humans and make mistake if you're going to sit there and just get the market return buy a lowcost etf but i want to do this to get a market price for the company hit the analyze button guys i got a low price of 100 high price of 195 middle price of 140 all right so i and by the way these returns down here include the dividends so i look at it saying i just got to be a littleit more patient and i have on my watch list at 150 not to buy it there but to start selling puts at lower prices stock number two celsius guys this is one of the most common stocks i see talked about in the community on twitter everything this company has come on the scene but look at this all-time high of $100 just back in march march 14th we're seeing a lot of companies with all-time highs on march 14th 52 we low just two days ago of $27.78 that is a 73 percent drop in stock prices i don't want to hear it when people say i don't think a stock's going to fall that much it can happen and it can happen very quickly it happens all the time this is a$7 billion doll company with an amazing balance sheet how do i know that enterprise value 6.5 billion it means they essentially have a negative $500 million of debt which is basically a positive $500 million of cash on their books this poultry dividend yield now here's the interesting part about this company 5 years year free cash flow of 60 million one year of 170 million you know what that means growth so for me guys i'm going to immedately tell you don't focus on this five-year number this is useless the fiveyear free cash flow is useless because they're growing so much let's go look at this free cash flow in here this free cash flow by year lost 11 million about a million bucks 2.8 lost 100 million made 100 million 123 and in the last 12 months $170 million big i mean it was negative in the first 5 years of this uh 10-year chart so guys here's the eight pillars on celsius 4x four checks 1.25 billion increase in revenue let a 200 million in profit and 165 million in free cash flow now remember i'm ignoring the fiveyear numbers because of how much they've grown it's so skewed that way you can't possibly hold them accountable for this shares outstanding 4% increase not terrible i prefer to see nothing but it's a fast growing business i don't blame them for issuing shares that may be expensive and a low roic which doesn't bother me so much because you look at the one year and you have 15% remember the fiveyear numbers this five-year rc is based on five-year free cash flow it's insanely low so i'm not worried about that at all now because celsius is now the third biggest player in the us energy drink game now the world as we've seen is getting healthier in fact i think this year was the first year that the us had a decrease in the amount of obesity celsius is right there leading that char charge with zero sugar as of q3 2024 this brand is absolutely crushing it making up 16% that's one in six of all energy drink sales growth globally now red bull and monster they're still top do top dogs no doubt about that and monsters has been one of the best companies in the world when it comes to stock price but since 2022 celsius has been blowing past both them in terms of volume growth you could say that celsius is the underdog that suddenly got everyone talking and they not stopping anytime soon 2024 has been huge adding six new countries to their distribution list celsius is officially global guys but here's the kicker despite this insane growth and killer numbers their stock has taken that dive down 73% from its high of $99 if you're thinking longterm the question is is this just a temporary crash in the roller coaster ride of this brand's future remember this is a company that's down 70% but let's look at their quarterly revenue 265 versus 384 oops that's not good 401 versus 325 maybe the fundamentals are getting worse this is a big drop in revenue from third quarter 2023 to third quarter 2024 remember our goal here is to buy companies that fundamentals are getting better as the stock price falls but here we see a big drop in revenue so guys the question is why did this happen well they came out and said that pepsi overstocked their inventory that could be the case that very well could be the case but is it an overstocking because they just bought too much or is it overstocking because demand really faltered so for me yes the stock is down a lot the question is are they going to rebound here back to new highs because look in june of 2024 402 versus 325 that's a huge increase that's a 25% increase actually 20% to 25% increase in revenue to suddenly have a big drop the next quarter maybe remember guys these drinks are very fickle on people who love them and you see them all over the place it's a very easy business to get into it's not exactly hard for that one so you want to be careful and also the next time you see companies like this flying high remember how quick it can change they have announced that the sales to pepsi is down almost $120 million year-over year again they claim it's an overstocking thing that tells me they're claiming it is temporary it'll be really important to see if that's the cas to decide if they're an honorable company that's going to be honest with their investors that's very important so what are analyst estimates on this company well analysts are enthused a dollar per share here going to 274 here in the next four years big time growth 170% revenue growth 20% 18% 19% 35% 8 and a half% they have revenue over about doubling in the next four years so analysts are still pretty positive about this so it' be really interesting to see what happens with that pepsi overstocking issue now obviously back to stock analyzer to figure out what's the right price to pay because now we have to sit there and figure out okay we're i'm going to make these assumptions based on them being honest about their pepsi temporary issue i'm going to make that assumption there okay so i did 48 and 12% revenue growth considerably lower than their history all right profit margin i did 1520 and 25% i started at 15 went to 20 might be a little high guys might be a little high because they've not really done 20% but they have increasing the profit margins so actually you know what i'm going to be a little more conservative here guys i'm going to go with 12 15 and 18% same with free cash flow pe i remember why i did this and the last time i did the stock analysis i was trying to be overly enthused it was back in april the stock was flying high so i think that was the reason why i was sitting there saying like listen be careful here because there's a lot of even i'm overly optimistic it still looks a little risky so for pe it's a i'll do 15 17 and 19 and then for my desired any return 9% across the board guys you got to put your margin of safety in here it's a very easy business to get into a lot of competitors and a lot of fickle consumers out there who will change brands very quickly now before i get into the numbers of that you may have noticed i'm sure you look at the stock analyzer tool look our community and think to yourself gez that would really help me a lot in analysis and it absolutely does but if you go to our everything money.com website you'll see that we have a waiting list there and the reason being is

click on the link in the description below to get access to everything we have to offer including all of our investment tools and the community and i'm willing to bet it'll be the best decision you've made all year so let's hit the analyze button here the stock's currently at 30 bucks a share so i see a low price of 12 high price of 37 middle price of 21 guys the stock is down 73% it's a lot and it's wonderful for me it's not such an obvious screaming deal where i have to sit there and go i got to jump on this yes it's 73% % drop is awesome but it just goes to show you how overpriced it was at 100 stock number three a highly highly volatile stock super micro computer this thing has been all over the board guys look at this all-time high very close to our march 4 14th date march 8th 2024 of $123 the low was two days ago of 20 bucks guys that is an 86% drop in 250 days and this is a stock that i'm sure that if i was covering it back then people would said look how stupid you are paul you don't get it maybe so but what's happened lately ernston young one of the biggest accounting firms in the world one of the most reputable said we're out we're going to stop auditing these guys because these guys are unethical all right so what's the deal with the company is it possible they clean things up yeah but the question is who are the people going to clean it up guys this is this super micr computer story is a wild ride the company's absolutely been crushing it in quotes over the past decade you know back in 2014 they were bringing in about 1.5 billion in revenue fast forward to today and they're bringing in 11.8 billion in revenue earnings went from 54 million in 2014 to over $1 billion in the last 12 months a 20x growth in the last 10 years on their profit and get this super micro stock went from just one .70 a share on january 1st 2014 to that peak of 123 back in march of 2024 but it gets even crazier in the q4 of 2024 the company posted a jaw-dropping 143% revenue growth year-over-year for the full year they've already seen a 110% revenue boost that's some serious rocket fuel guys for their business they're powering everything from cloud infrastructure to data centers and they are absolutely riding this massive wave of ai growth but remember this is exactly what happens whenever there's some big market all the ancillary people around it will surge with it they've been in the right place at the right time so what's that problem it started with those auditors at ernston young they bailed on them due to some serious disagreements over how super micro was handling their books then back in august hindenberg research the big short selling research company dropped a bombshell with a report accusing the company of accounting fraud and hindenberg is not a company that comes out there and just says it just to be dicks they say it because they do a lot of research and here's where things get even more messy this is not super micro's first time getting in hot water back in 2018 they were nearly kicked off the nasdaq for failing to file financial statements guys why is that why would a company fail to file financial statements their cfo should be in there guys i have eight businesses upstairs i have 30 bank accounts for these businesses and guess what we reconcile every single day yes it's not the same as multi-billion dollar company and a lot of people like my accountants think i'm crazy for reconciling every single day but the reason is the second or quarter is not done i want six or seven days and our numbers are done yes it's different for a big company but to fail to file financial statements go look at when was last time that happened with other major companies then in 2020 guys the sec came knocking after it was discovered that super micro had artificially inflated their earnings by about $200 million let's put that in perspective in 2020 they did 3.34 billion $200 million extra in earnings look what they a look they end up reporting 84 million that was the adjusted number so they' reported over $2 million extra the company settled for 20 million but here's the kicker three months later they went and rehired the same executives who've been at the heart of the fraud that's a bad look that's where i get concerned a company can change but you got to change with new people so while super micros future appears to be bright with ai booming and their tech in high demand the shadow of past mistakes and the current accounting drama means this roller coaster is probably far from over you need to stay tuned on this one now are you the kind of person who sits there and says no risk or reward i don't know but until they completely make over their entire executive team even people who probably are innocent to this you got to start from scratch to show wall street you're really serious about change so i wonder what these analyst estimates are if they've been updated guys super micro still have this eps issue so guys right now is where i'd sit there and go let's put it in stock analyzer but we have verifiable reason not to trust the numbers so i think for myself i'm just a pass on this one and i'm okay if the stock ends up going to 500 because they figure out their accounting issues i'd rather wait for the right company that i trust so guys if you want to watch the next video on top under valued stocks

2024-11-13,eT9Ug0sG0lI,kind: captions language: en i kicked off my nike stock journey this year when nike fell below $80 per share and as it's gone lower i've continued to add more shares if you're new to this channel you might not know that nike is one of the five stocks that i was really really hoping to grab this year once the price was right well guess what i'm pumped because not only is nike selling for under 80 bucks a share but i get to load up even more as it falls further so allow me to share with you why i'm so hyped about buying more nike so guys nike hit an all-time high about 3 years ago of 179 per share and you look back at videos i'm sure we made back then i'm sure people would have never thought nike would fall this much but that's what happens it hit a low in august three months ago of $70 per share so in about in less than three years it had fallen well over 50% that's a huge drop but here's what's interesting the last 12 months free cash flow was 7.2 billion the last 5 years it was 4.7 billion on average so look how much higher the free cash flow in the last revenue free cash flow is up free cash flow significantly higher than last five years and the other thing i love is free cash flow last year was greater than net income and it's about even for free cash flow now versus free cash flow the last 5 years versus last five years of net income we've got great gross margins of 45% and increasing because one of the things you're going to hear me talk about later is nikes focus on making high higher margin products and making more money on them with very consistent profit margin guys look at that basically 10.6% across the board now you've got a price to free cash flow of 16 guys that's pretty low for a companies i look at the saying okay if i think this free cash flow number of 7.2 billion is the new plateau it's selling for 16 times free cash flow on a brand like nike on a moat like nike now some people might sit there and say well wait a second is nike ote well yeah for a couple reasons if i asked 100 people what's the best sports apparel brand how many would say nike probably a lot of them the other thing is we always look at return invested capital to show us that there's a moe this is the metric that says does this company get a lot of return on the money they invest in their business 20% is a lot and they get that in the last 5 years it's been 19% so what are the eight pillars telling us about nike well i'll tell you right now it has x's on the 5-year pe and 5year price of free cash flow but the question i have to ask you is are these really x's what premium would you pay for nike we can all i think everybody watching this video can agree nike is a premium company if you don't believe that please comment below why you don't think it is but my question to you would be is it because of fear of what you've been seeing lately in the news because the stock went from 180 down to 70 because i always say news follows the stock price you very well could be right on your reasons why nike is not a high moote business a premium business but at the end of the day guys there's always going to be good and bad in every company the question is what's the good and what's the bad that really matters now before we go further i want you to remember i own nike stock as i said before you should never buy a company because anybody in the internet anybody on youtube or even warren buffett owns the company we're here to teach a process that you can apply to yourself and to your methods of understanding companies because even though i might disagree with people in our community here on their investments we all think in the same kind of way so if you have a certain edge in a company those are the companies you need to apply the same process to now nike stock is down about 60% from that peak in 2021 now what's behind that drop well a lot of things we've got a nasty recession in china and by the way keep in mind nasty recession in china still involves growth just not as much growth obviously we have some geopolitical things going on and fears of a us recession but those fears have been going on for quite a while and it seems like our government's pretty set on just printing a lot of money to avoid a recession and not only that what's been going on with retail retail has been absolutely slaughtered as of lately now you couple that with management coming in and pulling its full year guidance that's not a very typical thing especially for a company like nike so obviously it's understandable to a certain element that the market has gotten a little spook but here's the twist nike has been switching gears to turn things around instead of pushing out a ton of sneakers they're aiming to sell less but at a higher price goes back to our conversation about gross margin if they sell at a higher price they're going to have a higher gross margin if they have a higher gross margin what's going to happen to that bottom line it's going to go up as well they're cutting back inventory for big names like jordan air force one and dunk inventories are all down 50% there so what's the goal with that get those inventories under control and boost the profits seems like a pretty smart move if you ask me now obviously a lot of people think that china is a major headache for nike but what's interesting is when it comes to manufacturing china isn't nearly as critical as we may have thought before vietnam is actually where most of nike's production happens so why does that matter well most important thing is wages in vietnam are way lower than in china so nikes got access to even cheaper labor in vietnam and don't sleep on indonesia either it's also a more affordable manufacturing hub than china we've talked about this over the years china led the world in manufacturing because labor cost were so low but just like the us as labor costs go higher and higher and higher it becomes less economical to be manufacturing in china and we have to find other spots here's the big picture nike is still the number one sports brand in china and the world and the number of people getting the sports even in china is growing immensely that's a huge tailwind with a country that has one .5 billion people and that could push nike sales up over time now you might be thinking yeah but paul last year they declined in population very true but you still have to look at the per capita gdp growth that china has with their growth potential and gdp even with this minorly declining population growth they can still crush it and be a very very good market for these brands so that alone gives nike a very solid game plan to bounce back so considering all that let's see what analysts think about nike's profit potential they estimate 377 this past year going to 636 in 2029 so pretty decent growth a little volatile here 377 315 362 394 and jumping so it's fle there but let me ask you a question think about nike from a long-term perspective do you think nike will be around for the next 10 or 20 years if you're like me your answer is yes now in those next 10 or 20 years years do you think their revenue and profit will be higher or lower than today now you might sit there and say well yeah but nike but this is my thesis whenever i buy a lot of companies as a group will they be around and if they're going to be around will they make more money 20 or 30 years from now than they do today that's the way i think about things now what about revenue a little bit choppy again on revenue but again growing from 52 billion to 67 billion by 2029 so again these are analysts and they're have their own bias like you and i do but but it just goes to show that even analysts aren't that negative on the company quite yet but of course guys this is all great and dandy but we have to be able to put this together the story and the numbers the story by itself is a fairy tale the numbers by themselves is an excel sheet and story does matter immensely with companies now the story if you think it's negative on nike i ask you how much of it has to do with recent stock price events because remember the way you make money in investing is thinking a little bit different than everybody else and if people are negative on a company it is going to drive the stock price down the question is is the negativity appropriate for that company so that's why the next step is our stock analyzer tool i use this tool to sit here and make a determination on what the price i should pay for the company is today because it allows me to put my revenue growth my profit margins my multiples and my desired return in here but even better i can do low middle and high ones cuz we don't know the future the future is unknown and we're humans and make mistakes that's why we need to put low middle and high assumptions here and for a desire return put in something for yourself when you get this that gives you a margin of safety so the last time i did nike let's see what my assumptions were because i want to see how i feel about them today i put in three five and 7% revenue growth for the next 10 years okay doesn't seem anything insane maybe it's a little low maybe it's a little high that's the point you're allowed to sit there and make your own assumptions if you have access to it now profit margin i did do 10 11 and 12% i pushed profits a little bit higher because of their gross margin probably going higher and then for pe guys i think this a premium company i put 20 23 and 26 i can understand if you said 18 on the low side i can understand you said 22 on the low side 23 this is the this is the art of investing this is what makes investing tough what is the appropriate multiple for nike 10 years from now and then finally i put in my 9% desired return now keep in mind i do not want nike for only a 9% return this is the market return of n9 or 10% this is to tell me paul this is your intrinsic value from there give it your margin of safety because if you're going to buy an individual stock make sure you have margin of safety or else why not just buy the stock market in general now guys if you have the software right now share with me what the assumptions you did make cuz i'm really interested to hear people's assumptions and if you don't have the software but you've been to the

2024-11-16,x9no7nt0qXg,"kind: captions language: en warren buffett's pulling a major move and it's raising some serious eyebrows in the investing world the oracle of omaha has been quietly unloading stocks and piling up cash to the tune of a jaw-dropping $341 billion dollar sitting in treasury bills that's right that's cash and if you've been paying attention to his annual letters they're starting to feel lighter and less revealing so what's going on here buffett's no stranger to caution as we all know he's done this before building up massive cash reserves when he senses the markets are getting overheated i don't know if you know this but if you remember in 1969 he actually shut down his highly successful partnership because he thought the market was too frothy and guys the market wasn't anywhere close to his overvalued back then as it is today now fast forward to today and a lot of investors are getting really nervous could buffett be anticipating a massive market crash is this the calm before the storm now we couldn't resist diving deep in his portfolio trying to figure out what the oracle of omaha may know that the rest of us might be missing buffett's 13 f filing just came out and here's what it reports and for those you don't know 13f is whenever a fund is out there with over a certain number i think it's $100 million they have to report their quarterly filings after the quarter is over here's what he's done he's bought about 1.3 million shares of dominos which is a new position 400,000 shares of pool corp also a new position a poultry 5,000 shares of hio but most impressive are his cells 100 million shares of apple that was 25% of his position over 700,000 shares of capital one which is about 7% of his position 20.7 million shares of new holdings which is about 20% of his position charter communications a million shares about 26% of his pos position and ulta beauty 96% of his position that he just entered recently this year over 665,000 shares exited he fully exited floren deccor which is one of charlie's favorite companies one in which charlie called this costco 2.0 in an interview with the acquired podcast charlie munger called floren decor a wonderful business implementing the same playbook as costco and even referred to it as i said as costco 2.0 yet buffett's people or him have sold it guys the thing no one's going to tell you about buff and his portfolio is they're going to quote old buffett and then not sit there and look at his actions today about getting in and out you might you might sit there and say well paul even you said it's not him doing anymore exactly he has so much money that he finds people who are good at managing money and whether they get in and out does not matter to him which is very inconsistent from what he said in the past but i still think his words and advice will apply great to you about the future do less don't jump in and out you'll probably do well no one's going to to tell you that about buffett i'm here to tell you that as i've said before guys warren buffett and charlie munger always said their goal is to buy companies to holding forever and he has said many times before that he's not the only one picking stocks he gives certain people at the company the ability to buy and sell stocks but don't think for a second they're buying and selling with the same kind of philosophy that buffett has in fact even buffett himself has not been acting in the way he always says he was very big on apple and let's go back to the beginning of this year this is q1 apple reduced 116 million shares just in the first quarter not done then second quarter reduced by 50% to d sold 390 million shares and now the most recent quarter apple reduced 25% 100 million shares on the nose guys this is a company where he was spending a lot of time he talked about how hey if you had to pick between your car and your phone to have that not have one of those next year i think most people would pick the car a phone they can do everything with and he was so big on apple and yet they're selling now is it because stocks are so high maybe but that goes against his entire idea of getting in and out of stocks and apple i do believe is a company that warren buffett himself was very active in buying and selling it was his decision to do that and it's not like they need the cash so it's not like he had to go sell apple to go buy some other companies he was flush with c cash $340 billion worth he does doesn't need the cash to go buy other companies with 340 billion he could literally pay cash for how many companies in the s&amp;p look at ulta beauty this is a company that i own and again don't buy anything because i own it or buffett owns it or anybody in the internet owns it by the third quarter buffets down reduces position by 96% on ulta beauty which by the way was on top of he him just buying ulta the quarter before he went from buying to selling 96% of his position in a matter of one quarter why i have to ask the question do they do it thinking themselves we're going to get a pop we can sell after it gets a pop and and make our money i don't know because it went from 320 all the way to 370 380 pretty much overnight after that happened the big key on these is we don't know who's making these purchase decisions look at liberty serus they increase their position here and then most recent quarter bye-bye full thing see you later so much for buying things forever and you might sit there and say well paul value i get it but they're very big on look ater he wanted to own costco for the he said i will never sell costco i give him credit his companies out there never sold costco he had it until he died and they probably still have it today bank of america one of his biggest positions he's been unloading at last quarter he sold 8.7 75% of his entire company's positions out of um bank of america reducing 23% of their portfolio the previous quarter nothing nothing at all previous quarter nothing and it got a lot of attention when he started selling bank of america stock because this is a company that he backed for a very very long time and he understands banks now how does 2010 birkshire hathway differ from 2024 birkshire hathway back in 2010 they had $73 billion in cash on their balance sheet now 340 billion revenue of 136 billion back then now 37 billion earnings of 13.5 billion versus a 106 billion but i want you to keep in mind the 106 billion now factors in the growth of stock that they have to report as earnings which is a little misleading and buffett ander have many times said they do not agree with that and i absolutely agree with them what that means is if they buy a stock at $10 per share and it goes to 15 even if they don't sell it they got to report this $5 per share as income and if it goes to $5 per share they got to report this as a loss it is not accurate and it's not good that's why i think for a company like burkshire focusing on the free cash flow is very important so what do they do with that cash they bought back about 200,000 shares decreasing the number of owners out there and increasing the per share ownership for everybody else so obviously everybody's question is what does buffett do when the market's overvalued he's no stranger to caution as i said before he's done this many times before he's built up massive cash reserves when he senses the markets are getting overheated 1969 shut down his highly successful partnership now he has said he wanted to do it to protect his performance record which i think is a little shady that's okay he still did it but now that he's head of a major corporation that's publicly traded he can't dist distribute the money he just sits on cash and says hey i'm fine waiting and remember there's a lot of things going on the internet when kathy woods etf was crushing buffets go look at it now as can tell for a while kathy wood was crushing birkshire hathway but as we always say in the short run stocks are a voting machine in the long run they're a weighing machine and buffit has actually absolutely smoked her as of late so guys let's pull up the top two purchases they put domino's pizza and pool corp i've done pool corp in the past here's domino's pizza up 58% in the last five years guys look at this 39% in the last 10 years this is a company and what's interesting is a ne return on invested capital yet they like it pays a dividend 1.2% their net free cash flow versus net income is about the same the fiveyear is pretty much the same 40% gross margins 11 or 12% bottom line margins mostly off of franchise fees etc so let's go do our quick stock analysis and let's see if i've done it in the past because i don't really remember if i have i've done it one time back in 2022 so guys i did a 10-year analysis i did two four and 6% revenue growth nothing crazy but again it's not going to be some major growth potential here profit margin and free cash fl did 10 11 and 12% now my pe in 10 years i put 13 16 and 19 a dominant pizza company probably deserves some sort of premium how much of a premium i don't really know and of course i did my 9% desired return which has zero margin of safety in there i put in 9% for our videos to say here's what i perceived the intrinsic value to be but if you're buying your own stocks you need to put a higher return than 9% because you need a margin of safety in there because we don't know the future and we're humans and make mistakes and if you're going to invest and to get n9 or 10% just buy a lowcost etf so to buy an individual company you need a higher return hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 444 i have a low price of 176 high price of 355 middle price of 250 guys way too expensive for me but who knows what they see in it let's see if they they bought it last quarter yeah i don't know i really don't get the play here i really don't now let's pull up pool corp this is an interesting company now higher returns on capital eight 21% the last 5 years 19% last year all-time high of 582 back in november of 21 52 we low of 293 free cash flow and net income pretty similar a little bit lagging on the five-year part but not terrible pays out a 1.3% dividend which they can easily afford so let's go to our analysis here in our stock analyzer tool so guys here are my assumptions 35 and 7% revenue growth 791 11% profit margin and free cash flow margin i did a pe because of their great roic of 14 17 and 20 and again our 9% desired return hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 364 we have a low price of 144 high price of 380 middle price of 240 again i don't know what they see i don't know if they really buy based on intrinsic value anymore for some of the guys there i wonder how much it has to do with market movements i have to assume that based on what i see on their ins and out now guys this is why i love using the stock analyzer tool because it allows me to sit there and make these assumptions about the future make the assumptions that i think are going to happen and it gives me a low middle and high estimate of value now warren buff in the past probably uses some sort of idea of a model back in the day whether it was this or some sort of balance sheet model depending on his investment ideas now for our users who've used this almost a million times every year it's essential because it allows you to give you some framework of where to go in order to determine what price to pay for a company because every investment is the present value of all future cash flow we don't know the future so we have to make assumptions today about that future and i make low middle and high assumptions now our users love this service so if you've been to our website to get on this you'll notice that we have a weit list on our site today's software includes everything we have to offer for stocks retirement and real estate all of these tools and growing but behind the scenes we're making changes so this offer is going to go away real soon now i don't know if you remember from back in the day if you're not if you're not new to the channel been around for a while i built this software for myself but we kept getting requests on the youtube comments how do i get your software how do you get your software so we decided to finally just sit there and say let's just make it for everybody and it was a massive success i use this software my team uses this software every single day but as we grow it's less about me and more about how i can better serve you this is why we update our software to give you exactly what you need just today the st louis fed series came out here we're going to be adding more and more economic data this software will be the go-to resource for everything having to do with any sort of research here in the future all economic data real estate we are making it an absolutely essential part of your life in order to understand the economy and investing the good news is these changes haven't been made yet so if you join today you will get all of these as part of one package you don't have to sit there and worry about what's going to happen in the future you get it today and you'll get it forever i'm telling you this now because there is still time for you to sign up to get everything we make here as long as you join this community before we make the changes you're going to keep this plan as well as you're going to stay in the pricing tier forever so click on the link in the description below to get access to everything we have to offer including our investment tools and the community i'm very confident it'll be the best investing decision that you've made all year now guys buffett runs a massive company and he's getting close to the end of his days as we saw with munger about a year ago this is not something to be criticized and i think that their diverse group of companies as well as holdings will probably do well in the future but you got to remember as they get bigger it's going to be harder and harder for them to outperform and over time as the company gets bigger and bigger they're probably going to be less informative and less open book but everything they do because it would just take too much time i've read every annual report that buffets had going back to 1955 and early on he was very thorough because he had limited number of investments as time went on he started to break down different categories of investments and as time goes even further and as he passes this is going to change even more for example he used to give his acquisition criteria not so much anymore top holdings were worth worth over 1 billion or more not so much anymore because they're so big list of fully owned businesses not so much anymore so guys i think warren buffett and charlie munger's words are things you need to learn from but again like i repeat over and over don't just make investment decisions because somebody on the internet says it or warren buffett has it or anything like that we're here to teach a process learn the process from buffett and merer learn the process from people you respect and apply that to the things you know and understand that work for you now guys we did a video recently where we looked at his cash position comparing it back to 2000 to see if warren buffett was predicting a crash like the 07 crash so check it out in this next video thank you for your

the second stock has $30 billion in cash and skyrocketing revenue and the third stock has 40 million loyalty members now the best part is they all seem to be undervalued guys the first stock we're going to talk about right now is paypal own it but don't buy a stack just cuz i or anybody else on the internet or even warren buffett owns it we're here to teach a process let's get into it big fall from grace over 80% drop but fundamentals getting better this is what's important when you look at companies what's the story on paypal paypal is the king of online payment processing if you're making a purchase online chances are you've used it now here's the big mindblower paypal's been making some serious cash earning an average of a18 per transaction per transaction and guess what since 2018 their total payment volume has been growing 21.5% compounded annually which adds up to a total of 164% increase now when i hear people talk about paypal is dead i look at that and think yeah they're just talking about the stock price they're not talking about the business and the growth is not slowing down anytime soon as transaction volume rises so will the money that paypal pulls in each transaction and get this half of paypal's users are in the sweet spot of 18 to 39 years old so you might be wondering why is that important paul well this age group is when people typically start spending more in their lifetime which means more money for paypal in the years to come so yeah paypal is not just dominating today it's positioning itself for massive growth in the future and if you're not watching them i truly believe you're missing out on a company with a lot of potential but of course it's all about implementation we can't just assume because the story is great that they're going to implement great they have a new ceo that came on last year and so far things have been getting better but of course they also have venmo which is a huge app for people making payments to each other and that is incredible so guys some of the other things i love about paypal free cash flow last year 7 billion last 5e average is 5 billion and look at their net income significantly lower for those of you who are new to this channel we love when free cash flows greater than net income we love this so to me i look at this profit margin of 14% i say well their free cash flow margin is much higher and you can see it right here their pe is 19 their price of free cash flows 12 and guys that's after skyrocketing from that low of the low 50s they're now at $82 a share let's check out the eight pillars and see what story this tells us guys this would be an eight pillar thriller if it wasn't for this pe and again i'm not worried about the pe because of the fact that their free cash flow is much greater than their pe than their earnings net income along the way these are the things i want to see and a growing return on invested capital so i'm looking at saying okay are there issues yes the number of active accounts had decreased in the last two quarters but the amount the transactions per account had skyrocketed so yes you had less accounts but the people who already had accounts were using it more that's a really good benefit to the company so what do analysts think about paypal well it's not as rosy as your uncle paul makes it out to be according to analysts they expect $4.50 in earnings this year going to $7 again earnings is net income not free cash flow that's a big difference but some solid growth here revenue wise 7 to 10% 7.8 7.8 7 and a half 8 10.6 again these are analysts i look at this saying their gross margin is like 50% how are they growing revenue this much and not growing earnings per share in free cash flow by at least that much that's what confuses me so makes me wonder about this thing so we have all this information what do we do with it now now we put in our stock analyzer tool and remember guys the stock analyzer tool is our final step before we decide if we spend more time on a company or not now i'm not saying to beat yourself down and go do a ton of stocks and go analyze like crazy and all that stuff but the stock analyzer tool is so great great because we know that every investment is the present value of all the future cash flow we're going to get if you paid $10 to something today and you get $2 a year for the rest of your life that's a pretty good return there's going to be a certain return there that's what we're trying to do here but because the future is unknown because humans make mistakes we need to make different assumption levels low middle and high i love using this now it's going to give you a very wide range of of values but that's the point we want to buy when it's a great quality company that's selling at a good price based on our assumptions so i did four seven and 10% revenue growth for the next 10 years i did 12 and a half 14 and a half and 16 a half% profit margin but remember i'm more focused on free cash flow i did 16 20 and 24 and this could end up being too low but we'll see now for pe and price of free cash flow i look at this increasing roic this means as time goes on this company is getting better at managing the money and getting a return on the money that's in the business that's a good thing that's a great thing and it deserves some sort of premium so i did 14 17 and 20 for both my low middle and high pees and price of free cash flow and finally my 9% return guys that's the market return i put it in there to figure out my intrinsic value for the business but i need a margin of safety so i recommend putting a higher number in here of higher than 9% because the higher your return the lower the price and that's your margin of safety but that's going to depend on you you might know paypal way better than i know it or way better than somebody else in the community that's why when we see people in the community sharing these screenshots it'll be people saying well i think you should go higher because of this or lower because of this different people have different circles of confidence and that's what's important so we hit the analyze button the stock's currently 82 bucks a share we have a low price of 60 to 80 high price of 160 to 230 middle price of1 to $140 per share based on today's price if my middle assumptions are correct i'm going to get about a 16% return on my money based on free cash flow i like that now if i could find 30 companies that had this kind of return potential some will do better some will do worse a lot will do somewhere around there and i'd be very happy with that return stock number two alibaba another stock that i own that you don't want to mimic especially with china and the fear around china $320 all-time high back in 2020 hit a low in the last 12 months of 67 bucks it got as low as 58 in the recent drop over here i look at a company like this that's getting beaten up and i look at their income and i just look at increase in revenue 52 71 100 120 121 132 last 12 months 132 their net income is a lot lower than their free cash flow free cash flow average in the last five years of 20 billion net income of 15 14.5 billion 19 billion of free cash from the last last year versus 10 billion in net income guys they're also buying back a ton of shares i used to be critical of china and worried about the authenticity of the results but look at the saying if these guys are scamming why would they report a higher free cash flow than net income on top of that they're buying back a ton of shares again why do that then i hear people talk about adrs paul you don't really own the company because great that's always been the case for china to me that was just proof that people because i started hear that complaint right about there because people were following giving any reason why the stock price could be lower now i personally called marl lynch i said guys if alib baba gets delisted in the us what happens they said well your shares will be converted to hong kong and if you ever liquidated it just might take a little bit of time to get your money i said that's it i don't lose the shares no you don't lose the shares now that's marl lynch when i spoke to them most spoke to charles schwab these could all be different things here but it's it's something to very much understand before you make it decision based on it now let's look at the eight pillars for this company all right five checks three x's net income growth we already talked about net income not being great i don't like this free cash flow drop on 56 billion in revenue so don't get me wrong this does kind of concern me right here from this standpoint i'm looking at going man they increased their revenue 56 billion and their free cash flow dropped two billion from it now let's go back and see in their cash flow statement did they did they increase increas their capital expenditures well not really 4.2 billion in 2018 4.6 last year 4.8 the year before that 7.56 so you look at this going okay they've been pretty good about their about their it's not like they had some big jump like amazon amazon has these massive jumps in capital expenditures as they reinvest back in the business now the story on alibaba earnings have shot up from 3.3 billion to 9.7 billion however revenue has absolutely exploded from 10.6 billion to 130 billion and as we saw in our cash flow statement 4.7 billion to $21 billion that's a 4x of their free cash flow yet the stock is only up from $72 to 100 bucks right now now here's the kicker alibaba has $30 billion in cash with a market cap of 220 billion and guess what they've been ramping up their stop buybacks like crazy which means they're buying back their own shares as i said earlier a wrong sign that they believe the stock is undervalued now of course we see stock buybacks on companies at very high levels but go look at when alibaba started their buybacks it wasn't until their stock plumed but it gets even juicier the reality is that the current price of alibaba stock has very little to do with the company's economics it's more about that geopolitical noise that's got investors spooked look at all the china companies out there they've all been pummeled but guys let's talk about china there's obviously a lot of chatter about an economic slowdown but guess what president x seems to be following jerome powell's playbook and cranking up the stimulus no different than we're doing here we're also discussing a country where the average person makes 12 or $4,000 a year while in the states we're making 70 to 80,000 a year there's a lot of growth potential there we're talking about mortgage rate cuts for more affordable housing and a$ 42 billion doll investment into their housing projects over there they're not sitting idle while the things slow down remember a chinese recession doesn't mean a contraction it just means a much slower growth rate now for d listing as i said earlier the fear is there in 2022 the us and china came to an agreement that allows for audits of chinese companies that was a big issue before now this means that over 200 chinese stocks including alibaba can keep trading in the nysc now the organization that looks over all the auditing the us pca is on track to continue those inspections through 2025 so again is there a delisting worry i'm sure there is the question is has it been factored in too much in the stock price the bottom line is alibaba is crushing it as a business china is set to add 80 million new middle class consumers between now and 20130 and that's a ton of potential look at it this way the fastest growing middle class in the world the us is 70% gdp is consumer spending once we get there with china how big will china be and this underperformance in the stock price again it's perceptions there probably is a lot of reality to those perceptions but the question is is it factored in already into too much the real question is do you want to let all this noise distract you from a potential multibagger that could be coming as the china story unfolds and gets better that's the question have to ask again i'm not telling you that you need to go buy alibaba and if you are scared of death of china please stay away from it but you've got to remember that the potential reality versus the price of the stock probably isn't in line and we have to sit there and realize that even if there's a one out of 10 chance that you're right but if it's going to pay out 20 to one i don't know if that's the case here but if it's going to pay out a huge number you got to think about that now let's go look at analysts and what they think about everything very little growth 890 a share to 922 per share blows my mind again but again in order for a stock to be down a lot there has to be some sort of perception that things are worse than they actually are now for revenue interestingly enough 8% 7% 8 and a half 7 and a half seven 3% growth yes it is not very fast and this is all the more reason why when stocks are growing fast because their revenue is fast remember that it doesn't take much for that revenue growth to plummet i look at this saying is this dying 134 billion 185 billion hardly so and that's why i sit there and and have to understand that the stock analyzer tool is so important for that exact reason let's go pull it up in stock analyzer tool and look at my assumptions here before we get all b out of shape about what's going on with alibaba so guys i did really reasonable assumptions 3 six and 9% revenue growth nothing huge it's actually lower on the middle scale than the analysts even have profit margin i did 12 15 and 18% free cash flow i did 15 18 and 21 and look at this in the last 10 years their free cash flow has been about 21% but they're spending a lot more money now than they did back then on on their cloud systems their capital improvements etc pe i did 16 18 and 20 now this one i could understand if somebody said well paul i got to go lower or make your desired return your margin of safety much higher and i did 9% there now guys this is why our software in our community is so important it's about getting in there we have a china chat in our community right here a chat specifically related to china that people have a conversation in so you've gone to try sign up i'm sure you've noticed that there's a weit list on everything money.com and the reason for that is today's software includes everything that we have to offer all these tools for retirement stocks and real estate but behind the scenes we're making changes that offer is going to go away very soon now if you've been part of our channel since the beginning you'll remember i built this software on an excel sheet selfishly for myself so that my team and i could use it to continually help make better investment decisions for myself for stocks and real estate but as we've grown it's less about me and more about how i can better serve you and the other community members and this is why we do constant updates to our software we want to make sure we're giving you exactly what you need now the good news is these changes are still being worked on we're trying to fine-tune more and more so if you join today you'll be grandfathered in for life with all of these tools everything here and it's in all likelihood it's the best deal that we have offered and maybe we even will offer in the future and i'm telling this now because there's still time for you to sign up as long as you join the everything money community before we make these changes you can keep your plan even after we make these you'll keep all of these tools you'll be grandfathered them for life and you'll be locked into your pricing tier forever so click on the link in the description below or go to everything money.com signup and get access to everything we have to offer it'll probably be the best decision you've made all year now for the stock analyzer we hit the analyze button this is why this company's interesting low price of 100 to 130 high price of 280 to 330 middle price of 175 to 200 again guys based on my middle assumptions i have a 20% cash flow return based on those middle assumptions i don't know if it's going to happen or not but i like the potential juice coming out of that squeeze that's what's more important for me and if i could find 30 companies like this i would probably do pretty well final stock another stock that i own and again don't own it because i do ulta beauty ulta is incredible warren buffett recently bought it or at least birkshire halfway did i don't know if it was warren buffett directly and it skyrocketed from 320 all the way to like 370 or so 52 alltime high of 575 was earlier this year just eight months ago 575 52 we low of 318 then it was announced that buffett and burkshire bought some it skyrocketed immediately guys this is an $8.5 billion doll market cap ta business with 21.5 billion enterprise value that $3 billion difference is essentially their debt but guys look at this they have a billion dollars in free cash flow last year they have 900 million 890 million in fiveyear free cash flow they can easily afford this debt and it's retail that's the incredible part now let's go to the uh eight pillars to see what story this is telling us eight pillar thriller remember guys you don't buy a company just because it has all eight pillars and you don't avoid a company because it has more more x's than you'd like but it tells a story here what's the story here they get a great return on money invested in the business high return invested capital buying back shares hopefully intelligently it might seem that way growing revenue five billion led to $500 million in free cash flow growth and reasonable prices of their fiveyear pe and five-year price of free cash flow i love gross margin 39% profit margin consistently in a 10% range so guys i'm looking at this saying doesn't doesn't feel like retail even though it's retail it's not struggling so what's that story guys i would consider ulta beauty the undisputed heavyweight of the beauty world in the us and they're absolutely smoking it they have 600 brands and 25,000 products under their roof ulta is a onestop shop for all things beauty and it doesn't just stop there they have over 1,400 stores nationwide they've got a presence in every single state that is called reach guys they're out there but with every single state only 1,400 stores i love that they're smart about their growth now here's where it gets absolutely insane like i said in our intro they have 40 million loyalty members they have 40 million people that are already hooked to their brand and the numbers don't lie since 2013 ulta's earnings per share has been growing at 24% compounded annual growth rate and they're bringing in a solid $10 billion in revenue and even more impressive 20% of that two billion of that comes straight from online sales which is a massive win in the world of retail right now now big reason for ulta success is their constant reinvestment in their brand in the last three years alone they've added up whopping 955 new brands their lineup and increased spending on these brands by 35% and the beauty market it's on fire with a runway for insane growth that shows no signs of slowing down guys the vast majority of our viewers are men so for the men out there how many of your spouses girlfriends wives friends who are female go to ulta beauty ask them next time and for the women out there how often you go to ulta beauty every time i see an ulta i just walk in and see what's going on there i love how clean it is i love how nice it is the women in there are very nice i love the whole experience and i think ulta is actually set up to keep compounding for a very long time add to that they're top tier brands that rang among the most used and most loved in america and you've got a company that's in prime position to dominate for years to come even in a tough retail environment i truly believe that if you don't look at ulta you're missing out now you might see something i don't see any of the community by all means mentioned it to d and mention it to myself because i want to hear what your viewpoint is so what do analysts think about ulta they might be wrong $26 earnings per share going to $42 per share 11% even 10% 10% 17% 13 % all across the board but it's pretty clear they think eps is growing nicely revenue growth nothing sexy 12% 3% 6% 6% 7% 6% that's pretty solid though you're going to get growth from inflation and you're going to get growth from new store sales so let's break this thing down in our stock analyzer tool and see what ulta looks like from that perspective so guys i did my 10-year analysis 3 five and 7% and one thing to point out roic in the last 10 years is 20% last 5 years 22.3 last year 28 they're getting better and making money that's invested in the business monger will always say if you can find a company like this even if it sells for a major discount to the multiples in the future you're probably g to get a pretty good return on your money and that's my bet on ulta profit margin i did nine and a half 10 and a quarter 11 free cash flow margin i did the exact same thing even though their free cash flows trailed their net income a little bit pe 15 18 and 21 i went a little bit lower because of the fact that they're retail and some could argue put in the right pe and then put a higher desired return that probably is a smarter move but again i'm doing my 9% desired return to match the market guys after this if you want to see my stocks at a 52 we low video make sure you watch it but here are the numbers on ulta hit the analyze button i have a low price of 346 high price of 670 middle price a 484 and today's price yields about a 12% return on my money guys see you in the next video stocks to watch at 52 we low thank you for your

2024-11-20,MVjCWeZrqKk,kind: captions language: en super micro computers had failed to report their quarterly earnings back in september and now the company is in danger of being delisted this is a huge problem but not just for that reason the second problem here is they're a big customer nvidia and nvidia is a big customer of theirs and we all know nvidia has been the darling of the stock market for the last year and a half or two years these companies are intertwined and it's going to have an effect on nvidia so let's go take a look at how big a problem this could be for both companies now guys before we get into the details of the d listing this is the company here to date it's only down 3% why because it had a huge surge this year and i'm glad you're watching our channel because if you'd been one of these hypers earlier this year you' have said this company can't miss because news follows the stock priceing and you loved it and then you'd seen this happen guys two auditors have quit this company ernston young was the most recent on saying listen we don't like these books we're out for that to happen for one of the biggest accounting firms in the world to sit there and say we're out after you guys are paying us lots of money that's pretty bad and the nasdaq in order to stay listed has certain requirements they have to have and they fail to meet any of these listing requirements basically earnings were delayed because of the second audit firm quitting in the last 18 months and this would be actually smci second time being delisted now before everybody gets worried smci being delisted does not mean that they'll fail to exist but they would be moved to the otc which is the over-the-counter market which would make funding a lot harder to come by from these wall street blue chippers and make transactions in the stock more expensive back in 2018 they got delisted and it took them two years to come back guys it's harder to come back and if they get delisted again coming back a second time i think would prove to be very challenging but again guys we're trying to separate the news from the stock price and this news could be exaggerated we don't exactly know the department of justice is currently invested in a company and if you remember back in 2018 they were investigated and the sec ended up finding them $20 million was a jop in the bucket so as you can tell guys this company is used to being in hot water and i ask you a question if you were a private investor buying the whole company in full would you want to be part of that i'm not telling you whether to bu the company or not bu the company but these are decisions you have to make because you have to be able to trust the people running the company now guys in the last week look at this company it's up 27% why because they've put a plan in place to try to to stay on the nasdaq before they get delisted and here it is this is the article from barons they have appointed an independent auditor and submitted a plan with the nasdaq to comply with their listing requirements that auditor was bdo usa bdo is a member firm of bdo international now here it's not telling us exactly but they're going to give their annual report for for june 30th and their quarterly report for september 30th in order to get back and stay on the nasdaq and they also said their securities will remain listed pending nasdaq's review of the plan citing the exchange's rule a person familiar with the matter told baron that it should take about two weeks for the nasdaq to review what has been sent over now the reason they've surged this week is they had an extension because sept november 16th was the actual 60-day deadline of when they were supposed to when they received their letter from the nasdaq to sit there and pro provide a response it landed on a saturday so it gave him until yesterday ironically yesterday was the 18th and the stock was up big and after hours today it's up even higher but again it's still significantly lower it hit a low this week of 1725 back on november 15th that's a big drop so another big issue is when a company gets delisted they access to capital is very difficult their largest funding source is cafe bank and they've already changed their covenants on smc's debt and they failed to meet these new covenants they can call their debt that's a huge problem for smci those are the issues these companies have because if smci then has a call in their debt they got to come up with a big check if they can't come with a big check they go into bankruptcy at that point what happens to people buying from in from smci so guys here's a timeline of events for smci 2018 dlisted for failing to file financial statements same year howard hayashima the cfo left and was charged individually by the sec okay then fast forward to august of 2020 charged by the sec for widespread accounting violations related to $200 million in improperly recognized revenues and under reporting expenses same month $7.5 million fine from the sec fast forward a few months in november they rehired the top execs that were involved with the accounting so guys before we even go further on the timeline that's your number one problem if it's not just a matter of even though those people had nothing to do with it you have to share the save the image of the company and part of that is saying guys we're going to walk away from these people people fast forward april of 2024 a lawsuit from a former executive bob longang sues smci claiming that even after the relisting in 2020 they continued to improperly report revenues then in august of 2024 the famous hindenberg report the short report came out talking about all the accounting irregularities and all the problem september of 2024 nasdaq issues their delisting warning to smci giving them a 60-day deadline which would have been november 16th of this year to file a compliance plan now if the plan gets approved this allows for 180-day extension to file its annual reports if the nasdaq rejects the plan mci can then request a hearing which gives them the 15-day delisting suspension period also in 2024 but november elon musk then shift the $6 billion order from sci to dell for its xai again in november 2024 smc's compliance plan buys at time however they still have overdue financials and they're not out of the woods barclays and other major brokers have refused to continue to cover the stock adding to future uncertainty over the company's financials now as of yesterday and today it looks like the plan is might be accepted but it doesn't mean they're out of the woods yet but the stock has surged from a low of $17 to 26 or $27 today because the plan at least allows them to save some time from d listing now up to the partnership with nvidia nvidia counts for 20 to 25% of smc's revenue which is about $2.3 to3 billion now i'm not trying to be a fudster but this assumes smc's revenues are actually real and i'm only saying that because to have two auditing firms quit you have to ask questions like that now smci counts for 10% of nvidia's revenues about 9.6 billion nvidia buys the racks and smc buying their ai products so what does smci do well they make ai cooling racks for data centers basically think about your laptop when you run it for a while the bottom gets hot we've all felt that in fact for you guys out there you're not put put you're not supposed to put on your lap because it might make you infertile now data centers are no different when they're running and doing that much work they will get hot very quickly but smci makes the cooled rack so the data centers can be more efficient and perform better now guys here's what's interesting they're selling for 10 times free cash flow for the last year that's after falling 75% think about that for a second that's after falling 7 %. but again all these numbers you have to ask questions auditors quit twice but the question becomes why haven't people been fired why haven't the entire corporate entity been fired these are the same people that led us and led people to believe that the numbers were what they were let ernston young to believe those things before ernston young quit these are questions you have to ask now let's evaluate nvidia as if they're losing smci so as i said before smci is about $10 billion of nvidia's revenue okay now nidia's revenue of $10 billion you apply a 76% gross margin it's $7.6 billion basically of their bottom line that's a big number guys when the company reported free cash flow of 47 billion in the last 12 months that's 15% of their free cash flow now does that mean the stock is is overpriced of that i don't think so and if you think smci is going to zero the question becomes well then who's going to take up their place if smci goes to zero somebody else is going to probably have to do their business for them which means they're probably still buying from nvidia anyhow now you have to remember nvidia is quite the growth stock right now their current price for free cash flow is 76 76 for a company that's worth $3 3.56 trillion that's a big number i asked the question of when it's the when it's the most valuable company in the world basically how do you get above average returns with that we have to get above average growth rates how do you get above average growth rates while paying a reasonable price for the company for this kind of premium 76 times free cash flow what do you have to grow at in order to justify that that's why we have the stock analyzer tool but before we get into that let's do these eight pillars and look at this guys this is a fabulous company fabulous and guess what these two metrics are useless why it's our 5year pre price of free cash flow it's our fiveyear earnings look at how much their free cash flow has grown in the last 5 years it's 3x look how much their net income has grown in the last 5 years again over 3x so you can't sit here and say oh there are 237 that really no they are still expensive from a price to- free cash flow metric but remember high return on invested capital that deserves a premium they're the clear leader on the ai front when it comes to data centers and things like that okay chips all that stuff so you have to sit there and say what's the right premium for nvidia this is what makes investing so difficult so what is the right price for nvidia let's pull up the stock analyzer tool and guys this is the tool we use because we have to marry the story with the numbers this is the numbers part it is possible to overpay for a good thing it's possible to overpay for a great thing the question is what's overpaying well that's why i have to make assumptions we don't know the future we have to make our assumptions and i do the low middle and high assumptions for every almost every company i do so for revenue i did 10 20 and 30% revenue growth guys 30% revenue growth is insane over a 10-year period 30% revenue growth is 14 times revenue guys they did $100 billion do in revenue that would take them to $1.4 trillion do in revenue in the next 10 years is it possible of course it's possible the question is is it probable that's the question you have to ask yourself at 76% gross margins at 45% bottom line margins that's the question 55% so on the free cash flow and profit margin i did 30 40 and 50% i have to assume in the next 10 years as these margins are so big more and more people will enter that market and drive down those margins a little bit so then we ask the question of what's the pe at the end of 10 years i did 20 25 and 30 it's easy to get sucked into a higher number because of how high the current pe and the current price of free cash flow is i still think 2025 and 30 is high most likely i would do 18 21 and 24 but i did my 9% desired return i'm not trying to do anything with margin of safety here i'm just sitting there saying listen to match the market what's the intrinsic value 9 or 10% what's that going to give me now guys these tools and all the tools up here are used every single day by the thousands of people in our community used every single day by me and the reason being is you have to be able to marry the story with the numbers most times out there people just focus on the story and the story is great but i remind you of the internet the internet 25 years ago was amazing the story was incredible and i would argue that the story got better than what we thought it was going to be back then but yet we still saw thousands and thousands of internet companies go to zero why because we weren't miring the story with the numbers that was the big thing so if you've watched our videos and gone to

have a low price of 36 a high price of 385 a middle price of 125 so assuming the rosiest of rosy assumptions it's a great deal right here but the question becomes when do any when does any company provide the rosiest of rosie assumptions smci being delisted or going out of business will not take nvidia down it's only 10% of their revenue and all they have to do is go to one of their other suppliers who does the same thing that smci does like dell ibm lenovo huet packard all these huge businesses that can pick up the slack guys smci is a crooked fraudulent company and even if they're temporarily able to scourge this delisting the short run the chances that their company probably has decreased significantly they have a history of improper conduct and the likelihood of d listing is probably a lot higher than people want to make it out to be the other part of this is they're losing business from nvidia and now elon elon there just reportedly shifted $6 billion doll of ai server orders from super micro to its rival at dell so even if they stick around the reputational hit is massive so guys if you want to see the 18 stocks that i currently own in y watch our next video thank

2024-11-22,DD262BydJcg,"kind: captions language: en the stock market has been on a very impressive tear for the last 2 years but let's face it every investor knows the market has to eventually swing we're going to have cycles and even though history doesn't repeat itself it rhymes we've seen devastating crashes wipe out trillions of dollars in today's money from the great depression the doom crash the financial crisis and the co crash the warning signs are always there in hindsight but when will the next crash hit and how bad will it be in this video we're diving into the key indicators that may signal that a market crash is coming but you can your position yourself to take advantage and be ready emotionally and with money when it does happen for those of you who don't know a pullback in a full stock market crash are not the same thing but they are closely related a pullback typically refers to stocks falling between 5 and 10% quickly and then rebounding shortly thereafter think of short-term market sentiment shifts from the news earnings controversy acquisition hypers all these random things that happen you get the idea about what i'm saying there a stock market crash is much more intense and usually takes significantly longer to recover from now there's no standard amount that a stock must fall to qualifies a crash for example in the 2000 tech bubble there were three years in a row of the s&amp;p going down the nasdaq fell 83% but it took 3 years for that to happen yes there were a lot of big drops and very quickly you look look at the great financial crisis things started to drop in september went back of 08 then went back up then came back down crashed it was a drawn out period then you look at covid it was a 40% drop in 4 weeks now since 1950 the average decline has been about 32.7% and lasted over 2 years now depending on your age you probably looked at these all-time highs and felt pretty rosy and felt pretty good about these because you've yet to experience a really bad bare market or a crash i want you go to your brokerage account and look at the amount you have invested now imagine seeing that number drop by 40% or 50% or 60% in the next 2 years would you be able to handle that 20 years ago seeing stocks fall got me scared i'd say is this going forever is this going to keep going down to zero am i going to lose everything but now after learning about history understanding what caused these things and more importantly understanding valuations and how to value the market in businesses it makes me feel much more confident to to embrace a crash yes it still hurts the pocketbook and the ego to see my account fall but if you have the proper training the proper people around you you can see that it's absolutely imperative to your returns on the long run that you don't do the things that you naturally feel inclined to do the things that i felt 20 years ago and i'm going to explain why in just a minute the thing that shifted my thinking 20 years ago was starting to understand the stages of a bubble that's extremely important to understanding what can possibly happen as frequent as market corrections are this does not stop investors from panicking and making emotional decisions with their money no one is immune from that everybody in history has done that including warren buffett and if you look back at history this should not be surprising why do so many lose sight of this this time it's different guys i've heard this countless times and the funny part is it's often talked about as the most four most dangerous words in investing it's not different how many times has it ever been different never at the end of the day every investment is the present value of all future c cash flows and a 10% return is a 10% return if you're just starting out you've already seen some things some bubbles burst a little bit electric vehicles cannabis nfts i currently believe that we're in a crypto bubble and an ai bubble and guys bubbles are nothing new there are the first recorded bubble was that tulip mania crisis back in 1636 that was the time when people were betting on tulips being worth a lot more money they had no intrinsic value they were just worth a lot more money was it different for any of those bubbles it sure felt like it as it was going up this is different every single time it's different i laugh whenever i hear people now saying paul the.com bubble that's totally different than today this is ai three years ago this is electric vehicles this is changing the world bigger than the internet and i always go excuse me bigger than the internet i consider the internet one of the top three or four biggest inventions of all time regardless i'm positive it'll continue to be repeated time and time again you know why because humans don't change the way we are intrinsically will not change and it doesn't take much research or analysis to notice a pattern now i want to walk you through the five stages of a bubble as warren buffett says every bubble starts on a sound premise something new or revolutionary will hit the market and begin to grab attention or something as simple as it's wise to go to college it's wise to own a home those are very true things but they lead to bubble behavior later there's an influx of buyers and media coverage that builds hype and instills fomo that fear of missing out it starts small it starts to grow people start to notice it then all of a sudden your friends are doing it news follows the stock price so what happens next naturally that price starts to climb higher and higher bringing even more investors to keep adding to their positions and they buy in and they sell as it goes up they see it go up higher and higher it doesn't take long before every other article praises the most recent high flying stock or investment and the prices seem as that they could grow endlessly unfortunately guys that's not how investing works otherwise everybody in the world would be a billionaire or even higher a trillionaire after a massive runup wise investors start to exit with their profits shrinking the share price temporarily but they say you know what it's getting a little nose bleed i'm going to move on this is what happens that causes something a joke currency made up by a guy about his dog like dogecoin goes up 12,000 and then it's right back down down irrelevance you can choose any bubble in history and identify each of these five steps now you might be thinking paul how long i know when a bubble's about to burst what signs are there that stocks could fall the honest truth is we don't know when the bubble will burst the main indicator of potential bubble burst involves the sentiment in the market but sentiment can shift very quickly to the positive and the negative be wary of any stock that experiences massive gains or sudden spikes in a short period of time without a change in fundamentals and by the way when i say short period of time i don't necessarily just mean weeks it could just be a few years in the investing world a few years is a short period of time everyone thinks that they take long-term versus short-term based on what the irs claims that to be that's not the case hype is an early indicator that investors are flocking to an asset for reasons beyond fundamental analysis and that can cause intense volatility now i'm not saying you should av avoid everything that's doing well just make sure that the performance is just ified based on the fundamentals and those fundamentals are revenue growth profit growth free cash flow growth a good balance sheet and all those things couple together always do your own research before starting a position in anything don't just follow what somebody on the internet says or even what warren buffett says he's going to make his own research and his own decisions based on his situation the questions you ask yourself is do i understand this asset if it's a stock do i understand the business how do they make money how would they lose money what's their position in the market what's their intrinsic value these are all things that we use our tools in our community and software to go help determine nvidia for example is a phenomenal example it's at all-time highs in the last year the company's stock is up 27% and at least for right now it's showing no signs of stopping is nvidia hype stock well it is hyped but it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bubble that's something i've been wrong on their revenue profit gross margin returns on capital are incredible and they're getting better with no signs of slowing look at a company like gamestop this company was up over 5,000% between 2020 and 2021 but there was nothing to justify that there were the fundamentals of the business were terrible the business was getting worse every single quarter so when that hype dried up where did the investors go they left it what happened to the price but with nvidia even though we see a big jump in fundamentals several fold the question is does it justify 27 100% growth in the stock price well it could if the future looks just as bright as the last two or three years remember just because something is up a lot doesn't mean it's overpriced and just because something's down a lot doesn't mean it's undervalued it's about marrying fundamentals with price together but the fundamentals are also driven by the future potential you're not paying for the past you're paying for that future that's what makes investing hard because we don't know the future and we're humans we make mistake the biggest thing i like doing is i like to take note of who is talking about this investment we know that euphoria is a big part of the bubble cycle and when bearish analysts turn rosie as the pride takes off it could be evidence that outlooks are get moving toward mania but more importantly what are everyday people doing peter lynch has a great great story he talks about his cocktail party theory he says when i go to a cocktail party if people ask me what i do and i say i own i buy stocks if they feel bad for me i know it's probably time to buy if they if they if they start giving me advice it's probably time to sell and if they're indiff the market's fairly valued i love that cu i love hearing what other people are saying now if a stock is getting beat up or ignored only to suddenly be pled all over the tv investing websites or youtube with completely different valuations at the very least it's time to ask more questions and dig deeper we saw this exactly happen through the electric vehicle bubble for a long time tesla stood out as an innovative lever with strong promises as tesla became more successful though other companies started spawning like crazy it took no time at all for analysts enthusiasts and experts to come to the forefront in support of the ev market but it usually happens on the tailwind of the regular person finding these companies and hyping them up now how many of those companies went to zero guys the vast majority did and not only that but how many people are talking about ev today the same way we talked about it just a few years ago and you watch our past videos early 2021 i would love for you to go see the comments on we talked about eevee and the workhorse and all these companies are nicola are going to zero we didn't say zero but we said these aren't justifiable the comments we got you don't get it e is the future e is everything right now it's not like the internet great now you hear nothing about eevee absolutely nothing and remember the market's rot from the outside in now here's a shocker for you it's ai now right ai will end up with the same result as ev there'll be a few players who really dominate and do well and there'll be lot of players who probably lose a lot of stock market value there'll be a massive boom which we're in the middle of right now and then at some point when the returns start to suck not many will care as much and we be on to the next hype category because there's always going to be a hype category the hype is so intense the fomo is so intense that it has to drag in casual everyday people to get them excited overconfident and eer to spread their success to any and everyone and that success makes people jealous so they want to jump on the same train but guys that's not a process for investing that's a process for speculation i can almost guarantee no valuations no financial metrics and no research of ever of any kind is ever mentioned there i was rec at a friend's house in florida and they brought other friends over talking and one of the guys said hey what's nvidia doing right now and i looked it up he said man this company's amazing they're saying it's going to double in price again and i said to him well you know what they do right and he looked at me goes no i don't know what they do i remember thinking to myself this guy's so excited about a company he has no idea what they they do and guys this is not an everyday person this is a person that's worth well over $100 million so just be wary when you're pizza delivery driver or you're waiter or waitress or some random young pimply kid next door tries to talk about some sort of investment maybe it's time to be a little cautious now that euphoria can keep on going look at crypto look at ai it's going to keep on going probably for some time so you might be asking well if crashes are inevitable how do i protect myself in my returns guys nobody has been able to predict where the stock market will go consistently over short periods of time you can react to it and a lot of traders will react to it but it's still a reactionary process again nobody knows where stock prices are going to go in the short time how long it'll take or how long they'll stay there if you're concerned about returns this is something every single investor needs to hear stocks will fall at some point that's inevitable guys i'm not trying to put fear uncertainty in doubt i'm not trying to be a fudster here where we are in valuations and where we've been in this bull market we have to take a breather at some point i always hear the adage of like bare bull markets don't end because of age yeah actually they kind of do the longer it goes on for the more complacent people get eventually there aren't enough new buyers to drive up prices higher and suddenly it might shift look at 2000 there was no event that sparked the crash of 2000 it just finally stopped but i can assure you the worst thing you can do is sell everything when the market's falling you might say oh paul i wouldn't panic i'd ride the way down and invest more that's so obvious guys i've been doing this for a long time and i've seen multiple crashes and the one thing i've seen happen over and over again is the people who say that are the first ones to sell and the reason being is there's always a story about why it's different this time on the way down too not just on the way up on the way down the great financial crisis guys all these value investors bailed guy spear wrote a great book called the education of value investor and one of the best chapters where he talks about all these value investing friends he had where the stocks were down 50% and they were bailing and he's like wait a second i thought we're value investors yeah but you don't get it the financial system's shutting down the world's going to shut down same with covid but if you go look at that chart 2009 where's the one area you wish you were buying the very bottom now this doesn't mean going buying more junk companies that have no fundamentals to them but it does mean looking at companies that have fallen a lot but the fundamentals are the same or getting better or not down as much as they should be that's where you can make a lot of money or more importantly buying the stock market because guess what you have two choices when the market falls you either buy more or you sell because the world's going to zero guys if the world's going to zero you might as well buy more because your money is not going to matter anyhow so you might as well load up while the stock market's falling again all the people i hear say i can withstand a 40 50% fall i'd buy more it never happens that way but it can and the benefit you have versus pastimes is you have youtube you have this channel you have people who actually cheer like people in our community who cheer when stocks are down there are pictures of me during the co crash taking a picture of my computer screen in the great financial crisis the guys from bank of america mar lynch would call me and say i'm the only good phone call they get because i'd be the one so excited i have the emails to show it this is not just words i see all these financial manslaughter idiots on the on youtube and i always say a lot of them are going to change from stocks at some point when these stocks fall a ton and they can't explain why or can't explain why they're not buying they're going to go find something else to go do this is a tale as oldest time now i used to be like everybody else remember once during the 2000 crash layer thing in my bed going this is going to zero and it took a few years but i've completely changed my view on downturns and crashes every time the economy has a downturn we've emerged healthier wealthier and better for it every single time i know seeing stocks plummet and navigating the noise seems like an investor's worst nightmare but remember every past decline looks like an opportunity every future one looks like a risk just change that last word every future one needs to look like an opportunity we have done countless videos in the past proving that those who stuck to their investments saw huge returns in the long run if they could stomach the pain even as simple as dollar cost averaging in the etfs remember it's just math the more you pay the less less return you're going to get the less you pay the more return you're going to get and there's no better time to buy stocks as a whole as when they're discounted but remember what warren buffett says be fearful when others are greedy greedy when others are fearful remember it's impossible for everybody to outperform the market the whole point of the market is the average and the best way to protect your returns it's a dollar cost average and a lowc cost etfs we talk about this a ton in our community in the channel if you're dollar cost averaging and buying regularly even when prices are falling you'll be much stronger position and you'll outperform the market from that time frame what matters more is time in the market not timing the market pulling money in and out of your stocks is horrific for your returns and there have been countless studies that have proven that if picking individual stocks are too risky i don't blame you stick to etfs but remember the example i always give qqq is the nasdaq 100 etf at the peak of the dot bubble if you'd bought right then and started dollar cost averaging from there so you start at the very peak you would have stomached at 83% fall and since then you would have made 13.5% return on your money the s&amp;p if you did the same thing at that point you'd have made 10.5% but since then the s&amp;p has only made 6 and a half or 7% with dividends and the qqq is done about 8 and a half %. so you would outperform those indexes that's how important dollar cost averaging is over the last 100 years the average stock market return is somewhere between 9 and 10% with dividends obviously some years or more some years years or less but if you keep buying robotically maybe even increasing when prices are lower and low value you will do phenomenal remember guys the best way to build wealth over time isn't by betting on a single asset or trend as it's getting exciting it's about being smart staying grounded investing in the long term and also being diversified there are only a few investors out there who can stomach not being diversified and kill it let them do that i like being diversified but it's all about keeping your head cool it's not about the iq you need it's about the stomach you need if you're able to do that you're going to do very well now remember i want to shift your focus from fearing stock market corrections and crashes and worrying about how to protect yourself to being excited about the opportunity to buy stocks at cheaper prices you need to take an offensive mindset when it comes to investing no one in this world is coming to save you the government won't bail you specifically out like they did banks in 2007 you need to surround yourself with people who are headed in the direction that you want to go and you have to keep investing so guys if you want to be our like-minded people join our community you shouldn't do this alone when stocks fall those overhyped stocks will fall the hardest and most people will panic sell in our community when stocks fall there's cheering there's excitement better deals on great companies this company's out of favor what's it looking like what's the free cash flow what are your assumptions i love people sharing their stock analyzer tool there are conversations going like crazy and right now guys everything money.com we have a 7-day trial for a limited time for $1 per day so make sure you take advantage of it while it's still here click on the link in the description get access to everything we have to offer and take advantage of the community that's going to help guide you and help be there for you and with you when stocks do fall it'll be the best investing decision you've made all year trust me guys the emotional part of investing is really really difficult i mentioned this earlier that it took me a few years in a major bare market crash to build up the tolerance to seeing and enjoy ing these massive swinging stocks but guess what you can do the same remember market-wide crashes are not permanent go look at history we've had them since the beginning of time in some sort of market in some sort of way and they all go away and end and we get to better times remember if they do become permanent we have much bigger issues than what the size of your 401k in brokerage accounts are just know that at some point we will see more market downturns don't be afraid be prepared the key is to stick with your plan be consistent and stay focused on the long term now it obviously won't be easy at all times but look at it as a great buying opportunity that could reward you in the long run if you weather that storm and if you're in the community we'll be here to remind you that it's not all bad news you don't have to endure this alone no one can predict the future but what we can do is teach a process that helps you make smarter decisions over the long run that's what we're all about here helping you

2024-11-25,UREs-rLVz2k,"kind: captions language: en guys we have three stocks trading at or near their 52e low and you know how much i love looking at 52- we low stocks i say this in every 52- we low video it's a great place to start looking for value but remember price is what you pay value is what you get just because it's at a 52e low does not make it a good buy stock number one target guys this company just plummeted today they had a triple miss on earnings they absolutely got demolished last quarter they saw a significant drop in same store sales this quarter they rebounded to a positive but not as much as people would have liked it is down 21% guys 52 we high versus 52 we low check this out 52 we high 180 low 121 just today now guys i own target stock do not buy a stock just cuz somebody on the internet has it or even warren buffett we're here to teach a process but the thing i like about target you will see very shortly i was buying it from 135 all the way down to 105 and i think it hit a low of like 103 or 101 so this company has a$ 57 billion market cap 95 to 98 enterprise value that difference is debt and my guess is a lot of that debt has to do with leases because this has a lot of locations that's the biggest thing on target pays a handsome dividend for those those you who love dividends of 3.6% eating up $2 billion of their cash flow now last 12 months their cash flows at 5.3 billion versus net income of 4.5 billion kind of nice here kind of nice profit margin little over 4% gross margin 28% so it's got about double the profit margin than walmart has but only a slightly higher gross profit so they do a better job of generating profit than walmart does now let's check out the pillars on target what are our eight pillars telling us about target well i don't really worry about this one this is our debt level like we talked about before a lot of their debt has to do with their leases so i'm not as worried about that now their cash flow is down with such a big increase in revenue $22 billion increase in revenue in the last five years yet cash flow is down over1 billion dollar so something to take a look at because that income's up a billion so something i definitely want to let let's go take a look deeper into the cash flow statement and see why now this last column is our trailing 12 months but but our cash flow right here as you can tell we're kind of on a big stretch of a big decline in cash flow over the last few years but look at this last year 5.3 billion versus the last four year 3.8 so it seems to be a back on the upswing hitting 7.9 billion in the one year following covid all right so this is probably a fluke this is probably a fluke hopefully i did a poll on twitter today and i want to show you guys the results target just reported and it was really bad they missed on revenue eps and guided poorly is target dead or dying or is this temporary 29% of the votes so far 196 votes only 45 minutes left said that target is dead or dying 71% temporary guys retail is tough but i think target's doing a good job they cater to the right customer that's women they love women love going to the stores i like going to the stores now the overall story on target let's have a conversation about this the recent earnings report resulted in that triple miss i was talking about target also lowered their guidance from a range of 9 to 970 per share to 830 to 8.90 per share comparable store sales were up 0.3% but the expectation was 1.5% and earnings per share came in at $185 versus $2.30 expected that's a big miss guys target has over 1,00 stores operating over 246 million squ ft of space they're the sixth largest retail in the us by revenue and third largest by volume behind walmart and amazon now guys for walmart shoppers 60% of the time they're coming in for groceries whereas in target only 22% of the time is at groceries as most customers at target come for discretionary items such as apparel home furnishings and decor as well as appliances this is also why they probably have a higher gr overall profit margin now target has gone through a few tough years with boycotts of the stores because of the lgbtq product pushing luckily target has been able to pivot with the consumer and the stores are beginning to improve one thing to watch for for target is how the us consumer is doing and today consumer sentiment is trending lower and us credit card delinquencies are on the rise which could be the cause of the recent triple miss earnings that the consumer gets weaker now here's some good information on target guys digital comp sales have grown 10.8% there's been 2.4% growth in traffic which is equal to 10 million extra incremental transactions and like i said before overall comparable s store sales have grown 0.3% and they grew their target circle rewards program by 3 million members so guys i asked the question does it feel like this is a on going problem with target or does it feel like it's temporary how do you have increase in customers going to the store increase in the rewards program but it decrease in the stock by 20 some per. to me this seems temporary so what are analysts saying about target now remember analysts have their bias but look at this growth rate they have for their earnings per share $840 to $13 per share in the next five years let's go to revenue basically down 1% down half percent back to growth from 108 billion to 126 and guys i don't think target's going to be a big grower on revenue i think they're going to grow along with nominal gdp so i think this might be actually a little low in my opinion now what does this all mean well guys for this stock and the next two stocks we have a good story or we have a story whether you believe it's good or not is completely up to you what we have to do then is translate that story into the numbers every investment is the present value evolve future cash flow how do we determine that cash flow well that's why we use our stock analyzer tool we make our assumptions on revenue growth on profit levels on multiples and our return and say based on those this is what price you should pay so here are the assumptions i made i did 2 and 1/2 3 and 1/2 and 42% revenue growth guys let me go a little more conservative let me go two 3 and a half and 5% revenue growth profit margin i did 3.75 4.25 and 4.75% same for free cash flow and my multiple guys it has a pretty decent return on invested capital nothing to write home about but if i asked you where the best place to shop these things you' probably say target or walmart or amazon so it's one of the big players and they're doing a much better job of doing online sales just like walmart and amazon so i did 15 18 and 21 and finally guys i'm always doing the 9 or 10% return because even though you need a margin of safety for here i want to look at what's the intrinsic value margin of safety means a higher desired return so for those of you out there who have our software or are getting our software make sure you remember that this is not the correct number to put in to buy an individual stock you need a higher return or else i'd just say why not just buy the market so we hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 122 we have a low price of 124 high price of 241 middle price of 175 based on today's price and my middle assumptions i'm looking at about a 14% return now does that mean it's going to happen for sure no but if i had 30 stocks that had this potential return that were all target size i'd probably do pretty well in investing where would i go i don't know but it' probably be a lot better than the market return stock number two asml asml guys this company is involved with semiconductors and look it's actually down 1.75% today all-time high 1110 just back on july 11th of this year 52- we low today 645 this is a drop of almost of over 40% almost 50% of the company right here why well let's take a look so first off some metrics here's what i love guys $256 billion market cap $277 billion enterprise value basically $20 billion here actually it's quite a bit because they're oh there we go fiveyear free cash flow 5.72 so very reasonable now here's one thing that's interesting net income last year 7.3 billion free cash flow 3 billion net income in the last 5 years 6 billion 5 year average free cash flow 5.7 so these are pretty close but the one year is a big difference let's immediately go to the cash flow statement and see why that may be let's see if they had a big increase in their capital expenditures okay so five years ago they did about a billion 650 to a billion dollars now they're doing two billion in uh capital expenditures that shouldn't drive down the cash from operations the big hit big drop big drop well because of semiconductors it might be declining all right so here's the catch here you've got big increases in cash of operations in the last but then big surge during co and it's just coming back down now the question is where is the stable level now asml you you might be able to consider the beating heart of the semiconductor revolution the company holds a monopoly on producing extreme ultraviolet lithography machines each costing over $200 million and taking a year to build now these machines are indispensable for creating the nanometer scale chips that drive ai 5g and high performance computing ai and 5g alone guys that is so important to our world operating now with the semiconductor market expected to explode to over 1 trillion by 2030 asl's technology is the lynch pin of this growth over 100,000 components per machine make it irreplaceable to clients like taiwan semiconductor and intel without asml our digital future wouldn't just stall it might collapse some would say now whether i agree with that or not would somebody else pick it up maybe but these are the things being said about the company let's go check out the eight pillars here on the company and see what it looks like so guys we're looking here at check marks all around except for the fiveyear p and fiveyear price of free cash flow but again look at this look at this return invested capital 20% in the last five years 25% last year growing so the question is even so this is the funny part it's down 50 to 40 to 50% and yet the 5year pe is still low still very high i mean why i mean guys we saw it's coming down from its covid lows co highs of revenue and profit we're stabilization let's see what analysts think about that earnings per share oh my gosh massive growth look at this $20 32 37 46 52 i hope these analysts are right guys because if you can buy this company with this kind of growth rate in earnings per share holy cow revenue growth basically break even this year same growth 32% 9 and a half 15 14% so they're able to drive a lot of their revenue into profit as time goes on so again leads us to the question stock analyzer tool what should we assume for stock analyzer i did this back on july 15th of this year ironically 4 days after their all-time high four days after their all-time high now one thing i love increasing roic the last 10 years was 14 a half 205 24 and a half it's getting better as of late revenue growth i did 69 and 12% because i did a 10-e analysis here i can understand somebody doing 58 11 in fact i think i'm going to do that 58 11% and i'm probably being too conservative but so be it 22 23 and2 and 25% profit margin 24 27 and 30% free cash flow guys these are probably low too well maybe maybe it needs to be a combination of these two let's actually make these the same let's call it this let's call it 22 24 and 26 i could be wrong but let's see how that goes pe and price of free cash i did 15 18 and 21 and then the 9% return i hit the analyze button now guys this is why the software is so important it's really really important that you're able to do both the story and the numbers together that's how you combine these that's how you make great investing decisions that's why thousands of people in our community are talking about asml this is the number one stock requested by our community members to look at now if you're not in the community that's a tragedy and you may have noticed if you've gone to the website to sign up we have a daily number of users that we're allowing into the community and software and the reason is today's software includes everything we have to offer for stocks real estate and and retirement but behind the scenes we're making a lot of changes that offer is going to go away very soon now remember from the very beginning of this channel i built this software selfishly for myself i had an excel sheet people kept saying how do i get that software how do i get that excel sheet we didn't have it available it took a very expensive data feed but it sparked the idea let's make this for people let's create that community because investing is so difficult because it can be a lonely road we can get ourselves trapped into our own thoughts it's nice to have thousands of people out there that we can talk to and bounce ideas off of and get new ideas from them i use this software my team uses the software every single day to make better decisions for stocks and real estate but as we've grown it's becoming less about me and more about how i can better serve you guys the community members and this is why we spend so much money updating our software continuously now the good news is a lot of these major changes have not been made yet they're still being worked on so if you join today you'll be grandfathered in for life with everything and this is the best deal we have ever offered so you still have time so click on the link in the description below to get access to everything we have to offer and i assure you it'll be the best investing decision you've made all year so i hit the analyze button i have a low price of 275 high price of 640 middle price of 420 guys i'm just waiting on this one let's see let's make these higher let's say my conservative assumptions are actually higher let's say 8 12 and 16% it's still hard today to's price but i could be wrong but i look at this saying this is why i like the stock analyzer tool so much i can sit there and see how far off am i i greatly increased my revenue assumptions that still happened stock number three end phase guys look at this fall from grace end phase hit a high december 5th of 2022 almost two years ago of $339 per share two days ago the low is 5833 and it's currently at 6276 quite the f all now if you look at end phase here area of concern 5year profit margin 16% 1 year 5% why is that i don't know that's something to look into all right now let's take a look at the end phase eight pillars so we have revenue growth of 530 million oops wrong side 530 million led to 120 million in free cash flow and drop of 116 million in net income one thing i do love about mf if you look at this free cash flow last year of 336 5year average of$ 439 look at their net income way lower this is a positive more free cash flow than net income eventually those things will even out but i love this situation their price of free cash flow significantly lower than their net income their pr pe okay so it's still a young company but solar panels are still a young business this happens to be an opportunity for a long-term multi bagger nphase operates in that solar panel industry with specific operations within the inverter industry the advantage to an inverter is it's cheaper to install easier to diagnose problems as the inverter will fail rather than the panel itself and they're cheap to repair and easier to repair as they have fewer parts now a big reason a lot of people see that the price has fallen from over 300 is partly due to california's new net energy metering 3.0 which slashed the incentives to own panels by 75% this matters because california is by far the largest install base for solar panels and if they change their regulations my guess is others will too the new regulation pushed the incentive payback period from four to 5year return upwards of 8 to n years that's a significant difference in the return on investment now nas and solar edge make up 95% of the entire global inverter market with mfas holding 50% and solar edge holding 45% the company gets 60% of its revenue from the united states as in the and is in the process of building out a footprint in europe asia and south america in addition potential for income per home has grown to $122,000 per home versus $2,000 back in 2019 another advantage that mfas has is that even though chinese counterparts make a cheaper product due to national security reasons and geopolitical tensions the us does not allow china to sell their products in the country yet that is something that i want everybody to remember that right now they don't allow it but who knows what that means in the future so let's check out the analyst estimates on in phase to see where they're going look at this growth from 264 per share to 950 per share and earnings per share now remember free cash flow is greater and revenue growth a big drop this year but growing to ion 2.4 3.15 2.79 well into double digigit growth for the next four or 5 years now another thing i want to look at guys is go back to the main page 46% gross margin 16% in the last 5 years but those incentives have fallen what's going to be the stable standing point that's what's hard about this company right now free cash flow is significant look at this free cash flow let's go to a stock analyzer because it'll tell us free tell us the free cash flow margin look at this increasing basically in the last five or 10 years net income much lower so i'm going to focus on free cash flow here i'm going to make my assumptions let's see if i've looked done in phase in the past in our history so guys here's my stock analyzer assumptions i did 10-year analysis i did 6 12 and 18% revenue growth i did 10 15 and 20% profit margin but remember i'm going to focus here on the free cash flow look how much higher that free cash flow is i did 20 25 and 30% free cash flow margin and finally i did a 15 18 and 21 pe and price of free cash flow now remember pe don't worry about the pe focus on that free cash flow over long periods of time earnings and free cash flow will be pretty close to each other and of course i did my 9% return hit the analyze button and guys here are my prices a low price of 34 high price of 161 middle price of 75 so it's in our green range here getting you about 11% return based on today middle assumptions and today's price i have found so many great stocks when i look at 52e lows i have three more stocks to analyze with you that we're trading near their 52- we low watch it right here thank you for your

2024-11-27,ghM5H5hCAbI,"kind: captions language: en investors inside our community have analyzed over 1,600 stocks in the past month and we're going to analyze the top five right now first one nike nike is absolutely killing it with its global reach and north america is leading that charge in the third quarter of 2024 the north american region brought in a solid 5.07 billion making a 3% year-over-year increase now it doesn't sound like a lot but for their new plans that is a lot now 3% again doesn't sound like a powerhouse doesn't sound like a lot of growth you got to remember nike's pulling back the reins on how much they're sing out the stores their goal is to do more direct to consumer which is also higher margin because before if you sold to a store you had to give the store enough room for profit now they're selling directly to consumers they're giving consumers a lot more options and they're keeping a bigger chunk of the profit but that isn't all nike is putting the pedal to the metal in greater china where footwear revenue shot up 5% to 1.5 billion in q3 the company's performance in china shows its resilience and strategic focus on these emerging markets as other markets around the world get larger and larger and total revenue grew by over 4% on top of that nike is pushing hard on its digital transformation that i was discussing before focusing on their direct consumer sales to boost those margins and enhance the e-commerce presence everything is about e-commerce these days these moves are definitely positioning the company for long-term growth making nike a stock worth watching nike is a stock that i own now remember don't buy nike just cuz i have it or anybody else in the internet or even warren buffett has it in fact bill amman just increases nike holdings by almost 500% this last quarter in his 13f that's a big jump now you might be wondering paul nike what's going on with nike that makes it so attractive well first off it's nike it's the global leader in apparel shoes anybody who thinks otherwise i just ask you how long you've been working on armor how long you've been working adidas because the only other people in the world who would think that would be working a competitor nike is a brand nike is a moe and most importantly their stock is down under $75 right now their all-time high was 180 three years ago this month that's a long time and back then i guarantee if we did videos on nike people would have said nike is never going to be below 100 blah blah blah blah blah well look it now it just goes to show that even the most amazing companies like nike can see a fall at some point just of a shift in the mood now the reason our community members are looking at the stock is exactly this i always tell people a great place to look to start looking for a company to buy is one that's fallen precipitously 175 180 down to 75 bucks over a 50% drop for a company like nike you got to take a look at it absolutely have to now the company has $112 billion market cap it's last year's free cash flow 7.2 billion beating its net income of 5.3 its margin is still at the same consistent 5-year level 10.6% but i think that's going to go higher along with this gross margin of 45% now gross margin as you know or if you don't know is the amount of money they make on every additional dollar they bring in in revenue it goes before the overhead before taxes all that stuff that's pretty solid if this is a high number it means they can grow their profit very quickly as they expand so guys let's look at the eight pillars here and what's the story that nike is telling us with these eight pillars guys everything's a check except for valuation now with mo businesses and businesses with a high return on capital these are businesses who can get a high return on the money that's invested in the business you should be willing to pay a premium for that so even though these are exes i don't know if that's really an x is it reasonable to pay 20 or 25 times earnings for a brand like nike that is your decision to make that's what makes investing so great that's probably why so many people in our community are running nike in our stock analyzer because the stock analyzer is exactly used for the reason of making three assumptions on revenue growth profit margin everything to determine the right price to pay for the company so let's see what happened with nike the last time i put it in my stock analyzer tool what were my assumptions here so i did three five and 7% revenue growth pretty reasonable if you ask me profit margin i did 10 11 and 12 same with free cash flow now again guys i do think their profit margin get better so i think i'm being reasonable here pe i did 20 23 and 26 remember what i said before i think they're a premium business that deserves a premium to them their one-year price of free cash flow currently the trailing 12 months is 16 that one of the eight pillars was a fiveyear free cash flow and finally i put a 9% desire return now if you look at community members they're not putting in 9% and they shouldn't and you shouldn't either i select 9% to give me the intrinsic value of the business what's the business worth today because the market's going to do 9 or 10% so if this were to match the market what's that worth but remember you're buying an individual company you should have a margin of safety i so the number here should go higher when you do it in your own stock analyzer analysis so we hit the analyze button scroll we got a low price of 60 high price of 120 middle price of 85 based on today's price almost an 11% return including dividends on this company so in my opinion i've started buying some i have puts at lower prices and the lower and lower it goes more likely i'm to buy it remember news follows the stock price so i'm sure there's a lot of news out there that's negative about nike stock number two crocs i was actually surprised about this one crocs is straight up killing it and the numbers back it up in 2023 they pulled in a record 3.6 billion in revenue a 54% boost from the previous year all thanks to demand for their classic shoes and the recent heydude brand acquisition now the good news is the brand isn't just sitting pretty they're aggressively expanding aiming for 10 to 133% revenue growth this year alone international sales are a major driver especially in the european middle eastern and asia region where sales exploded by 49.2% and it isn't stopping there crocs is doubling down in e-commerce with a 19.6% jump in online sales with these moves it's absolutely clear that crocs is able to scale and able to scale like a beast and with growth in both international markets and digital sales it's looking like a no-brainer for some investors if the price is right now the stock here also had an all-time high back in 2021 just like nike right around the same time of 183 exactly years ago basically got as low as 85 bucks back in january of this year it's currently at $97 per share now some benefits of crocs price to free cash flow six they generated almost a billion dollars in free cash flow last year versus 834 million in net income and their fiveyear free cash flow is 536 which is 11 times free cash flow with a high return on invested capital guys that's impressive those are really really good numbers the question is is the growth going to be there let's go see what the eight pillars say before we get into the growth story eight pillars eight pillar thriller guys everything is check marks everything guys i love the fact they're buying back shares and i hope they continue to buy back shares i love that they don't pay dividend now i get worried when company's stock starts to falter they start to worry about paying a dividend to get people attracted into it i want them taking all their cash and buying back shares at these low multiples that would be the best thing to do for the ex with the extra cash flow for the company they can't use it to expand at a profitable rate everything else is a check mark all right so let's see what analysts say about crocs revenue growth potential not huge 4% 5 a half three 14.8 7.8 from 4.2 billion to 5.6 so hey dude's very popular i know a lot of people who have them they have said though recently that hey dudes sales growth has slowed down and the crocs by themselves guys they're fun now they've got all those little j blits you can put on them people love using them for outside work inside work a lot of restaurant it's a great product that's very simple so the question is is it going away well that's the determination you have to make it looks like the market's pricing in it's going away based on six times re six times free cash flow all right i made some pretty conservative assumptions here guys i did zero three and 6% revenue growth by the way guys increasing return on invested capital that's a major check mark to this business all right 17 20 and 23% profit margin and free cash flow margin not bad pe i did 13 16 and 19 you know the hard part is for me we might wake up 10 or 15 years from now and go crocs is a brand that's going to be here forever but we don't know that right now they've recently in the they've been around for a long time but they've only recently become more and more popular but if they do a great job of this free cash flow expanding their their lines and buying back shares this could be a company that's like autozone or like nvr that just buybacks a ton of shares and gives amazing value to this to its investors this one's very interesting even to me so then i have my desired return of 9% hit the analyze button guys this is pretty interesting 133 on the low side 350 on the high side 220 in the middle a potential 22% return this is exactly why it's getting the attention of those in our community stock number three celsius guys ignore the stock chart on celsius it is down big time and the story doesn't match the stock price all-time high of $99 just earlier this year a mere eight months ago hit his low is $25.20 it's currently and that was actually just today hit a 52- we low just today that's a big fall but remember you have to look at the difference between the business and the stock price celsius of the companies on fire hitting 2.2 billion in revenue for 2023 making it a 15% year-over-year jump thanks to its growing fan base and surging demand for its calorie burning drinks the future actually looks even brighter with analysts predicting 6 to 8% market share by 2025 driven by a key partnership with pepsico and a bigger global footprint now with these solid financials and focusing more on the marketing push celsius position for even more growth making it a compelling investment for the long haul along with this happening that really really helps a ton when it comes to looking at the company and saying let me pay attention guys these are the things we discuss every single day in our community this is exactly why you have to sit there and use all this community and the tools to get better at making decisions

community and i'm very confident it'll be the best investing decisions you've made all year now with celsius let's see if this will be an even better investing decision here's what i love $6 billion market cap $5.6 billion enterprise value that means they have net caph on hand cuz usually most companies have a higher enterprise value which means there's debt in the company when the enterprise value is lower it means you can buy the company use all the cash to pay off all the debt and still end up with cash left over that's what's incredible all right now the profit margin this is interesting 5year average profit margin is 6% last year's profit margin 15.6 now the question to ask is are they becoming more efficient is that why there's a 15.6% profit margin versus 6% historical is it some other reason these are important questions to ask all right now let's go check out the eight pillars all right not as rosy but remember we don't buy or sell based on eight pillars it's about telling us a story what's the story here well the return on capital is low fiveyear return on capital is 1% but guys the one year is 15% so they might be turning a leaf over here which means maybe ignore this one share that standing up 4% okay not bad now the 5year pe and 5year price of free c very very high and it's not like their profit so if you look at their net income here 5year average is 43 million net income of 200 million last year free cash flow 5year average of 60 million 170 last year so it's still elevated it's not really a 100 because they're a growing company but it's still elevated for recent times for their recent data i mean even at if you triple this take 1/3 off it's still 50 and 33 which is still rich but if they're growing like crazy it might be okay remember you should be okay paying a premium for good growing companies you absolutely need to pay a premium for that is celsius that one i don't know that's the question we have to ask ourselves so let's see what analysts are saying for their revenue growth 20% 18% 19% 35% 8 and a half% but here not many analysts here only three but that's um it's a lot of growth grow it's going to double in the next four years 1 2 3 4 doubling in the next four years that's a pretty fast growth rate so even if they double their profit is four years enough time maybe it is this is something that with its fall of 75% is something worth looking at now if you make decision to buy in all likelihood it's probably going to go lower you're not going to buy at the bottom so you have to be okay with that that's very important so let's go pull up stock analyzer and the celsius story so i did 10 year analysis 4 8 and 12% revenue growth profit margin i did 12 15 and 18 same with free cash flow now for pe and price of free cash flow i put 15 17 and 19 i kind of want to go lower i kind of want to go i just all it's hard because let's do 13 16 and 19 because it's still an energy drink and a lot of energy drinks there's so many of them out there but for those of you out there apply a reasonable pe and put the margin of safety much higher i'm putting in my 9% here hit the analyze button i have a low price of 11 high price of 37 middle price of 20 so for me guys i understand why it's getting a lot of attention in the community because it's down 75% but i look at this going maybe it's not down enough maybe remember just because something's down 75% does not make it a great deal stock number four another stock that i own paypal venmo makes up 18% of total payment volumes in q3 2024 and the reason that matters is who owns venmo paypal guys ready for the stat 24% of the us population uses venmo today that's 83 million people and not only that it's estimated they're going to grow mid to high single digits through 2027 and the majority of venmo users are in the range of 19 to 49 years of age which is the highest consumption phase of life guys venmo is a verb literally can i venmo you venmo me i've literally hired people to do work for me around my house where i say do you have venmo no get vm mo and the interesting part is even though the app is absolutely dominant it hasn't even come close to full monetization but this is changing as management announced in q3 of this year that they're going to begin monetizing the app to do this they're rolling out debit cards and pay with venmo online payment checkout features which i think is fabulous i love using venmo look at this venmo processed 276 billion in total payment volume in 2023 a 13.1% increase year-over-year here's another interesting stat look at this year-on-year percentage change and total payment volume look at this boom growing payment volume now obviously the growth rate slowed because the app is not as big but this is still right here 6 to 10% annual growth guys venmo is huge allows people to do amazing things you can pay somebody boom just like that here are some other amazing statements about paypal 426 million active users guys there's 8 billion people in the world that's 5% of them total payment volume reached 1.53 trillion in q4 2023 across 25 billion transactions guys in 2014 it was 250 billion in 2018 it was 500 billion look at this growth that's amazing amazing growth and the more online grows the better this will do up to 36 million merchants use paypal in over 165 countries worldwide and guys 60% of consumers trust paypal more than their bank for storing payment credentials trust is everything when it comes to money paypal has that trust that's what's important there so guys here are the eight pillars on paypal guys as you can tell their free cash flow is better than their earnings and you see that right here free cash flow 7 billion net income of 4.43 5year freight cash flow of $5 billion versus 3.71 so they're going to have a lower price of free cash flow than their earnings which i love everything else is a check they're buying back shares and this is especially important for a company that went from an all-time high of 310 down to 55 in the last year about a year ago it was down a $55 per share a lot of people saying the company's dying as we said earlier but i look at the numbers going yes there are issues the question is has the price drop overe exaggerated those issues that are coming so let's see what analysts think about the potential for paypal okay 450 per share in earnings this year growing to se nearly $7 here in the next four years not bad decent growth and revenue boy isn't that funny 8% 8% 7 and a half 8% 10 and a half pretty solid for a company that is supposedly declining again analysts could be wrong i agree i always say that you got to be cautious but the reason why i continue to hold paypal i think you'll see in two seconds when we do our stock analyzer tool on paypal let's pull it up right here the pay pizzle okay i did four s and 10% revenue growth for paypal i did a profit margin of 12 and a half 14 and a half and 16 and a half and i went higher with the free cash flow and i'm going to focus on free cash flow here because that's the metric i want doing better i did 16 20 and 24% all right pe i did 147 and 20 now i did a lower one down here even though their roic is increasing there are there's still a lot of competition in area so i'm going to put that lower um pe and i did my 9% desired return hit the analyze button guys a low price of 61 to 78 high price of 160 to 230 middle price of 100 to 140 and paying today's price assuming all my middle assumptions are correct i'm looking at a 16% discounted cash flow return that's pretty solid now does that mean i'm going to be right on this not necessarily but i think this is enough margin of safety for me we're or even i'm wrong i might still be able to squeak out a pretty decent gain for being wrong on a company and that's really what we're talking about here our fifth stock dollar general guys look at dollar general year-to date down 45% last 6 months same thing last 3 months 37% down that's a huge drop for a company that is supposed to do better when the consumer gets weaker so who knows if that's happening now they are on fire this year with a clear strategy to capture new higher income customers that might make you laugh but it's actually true the average household income of a shopper has jumped from 40,000 to almost $75,000 the company's expansion plans are on also on another level with a plan to open 2,300 new projects in fiscal 2024 including story remodels and international growth with pop shelf locations and misup dollar general stores and mexico that's not all dollar general is also making smart moves to boost its efficiency investing $150 million in labor to improve their customer service and inventory management their plans are to maintain a 6% operating margin but with a goal to return to its historical levels of 8% they are definitely setting themselves up for driving that bottom line long-term growth so let's take a look at this dollar general big difference between market cap and enterprise value probably a lot of those leases in there guys the roic is not as high as that expect for a company like this but look at this price of free cash flow 10 5year price of free cash flow 11 a half they pay out a lot in dividends here 3% dividend deal is probably grabbing a lot of attention and a big part of that it's probably driven by the fact that their all-time high was 260 a mere two and a half years ago and it recently hit a low of $73 just last week that's a big difference which is probably why this dividend yield is so high when it was back at 260 it's essentially a 1% dividend yield so this is how you run those dividend yields to get higher numbers and the good news is this dividend of 500 million they're safe on that one the last 5 years they've done a billion and a half in free cash flow they can easily afford this dividend any way they cut it i am surprised about it's 30% gross margin and this 5year profit margin of 6% has been hit in the last year at 3.6% so guys these numbers are good not insanely awesome but they're good and for a company that's down 75% it's something to take a look at now let's see what these eight pillars are telling us okay we have a few issues here here's what's interesting revenue growth up 8.5 billion yet net income is down almost a billion and free cash flow is down a billion and a half so i want to understand why that is i can understand free cash flow if there's capital expenditure growth so let's go look at our capex here real quick and see if there was a big surge in capital expenditures by going to our cash flow statement scrolling a little bit down here the first line of the investing section 1.7 billion yeah big jump a billion dollars in free cash flow in capital expenditure increase and here's the thing that billion dollar increase was not met with cash from operations increase we're talking about bar barely an increase and so that's the big driver of why their free cash flows lower is their capital expenditures the question is is this reasonable is it good for them are they going to invest this money to get that growth that the company needs don't punish a company that's investing in itself if the investing is smart because there's definitely an increase here just like it was an increase from 2015 to 2019 these are the questions that you have to ask and these are the reasons why having this kind of software is important because you see this change immediately and you go wait a second how does this company increased their revenue by 8 and a half billion and they decrease their cash flow by 1 and a half billion you have to ask those questions and those are the things that a lot of average people are never going to know that's why you're above average by being here so let's see what the analysts are saying about dollar general all right 770 eps to 1216 pretty decent growth couple a couple decreases here but then back to growth here in future years according to the analyst and guys at $12 that's basically six to seven times uh the stock price right now but look at this revenue growth pretty consistent 6% five and a half five and a half six and a half six and a half all right so with inflation cost of living going up these c their their revenue is going to grow but also with growing their stores and making more stores and making their other stores more efficient that can really help their revenue growth so the question becomes our final question stock analyzer tool what is dollar general worth to us so i did a 10-year analysis 3 five and 7% revenue growth i did 5 and 1 half 6 and a/4 and 7% profit margin their free cash flow is lower but it seems like they're investing a lot in the company so it could be okay and i did 13 15 and 17 times earnings they're currently selling for 12 and 10 times their earnings in a 9% desired return hit the analyze button and guys don't forget $7 for 7 days click that link below to try out our software wow this might be interesting 100 to 140 210 to 290 150 to 200 in the middle with a potential return of 20% per year if the middle assumptions occur that includes the dividend so if you want to see our latest video on our stocks at a 52e low watch this next video thank you very much for your

2024-11-30,pR29gUOlWOg,"kind: captions language: en as a stock market is trading at alltime highs the most common question i get is should i wait for stocks to crash before i buy i completely understand this concern as you're trying to protect your investments and it sucks to see your money fall so much so quickly potentially in a crash in this video i'm going to provide you with two different answers one on when to be cautious and another one on when to consider buying more this is my famous stock market the gdp ratio going back to 1928 i made it based on the s&amp;p 500 and it's equivalent to before 1957 when the s&amp;p 500 started guys we're currently at 117.5 overvalued that takes our fair valuation today to 2737 now those of you who are new to the channel are probably like what the hell that's over a 50% drop to get to normal levels guys this is just data i'm not sitting here saying this is 100% fact cuz things can happen and i've been saying market's been overvalued for a long time even before we were at 3,000 on the s&amp;p what is that mean well it just means that be ready for a bumpy ride ahead 5 or 10 years from now probably won't be as good as the last 5 or 10 years but it doesn't mean you stop and i have a great piece of data for you coming up that will show you how valuable what i'm saying is but you look at this and look at history based on undervaluation and overvaluation when we're for 40 or 50% or more overvalued the next 10-year average is .2% on the s&amp;p not including dividends guys we're 117% overvalued this is just for 40 or 50% overvalued when you're undervalued look what happens your returns are much better guys is it a coincidence that as we go from undervalued to overvalued our returns go lower it is not a coincidence the more you pay for something the less you make the less you pay for something the more you make more on that shortly with even more incredible information so guys now this is the mag7 in our software we have a great tool called the eight pillar portfolio it allows you to put certain stocks in show them how many shares you have and see how they look as an eight pillar perspective okay i made these basically all an equal portfolio on the mag 7 tesla google microsoft meta amazon apple nvidia they're basically 14 to 145% each guys here's where we stand the seven largest companies in the stock market as a whole are selling for 54 and 59 times earnings and free cash flow over the last 5 years my goal is to be under 22.5 now these are incredible companies everything else is a check they have low debt they have high-f free cash flow growth high net income growth high revenue growth high return on invested capital these are top quality business businesses but you've got to remember a very true sign of investor it do you think it's possible to overpay for a good thing if you think yes you're probably an investor if you think no you're probably going to be very very poor soon now guys i don't mean that to be a jerk and i don't think you're really going to be poor but you're probably going to end up losing a lot more money than you like the stocks that take the s&amp;p and nasdaq up are the ones that are going to bring it down and this is not new this is the way it is all the time the biggest drivers of the market when the tide finally turns bring it down but that gives you opportunity in the future now let's go back to 2000 guys there are three companies i want to go over amazon intel and cisco intel and cisco were the nvidia of 2000 they were the ones that everybody said you cannot make money unless you have intel and cisco they're absolutely a must for every portfolio well guys here is the max chart for intel see anything interesting here alltime high a august 28 2000 $75 a share it has not reached that point since now you know the interesting part is as i'm sure you guys have seen me say before in the last 12 months intel did 54 billion in revenue guess what it did in revenue back in 2000$ 33.7 billion so it's it's doing more revenue today than it did back then and by the way that 54 billion after it fell a huge amount in revenue it's trying to build itself back up all right let's go to cisco cisco has the exact same story from a chart perspective all-time high march 27th 2000 of $82 a share has not seen that since well let's go to the financials income statement $53 billion in revenue in the last year and in 2000 it did 19 billion this is almost three times greater size company than it was back in 200000 if i told you in 2000 when you were paying $80 per share for cisco and said hey the company's going to be three times bigger where do you think the stock price would be you just said oh my god it's going to be so much bigger would you thought it' be $57 25 years later probably not and guess what guys it's not like it's selling for a super cheap amount of money it's 20 times free cash flow and 25 times earnings it just goes to show how overpricing would be now let's go look at amazon amazon's a beautiful one because one most common thing i hear nowadays about bitcoin or about these companies is i will never sell these companies these companies are incredible well guys in order for stocks to go down people have to sell them that's what drives the stock price down amazon what you're not going to see here is right back here this looks like a chart that just goes straight up well let's do a custom chart here this is the chart from january 1st 1998 to december 31st 1994 guys this is many many years all-time high split adjusted 553 per share the low 28 cents per share 553 down to 28 if you think for 1 second that you'd have been the person that held this all the way down i think there's going to be a rude awaken you this is a 95% fall in stock price and guess what a lot of people said oh look amazon sucks and now it's at $200 almost $200 a share that's the point here guys the thing i keep repeating in the short run stocks are a voting machine in the long run they're a weighing machine so the lesson to be learned from this right now is to be cautious when buying individual companies buying individual companies can be a very tumultuous road because one you have to rely on that company two the people out there in general are going to love or hate companies and the ones that everybody loves tend to go up in price a little too far out of sync from valuation and that can be difficult and the ones that are falling everybody hates and will blast and say these things suck and you have to sit there and be okay buying them that's very very difficult now guys this is the s&amp;p 500 from january 1st 1998 to december 31st 2010 look at this it peaked in 2000 11 years later it had not reached its previous high when you overpay for something out of whack it can take a while to recover there is a way to make money along this way but it takes discipline it takes just removing your emotions from the situation that can be very hard to do again i don't know this what the next 10 years is going to look like i have no idea do i think it's going to look like this probably but i've been wrong for last three since covid started i've been saying markets overpriced again back in late 21 mid 21 early 21 you look at the saying well paul's just a dinosaur maybe i am but think about it logically if this phone is worth $1,000 are you going to make more money paying 1,500 for it or 100 for it if you don't understand that concept you should not be investing money the whole point is a good thing if you pay too much is a bad investment that is the difference price versus value my goal is to buy when value is above price not the other way around and right now and for a while now price has been above value but as long as that keeps on marching like it did in the late 90s it can feel like it's okay now guys this is the nasdaq qqq this is back january 1st 2000 it surged to start the year and this is all the way in december of 2016 this is 16 years later 16 years later and it was about even it took 16 years to recover and in this time frame it fell 83% and guess what at this point people thought tech was dead at this point people told me microsoft was a dead company and you shouldn't own it at this point microsoft was one of the few companies you had to own in your portfolio microsoft's revenue and profit and qqq's revenue and profit was much higher here than here and yet people were following the stock price that's what i want you to understand now the good news is there's a way to make money off this and you might be surprised how good the profit can be it is going to blow your mind now guys this is an excel sheet that i made investing on january 1st of every year going back to 2000 so remember that's basically the peak of s&amp;p 500 in the peak of the nasdaq in 2000 up until today guys the results are shocking if you invest the same amount of money in the in the s&amp;p you would current $6,000 a year $500 a month from january 1st until now you'd have $742,000 today which is equivalent to 11.5% per year return this 11 half% is amazing because you know what the actual s&amp;p did from january 1st until now 7.4% per year this is outperforming the market by over 4% per year how does that happen well because you invested while stocks fell and as you can tell the returns get better as stocks are lower and it's even more crazy for qqq that took 16 years to reach its previous peak if you dollar cost average $6,000 a year into that one your returns were 15.32% per year compared to 7.88% per year if you if you invested at the peak which by the way is still an amazing number now you might sit there and say yeah paul you keep saying the market's overpriced exactly and let me show you something interesting let's assume the s&amp;p would have fall 50% from today and qqq would have fall 65% from today what's the return difference as of right now well dollar cost averaging in s&amp;p 6.85% dollar cost averaging in the nasdaq 8.46% that's with a 65% fall in the nasdaq as of this very second and a 50% fall in the s&amp;p which if those things happen again it's compared to 4.69% of the s&amp;p and 3.32% on the nasdaq so what does this mean dollar cost averaging works it takes the thinking out of everything all you have to do is just robotically buy good indexes at low cost that's it and if you do that you will wake up a very very wealthy person you could have tried your hardest from 2000 until today and i guarantee you you would not have made 15.32% per year i can absolutely guarantee that so imagine buying an etf that would give that to you now you might sit there again and say but paul this is alltime highs today yeah but i had you starting at all-time highs as well so i picked the worst pine possible to start investing and it still made sense and i guarantee if we took these numbers back to 95 it would be even better and that's the big thing guys and when it comes to retirement i always use my retirement calculator because retirement calculator sits here and allows you to make assumptions about the future on your returns and i always tell people be more conservative in that regard but imagine waking up 25 years from now and after the market has fallen 50% 60% in some cases still being able to put in 7% returns for your worst case scenario that's a pretty powerful place to be now look at this amazing thing the nasdaq fell 83% this is our nasdaq part if you had invested at the peak of the nasdaq you'd have made 546 per of your money two or three years later when the nasdaq bottomed every dollar you put would have been 233% growth to today that is an amazing number so for those of you who say paul i'm a little bit of a risk taker and i understand these valuations how can i really make money on that very simple when our valuations are below historical put more money in just put a little bit more money in as it becomes more and more undervalued put more money in find a way to add more money to the markets and what you're doing is you're buying $1 of cash flow cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and if you do that you are going to wake up so incredibly wealthy because at some point the markets will turn in 2000 2001 and 2002 the market had negative years all three of those years that had never happened before and then we went into a nice bull market and then we had another bad year really awful year and then we went into a 156e bull market those will always happen eventually just like we will eventually have a bad market we'll eventually have a long-term bad market when i have no idea i'm currently buying stocks in this market and i'm finding value but it's very difficult and i do believe that based on these numbers all the companies i've bought today will be considerably lower than they are if what i think is going to happen does happen you know what i'm going to do i'm going to buy more i want to change your perspective from fearing overvalued markets and worrying about how to protect yourself from the next crash to being excited about the opportunity to buy stocks at cheaper prices morgan howel always says every past crash looks like an opportunity every future one looks like a risk spoiler alert they're all opportunities the question is can your stomach realize that many people i knew many people who quit investing back in the 2000 crash and many people around you today that say they'll never sell something absolutely will bail they will stop investing when the next crash happens it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when they will lament their losses and claim that wall street always comes out on top and there's some excuse because of blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah there'll be some story that everybody comes up with that will feel so incredibly true at that time it'll feel so incredibly true in 2009 the world was worried about having money the world was worrying about banks all shutting down if there's not more of a fear than that then what is and guess what we came out to a bigger stock market for the next 15 years but people who bail are those who fail and you need to align yourself with like-minded people who won't quit if you surround yourself with a people who think like this you will do better in the long run take an offensive mindset when it comes to in when you have a longterm time horizon in front of you surround yourself with the people head in the direction that you want to go and never stop investing when stocks fall the vast vast vast majority of the lemmings out there will also sell off their holdings and they'll have every excuse in the book as to why they are i had a conversation two days ago with two people about investing in bitcoin and both of them said they would never sell bitcoin ever i thought to myself i've heard this before guy spear writes in his book the education of value investor he had value investing friends who saidi believe in buying something when it's fallen in half and guess what they bailed and he said wait a second what happened to our value investing

2024-12-02,m2CJohw7tJ4,"kind: captions language: en we have three stocks trading at or near 52- we lows and these are what our community voted on inside of everything money so why do we look at companies that are at 52- we lows well it's a great place to start it's a great place to find possibly hidden value there's usually a reason why stocks are falling out of favor and when they start to get to their 52-week lows prices can get very interesting and that's why we take a look at these so stock number one pepsi everybody knows pepsi uh pepsi is is at $165 a share right now let's see what the 52e low is it is just a few days ago 15585 now this is an interesting company because when we start looking at some of the main metrics of them look at the market cap 226.11 billion and you come down here to the enterprise value very very interesting $300 billion the difference is the debt i would expect to see on a company like this where you see a higher market cap maybe they would be switched 300 billion here 226 here that's not the case this is a company that really doesn't have to deal with any debt and that is a great thing when we're starting to look at big companies especially these conglomerates let's look at a couple of other things return on invested capital i absolutely love that anything higher than 10% to me especially when we're looking at something with a market cap of nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars that is a very rare thing to see it's rare to see companies this large that are very good at reinvesting in themselves if we come over here to the gross profit margin very large number about 55% the profit margin is very stable at about 10% h anything else that i'm noticing here the dividend okay so they oh i don't like that so they have a three% dividend that pays out7 billion their average 5-year free cash flow is 6.52 so they are paying out more money and this is what i don't like about these companies when you think about companies like at&amp;t fizer pepsi maybe probably coca-cola maybe coca-cola is a little bit different i hate when they just pay a dividend for the sake of paying a dividend especially when you have a return on invested capital over the last five years a 14.5% why are you not going and investing in yourself why are you not doing other things to grow the value of the company that way versus paying out some dividend that you really can't afford at this point based on the cash flow that's coming in but we'll leave it there for now now also when you look at this free cash flow is pretty significantly lower than the net income so there's a couple of good things here couple of bad things here i like to see free cash flow a little bit higher i don't like to see this dividend this i like but if you're not utilizing it what the hell is the point um the return on invested capital is growing too you can see that it's increasing over the last 12 months so let's look at the eight pillars here real quick and see what we have all right all right i like to see that our shares outstanding are sitting relatively the same the five-year free cash flow number and the 5year pe not terribly surprised this after what we just saw on the other uh metrics chart i'm not surprised about this i'm really not too worried about it i like to see the revenue growth and this is the mo most important thing cut the dividend and start reinvesting in yourself that's what i don't understand why are you not reinvesting in yourself when you have the capability to do so especially at the scale that they do pepsi is a global brand with consumption figures that truly boggle the mind worldwide the brand claims about 23% of the soda market a significant share compared to coca-cola which has the dominant 45% number this means that nearly one in every four sodas consumed across the globe is part of pepsi's vast portfolio which includes heavy hitters like mountain dew gatorade tropicana but they aren't just a beverage company every day over a billion servings of pepsi products are consumed globally a billion and they have a snack division that generates more revenue than the beverage division in the us alone pepsi products hold a commanding 30% of the soft drink market and 23% of the global snack market the lays brand alone produces 4 billion bags of chips annually the only company with a larger revenue and snack space is nestle and in fact pep pepsi is two times larger than mars which holds the third largest snack revenue globally think about that now let me show you these brands this is absolutely wild and to me i thought of pepsi as like pepsi aquafina that's about it but look at this aquafina brisk bubbly captain crunch and you we think about the snack brands doritos cracker jacks that's been there for quite some time grandma gatorade fritos funions um this jack links beef jurgy life water i've seen that everywhere let's continue here miss vickies that's a chip that i know a lot of people like muscle milk ocean spray popcorners that's supposed to be your healthy uh popcorn chip thing leaf uh pure leaf quaker ruffles oh my goodness they they have partnerships with starbucks spits which are the best sunflower seeds out there if you haven't had them try them tazo soda stream in general soie i i didn't know soie was still around but apparently they're still doing something this is just astounding to see not only the beverage brands but the snack brands that they command all right now let's go check out these analyst estimates and see what they have to say about pepsi so all right much bigger than i expected going from $8.23 the end of this year to the end of 2028 $10.75 it's actually mid singled digit growth it's higher than i would expect them to have on that side and on the re okay this is more of what i was expecting but i i expected it to be kind of the same so if we look at the revenue side going from 93 billion to 115 billion i mean mid single digit growth which is still rather high i was actually thinking it would be in the 2 to 3% range but hey if analysts analysts tend to be a little bit more aggressive than me doesn't mean that they're right doesn't mean that they're wrong just kind of gives us a guidance of saying okay where do we think that things are going to be so let's put in some assumptions to see what we would pay for pepsi to make it almost of value for us going into the future so when we look here at the stock analyzer tool it breaks it down to different categories and these are different assumptions that i'm going to make over a certain year period for this example i'm going to use a 10-year period because when i typically invest in companies i like to sit in them for an extended period of time so i'm going to put in a revenue growth assumption just like we saw on the analyst estimates i'm going to put in a profit margin assumption which they can do over a 10-year period free cash flow margin pe price to free cash flow and then i'm going to put in a desired uh rate of return which is my margin of safety which going to give me a little bit of a buffer of where i go and then it's going to tell me a couple of numbers down here what i should pay and what kind of return i'll get over the 10-year period so let's put in some numbers here so revenue growth analysts thought it was going to be in that mid single digit range i'm going to go with 1 three and 5% i'm going to give myself a wide range here profit margin they've been incredibly consistent at 10% i i kind of want to just put 10% across the board free cashlow margin slightly lower historically lower so let's go with a consistent uh actually you know what let's do cuz decreasing so let's put in 7% across the board i typically don't put the same numbers across the board when it comes to those assumptions but when i see a company that's basically doing the same return over a 10e period because this a five 10 year 5e one year over that 10e period i'm going to just stick with it pe i do think there's a premium to pay here i'll go with a little bit higher than i normally do and for my return i'm going to put in a 10% return an 11% return and a 12% return why would i increase these numbers here well it's definitely going to be harder for them to do 5% revenue growth versus 1% reven growth over a decade right therefore i should have a higher rate of return or i should expect a little bit more because if they do 5% which is going to be challenging i need to have a little bit of a buffer in there make sure that i'm making the right assumptions so let's go ahead and click analyze and scroll down and see what we have all right so if i were to buy today these are the numbers that i should be paying today based on the assumptions that i put in and these are the returns that i get so if i bought today based on those highest assumptions i would get a 3.48% return over the next decade if i bought at the lowest assumptions i would get a negative return over the next decade but you could see that my range is i'm going to go with the multiple of earnings 91 to 121 you can see that we're at 164 so even though the stock price is down and it's at 52e lows it's still a little bit expensive for my taste and if we go if we just go back here and we click on the metrics you can see here what's that pe sitting at pe sitting at 26 so that's kind of where i'm thinking that maybe we're still a little bit overpriced do i want to pay a premium for pepsi yes maybe not this much of a premium now stock number two lamb research this is a stock that was requested by our community and if we just scroll down here lamb research is one of the largest semiconductor water fabrication equipment manufacturers in the world they specialize in deposition and etch this is all chinese to me but let's go and look through the metrics because we could still break it down if we look at the market cap it's another one market cap about 93 billion enterprise value higher than the market cap very interesting i like seeing that kind of stuff let's look at our return on invested capital it's just going the same order 5year return on invested capital 29 a. half% now over the last 12 months it's slightly lower so we're going to want to pay attention to that is that something that's going to flow over time is it steadily declining is this just an off year is there something that has thrown off the return on invested capital we'll figure that out if we come over here to the pe it's about 23 and a half over the last five years consist it's pretty consistent it's about 23 gross margins um i actually would expect a little bit higher gross margins now i do like that the profit margin is increasing ever so slightly increasing but increasing but there's a there's things on here that i like now let's look at this dividend more than affordable dividend um again i it just bothers me when a company goes out and pays even a dividend like this a billion dollars you're paying a billion dollars paying 25% basically out of your free cash flow when you have a return on invested capital of 26% i don't i just don't understand why companies do this i just don't get it um let's see are they let's go to some financials here let's see are they buying back any shares um they are buying back shares what was the what was the pe okay maybe not the worst thing in the world let's check out the eight pillars here so really the only two things that are r are our valuation metrics price to free five-year price to free cash flow 5year pe and they're ever so slightly over to me this is definitely saying go and take a look at this because this is not much we're 23.4 6 my my my setup is for 222 everything else is telling me things are good can't say i absolutely love this basically the two things that i don't like so far can't say i love the shares outstanding um that they're that they have this buyback program and not only that let's look and see where we are at here so let's go okay so they've been buying back shares if we just look at this chart they've been buying back shares all along the way so even when they were at $110 a share they were still buying back shares i don't like seeing that i don't like companies that just buy back shares to buy back shares doesn't make sense to me um doesn't make sense to them either but hey it is what it is let's see what the analysts have to say here analysts whoa i don't know what that big jump is in 2028 i'm actually going to omit that i'm just going to look here we're looking from june of 24 already passed to june of 27 basically going up at a mid- teens rate on the earnings per share side and if we go to the revenue side 15 billion to 23 billion not as much growth as i expected to be honest with you i think on the high side maybe we'll put an 8% in stock analyzer tool now before we get any further let's talk a little bit more about lamb research lamb research is revolutionizing the semiconductor industry with its cuttingedge technology that powers everything from smartphones to supercomputers join the club special izing in etch and deposition systems this is what i talked about before where i don't really understand what they are if you're interested in a company like this go find it out so lamb ensures the creation of tiny high performance chips by precisely moving material and laying down ultra thin layers that form the foundation for the modern electronics there are actually videos that you can go watch on youtube that kind of show you this process it's actually pretty cool these innovations are crucial in the race to shrink chip sizes and increase its functionality over 60% of their revenue comes from advanced semiconductor systems lamb has a strong recurring revenue component to their business with $1.78 billion from its customer support services the company's footprint is global with about 37% of its revenue tied to china competitors include semis tokyo electronics asmt applied materials k asml and incor systems in terms of market maret share lamb comes in third with 7.52% of the market share versus asml with 15.5% and applied materials with about 13.5% so with all that said let's go look at stock analyzer and see what price that we can put on this bad boy so if we come over here to stock analyzer let's make some assumptions now the first thing that i notice here before i go any further over the 10-year period they're about 24.5% of roic then they climbed so so there was a climb somewhere in the last 5 years and over the last year so i like to see this this makes me say even more why are you paying this dividend you're really good at investing in yourself stop doing that now when i look at the revenue growth when i see a number like this ah i'm not going to i'm not going to put too much weight into that but let's go here and do let's do five seven and %. and you may look at this and say well why would you put in 5 seven and n when it was 12.6 and 10.4 well this number is starting to decline clearly there was something here that happened that is bringing it down now i'm saying to myself okay well now this number has to go back up so over the next decade i think that i'll be comfortable with 5 seven and %. so that's kind of how i rationalized my way to that one profit margin is increasing that's great to see let's go with 25 um let's go with 25 26 and 27% and i'm actually to do the same thing for the free cash flow margin these numbers should equal out to be about the same over that period of time i'm going to go 179 and 21 here i do think there's a premium to pay with as much um market share that they actually have and i will go with i'll go with 11 12 and 133% now with a growth company like this where things are constantly moving every and especially in the semiconductor space everybody is fighting for market share you're going to want to have discussions about these kind of comp companies rather than just going in and buying them this is one of the stocks that's discussed regularly throughout our community remember our community voted for it to be in this video now if

everything that we have to offer including all of our investing tools and most importantly the community it will be the best investing decision that you have made all year so now let's go look at the results from the assumptions that we made click analyze scroll down here okay this could be interesting so if we go off of the highest assumptions these are the assumptions that we made $71.68 is what we should pay today you can see that the current price is below that and if everything hit right here even with our margin of safety we would get about a 13.2% return over the next decade you can see on the low end it's about $50 in the middle it's about $6 so depending on the assumptions that you think are most correct and you do your own assumptions this is kind of where we're going to stand and if we change this to go without any margin of safety this means that we're just buying and we don't have any margin of safety in there you can see how the numbers change it's about $90 with about the same return uh current price is not going to change obviously and it's about 50 and 70 in the middle so you need to determine where and what assumptions you're going to make and this is where the community helps out so much all right third stock cvs this company has been battered and abused that's for sure so if we just come down here and look at some of the well actually let's look at this first $59 a share right now the 52- we low is $52 a share so it's a little bit over that was just about a week ago the 52- we high is 83 and the all-time high is 113 dang that is some that is some abuse so let's look at these oh my goodness gracious okay so if we look at some of these things market cap of 75 billion look at this enterprise value guys sheesh sheesh okay let's see what they pay out in a dividend this is the thing that starts to worry me about cvs so if we look at this and we say okay this a company that pays about 4 and a half% dividend it's $3.3 billion over the last five years can they afford it yeah but they were a very different company over the last five years now they have a free cash flow of 1.69 billion how are you doing this um return on invested capital 6% nothing to write home about out and you can tell that it's decreasing decreasing slightly but decreasing 5year pe look at the price to sales ratio of 02 the 5-year pe is 11 we're about a 15 pe right now gross profit margins of 14% and this is important to look at guys you have a five-year profit margin of 2% and over the last 12 months you're at 1.36 so the profit margin is declining that's not something that is very good and ah man all right let's go and look at the eight pillars actually i i want to look here just real quick the revenue is still up okay revenue is still up so this is going to start to tell the story right they are buying back some shares their debt we saw um is actually we didn't see it 7.68 i'm not terribly worried about this they have a ton of brick and mortars just sitting out there a lot of it probably has to do with leases obviously your 5-year pe and your five-year price to free cash are going to come in soundly i'm worried about the cash flow um i'm worried about the net income growth there's a lot of things that i'm worried about here this is another one where i would not hesitate to chat with the community about and with that cvs has fallen recently due to a combination of factors they have they've had declining profit margins in its retail pharmacy stores they've increased costs with its insurance division of etna they have repeatedly cut their earnings outlook they've had recent layoffs to cut costs the rec replacement of their ceo karen lynch to david joiner what does this all mean going forward there's a lot of moving parts here well c cvs there's still a leader in both the retail and the healthc care space with over 9,000 locations ensuring 85% of americans live within five miles of a cvs store just think about that each year the company serves millions of people through its minute clinics the pharmacy services the innovation of its digital solutions processing more than 2.3 billion prescriptions and pharmacy claims per year polls that have been taken have shown that cvs pharmacists are trusted by 81% of consumers that's a very large number further cementing their role as a credible health care provider now back to etna cvs acquired etna in 2018 some of you may remember this and it was a gamechanger for both companies and really the broader healthcare industry valued at 78 billion the deal was a major move towards integrating healthcare services with cvs now combining its extensive network of retail pharmacies and minute clinics with etna's insurance capabilities the acquisition also gave cvs a unique opportunity to reshape healthc care delivery with a focus on local convenient care reducing the reliance on costly emergency rooms and hospital visits now with all of that being said let's see what the analysts have to say about all that and how they digested that information so if we come over here and just click on analyst estimates i am actually wow i'm surprised by this $535 this month december i it's november right now uh through 2028 1060 i'm actually shocked by this number i thought that it was going to be declining let's see what the revenue is doing okay revenue growth so maybe this is something interesting to look at i think if anything in this space management is my worry so far and that's just kind of what popped into my head right now 376 billion going to 456 and a half billion it's about uh let's call it 4 and a half% revenue growth over the next five years or yeah five years four years all right now let's put some numbers into stock analyzer okay now revenue growth okay the return on invested capital like i talked about right when we pulled this up and looked at the main metrics declining declining profit margins declining okay free cash flow margins declining oh boy revenue growth obviously declining so let's put in some stuff here uh this is going to be i i feel like this is going to be a turnaround play is so let's go with two you know what let's go two four and six and some of you may think that this is rather low but i'm going to go one i'm going to go one and a half and two and over here oh my goodness i guess i'll go with 0.5 one and 1.5 um pe i just don't think that there's anything that's going to get their unless they sell something off if they sell something off everything's going to change here let's go with 13 15 and 17 13 15 and 17 and then their desired return i'm going to go 12 14 and 16% why so high because th like i just said this could be a turnaround play this could be something hard to understand so based on my assumptions let's see current price is about $60 a share okay i think we should go off the multiple of earnings i don't think we should go off of the free cash flow at this point in time but let's look at it anyways so on a high side about $56 to $75 remember this if everything hits with that large margin of safety on the low end $16 to $32 12% margin of safety if you bought it today you're going to get a negative return over a 10-year period and the middle is about $ 35 to $50 this is a hard one this is another one that is very important to chat with in the community i think that that it is very important to have these conversations now there are three other stocks that the community has requested us to analyze you can click right here and go watch paul analyze

2024-12-04,-zRktItYN3U,"kind: captions language: en guys i am always looking to find the best stock to buy at any given time companies that are both great and trading most importantly at the right price right now i'm currently looking at five stocks from joel greenblat value investors club and i'm going to analyze them today to see if they're selling at the right price but first i want to analyze the top stock that youtube is absolutely in love with right now that top stock is palante tier guys this stock has absolutely ripped it's almost at $70 per share if you remember three years ago there was a guy this russian guy who's in hiding talking about paler stock going to 500 man it's on its way but it was 45 first went down to five and now has gone up to 70 and guys i said back at 45 i'm like listen i'm interested under $5 a share and i got to like 583 i never pulled the trigger but guys guess what the fundamentals have gotten way better they have got the free cash this company has gotten way better but there are some lingering issues i see with the company now 168 billion market cap on revenue of 2.65 billion it is selling for 63 times sales that's a lot does that mean it's not justified not necessarily if this company could grow grow its revenue 20 30 40% a year for a long period of time this could end up being a value play cuz guys growth is a part of value don't just look at this and think oh crappy company because it's selling so expensive yeah if it's going to go 3 or 4% a year this is insane but it's a great balance sheet $68 billion market cap versus essentially 168 or 165 billion enterprise value what does that mean it means they have more cash on hand than debt that means when you buy the company you're gu essentially getting it with no debt which is phenomenal and this company has amazing margins look at this 81% gross margin every extra dollar they bring in 81 cents of that is going to go to the bottom line before taxes and and overhead and that's incredible a company like this can grow their earnings and free cash flow like crazy there's a lot of major tailwinds helping this company guys look at these finan let's look at this income statement look at the revenue 600 million 740 million a billion a billion 5 a billion 9 2.23 last year this year in the trailing 12 months 2.65 so not as much as last year but still amazing growth in this company let's go check out their eight pillars to see how this is looking now here's an issue with palante here got a negative pe and a really high 5-year price of free cash flow okay fine that i can get away i can ignore going hey you know what it's a fast growing business they're getting five years is a long time on companies that just started showing profit i really don't want to look at that this doesn't bother me this is what bothers me 171% increase in shares outstanding now guys that means it almost tripled if they had 10 shares before now they have 27 major dilution i don't blame them issue the shares out people love the shares give them the shares but if you're a current investor in the company you're taking away a big chunk of the growth back in 2003 paler kicked off its mission with peter teal and alex karp and another crew of innovators on a mission to tackle the world's biggest data puzzles starting with counterterrorism if you remember back then 03 we were just two years outside of 911 terrorism was still a big issue now fast forward to 2008 they dropped their game changer which was paler gotham that became the go-to platform for government agencies to decode complex intelligence by 2010 they broke into the private sector landing jp morgan as a client and hitting a solid $730 million valuation but it didn't stop there in 2016 paler took disguise teaming up with airbus to save the company hundreds of millions of dollars on on its a350 production and guys with these companies that build airplanes that's a lot of money they also bagged a huge us army contract after fighting for their spot in the courtroom by the time 2020 roll around paler was raking the big bucks with $100 million plus deals with power players like the cia and the department of defense now remember paler has a great story behind it but you've got to merge the story with the numbers there are so many great stories out there of companies but if you don't believe that there's a price that's too high to pay for a great story then you're not an investor you're just a speculator because as professor oswa says a story without the numbers is a fairy tale and numbers without a story is an excel sheet you've got to be able to put those two things together and that's why we use a stock analyzer tool i sit here and can put in my assumptions about the future and it'll spit out a price to pay for the company that makes sense based on my desired return so let's pull up the last time i did paler to see what that valuation would have been i did it just last month guys i did a 10-year analysis i did 12 18 and 24% revenue growth per year now it might seem low but if you do the math on what they're doing right now this is actually a pretty healthy growth rate might be a little aggressive but i'm okay with that profit margin i went higher i did 1525 and 35% profit margin and for free cash flow i did 20 30 and 40% they did 42% the last year is it possible that this is too low yeah maybe it is now for pe and price of free cash flow i'm ignoring what they're currently at it's useless because you got to pay this is about the the the pe and price of free cash flow at the end of year 10 not today and in 10 years this company is going to be a lot bigger and in all likelihood this growth rate is going to slow so you got to sit there and put a reasonable pe and price of free cash flow i did 15 20 and 25 and finally guys i did 9% desired return you got to remember when you do your desired return you've got to see that you've got to get a premium to the market the 9 or 10% here is basically just the market return but if you're buying individual stocks you got to have that margin of safety how do you get a margin of safety you put a higher desired return in that's what's so great here so we hit the analyze button before we do our next five stocks guys we have a low price of 5 to six high price of 41 to 47 a middle price of mid to high teens that's without margin of safety so for me stock's a little too expensive for me right now now guys in the last 30 days across all of our youtube channels we have analyzed over 50 stocks and our community has

$5 per share i'm just kidding even that it'd be a better investment decision now these are the top five most written up stocks in joel green blad's value investors club stock number one lululemon lululemon is absolutely crushing it right now in 2023 they rak in a massive 9.6 billion doll in revenue 19% more than the year before they're not just sitting back with their eyes on the prize they're pushing it to a colossal $ 12.5 billion by 2026 and they didn't just grow their bank account they're expanding their footprint as well in 2023 they opened 56 new stores bringing their total to 711 stores across the globe they even made their debut in thailand marking a huge step in their international expansion this is all part of their game plan to quadruple their international revenue by 2026 but they're not stopping there lululemon is also laser focused on doubling its e-commerce revenue by 2026 they're blending the best of both worlds with a strategy that combines seamless online shopping and topnotch inore experiences to give you the ultimate shopping vibe but again is this a good story that is overpriced well let's pull up our stock analyzer tool and see what we did on lululemon in the past 10-year analysis guys 5 8 11% revenue growth this might be low if they're going to double their international sales in the next 2 years and increase their revenue another 25% from today over the next 2 years profit margin i did 14 15 and 16% free cash flow i went a little bit lower because of 10 years but i probably should increase this because it looks like free cash flow is catching up nicely now pe in price of free cash flow i did 15 17 and 19 even with the growing roic it might be a little low i might i probably should go higher and have a higher margin of safety so i'm going to go 15 19 and 23 may be a little more aggressive but again doing my 9% return you need a higher margin of safety hit the analyze button i got a low price of 200 high price of 480 middle price of 311 again this is based on you can analyze this yourself and decide what makes more sense for you stock number two sketchers guys another retail play right here sketchers smashed in 2023 they raked in 8 billion in revenue jumping 16.4% from the year before and the real kicker pun intended their direct consumer sales shot up a wild 24% but that's not all sketchers won a store opening spree launching 1144 new locations globally bringing their total to almost 5200 stores regions like europe the middle east and africa are popping with stores growing 49% and of course they didn't forget their online game seeing a 19.6% increase in e-commerce sales as part of their plan to crush it both in store and online and guys remember when they do it online they don't have to worry about the markup to other stores like foot locker or or or champs or wherever they're selling to at a at a wholesale price so what's the stock analyzer on sketchers i don't know if i've ever done sketchers let's see if i have i never have so i'm popping my cherry right here so i need some guidance here so i'm going to look at analyst estimates on the revenue growth side looking like double digit growth here but slowing so let's go to stock analyzer for 10 years i'm going to do 4 7 and a half and 11% revenue growth profit margin yeah it's increasing but still low and one thing i like is that their free cash flow in the last year has caught up to their profit margin even though in previous years it was not so i'm going to sit here and i'm going to do six 7.5 and 9% for pe you know the pe here is tough sketchers look at their roic not the best declining so maybe we do something like 13 15 and 17 and again our 9% desired return hit the analyze button the stock is currently at $68 per share oh interesting $52 in the low side 155 in the high 91 in the middle maybe this is why this is getting the atttention of the value investors club guys stock number three if you're comparing sketchers you got to look at crocs which was a very very big value investors club stock now crocs made an acquisition of hey dude they're trying to grow their market and try to expand their product line guys i thought crocs was were was a fad maybe it's not i see them everywhere and they're so practical for so many different things are they attractive be is in the eye of the beholder they whole giblets they look kind of cool i get why people like them people my family like them the females tend to make fun of the the guys who wear them i don't wear any myself but i see the practicality them our good friend on the channel mo he loves his crocs but again this is a company that has seen some up and downs what's interesting about them though is look at their price to free cash flow 5.6 and 7.8 look at their return on invested capital 18% and 19% over the last 5 years it's pretty incredible now their heydude portion is slowing but it doesn't mean the company itself is slowing in fact look at analyst growth estimates i'm actually surprised by this 3% 3% 4% 177% 7% so is this the start of something bad for crocs i don't know but somebody in the values investment club sees seems to see a lot of value in this so let's go see what our last valuation of crocs were now i went a little more conservative i did 03 and 6% revenue growth i did profit margin of 1720 and 23 same with free cash flow pe and price of free cash sl to 13 16 and 19 and 9% across the board for margin of safety my desired return guys i think you need a higher margin of safety for this this company is one of those that could i mean is it a fad or is it going to continue growing i don't know but hit the analyze button the stock's at 110 this is why it's interesting to people a low price of 133 high price of 350 middle price of 218 so guys here is what i'll say about crocs if crocs is going to be around for the rest of the time and they're going to grow even at four or five% a year this is a no-brainer right because you look at this going i made my assumptions on 3% here in the middle the thing is look at their balance sheet they're easily handling this balance sheet difference of of of uh of debt here let's go look at their eight pillars an eight pillar thriller so that's what's interesting about these companies you can find great numbers the question is is the market perceiving this to be a fad or do you know something better because if this isn't a fad this could be a very great buy right now but for me i like to invest in companies that i i think are very very high likelihood to be around for decades to come i'm going to make less return for that because it's more of a sure thing versus something like crocs but that's why the upside potential in crocs is so big stock number four match group guys they're also on fire with q4 revenue of 2023 jumping 10% year-over-year at $866 million fueled by massive gains from tinder and hinge tinder brought in $494 million up 11% while hinge skyrocketed 50% to $116 million in revenue the company's revenue per pair rpp served 177% hitting $18.67 with the big growth seen in americaas in europe on top of that match group has been crushing it on the cost side boosting adjusted operating revenue by 27% and expanding its operating margin to a solid 42% they're also sitting pretty with almost $900 million in cash proving that they're in great financial shape as they continue to grow and expand and don't forget guys where's the expansion worldwide how many people in poor countries are using these apps zero imagine that growth as they expand internationally that's what's incredible so let's pull up our stock analyzer as we see this company go from an all-time high of 182 about three years ago to a low recently of $27 per share back in may that's a big big drop is it justified well that's the question we have to ask ourselves so let's look at match group i did it about 6 weeks ago i did 3 6 and 9% revenue growth i did profit margin of 104 and 18 guys look at this free cash flow way higher than their profit margin i did 22 25 and 28 even though the last 5 years they did 39% gross free cash flow margin so i'm probably being too conservative here but i don't like seeing this inconsistency here that's what kind of worries me but i haven't done a deep dive into it that's where your advantage as a as a person who understands match could be better 15 18 and 21 on the pe in price of free cash flow and 9% desired return hit the analyze button boom this is why it's interesting focusing on free cash flow 43 on the low side 106 on the high side it's currently at $33 per share is this worth it this middle 19 and a half% potential return could be interesting stock number five excelis technologies guys this company hit a high of $21 per share about 15 months ago it is now at $76 per share these guys are part of the semiconductor game they're in that area they're crushing it in the semiconductor space posting an impressive $1.13 billion in revenue for 2023 which is a solid 22.9% jump from the previous year this growth is driven by surging demand for its puran product line which continues to dominate the ion implant equipment market but they're not slowing down they're making smart investments in their future with with a strong cash reserve of $870 million and a focus on research and development and cost efficient production strategies to keep the momentum going with these solid growth numbers the market leadership and the forward-looking financial strategy excelis is well positioned to keep delivering strong returns in the semiconductor industry as this industry continues to expand and grow now guys i made my assumptions here now the semiconductor industry has surged and it's coming back down but you have to ask the question what does the next 10 years look like especially for a company that's trying to lead the market so i did three six and 9% revenue growth okay way below their last 10-e growth of 18.38% per year profit margin i went lower because they crushed it the last few years so i'm assuming a little bit worse i did 13 16 and 19% for profit margin and free cash flow for the

2024-12-07,7YuoLtkwuV0,"kind: captions language: en bitcoin it's called a digital gold it's called the future of money and it's a hedge against inflation but what have i told you that bitcoin might actually be the biggest financial scam of our time today we're pulling back the curtain on the crypto ecosystem exposing the fraud manipulation and speculative hype driving bitcoin and why you should think twice before investing bitcoin story starts with three key selling points that makes everybody's panties get all excited a limited supply of 21 million coins decentralization of a currency and freedom from government control this was the premise behind bitcoin and why it would be a great changer for how we interact with each other financially but when you strip away all the budge words here's the reality bitcoin has no intrinsic value no earnings no dividends if you think it has intrinsic value you are going to lose a lot of money in some way shape four maybe not on bitcoin but on some other thing its entire worth depends on people believing it's worth something more tomorrow than today you're hoping that you wake up tomorrow and somebody else says i will pay you more for that so you might sit there and say well you've said that before everybody keeps saying that it keeps going up in value that's what happens during hype look at the tulips back in the 1600s why do those keep going up in value if bitcoin feels familiar it's because we've seen these speculative bubbles many times before and we will never stop seeing them think about cannabis stocks like tillay which skyrocketed to $300 in 2018 before crashing into a141 a 99.5% loss electric vehicle companies like neo peaked at 6699 before plunging to 470 workhorse going bankrupt tattooed chef going bankrupt and going under what do these bubbles have in common a story that's too good to resist and prices that can't be justified but more importantly human envy and fomo people can't stand being the ones missing out on the skyrocketing price now i realize we're doing this video during a time when bitcoin cannot stop going up so of course you can look at this going paul you're wrong i could be wrong but let's understand what an investment is because a lot of people say i'm investing in bitcoin and i always write immediately speculating in bitcoin and guys there are other things that people speculate into that i've done artwork baseball cards these things are all speculative why they don't create anything they don't anything but when you buy a stock of a company that's generating cash if the market went away for that company tomorrow you would still have access and a claim to the free cash flow in the bank account and the assets of the business and until the stock market open again let's say 20 years down the road that business would continue to get more valuable as it drove revenue and profit but let's take away the value of bitcoin how are you going to interact how do you know what your bitcoin is worth before you buy something supporters claim that bitcoin could one they replace fiat currency or rival gold as a store of value but there's no clear road map or economic foundation supporting these claims as of now and people who try to say that what about gold yeah what about gold gold has thousands and thousands and thousands of years of evidence that is it has other uses besides just a backing of currency now we don't use it to back our currency anymore which has led to massive inflation but how is bitcoin the solution for that when bitcoin itself is valued in the very it wants to replace why was bitcoin created it was created originally to keep transactions away from the government guys you think the government's ever going to allow that if the us government ever thought that people were getting away with defrauding them by using bitcoin all the government to do is say bitcoin's gone it's done another thing that's interesting whenever i hear people talk about the merits of bitcoin i say great tell me how you value bitcoin and they list all these things about bitcoin and i say okay you said a lot of qualitative things which is wonderful now let's change the price of bitcoin by adding two zeros are all your statements still true yes they are okay let's take three zeros away are all your statements still true yes it's not an investment because if i look at a company like microsoft and i name all the reasons why it could be a good or bad investment if i add two zeros to it it becomes a bad investment immediately those statements aren't all true if i take two zeros away those statements are even better but with bitcoin as much as i hear people say the fun fals there there's limited supply guys i can take a dump in a bag it's the only bag of my feces in the entire world does it make it valuable not necessarily because you have to have a use for that and you might sit there and say paul you're missing it there's so much use for bitcoin guys i own eight businesses upstairs i own a thousand apartments i own luxury rentals around the world not one time ever in all of these things i've done has anybody said to me paul do du accept bitcoin not once now the internet there was a lot of fraud and speculation on the internet didn't mean the internet was a fraud and that's why i always say crypto and its current essence will not succeed it could change the us government came out and said we're making bitcoin our official currency but my guess is then that the price of the currency will still drop in the long run why because it has to equate out and there's too much euphoria around it there's too much fraud right now look at the people around you who love crypto if you've been around investing for a long time these are the people who always get burned let's look at some of the problems with this early adaptation of bitcoin in 2022 ftx raised over $1.8 billion from investors promising safety and transparency behind the scenes founder sam bankman freed funel customer funds to his trading firm alator research the result a bank reed that temporarily wiped out billions in customer funds according to the sec now they were all made whole at some point but it took a long time time and it took a rebound of bitcoin's prices for that to happen in 2023 bance and its ceo cz who claimed to be the adult in the room pled guilty to federal charges of money laundering and failing to register as a money transmitter guys if it's supposed to be under the radar and away from government control why are these things happen the department of justice's $4 billion penalty marked one of the largest in us history and remember guys this led to everyone requesting that the government regulate crypto which absolutely melted my brain crypto was created to avoid all the government scrutiny all these things to avoid government interaction and then the crypto people said please come save us guys this is proof that the world of crypto is running around with their heads cut off they have no idea what they want it's purely a speculative asset it generates nothing just like artwork but at least with artwork i cannot go create another van go now you might sit there and say well there's only 21 million bit coins allowed okay but guys it's coding at some point if they need to make more crypto they'll figure out a way more bitcoin if they don't they're going to create more and more cryptocurrencies which is what's happened over time at one point there over 20,000 cryptocurrencies out there in 2023 the fbi reported that americans lost $5.6 billion to crypto scams alone with investment fraud accounting for 3.96 billion of those losses the real cost of bitcoin isn't just in losses it's in the lives it disrupts the fbi highlights scams like pig butchering where victim victims are groomed to invest their life savings into fake crypto platforms in 2023 retirees has lost over 1.6 billion to crypto fraud making the most targeted demographic crypto's decentralized nature makes it an easy playground for criminals from hackers to scammers now bitcoin's decentralized nature is often celebrated as a technological breakthrough but it's also made crypto a prime tool for criminal activity and by the way that is going away there is no way the us government who owns crypto is going to allow crypto to have transactions without them knowing about it you might not remember but there was a time when crypto was being promoted as taxfree you can sell your gains and guess what the irs did no no no if that's an asset we want our change we want our cut between 2017 and 2021 bance the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange processed over $2 billion in transactions list linked to illicit activities including drug sales investment frauds and cyber attacks one notable example involved north korea's lazarous hacking group which laundered millions and stolen funds through the exchange this kind of criminal exploitation is not an isolated issue bitcoin atms have emerged as a new tool for scammers frauders impersonate government officials or claim fake emergencies pressuring victims to deposit money into bitcoin atms which are then transferred directly to scammer's wallets now guys you're going to sitting there going paul everybody has scams cash has scams you're right but there's this new cryptocurrency this new way of giving money do you think the government's going to allow that to happen in even more common fashion look at cash for example if you go to a bank and you open an account and any given year you deposit or withdraw in excess of 10,000 you have to sign for it you have to make a report to the irs about this that's how the government watches you so you think they're just going to let you do whatever you want with crypto without any regulation whatsoever you're out of your mind the government does not want competition almost every crypto company has been implicated in some sort of fraud or some sort of sec investigation nearly all of them in addition when you see assets being promoted by celebrities is that really an investment how often you see companies out there making commercials for birkshire hathway how often you see microsoft those guys making commercials for buy our stock but celebrities like matt damon tom brady kim kardashian have all pushed bitcoin and been sued for it making it feel legitimate to the masses ftx crypto.com these guys have even sponsored sports arenas and ran ads featuring a-list stars but these endorsements weren't about financial advice they're about ly in their pockets and doing more hype to promote the price the history of bitcoin has obviously been riddled with rises and crashes guys is that what you want to see from a currency that is the fundamental backbone of the economy that everybody thinks it is come on give me a break break in 2017 it hit a price of 144 in 2018 it hit almost $188,000 before crashing to the low 3000s in 2019 and then rallying all the way to 60,000 in march of 2021 falling again down to the low 30s recovering to 60,000 in october 2021 guys the ride's been insane but when you compare this to other assets bitcoin is compared to the price fluctuations simply don't occur but just like every other thing in the world when bitcoin does well the great stories follow when bitcoin does poorly the bad stories follow but what i have noticed is the correlation between bitcoin and qqq a highly technologically driven value driver in the us economy the bull case for bitcoin i believe is best examined by following its most popular and accepted experts and i put experts in quotes there guys michael sailor has made the base case for bitcoin stating that it'll account for 7% of global wealth which each with each coin being worth $13 million 2045 guys if you bought a piece of real estate that you wanted to be worth x amount of dollars you know what has to generate every year in profit to do that stock same thing but to get to those levels would require 29% returns per year for the next 20 years his bull case calls for almost $50 million per coin and accounting for 22% of global wealth by 2045 but guys remember this has nothing to do with fundamentals you might think it is it is not stop convincing yourself otherwise the best part is when i hear crypto people say they don't just they just don't understand i don't hear warren buffett saying that i don't see howard mark as saying that i don't hear any of the smartest investors who have the track record of doing so great over a long periods of time you know what they do they teach but when i see on twitter oh they just don't understand what don't we understand that every investment is the present value of all future cash flows and bitcoin has no cash flow the dynamics that make up bitcoin reaching these prices that microor has talked about include a fixed supply of only 21 million coins global accessibility and resistance to censorship and manipulation which will then lead bitcoin to become as valuable as gold which would make it worth $13 trillion now guys this journey also includes a new group of buyers like asset managers countries major investors buying into bitcoin i think part of the reason my personal opinion is they just don't want to miss out because so many people are demanding it give the people what they want included in this mix are wealthy individuals with billionaires claiming it's common for billionaires to have 1% allocation of bitcoin maybe so gold holds 3.9% of global wealth and bitcoin is just. 35% and if it grow to just 3% still below gold the market cap would be 20 trillion and push the price to 1 million per coin but guys again there's no fundamental reason behind that just like there's no fundamental reason behind gold yet we have thousands of years of data to show that gold has an ulterior use besides just being used at backing for for currencies but what's amazing about all this is it's all these speculators who are just relying on other people to see the value and i see that on twitter all the time look at it this way only this many people own crypto own bitcoin imagine when the masses see it that is not a fundamental investment case that is purely the greater fool theory somebody else will pay more for it than i did claiming it's basically digital gold and because of that it'll command the same percentage of global wealth that to me is not investment thesis it's a hopeful pipe dream the prominent investors howard marx warren buffett charlie munger monis p michael bur they talk about trading it they sit there even bur talks about trading it but they have skepticism towards bitcoin and cryptocurrencies buffett often referred to as the oracle of omaha has criticized bitcoin for its lack of intrinsic value stating cryptocurrencies basically have no value and they don't produce anything he further emphasized his stance by remarking i don't have any bitcoin i don't own any cryptocurrency i never will now a lot of people tell me well he said the same thing about tech no he never said he never will he said he doesn't understand it and therefore he doesn't buy it but now he understanding more tech companies like apple he started to buy some charlie munger buffett's longtime business partner was even more forthright in his condemnation of bitcoin he has described it as worthless artificial gold and liking its trading to just dementia munger has also compared bitcoin to rat poison and criticized the crypto cryptocurrency market for its association with listed activities monus p very person we've interviewed on this channel an investor known for his adherence to buffett's value investing principles shares a very similar outlook he's expressed doubts about bitcoin's future aligning with buffett ander views on our channel he said bitcoin and crypto is going to zero collectively these investors critiques highlight concerns about bitcoin's speculative nature and its perceived lack of fundamental value cau against its inclusion in traditional investment portfolios guys i hate to be a snob but i've never met somebody that i respected in the investment world who said they like bitcoin everybody i know who says they like bitcoin is somebody i would never ever talk to about investing i just laugh about it by the way do you many people tell me they're a crypto expert like every single person talks about crypto says they're a crypto expert that's really odd to me if you still want to get into it treat it as a gamble not an investment day trade it we believe in trading here trade it as an asset that's fine by me but diversify into traditional investments like etfs or assets with intrinsic value such as etfs that are driven by s&amp;p 500 always conduct thorough research and never trust unsolicited investment advice especially from social media or unregulated platforms the bitcoin story is absolutely captivating but the evidence to me is clear it's a speculative bubble fueled by manipulation fraud and hype from ftxs collapse to bance's record fines the crypto ecosystem is riddled with scams designed to benefit a few at the expense of the many don't fall for the hype understand what you're buying and just because you buy it with some sort of good story doesn't mean you're understanding what you're buying it has to be coupled with some sort of fundamental analysis if i've convinced you that there's a better way to invest join our community of like-minded invest

2024-12-10,ZU18sUIv18g,"kind: captions language: en i currently have 25 holdings in my portfolio with the largest being cash held in treasury bills i own 19 large cap stocks three small cap stocks and two etfs a very frequent question i get is which stocks are the largest positions in my portfolio so let's go take a look and analyze them right now now remember don't buy any stocks that i own or anyone in the internet that they own we're here to teach a process and through my holdings you will see understanding of my process and i'll be able to explain it better stock number one ali baba this has been a longer term hold for me it has gotten very popular in the value investing community it currently makes up 2.9% of my portfolio my cost basis is a shade under $100 per share and here is what i like about alibaba alibaba is one of the most dynamic companies in the world it's cloud computing arm ali bba cloud ranks as the fourth largest globally trailing only aws microsoft and google cloud baba holds 39% of china's cloud market share proving its dominance in one of the most competitive tech ecosystem then there's obviously the shopping aspect there singles day the shopping extravaganza that alibaba has turned into a global sensation in 2023 that event alone pulled in $ 84.5 billion in sales and saw2 million packages delivered crushing black friday and cyber monday combined on the financial side alibaba has been a great cannibalized of the company what that means is they're repurchasing their cheap shares they repurchased 52 million shares in the last quarter for $4.1 billion at an average price of $788 singly confidence in its undervalued stock guys when a company is buying back shares at a cheap price they are helping shareholders and it's not just the company buying in legendary investors like michael bur howard marks have significantly increased their stakes with bur adding 29% and marks boosting his position by whopping 83% recently as the price has fallen the juggernaut that's alibaba continues to grow and attracting big money and making big moves from these investors so with alibaba let's go take a look at this again you this chart a high of nearly $320 back in october of 2020 over four years ago it hit 320 per share now one thing i want you guys to know is all the negative stories today about alibaba and china guess what they were issues back here the only difference is they became an issue when the stock goes like this adr shares not owning the actual company that was an issue back here china communism are you telling me china was less communist back here than they are right here taiwan guys it might not have been on the forefront but it became it was still an issue back here these are the biggest issues i've seen with china now population growth people are saying well they just started losing population yeah but this is a country whose gdp per capita is skyrocketing even with population decline if they're not able to reverse that the amount of growth that china has gdp per cap is way ahead of the us and alibaba being a company that sells to the middle class is in a market of the fastest growing middle class in the world how is that a bad thing let's go check out the eight pillars on this company two x's net income growth roic but one thing i'd say is the net income growth has not matched the cash flow growth in fact in the last 5 years average free cash flow was 23 a. half billion yet average net income was only 15 billion way higher free cash flow i trust this number way more and guys when i hear people saying that baba might be lying about these numbers that was a concern of m years ago but when i see them reporting higher free cash flow than net income this is the number 99% of investors look at if they even look at this number this is their true number the cash coming into the business and they started buying back shares if they're defrauding everybody which they could be i will be open to that then why are they buying back shares is to perpetuate the fraud of the stock keeping been going lower maybe let's go see what analysts think about this company and remember i don't take much for analysts but it's a way of gaing now analysts are not seeing much growth in eps they're seeing growth up until 2027 and then dropping off in 2029 i have no idea why but as you see the number of analysts decreasing here as time goes on and revenue ironically just continues to grow 132 billion to 181 mid high single digits nothing to write home about but remember this guys you can still make a lot of money on a slow growth company let me show you guys a stock analyzer tool as you know if you watch this channel the stock analyzer tool is a way to sit there and say okay i have these assumptions about the future but what does that mean for what i need to pay for the company today this does that for you excluding the balance sheet you can do up to 20 years of analysis i always choose 10 first line right here revenue growth guys i did three six and 9% to me this is very low for a company like alibaba this is a company in china that has a fast growing middle class a recession in china is 45% real gdp growth so i got to think this company is going to grow faster but let's be conservative at 36 and %. profit margin i did 12 15 and 18 free cash flow i did 15 18 and 21 what i should do is make these equal because eventually the net income and free cash flow will pretty much equate out okay pete i did 16 18 and 20 and finally for my desired return i did 9% guys if you have the software don't do 9% this is 9 or 10% should be the market return if you're buying an individual company you need to have a higher desired return that gives you your margin of safety if you're not going to try to get 12 13% or more then just buy a lowcost etf don't bother with the hassle of it but you're going to see how interesting this alibaba play is hit the analyze button guys i have a low price of 104 to 130 high price of 285 to 330 middle price of 170 to 200 the potential is huge here doesn't mean it's going to work but when you're investing in a company you should ask the question of if i had 30 opportunities like this would i do well and the answer i think on alibaba is yes i will probably do well so i'm willing to make an a bet on that one stock number two sprouts farmers market it ranks as my second largest holding making up 2.9% of my portfolio but guys the reason being is my cost basis is a mere 35 a share i actually think it's a little bit lower than that but it has skyrocketed in value it is over four times larger so it started out as a much smaller piece of my portfolio now you might sit there and say damn that's awesome guess what it's not awesome i wanted to buy a lot of shares i didn't get a full position on sprouts i wanted to have one to one and a half% of my portfolio and sprouts as my initial buyin not growing into that so why was sprouts attractive to me well year to date it's up 29% which is not anything i care about after the company's october 31st earnings report investment heavyweights like bank of america capital and evercore raised their price targets by an average of 20% signaling imense confidence in the grocers momentum now remember when these companies increase price targets guess what i do i yawn i don't care these guys are based on momentum and based on all these other things that don't matter what i care is about the fundamentals of the bu business but sprouts is now a top five holding in the russell 2000 index reflecting its growing appeal amongst institutional investors and when institutional investors get in it can drive up the stock price but what do i care about i care about the fundamentals and here they are they posted 8.4% same store sales growth in the most recent quarter that is massive that was also in addition to 38% gross margin and nearly 5% % net income margins so 38% gross margin 5% net margin compare that to a company like kroger i believe kroger is in the 20 to 22% gross margin and in the 1.5 to 2% net margin way higher and guys this is only getting better for sprouts and here's why they're expanding intelligently they operate 421 stores with the goal of getting to over 1,200 across only 20 three states and they're building new locations that are actually 23% smaller to maximize efficiency that's going to help drive up gross margins and therefore bottom line margins the next wave of openings include states like virginia california texas and delaware with wyoming becoming the 24th state in its portfolio now with the mix of financial performance the strategic growth and market recognition sprouts is planting itself firmly as a leader in the natural and organic retail space but not only that the percentage of their sales coming from sprouts branded products is increasing every single year and the sprouts products instead of a 38% margin have between 50 and 60% gross margin as they drive their sales up in this area i could see this company potentially having 7 to 8% bottom line net margins at some point it's got to get into that but they've already increased their net margins to about 5% which is incredible look at the stock it is absolutely crushed now old paul would have sold this thing by now saying okay it's gone up too fast too i've learned my lessons stick with great companies and hold on to them there's going to be ups and downs but my job is to hold on to them they spend an average of $3.8 million to open a new store and their profitability is in their cash on cash returns are in excess of 30% per year once stabilized guys these are huge numbers i cannot tell you how massive those numbers numbers are this is a company that can grow three times its size just a number of locations and increase their profit from today's levels 50% or more on profit margin guys this is the makings of a multi multibagger and this company i think is going to be around for a long time now one thing i will say they could get acquired but i'm going to tell you right now that 150 that's a high price and we'll show you that here shortly but let's go look at these eight pillars right here guess what all check marks except for 5year pe 5year price of free cash flow it looks expensive but a lot of growth potential the question is is this a reasonable price to pay for the company is that reasonable 45 times 5-year free cash flow now look at their five-year free cash flow last year was 400 million 5ye average is 340 so not like it's insanely higher it's not like it it's like nvidia where they have 15 billion this year and the last 5 years is like 3 billion i don't know what the exact numbers are are but we don't see massive growth here so what kind of premium do you pay for sprouts let's see what the analysts think for their growth potential look at this guys they have sprouts falling 373 down to 347 per share in the next four or five years are they right i don't know with revenue growing from 7.75 billion to 10.13 billion almost a 50% increase in revenue again that seems kind of low if they're going to open stores every single year so let's go look at the stock analyzer and let's look up sprouts farmers market and what i put in here now guys 10-year analysis 68 and 10% revenue growth i did profit margin of 4 four and a half and five same with free cash flow probably being a little conservative but i'd rather make it based on my original assumptions right here pe 161 1922 same with price of free cash flow and my 9% no margin of safety desired return analyze button a low price of about 60 high price of 123 middle price of 85 so in my estimation i think it's overvalued but i'm letting my winners run i have stuck behind sprouts and i'm going to let them keep going now if sprouts all of a sudden went to 250 or 275 with these valuations still in place i might consider selling it going listen i don't know it just seems a little frothy can i put the money to better use that'll be determined later it's one of the hardest things to do in investing is when to sell your position target weighs in as my third largest stock position making up 2.3% of my total portfolio guys i started buying target at 135 per share all the way down to 105 a share was my last purchase as you can see down here it was back in october late late last year is when i started it got as low as $100 per share 99.66 guys i believe in target back here they were having issues with theft and same store sales de i'm sitting there saying do i see a world in which target goes away that is what makes investing hard we got to we get comments all the time like why would i buy a stock when it's going down because if it's fundamentally a good business that and the fundamentals are getting better or you see an end to the short-term crisis that's when you buy a company that's falling you see this you see this does it make it a better investment here than here that makes no sense guys the stock price is merely the market saying here's how much we like the company and that's it that's it it's not it's actually reflecting the fundamentals of the business and by the way i could be wrong on target i have no idea but if i have 30 target options 30 options like target to buy where i was buying them in the low 100s i would do that all day long target is a retail powerhouse they have over 1,900 stores they occupy 246 million ft of space making it the sixth largest retailer in the us by revenue third largest by volume trilling only walmart and amazon walmart dominates grocery sales accounting for 60% of their visits target captures a different demographic only 22% of target's customers come in for groceries with most shopping for discretionary items like apparel home furnishings decor and appliances now despite recent price fluctuations after earnings target's core business i believe remains strong the company reported impressive growth figures including a 10.8% increase in online sales 2.4% growth in foot traffic which is about 10 million incremental transactions and a modest 3% rise in overall comparable sales that 3% rise is not a lot but for a company like target it can matter when their same store sales were declining 3 and 4% recently in addition their rewards program target circle grew by 3 million members further in enhancing customer loyalty on the digital front target's cartwheel app is a huge success with 27 million users collectively saving $600 million through these exclusive discounts they offer this innovative app not only enhances the shopping experience but also drives significant savings for the consumer adding another layer of customer engagement to target's overall business strategy i do not think target's going away i think they're doing a great job of making their experience better for the people who love them and that's really important they are a $60 billion enterprise $13 billion with enterprise value which includes their leases and things like that 14% return on invested capital over the last five years free cash flow great people love this dividend 4.2% eats up half almost half of their last year's free cash flow not great not awful it's a lot but that's target's way of giving back you know what i prefer when you're selling for 11 times free cash flow and 14 times pe get rid of the stupid dividend and buy back 4% of the company every year but unfortunately this is why dividends suck because they cut that tomorrow the stock would plummet they have no incentive to cut that dividend even though dividends are absolutely tax inefficient eight pillars boom eight pillar thriller buying back shares which is great even with their long-term liabilities they're still selling for reasonable uh price long-term liabilities a 5-year free cash flow 13 times free cash flow 14 times earnings guys everything's a positive here fiveyear cash flow growth is greater than their five-year net income growth i like it i like it a lot let's see what analysts think about target well they're much more optimistic on target 8.42 per share here going to $13 and revenue growth of about inflation 3 4% a year you're not going to get much growth from that yeah you might get a little bit more because they're opening more stores but i really want to make sure you guys see that it's all about looking at these companies from a long-term perspective all these compan most of the companies i own i sit there and say do i see a world in which this company's going to be around for decades if the answer is yes do i think they're going to make more revenue and profit in the future than they do today the answer to that is yes the third question is can i pay a reasonable price price today that gives me an adequate return on my capital factoring in that future growth potential if the answer to all that is yes my question is why am i not buying and i sit that and see that with target at the prices i've purchased it at with my basis around 115 to 120 i i feel like i have a very good potential for a very good stock but of course you must use the stock analyzer tool to see that for yourself putting in your own numbers you might disagree with me on my assumptions here on a lot of these companies that's fine there's a reason why the stock analyzer tool is used over a million times every single year by our users they love to put their own numbers in they should your res return requirements are going to be different than mine your pe and price of free cash fl going to be different than mine your assumptions are probably going to be different than mine we might end up getting the same number but through a different path that's why this tool is so important it allows you to put numbers to the story that you're attaching and that's what good investing is so here are the numbers i assume for target 2 3 and2 5% revenue growth profit margin 375 425 475 same with free cash flow even though their free cash flow tends to be higher than their profit margin look at that higher in the last 10 five and last one year pe 15 18 and 21 i could argue it should be higher than that and a desire return of 9% now guys if you've been to our website you may notice that there's a weight list going on the reason being is our software right now includes all of our

of sitting there and saying h i like target at one you'll know exactly what price you want target at so to finish up target hit the analyze button i have a low price of 125 high price of 243 middle price of 175 and guys these returns here include that massive dividend so even at this price today it's looking pretty attractive based on my assumptions but again don't go based on mine you must do your own analysis paypal is my fourth largest stockh holding consisting of 1.9% of my portfolio i started buying at 85 all the way down to the low 50s and now it's at $85 per share so even my original purchase i'm almost even on if not even now being even up down that doesn't affect me in the short run what affects me in the short run is what are the fundamentals doing paypal is a company that was at an all-time high of 310 a mere 3 years ago and plummeted from there and the story is about paypal being dead guys paypal isn't just a leader in digital payments it's the number one payment processor in the world commanding 45% of global payments market venmo its peer-to-peer app has over 90 million active users with 26% of them being young adults aged 18 to 29 fueling the surge in mobile payments add to that 85% of paypal users base being millennials and it's clear that paypal has a young engaged audience plus its byy now pay later service has absolutely exploded growing by a staggering 8 167% showing the company's knack for tapping into trending consumer demand now the negative story on paypal was they have they have a short-term loss overall of active users but that's not the full story the better story is the number of transactions per user is up and the number the cost and the revenue per user is a lot higher and that's what matters here so a company like this generated 8.15 billion in free cash from the last year relative to 5.45 billion in net income and 6.57 billion average free cash flow compared to 3.76 billion in net income so the the play here is the free cash flow that is what matters here now look at this overall gross margin 45% bottom line about 15% and again that's net income gross margin not free cash flow so they have huge numbers growing here for a company that's dying that's a lot of free cash flow to have in the last year in the last 12 months this dead company has generated $7 billion in free cash flow compared to 4.2 last year 5.1 the year before 4.9 5.3 3.3 4.7 1.7 you get the point now does this mean it's a permanent plateau i don't know but the stock price and the story are not the same they're not matching up i think there's a mispricing here for the company so let's go see what the analysts think about this company look at this they have the company going from 466 earnings per share to 691 so much for dead revenue wise 32.3 billion to 45 billion in the next four or five years again so much for dead not massive growth but i look at this going okay well that's interesting to me so let's put the stock analyzer tool and see what my assumptions were in the past i did four 7 and 10% revenue growth profit margin here 12 and a half 14 half 16 and a half my free cash flow was a lot greater 16 20 and 24 i did 14 17 and 20 on my earnings and free cash flow multiple keep in mind guys it's selling for like 10 times free cash flow right now pretty cheap and my 9% desired return stock's currently at 85 i have a low price of 60 to 80 high price of 160 to 230 middle price of 100 to 140 i think there's a lot of upside here look at that low price right there just buying today and the low thing le low assumptions occurring can look at a 7.8% free cash flow return my fifth largest holding is hpq it makes up 1.77% of my portfolio with a cost basis where i started buying around $33 per share and lower and as you can tell i've had the stock for a while and as you can tell it's been in a pretty tight range for quite some time hitting a low early this year of $27 per share 2743 hp is on track to generate around 3.1 and 3.6 billion in free cash flow for 2024 now the reason that's impressive their market cap is 3.6 billion it's still at under around 10 times free cash flow with plans to return nearly 100% of that cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases hey guess what stop giving this dividend away 3.65% get rid of it this 1.33 billion in dividends buy back your shares 4 billion do in free cash flow last year they could have been using that to buy back 11% of the company every single year this reflects the company's strong financial health and commitment to delivering value to its investors additionally hp 's future ready plan is targeting 1.6 billion in gross structural cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025 a move that will improve margins and increase available capital for reinvestment into key growth areas on top of this hp is making significant strides in the digital space particularly through aid driven solutions and subscription-based services like the hp all-in plan now let's go take a look at their eight pillars here now a little bit choppy you've got declining net income decline in cash flow decline in revenue this is a declining business from all metrics looking at it and the reason though that i look at this is like well it's selling for a cheap price they're paying a dividend out and they're buying back a ton of shares if they can just buy back a billion or two billion dollars in shares every single year and figure out a way to stay stable and increase those margins with those with the cost savings this company could just be a company that stays stagnant if the stock price goes up look at this return on invested capital 132% a year for the last 5 years 62% the last year now obviously they can't redeploy that money at those returns but it shows that their their basis in the company is decreasing and they're buying back shares and making it so much better for the investor now let's see what analysts think about the company ironically there's still growth here accord analysts 340 a share growing to 440 per share in the next four or five years on earnings and revenue about the same 54 billion to 56.7 billion not much growth that's okay because i'm going to show you in our stock analyzer tool how this can absolutely actually help still the company do well guys look at these assumptions i made -30 and 3% revenue growth profit margin five six and a quarter seven and a half and even though their free cast fl is significantly higher than their profit margin i made their free cash flow the lower profit margin number pe 10316 9% desired return i hit the analyze button guys i got a low price here of 22 to 24 high price of 64 middle price of about 40 so buying it for low 30s and below 30 i'm pretty happy with now guys if you want to see the full 33 stocks that i want to own watch our next video thank you for your

2024-12-12,bXYPLZpnVrU,"kind: captions language: en guys we have three ai stocks that are being overlooked by investors with the potential for multibagger returns the first one terine now first whenever i hear terod i think about aero industries the company in the wolf of wall street that he selling at his first job at investors first but either way terine is like the ultimate robot tester for technology their machines act as super smart inspectors checking if everything works perfectly before these products hit the market they also build robots for factories that help with tasks like carrying heavy loads or assembling parts all this helps pterodon ensure that technology is reliable and factories run smooth now ai is at the heart of how pteridine works and mix money for their testing machines ai acts like a genius puzzle solver quickly finding mistakes in computer chips or electronics by learning patterns and spotting tiny errors humans might miss these machines collect massive amounts of data and ai sifts through it to find trends or warn when something might fail so companies can actually go in and fix the issues before they become a major problem now for their robots ai is like the brain that helps them learn and adapt in factories pterodon robots use ai to understand their surroundings figuring out how to grab parts move efficiently or avoid obstacles instead of programming every move ai allows these robots to learn new tasks quickly by observing and practicing ai also makes the entire process smarter by predicting when machines or robots might need repairs preventing costly downtime it constantly analyzes performance suggesting ways to make everything faster more reliable and energy efficient now here are some things on pteridine as a stock let's check this out right now well first off it's exactly basically a$2 billion stock with a great balance sheet cuz look at this and prise value essentially $20 billion so when you have market cap and enterprise value the same essentially means the net debt between is about the same is zero they've got a great 5year return on invested capital of 19% now the issue is we got 39 pe and a 44 price to free cash flow now guys if this is a company with massive growth potential these might be cheap i mean look at nvidia for example when nvidia was $100 a share before the splits so $10 a share today they probably looked a little expensive who would have seen this ai burst not many but those who stuck with the company saying this company can generate a lot of profit have been rewarded appropriately i'm not saying this is the next nvidia but i think these are companies that are being overlooked let's go check out the story on the eight pillars wow i'm actually surprised by this five x's three checks revenue is actually down over the last 5 years net income is down free cash flow is down all right so i'm immedately going i don't know about this one so we have declining revenue declining profit and declining free cash flow with really high price of free cash flow and pe okay i'm a little apprehensive about that how do you have a premium being paid for a company that's declining in revenue and profit i'm not saying it's fully declining but let's go check out the financials to see exactly what's going on i'm going to pull up quarterly all right so this last quarter 737 million in revenue versus 703 but look versus 827 2 quarters ago so it fell but maybe not might be rebounding now cu look 730 last quarter versus 684 600 versus 617 so maybe they're back on the upswing here so even though in the last 5 years the revenue and profit and free cash flow might be down they might be back on the upswing right now let's go see what analysts are saying about this oh wow look at this guys major upside analysts 320 per share in earnings in 2024 836 in 2028 almost tripling two and a half times if not more uh earnings per share and revenue growth pretty solid 2.8 billion to 4.7 billion all right not bad big jumps the next two years and then a little bit slower so guys we're looking at this thinking all right the story might be okay the potential for these robots is incredible the question question is can they implement so let's see our stock analyzer tool so guys here are the assumptions i made for pteridine i did 3 6 and 9% revenue growth because i'm looking out 10 years for profit margin i did 17 19 and 21 the same for free cash flow now if you look at the free cash flow over the last 10 years they've actually had more free cash flow than profit but in the recent five years they have not i'm hoping that stabilizes so i gave them the exact same numbers there now for pe 10year roic of 15 and a half fiveyear of 19% so it's a premium company high roic deserves a premium so i did 14 18 and 22 per um times earnings and free cash flow and then guys i did a 9% desired return now you shouldn't put in 9% 9% is the market 9 or 10% the market if you're buying an individual company you got to put a higher amount that would give you your margin of safety but i put it in here to kind of give me my in value what's this company worth according to this so i hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 120 yeah 42 on the low side 108 on the high side 68 in the middle so unless you think my assumptions are completely off on the low side it's still feels expensive based on what i've assumed here for the future stock number two tempest ai inc it actually has the name ai in there they have experienced significant growth with revenue increasing by approximately 30% annually over the last few years analysts project that tempest will achieve annual revenues exceeding $4 million by 2025 driven by its expanding partnerships in both healthcare and pharmaceutical tempest has built one of the largest collections of healthcare data in the world processing over 50 pedabytes of medical information guys so let you know how much that is there are over 1,000 terabytes in one petabyte of information it's 2 to the 50th power this is an insane amount of data tempest collaborates with well over 50% of the top global pharmaceutical companies to accelerate drug discovery and clinical trials they've helped reduce the time it takes to identify eligible trial participants by up to 50% making drug development faster and more costeffective now guys my father owns a clinical research business and i hear this and i think oh my gosh how much better will it be for us in the future to be able to develop drugs that much faster and guys 50% faster is insane we're usually looking for 5 10% growth rates to make things a little bit more efficient every year or two all right now tempest ai inc has a $ 7.55 billion market cap versus 8 billion enterprise value now that's not a lot but i want to keep in mind here there's negative free cash flow here it's a relatively new company going public a lot of messed up numbers guys to get into it really quick and i like to be able to it doesn't fit my criteria i'm not looking for the hope and prayer on this if you know a lot about this company if you know a lot about this space it's a different story for you don't just take what i'm saying and saying well if this guy says this this must be true i don't understand companies that have this now could there be potential here yeah maybe so but it's looking like it's a little rich for what they're trying to figure out here you really need to make sure you do a lot more analysis on this if you're in our community this is a company that's interesting to you please start a conversation about it because this is exactly the reason why we have this community built it's really important that you're able to sit down with

tools and the community and i assure you it'll be one of the best decisions you've made all year now guys stock analyzer tool on a company like this i think it's just a little too difficult this is not the kind of company to use stock analyzer tool on for myself for you if you see that path to profitability more power to you but i think focusing on the price of sales ratio and saying listen as companies grows what's the price to sales ratio going to be and what does it make that market cap but don't forget dilution i always worry about dilution of companies are they issuing more and more shares as time goes on in this situation so far they've only been around for a year and they've decreased their shares outstanding by half percent but if their cash flow continues to be negative there's only two ways in which you fund losses equity by issuing more shares or debt so you've got to remember that when factoring this into the the company's future our third ai hidden company epam systems now guys this isn't just another tech company it's a powerhouse that's driving digital innovation across industries from building cuttingedge websites and apps to offering expert consulting epam is transforming how businesses operate worldwide they're already working with some of the biggest names in healthcare finance and telecom including over 50% of the top global pharmaceutical firms speeding up drug discovery and revolutionizing the healthcare sector in 2024 they were hailed as a leader in data modernization by the idc proving their relentless commitments to staying at the forefront of tech innovation and to expand on that epam launched stat gpt 2.0 a game-changing ai platform in collaboration with the imf making global economic data more accessible than ever with ai in digital transformation at its core epam could very well be set up for explosive growth continuing to shape the future of industries worldwide so look at this with a epam all-time high november 5th 2021 725 per share recent 52e low of 169 guys colossal fall1 14 billion market cap and the current stock price is $2.47 so essentially this company at one point was a $40 billion market cap business on revenue of what's now 4.6 billion that's a pretty hefty number they generate cash flow and i'm glad that their free cash flow is higher than their net income decent gross margin here of 31% i'm kind of surprised it's that low to be honest and pretty good returns on capital so this isn't just like other companies out there that are still trying to generate that cash flow this company has it and market cap 14.2 billion enterprise value of 13 billion that means they have way more cash on the books than they have debt so this company's probably going to be around for a while as long as they keep building on their revenue and these margins i'm actually really surprised about these gross margins being only 30% so let's check out the eight pillars here guys we have six checks and two x's and our two x's are on the famous valuation metrics now i love the fact that the price of free cash flow is lower than the pe which which is indicative because of the fact that their free cash flow is greater not buying back a lot of shares i'm okay with that this company potentially still has growth potential let's see what the analyst estimates are earnings per share all right 40% growth give or take from $11 a share to 1581 over the next four years and revenue growth not a whole lot guys 4.78 billion to 6.48 11% 10% 3% 8% so the question is does this company deserve a premium or not i don't know because i'm not really blown away by that growth i'm not really blown away by its return on capital so i don't know how much of a premium it deserves 31% gross margin okay all right so it's really important we look at the stock analyzer tool here and let's see if i've done epam in the past so guys these are the 10-year assumptions i made on epam systems i did 36 and 9% revenue growth i did profit margin of and a half 10 and a qu and 11% just based on looking at history and the fact that free cash flows higher i went a little bit higher on them but i probably should probably keep them the same 10 11 and 12% pe i did 14 17 and 20 because yeah this roic is above the market average of 9 or 10% but it's not really like hitting me over the head saying this is amazing now i don't understand the company in full detail so you might understand better and say paul you're being too high you're being too low that's the benefit of having your own access to the software you can make those decisions and that's exactly why this software this stock analyzer tool is our most popular tool used over 1 million times per year and finally our 9% desired return the market average with no margin of safety hit the analyze button all right i got a low price of 113 to 120 high price of 260 to 280 middle price of 170 to 180 it's just a wait for me guys guys $7 for 7 days go check out our software thank you very much for your

2024-12-14,J2gGh4UazP0,"kind: captions language: en now imagine this the stock market crashes people are panicking losing money left and right but a select few knew it was coming and they're cashing in big now what have i told you those same people are writing the rules for everyone else rules for thee none for me that's congress today we're exposing their trading secrets congress says trust a system the system that they built but what if that system is designed to make them rich while the rest of us play by their created rules today i'm breaking down how congress trades stocks the violations of the stock act and whether lawmakers should be allowed to trade at all and yes i will even address the name that everyone loves to bring up nancy pelosi so let's dive in in 2012 congress passed the stock act it was supposed to prevent insider trading and enforce transparency by requiring lawmakers to disclose stock trades within 45 days of making them sounds great right but the reality is quite different over 80 members of congress have violated the very stock act that created 12 years ago and what's the penalty a $200 fine that's it barely a slap on the wrist and here's the even bigger issue the process of self-reporting is fundamentally flawed it's like asking the player of the game to mark their own scorecard the system relies on lawmakers to police themselves and the process is incredibly hard to follow information is often misleading conflicting or buried depending on where you look now since these rules are created by the very people they're meant to regulate it feels intentional designed to be confusing and difficult to navigate this isn't just the failure of enforcement it's a systemic flaw baked in the very foundation of the law let me put this in perspective if you got caught speeding in a school zone you'd pay a higher fine than a us senator breaking federal law think about that congress the rules breaks them and then pays pennies for the privilege to make it go away it sounds like satire but it's not it's the reality that we're living in but this shouldn't surprise everybody anybody who's seen politics of the last 50 years and how it's changed is it really surprising to see that politicians make laws and then try every way to skirt them look at recently with biden talking over and over how he was nobody was above the law he was he was going to honor what the jury said but the second he the president's he was lost for democrats he came out and pardoned his very son for those exact same things he said he would never ever do and that was a quote from the white house and i'm not just picking on biden and the democrats it happens on both sides of the aisle but they were literally saying there is no way his press secretary said how many times do we need to say it he is not going to pardon his son now the stock act was introduced as a bipartisan response to growing public concerns about insider trading in congress it clarified that lawmakers and their staff were not above the securities laws it was meant to rebuild trust in the government but over a decade later it's clear the law has fallen short violations are running rampant and of course enforcement is weak so let's talk about some of the most blatant violations these examples show a clear pattern of lawmakers bending or outright breaking the rules representative diana harshbarger from tennessee violated the stock act over 72 20 times between 2020 and 2021 by failing to disclose trades on time senator tommy tuberville from alabama has violated the law more than 130 times since 2021 his trades included agricultural assets while he sat on the agricultural related committees representative tom swazi from new york failed to disclose over1 million do in trades including biotech stocks that were tied to his regulatory work senator diane feinstein failed to disclose a trade worth over 15,000 which isn't a huge number and three of her senior staff members were also caught violating the law representative josh gimer from new jersey sold svb financial stock just one day before the bank collapsed he's also been linked to other trades that coincided with major geopolitical events now what's the elephant in the room nancy posi everyone seems to think that she's trading on inside information but here's what my perception is she hasn't actually violated the stock act her trades are disclosed as required by law and most of the trades in question were made by her husband paul peli i get it the optics are bad and i do agree that that's kind of a way of skirting things but there's no evidence of insider trading or legal activity i know a lot of people watching this are going to get upset by that we've looked at all the trades we made a video in which we said look at these trades and we sat down we finally looked at and said wait a second i don't think it's glaringly obvious however that's not the point of what i'm trying to get across here even if there was no evidence of insider trading i don't think it changes my belief and what the laws should be for congress people let's shift gears here for a second and talk about timing because this is where things get really suspicious senator richard burr sold up to $1.7 million wor the stocks on february 13 2020 right before the pandemic rocked the markets i believe the high was february 19th now guys these sales included holdings in sectors like hospitality and travel such as windom hotels and resorts now here's why that's troubling burr was the chairman of the senate intelligent committee with access to classified briefings on the virus and the question i asked when our researcher doing this research was what's the guy worth because that matters if he's worth a billion dollars and it's 1.7 million whatever but according to internet again the internet they have an estimated range of between $6 and $8 million net worth because remember they have to disclose accounts and net worth in a range so that 6 to8 million $1.7 million even if he's worth 10 million bucks is a lot of money now to make matters worse just days earlier burr publicly assured americans that the country was well prepared for the pandemic while privately liquidating his own holdings again it's a breach of public trust on top of the horrible optics senator kelly laugher sold $3.1 million in stock just before that pan induced market crash representative nicole motakis bought new york community bank stock just before a major merger announcement set the price soaring josh gimer purchased defense contractor stocks right before the escalation of the israel palestine conflict and these might be legal but they sure as hell don't look good now before we get to committees i want you to realize something there's a lot of ways in which they can sit there and say well this happened and this happen there's a lot of explanations and here's where it gets even mercur the committees it's not not just individual lawmakers making trades it's members of entire committees trading stocks in the industries they regulate for example members of the house oversight and accountability committee collectively purchased $1.4 million in healthc care stocks and then sold $13.3 million worth of stock members of the senate armed services committee bought $2.4 million in tech and chip stocks now you might be wondering what's this do with armed services well guys chips are a major component of everything in the army if you're telling me for a second they might not have information at least question that let me ask you this if you're regulating an industry while personally profiting from it how unbiased can your decisions really be the conflict of interest isn't just obvious it's absolutely baked into the system and it goes as far back as lobbying these companies can also pay money to these people for their campaigns to get them to vote a certain way when members of the house armed services committee are buying and selling stocks in tech companies and defense companies they're trading in industry they directly oversee imagine being a ceo and knowing that the people deciding your industry's future also own shares and your competitors that's not regulation that's a rig game now this isn't just my opinion a recent poll found over 75% of americans believe lawmakers should not be allowed to trade stocks while in office this is not a partisan issue it's about trust in the people who represented of when they say to us at a rally i'm here for you i'm here to represent you you've got to ask the question then what are you doing over here and let's be honest trust in congress is already scraping the bottom of the barrel every time a scandal like this breaks it chips away a little bit at a time at the little confidence we have left in our public servants and i say the word servants very loosely so what are some solutions to this well one idea is banning lawmakers altogether from owning individual stocks they could be required to put their investments in blind trusts where they have no control or knowledge of what's being traded other countries do it and it works for example in canada ministers are required to divest or put their assets in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest if it works for our neighbors to the north the soon to be 51st state of the united states why can't it work here but here's the reality even if congress passed stricter laws tomorrow enforcement would still be a weak link let's go a little bit further and i thought about this i believe that they should just be required to either hold government treasuries hey you're responsible the government own government treasuries or be responsible for only putting money into long-term etfs like vo and spy by the way i'd even go so far as to say put the money in treasuries and they'll pay be paid a premium return for example if the 10e rate right now is 4% maybe they get 6% sit there and say why get the return we want to get away from them you're going to go make a lot of money when you leave congress we don't want being in congress to be very profitable for you and also need stricter penalties if we don't have meaningful penalties these rules are just suggestions with fancy names but then you get the question of paul peli and nancy peli whose money is it who's making the trades what if they're kids you better believe that nancy peli has inside information and can tell her kids or grandkids to trade in their account where do you draw the line is it grandkids is it cousins is it uncles and aunts where is the line drawn the fines and the rules need to hurt and the oversight needs real teeth until then it's just business as usual on capitol hill and the business has been flawed for a very long time now here's something you might not expect me to say do not waste your time and energy being angry at congress's trades focus on what you can control if nancy py makes $100 million it's not going to affect your life one bit now you might sit there and say well that's paul because she's making laws that i got you that's a totally different conversation al together don't get mad at them just making money get mad at the system make smart financial decisions for yourself the market doesn't care what congress is doing and neither should you the market's going to go up and down based on whatever the market's going to do not based on what congress is doing i fear that we live in a society where somebody else's gain means that i've lost that's not the case and i'm not trying to sit there and say that congress isn't messed up and putting laws into place that don't affect us they absolutely do affect us and they skirt those very laws absolutely 100% when i'm trying to talk about here though is somebody else's gain is not your loss go out there get better at investing i'd rather you make 12 or 13% a year by analyzing and learning the process of investing a disciplined approach to investing than to do insider trading or do some other bs that gets you returns that are illegal go take the high road i know that's not very popular at times but it's true you'll be much more proud of yourself doing so don't be angry at people out there let's go make the laws different let's go exert that kind of change we want but it's not about sitting here and getting angry at somebody else cuz they have more if it matters so much to them that they have to break the law to do it then i'm quite sure they're not great people if this

2024-12-17,UfiMpIsrvGA,"kind: captions language: en guys we have three stocks trading at or near their 52e low and i love looking at 52- we low stocks and i want you to be the same and the reason being is in order to find value it's important to find stocks that are cheap and the easiest way to get cheap is stock falling so it logically dictates that stocks that are at or near their 52- we low are cheaper than when they were at their 52 week high now just because a stock is down does not mean it's cheap but it's a great place to start stock number one the company of all companies well not really but johnson and johnson and in-house here one of our employes here hates looking at johnson and johnson and hates using their products because he hates the jets so much and he refuses to accept the fact that a member of the johnson family owns the jets so johnson and johnson's at 14711 but interestingly enough 52e high was just 3 months ago in 168 very tight range here this is pretty tight for most 52e highs and lows and you look at the last 5 years in this chart i mean guys this is not a very volatile company now if you look a big chunk of the returns that have come from johnson and johnson over the last few years look at this dividend 3.3% it eats up 11.7 billion of their free cash flow now the good news is their free cash flow in the last five years is averaged 18.65 billion and the last year $19 billion so they could afford that free cash flow but this company is not going to be a big grower i want to show you that based on analyst estimates here going to revenue if you look right here revenue growth potential for this company according to analysts 3 four 5% and guys it makes sense it's so big they sell everything how's that really going to grow a ton it's going to be hard to add to that bottom line or add to that revenue number now one thing i love about johnson and johnson 12.5% return on invested capital in the last 5 years 13.3% in the last year 21 % return on equity now these metrics say hey we get a good return on the money that's invested in the business this is a good thing and it looks like it's getting better but to look at some other metrics let's go check out the eight pillars and what the story is on this company all right so we have seven out of eight checks now here's what's interesting this is what i say when i always talk about eight pillar investing the eight pillars tell the story i have seven check marks here and some random x on net income growth but yet we have cash flow growth net income fall cash flow growth on $6 billion revenue increase i look at this saying there's probably some random reason for this because you look at their free cash flow last year of 19 billion versus their net income of 14.7 my guess is they had a write off here so what we do is we go to our income statement look in the last 12 months and let's see ah look at this guys we have special income and charges way higher than before way higher than before other income and expenses way higher than before so it's explained way they probably wrote down something and if you want to find out what it is they're 10k which you can access very easily on the main page just click this annual reports button here it takes you right to the sec page and right to the johnson and johnson 10k it'll tell you exactly what that write off was but to look at their other pillars they're selling for7 times 5year earnings 19 times 5year cash flow is that a lot well in this market right now it's not a lot historically maybe it's a little high i don't know because this is a company that's probably going to be around for a very very long period of time dividend lovers will love the fact that johnson and johnson as a company has increased the dividend 61 years in a row johnson and johnson products are used by over 1 billion people daily ac across 175 countries johnson and johnson is diversified across healthcare with their top two drugs in immunology accounting for 15 billion in annual sales their top two oncology drugs accounting for 19 billion and they're simple over the counter items such as tylenol which by itself did 9 billion in sales in the last 12 months so now going back to analis estimates we saw their revenue growth increase and this is their earnings per share increase slightly better than revenue growth that makes sense for a company like this as revenue grows more is going to go to the bottom line so they're probably going to grow their earnings per share faster and as this company gets cheap i'm hoping they start to initiate some sort of stock repurchase that is much bigger than what they've done because if you saw on the eight pillars they've bought back about 9% of their shares in the last 5 years not bad not a lot which i'm glad if the compan if the stock has been high but i look at the saying a great way to add value for johnson johnson investors is let's say the stock fell in half guys cancel that dividend and buy back the f out of their shares that would be very very valuable now the question becomes what is the stock worth this is why we use our stock analyzer tool guys this is the most popular popular tool on our website and the reason being is it allows our users to sit there and put in their estimates for the future what's the revenue growth what's the profit margin going to be what multiple going to sell for and most importantly what is your desired return because every investment is a present value evolve future cash flow this allows you to estimate that cash flow and then put in and say analyze and tells you without looking at the balance sheet this is what the company is worth to us today this is exactly why it's used over a million times per year by our users so here are the assumptions i've made over the next 10 years and you can analyze up to 20 years in this thing i did two three and 4% revenue growth might be a little low profit margin i did 1922 and 24 1922 and 24 for free cash flow as well now pe current pe is 24 current price of free cash flow is 19 i put in 16 19 and 22 because guys this company is going to be around for a long time and they have tylenol they have a lot of great products that are ingrained in our lives that we probably don't even realize we use every single day a billion people use it every single day i figure that's worth a premium how much of a premium i bet you some could argue much higher than this now finally for a desired return i put in 9% now guys the market returns on average are 9 or 10% so this is zero margin of safety if you're going to buy an individual company you need to put in a higher return than 9% in my opinion so we hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 147 and our current levels are a low price of 101 high price of 180 middle price of 140 i have my watch list at 140 not because i'm going to buy at 140 but i'm going to start take a look at it and sell puts at lower prices and guys these returns include that 32% dividend so don't think it's this price plus the dividend because this is a cash flow return stock number two canadian national railway last 5 years only up 14.5% another one with a pretty decent dividend 2.27% that they can probably afford eats up 1.5 billion of their $2.5 billion in free cash flow now to return to invest the capital that we're writing home about but a great return on equity of 28% guys this company is another one that's in a very tight range here um what i'm interested about here is this gross profit margin of 41.5% but yet a bottom line of 30% that's pretty impressive now here's the interesting stuff about u canadian national railway they transport 300 million tons of goods annually across its 18,800 mile network of track they transport 27 % of ca canada's national railroad shipments and cni is the only north american railway with a network connecting three coasts atlantic pacific and the gulf of mexico the fact that can reach all three of those oceans and gulfs and everything gives them unparalleled reach and makes it essential artery for trade and a strategic leader in the railway industry you guys all know good old warren buffett loves railway why railway is the most cost effective way to trans goods is it slow it is slow as molasses but the cost of transports goods via railway is unparalleled versus airplane truck any of those other methods it is so cost efficient so let's go see this um eight pillars and see what's going on over here all right so we have a a big difference which i don't like between the 5year pe and the 5year price of free cash film we we see that here you see free cash flow at 25 billion and net income at 3.8 billion railway seems to be a highly capital intensive business which means it needs a lot of capital improvements and capital expenditures to maintain you got to focus on the free cash flow here you got to focus on this price of free cash flow i'm not looking so much at the net income okay and there's a lot of debt here i'm not as worried about the debt because it's not like somebody can just go in there and just go say hey i'm going to lay track right here and i'm new competitor to cni doesn't work that way so i'm a little bit i'm okay paying a little bit more of a premium on the company relative to the debt now that doesn't mean you have to be but again this approach of looking at it saying not all debt is the same and with a company like this having a higher amount of debt i think there's a lot of value to those train tracks and i'm okay those 18,800 miles of train tracks might be okay and understandable here so now we obviously go to our analyst estimates see what analysts are predicting here almost doubling their eps 522 to 989 so some pretty big growth my guess is as the world economy gets better as canada north america as canada united states and mexico's economy do better they're probably going to do better as well now here's the revenue growth according to analysts you know four five 6% somewhere in the in the mid single digits all right so let's go to stock analyzer tool and see if i've done this company in the past cni have i ever done it i've never done it so i'm going to put some inputs in right now and then explain it so here's what i did for our stock analyzer assumptions for revenue growth i did 2 and a half four 5 a half% revenue growth for profit margin i really ignore i just put 30% in but as you saw before i'm really focused on the free cash flow to which i did 19 20 a half and 22% for pe again don't really care 1518 21 the price to free cash flow is really my important one and i kept the 15 18 and 21 why because even though this roic is not very high it's going to be very very difficult to sit there and get rid of cni those railways will be used by somebody and they seem to have a pretty good and solid control of that market now guys if you looked at the software you may have noticed that we have a

remember we're focusing on free cash flow here so we have a low price of 54 high price of 96 a middle price of 72 this includes the dividend so for my opinion i'm just going to wait a little bit i've got to wait a little bit longer for this to be interesting to me but you might have better insights into this industry than i do that's what's so great about investing not you have to sit there and figure out what's right for you and what makes the most sense to you stock number three a big company that i used to own that i got luckier than luck on this one walgreens this company is down 83% in the last 5 years in the last 10 years it's down 86% walgreens is at $8.6 billion market cap with a $76 billion enterprise value guys i was so wrong on this company and the second i started care a lot about return on invested capital i said i'm out on walgreens and by the way keep in mind i love shopping at walgreens i think walgreens the best corner drug drug store experience out there but just because i love a company does not mean the company is a good investment this is something i want everybody to remember this is one of our principal driven investing ideas just because you love a company doesn't make it a good investment it's not just about buying good things it's about buying good things well mean that means that a good price if you're not doing that you're you're a speculator not an investor and that's the first foundational principle of principal driven investing we are investors not speculators and this is a prime example for company like walgreens i think they operate their drug stores beautifully well whenever we go over seeds boots alliance the stores and i love them they're great but again you have to pay the right price now with walgreens here i think you look at this dividend yield and a lot of people might get sucked into the dividend yield 14.6% it's getting chopped next year but guys this free cash flow is struggling here now it recently popped because private equity groups have come out saying they're going to look at deals about taking walgreens private i think it's a good idea this company need to restructure and rebalance get back to what they do well restructure this debt and the reason being is this company's probably struggling right now with this whole perception the stock is down a ton how do we handle it get don't worry about that go back go private focus on turning this thing around and then come public back later when the business is a lot better there could be a play there that's probably being played out here internally as we look at this company we feel like maybe the stock is selling for what would be equivalent to bankruptcy in the sense of is this thing going bankrupt but i don't think that's the case here if you look at the eight pillars look at how ugly this is everything's just an x doesn't mean you don't buy it just means there's a lot of things going on here every single thing here is terrible funny thing is look at this revenue growth 27.6 billion in the last 5 years net incomes down 9 billion free cash flow is down 4 a. half billion it's terrible how do you pay this stupid dividend when you have negative free cash for last year it's unbelievable so this is a company that just to regroup restructure everything even though walgreens has had a tough couple years its healthcare acquisitions are performing with village md growing 7% in in the most recent quarter and shields health solutions growing nearly 30% the most recent filings they're navigating these challenges with these strategic moves and promising momentum let's see what analysts are saying about this i mean they have things getting better after a while from 288 down to 149 which is basically in half then back up to 426 but who knows if that happens and the interesting part is revenue growth every single year look at this every single year and you'll see by our stock analyzer tool then i'm sure this thing is selling for quite the price and for me the reason i sold it is when i saw that low return on invested capital i realized it didn't fit my criteria of companies i want to own for the long haul and i got super lucky there is no attempt to sit there and say i knew what i was doing when i sold it that it was going to fall 60% from there not at all i just got lucky so let's pull up the walgreens let's look at the last time i did it back in july 11th so guys look what i did here i did -20 and two for revenue profit margin did 1.75 2.25 2.75 and for free cash flow i did two and a half three and three and a half because they consistently have more free cash flow than net income so i put a higher free cash flow in for pe i put 10 12 a half and 15 and a 9% return guys look at this analyze button this is what i mean if i knew walgreens is going to be around and do these numbers forever i mean this is insane returns the question is is it worth putting a lot of capital into it i don't know for me because it doesn't fit my criteria and i'd always be worried having a check on this company so again guys walgreens looks attractive based on these numbers here and i found so many great stocks when i look at 52 we lows i have three more stocks to analyze with you that were trading near their 52 weeks low previously watch it right here thank you for your

2024-12-19,TKtXGkMehIA,"kind: captions language: en i absolutely without a doubt guarantee you that stocks will fall and they will fall hard the question is will you be ready to win while everyone else is panicking now picture this headlines everywhere markets are down 30 40 50 60% stocks are free falling investors are panicking chaos everywhere no news is helping good news is bad news bad news is even worse news it's happened before but most of the people in this market right now have not experienced that and most people will sell and lose but not you because today i'm going to show you how to turn that chaos into the greatest financial opportunity of your lifetime right now investor confidence is absolutely skyrocketing and it's at the highest level since 1988 look at this guys this is the share of consumers expecting stock prices to rise over the next 12 months guys the 2000 bubble was right here about 47% we just eclipsed about 56% you might sit there and say let's not that big of a difference guys this is a huge difference now here's what's interesting the lowest levels financial crisis yeah this wasn't really bad that low co because it was so short and you look here at the tech crash right here this was the bottom of the market guys we want sentiment to be bad when sentiment is bad people are selling when you sell stock prices fall valuations get better on this channel we're trying to teach principle driven investing one of the major attributes is we don't let the price of stocks tell us if we're right or wrong we look at it as relative to value junk bonds are priced as if risk doesn't even exist it feels like nothing could go wrong but that's exactly the problem investor optimism is at this highest level and that's not confidence that's complacency and complacency is dangerous now guys not every investor sentiment is this bad let me show you another one that's very popular and show you that it's high but it's not as high as this shows now this is the bullish to bearish sentiment on the investors intelligence survey we're still at this point right here currently that's what this dotted line is and back here in 201819 we were higher and things still kept going up and that's the thing about bull markets that's the thing about complacency that's the thing about euphoria you don't know when it's going to end look at bitcoin $18,000 per coin guys i see zero intrinsic value in bitcoin in its current state and yes i know people are going to argue and say paul it's just cuz you don't get it guys that's funny to me that every single time i hear warren buffett howard marx seth claran charlie monger all these brilliant people talk when people disagree with them they don't say you just don't get it yet then when some 19-year-old kid who can program a computer looks at bitcoin and says it's the future and he looks at me and goes you just don't get it i think to myself huh who doesn't get it another sign of complacency now i talked earlier about junk bonds guys what is a junk bond well there's certain levels of bonds that get rated under a certain level corporate junk bonds are considered higher risk they have more risk of bankruptcy more risk of default things like that the spread between junk bonds and the risk-free rate with the government as of september 30th was 3.03 it got as low as 2.7% the historical average is about 5.33% that's almost half guys that spread is almost half so you might sit there and say well big deal what does that mean well guys let's think about this way you have good credit your friend doesn't pay their bills they have bad credit so when you guys go buy a car who gets the better interest rate you do but in this situation what's happening here is as time goes on the banks get so and so excited to give money out to people because money is so plentiful they start charging a rate to your friend who doesn't pay his bills very close to yours are they factoring in the risk they're not properly factoring in risk and that's what creates crashes when people don't factor in that the downside is far greater than people realize now i'm going to repeat several times in this video i don't know when no one knows when it's going to happen euphoria can last years i've been looking at this thing and i've been wrong in terms of valuation for a while i bet against euphoria i bet against nvidia big mistake but that wasn't investing that was speculating and i'm really really glad i learned that lesson very early markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent so how over valued our markets let's take a look this is the stock market the gdp ratio going back to 1928 that i created now warren buffett he calls this the single most reliable metric of stock market valuations at any given time and of course i've seen tons of criticism of this and here's a spoiler alert that criticism has come the last few years why because this has shown how overpriced we are it calculates by taking the total stock market market cap and dividing into gdp we're currently at 121% overvalued guys as a comparison back in 2000 in the tech bubble we got to about 55% overvalued we're over double the overvaluation from 2000 now a lot of people sit there and say well money made in the us today made overseas it's not counted here blah blah blah blah blah blah blah fine there's a second ratio the 10year cally adjusted pe ratio it takes the last 10 years of s&amp;p earnings brings it today using inflation so brings it into today's dollars and divides the market cap into that we're currently at 38.5 historical average 17.17% overvalued that's even higher than the stock market gdp ratio guys any way you cut it people are paying more for a dollar of cash flow today than they ever have in history now let me ask you a question if you pay more for something are your returns going to be less or more they're obviously going to be less this phone is worth $1,000 if you paid 900 for it you're going to make a 100 bucks you're going to make 11% of your money 100 divided by 900 if you pay $500 for it you're going to sell it and make another $500 in profit you're going to make 100% of your money same phone same everything the future is unkknown we don't know what these companies are going to generate but their stock prices aren't going to dictate how much money they make in the future as an operating business if you don't believe that go look at intel cisco micron apple m microsoft google all these companies when their stocks fell guess what happened to their profit it still kept going up and even with intel a company that's struggling right now it is 66% lower than the year 2000 and its revenue and profit is much greater today than it was back then cisco same thing several times greater but what happened people overpaid that's what's happening here you're paying too much for a future stream of cash flow now you might be sitting there saying paul you've been saying this for a long time i have been and don't forget we have made accurate calls on bubbles in the past ev stocks cannabis stocks everybody told us we didn't get it e was the future when was the last time you heard somebody say eevee was the future i'll tell you when about three and a half years ago and all those companies went to zero remember tattooed chef paul you don't get it you have to understand the company and what it's going to do cool went to zero why cuz people paid too much and the company wasn't fundamentally strong remember one thing just because there's a future that's great for a company or an industry doesn't mean the company's going to do well in fact i think i heard a stat from warren buffett where he said overall in the car business since the car business started over 100 years ago there's been a net loss of investment dollars even though we have how many cars in this world every single year 51 52 million new cars are sold and yet you still overall have you invested in these companies all along the way would have lost money even with all these major increases which brings us to tesla tesla and bitcoin are i believe the poster children of this bubble why because tesla is being told it's not a car company even though actually over 90% of its revenue comes from car sales and two because bitcoin is a a asset with no intrinsic value that generates nothing and yet people are paying for it in they're sitting there so far as to say you you should make money in fiat and buy assets like bitcoin and i'm like oh my gosh this is unbelievable and to those bitcoiners out there who say you don't get it paul you don't get investing that's the fact you don't understand investing this is pure speculation and that's okay speculation is fine but when you confuse speculation and investment that's when trouble happens and guess what trouble might be kicked down the road for a while after all bitcoin was only $3,000 a few years ago and now it's over 100 it hit 108,000 and change today now guys i'm talking a lot of fear here that's not the case the reason i bring this up is to say people guys if you've been spoiled by the last 5 or 10 years it's okay i was spoiled 25 years ago and you learn the lessons and it makes you better because of it and also it's an opportunity because the thing i didn't know 25 years ago was that every bare market every crash is an opportunity look at it this way qqq is a nasdaq 100 from the peak in 2000 to the bottom of 2003 it fell 83% 83% but guys if you literally started dollar cost averaging into qqq at the peak of 2000 to today your annualized returns would have been 15.3% 15.3% even though qqq's only done like 7 to 8% from the peak till now that's incredible that's the power of of dollar cost averaging that's what i'm trying to teach i'm trying to teach you the idea of saying listen avoid the hype avoid the the junk companies nvidia is not a junk company nvidia is a phenomenal company but if you pay too much for it it can end up being a bad investment that's what we're trying to teach here it's not about buying good things it's not about buying good companies it's about good companies being bought at the right price if you're not doing that you're speculating we need to put the story and then numbers together to make a successful investment if this makes sense to you you're at the right place and it'll always be better in the long run if you're just the person who likes a dollar cost average into lowc cost etfs wonderful but i want to remind you when things look terrible when markets are falling like crazy when all these things look like stocks are going to zero just remember stocks don't go to zero what would have to happen for stocks to go to zero for the entire stock market not just one or two companies for the entire stock market to go to zero think about what have to happen nuclear war devastation asteroid hits the earth all these things that would happen and guess what what i would tell you is if that if those were to happen your money means nothing anyway so you may as well be buying on the way down dollar cost average and a lowc cost etfs and you will do very very well but it'll be hard after a while seeing stocks go down seeing other things go up like crazy and say well i'm going to sell these and go into those don't chase that hype if you want to chase that hype do it with extra money don't do with the money you need for retirement stick to your plan it'll do very very well but i want you to remember markets always correct that's what makes an average it's not if it's when the question is what will you do when that happens here's what most people do when markets fall they panic i have a thousand stories about this and it's even scarier to me now when i hear friends saying well stocks fell in half i'd be fine with that i'd buy more i've heard that i heard that like crazy in 0708 gu spear wrote a great book called the education of a value investor in which his value investing friends gave up and his comment was but this is what we're waiting for they said well no but i can't st make these losses it's different this time guess what it's not different on the up and it's not different on the down they sell their stocks at a loss and they quit investing entirely they blame the system they blame some news they state things like the market's rigged done with this but here's the truth every market crash is an opportunity to buy stocks at a discount think about it this way in 2008 during the financial crisis you could have bought apple amazon or microsoft at prices you can't even imagine today those who stayed disciplined and bought during the panic didn't just recover they built life-changing wealth every crash in history has rewarded those who are prepared the next crash it could be the greatest opportunity of your life but only if you're ready not just with money but emotionally with knowledge so how do you prepare first take an offensive mindset most people panic when stocks fall but you'll see it as a buying opportunity when others are selling you'll be buying second stick to your plan the best prices come when everyone else is afraid when everyone else is bailing that's what causes prices to fall don't let fear pull you off track and third you need to surround yourself with people who won't quit you need to understand that people there are people out there who get this you need to surround yourself with them cuz the hard truth is this when the next crash happens everyone around you your friends your family will panic they'll sell their stocks they'll tell you to do the same they'll tell you you're crazy to which i would say so wait a second the nasdaq at 20,000 made sense but the nasdaq at 10,000 doesn't come on but you need to line yourself with people who see opportunity not fear that's hard to find cuz fear works out there that's how you stay focus that's how you win and obviously at this time you understand the warning signs and the mistakes most people make when markets do crash but here's the good news you don't have to go through this alone this is exactly why we created everything money.com when the next crash happens and it will you'll need the right tools mindset and support to turn that into an opportunity and here's what you get with our community these

2024-12-21,ACDAxnAM4vA,kind: captions language: en guys i've added stock number 26 to my portfolio adobe wall street thinks that adobe's guidance is too low but frankly i don't care when price doesn't reflect true value smart and disciplined investors step in and here is why i started my position in adobe stock so adobe just wrapped up fiscal 2024 with record revenue of 21.51 billion which is up 11% from last year which is a tough feat for a company with this much revenue most companies would pop the champagne with those numbers but the market well it's grumbling and the reason is adobe came in with fiscal 2025 guidance falling short of wall street's short-term needs and wants and this tells you everything you need to know wall street cares about the short term and i want to change that for you and this is why on this channel we're trying to teach a principled driven investing approach where every investment is the present value of all future cash flows where we're investors not speculators we don't care about the short-term price movements that doesn't tell us if we're right or wrong we focus on the long-term fundamentals and this is exactly where adobe shines the digital media segment which includes creative cloud and document cloud is an absolute beast adding $2 billion in net new annualized recurring revenue guys that's a cash flow gold mine their gross margin as you see right here is over 88% this is absurd that means that $2 billion in recurring revenue that's 1.75 billion that goes to the bottom line to help pay overhead and income taxes and don't sleep on the document cloud products like adobe acrobat and sign are riding the tailwinds of digital transformation no one's printing forms anymore everyone is e-signing e- sealed and e delivered the digital experience segment brought in $5.3 billion which is over $4.8 billion in gross profit solidifying adobe's presence in the enterprise market businesses don't just buy these tools they integrate them into their workflows throw in those 30 million creative cloud subscribers and you've got the kind of recurring revenue that makes accountants and investors smile now ai is where adobe is taking things to the next level tools like firefly are making life easier for creators and there's one thing we know about adobe it's that they know how to monetize creativity financially they're a fortress $ 2.92 billion in q4 operating cash flow and nearly 20 billion in remaining performance obligation tells me that the pipeline is full guys they're not just winning today they're setting up for tomorrow and that's what i love about this company but here's the rub the stocks dipping because analysts wanted more those greedy wanted more this is where i remind you that the market is a drama queen adobe's core business is rock solid and the subscription model keeps revenue predictable so what's my take adobe is a business that i want to own but of course like everything not at any price and guys i love this quote by howard mark it's not about buying good things it's about buying good things well that means paying the right price that's merging the story with the numbers that's what we're trying to teach on this channel now the good news is as the market cries about this it gives us a cheaper entry point because it pushes the price down and as an investor as a principal driven investor this allows you to buy more shares of a great business at a better price it's all about buying when the story meets the numbers and if the numbers keep going down that's when you keep buying more and here's the story that the numbers tell us so high level adobe's a 200 billion doll market cap business with a$ 207 to$ 215 billion enterprise value essentially 15 billion in debt that's what that difference is and look at this guys 6.5 billion in free cash flow last year 6.5 billion in the last five years versus their net income so everybody in this world is going to focus on this pe and i'm going to focus on this price of free cash flow now guys before we go further in the numbers i always hear people say value investors don't understand growth they always want things cheap really i just started a a position in a company with a 30 times price of free cash flow and a 38 or 39 times pe tell me you can do that by buying just something that looks cheap no it's factoring in that growth potential cuz i see adobe with still great growth potential on revenue coupled with this bottom line gross profit i got to think we're going to start seeing much bigger profit margins the last 5 years almost 30% last year was down at 25 a5 per. guys this is an incredible business and i said this in our video in the past about the 33 stocks that i want to own adobe was on there i look at this as one of the best companies out there in addition of microsoft in the software world and i finally got to buy myself a position and i sold puts at a lower price but remember guys we're here to teach this principle driven investing process you apply it to what makes sense to you it's not about you listening to a video and saying oh paul x said don't be let me go buy it because guess what i'm hoping this stock falls yesterday i went on twitter and i said hey everybody i started a new position in a company i won't tell you what it is watch for the video but guess what it has a 37 pe and then i also added and i hope this price goes to 200 that was the amazing part and i know people out there are saying come on he doesn't really i really do believe that because i look at it saying if it goes to 200 i can dollar cost average down to 320 bucks would i buy adobe today my full position for 320 you bet i would and i would love it because what would the returns look like in the future so let's go see what the eight pillars tell us from the story perspective well all check marks here roic look at this 19% in the last 5 years 24 a half% last year buying back shares i have to look look at it and see are they buying back good shares 1.65 billion increase in free cash flow which is larger than their $1.5 billion net income increase on only $10 billion in revenue growth which is a lot it's double but this is what i love greater free cash flow than revenue and of course their poultry debt levels and again yeah there's x's here but i just started this position cu i'm like i don't think this is and you'll see shortly in their stock analyzer tool that takes the numbers and the story together to bine it to give me my buy price you'll see what i mean by this so let's see what analysts are saying about earnings per share guys look at this 1860 to 35 almost doubling in the next 5 years 14 1/2 12 a2 11 1/2 16 1/2 12 15% revenue growth guys when a company can increase its revenue and profit at these levels you have to pay a premium for it you're not doing the company or your pocketbook or your investment portfolio a favor by saying no i want to pay 12 or 15 times earnings for this no this deserves more on the revenue front look at this 10 and a half 11 11 13 11 and a half 11 a half 21.9 billion up to 37.7 now again as i'll always say about analysts we don't know exactly because analysts are they're just as whimsical as the every everyday market person they're not these everybody thinks these analysts are like these brilliant they're not but at the same point it like we like to see where the guidance at least is there to guide us cuz because if this was 0% and 2% and 3% unless we have some really good knowledge about why that's not the case we want to sit there and there are times when i sit there and say yeah i don't believe these numbers now guys remember i said before you take the story you take the numbers you put them together and this is why we have the stock analyzer tool because the story will help tell you hey what's going on with revenue and profit what's going to happen there that's going to affect the numbers you put in there so let's pull up the last time i did adobe and by the way guys i'm actually going to share some of our community members adobe estim in here because i really get interested to hear what they have to say so i did a 10-year analysis i did revenue growth of 6 10 and 14% i did profit margin of 26 29 and 32 and i'm focusing on free cash flow because of how because how much higher it is 38 40 and 42 now two earnings multiples 18 21 and 24 um listen i talked to dalton who works for us i find him from the community he disagreed with me he goes paul i don't think you're paying a high enough premium for this company he's probably right but i sat there and said let me just be conservative to see and then a 9% desired return now remember guys this is no margin of safety this is what's the intrinsic value if i wanted to buy this and match the market 9 or 10% what would have to pay but of course guys when you buy an individual stock you must i repeat you must put margin of safety in or else you might as well just buy a lowcost etf the hard part is how do we make good assumptions well the future is unknown and we're humans we make mistakes that's the hard part about investing so just like adobe subscription models gives creators and businesses the tools they need to succeed this stock analyzer tool this entire platform is designed to give you everything you need to make smarter investing decisions and i'm going to share with you right now here are some of our users this is juan ra here are his assumptions 10 12 and 14% okay profit margin 25 27 guys look how low he went on free cash flow 30 33 and 36 i think he went very low there now maybe he's probably thinking to himself let's merge these together kind of bring them together maybe he put 1921 and 23 in a 9% return but even then 584 he has as middle price and 478 on earnings all right let's check out another one a guy by the name of mous pad here his assumptions 11 12 and 13% profit margin of 28 29 and 30 free cash flow of 37 39 and 41 pe and price of free cash flow 15 20 and 25 and he actually put his margin of safety in 1113 15 i think that's very very smart to do we hit his analyze button and even with his margin of safety he's got some pretty big numbers in here 490 14% potential return now another user spike went a little bit more conservative than i would have done but i love the fact that he went more conservative 58 11% revenue growth way lower than mine 26 28 and 30 and 33 35 and 37 way lower on the free cash flow pe 15 1821 and then 13 15 and 70 17% desired return now spike you're watching this my only thing is do you really need 15% return to by adobe this is a top tier company i think i think it's a little too much i think you're beating it down but with that said hitting the analyze button look 208 on the low side 335 on the high side 266 you could very well hit that 266 but are you sacrificing too much potential return by doing that that's my question so guys you saw how power ful that was i only picked two of like the two dozen people who shared their stock analysis with me this is what's so great about the community people comment they go into this they have these conversations this everything money platform is designed to give you the the tools and the community to make smarter and help your stomach feel better in your investment decisions and just like how

current price today of 447 i can expect a 133% % annualized return and i swear to you right now i really hope this goes to 200 because i will be buying it all the way down and i have puts at 425 for a month from now so guys if you want to see my top five stocks watch this next video thank you for your

2024-12-23,IAEcOMgzB3o,"kind: captions language: en the incredible investors inside our community have analyzed over 4,650 stocks this year and we're going to analyze the top five of the most analyzed over the last 30 days from our community members stock number one amd now amd is strategically positioned to dominate the rapidly expanding ai chip market projected to reach $400 billion by 2027 under the leadership of ceo lisa sue amd is leveraging this transformative opportunity to redefine high performance computing the company is working on an acquisition of zt systems which will further enhance its ability to have a stronghold on the data center infrastructure now the reason this is good for amd it's a good complement for their current leader in cpus and gpus enabling it to deliver more comprehensive and innovative solutions now in addition to this they're going to continue pushing the boundaries for high performance computing they need to drive more innovation across ai gaming and cloud platforms these are the major major growth areas for ai so they're not only combining their technological excellence but they're also bringing in the strategic growth and this is helping cement them as a cornerstone for modern computing revolution now let's go look at amd to see how the company looks from a highlevel perspective and to see if there's any opportunity here to buy now guys all-time high was back in march of 227 hit a low in august of 12 21 that's a fall of like 45% in a matter of 5 months that's a big fall things can change very quickly it's currently at 126 nearing those august lows it's a $26 billion market cap business with an enterprise value of 215 billion this difference here is essentially their debt of $9 billion but look what they do right here their 5year average free cash flow is 2 billion now what's interesting is last year's free cash fl is down to 1.5 billion so they actually generated less free cash the last 12 months than their average over the last 5 years and this 5ye average is before the ai boom started so let's go check out their cash flow statement that's an important one for me to understand so we look here okay look at this inconsistency here negative 130 million 276 million 777 million 3.2 billion 3.1 billion 1.12 billion for last year and for the last 12 months 1.56 billion so still half off its highs but still significantly higher than its history for a long time this company was operating at negative cash flow so let's go see what the eight pillars look like now remember the eight pillars are here to tell us a story four checks four x's we've got revenue growth we've got net income growth we've got free cash flow growth and they're pretty consistent across the board in terms of net income and free cash flow but guys 5year prices for cash flow of 100 5year pe ratio of 112 shares outstanding guys this is what makes me vomit all over the place this is me is that my face my nose that's me vomiting all over all over why they're diluting their investors i hate this i get it i get why they do it the stock's expensive that's the company's way of saying our stock is expensive let's go give shares out to the people who are obsessed with it great but at the end of the day i look at this company versus nvidia nvidia has a much long and better track record if you ask me look at the gross profit here 48% nvidia is at 75 to 80% gross margin they make almost double for every single dollar they bring in versus amd look at this bottom line profit 7 and a half and 10% listen this could be the early stages of a major turnaround for amd this company's gone up and down i mean you go look at the chart here look at this chart look at the stock chart it got as low as a194 back in 2015 that means if you bought it that low in 2016 you'd be up over 60 times your money that's insane but they've struggled to make money and look at this what's also amazing their all-time high in 2000 was 4850 or so they didn't hit that price again until december of 2019 19 years later it just goes to show it can be scary out there so the question is what what's the stock worth this is exactly why we have the stock analyzer tool our goal with the stock analyzer tool is every investment is the present value of all future cash flows but we don't know those cash flows that's why we make low middle and high assumptions on revenue growth profit margin free cash flow margin the multiples of earnings in free cash flow and our desired return it gives us a range of what to look at this is very important when you're sitting there looking at a company you got to merge the numbers with the story these numbers are going to be dictated by the story what kind of growth does this company have let's actually go check out analyst estimates to see what they think eps growth wow tripling so this could be a turnaround for amd this could be the start of their domination and revenue growth look at this revenue growth 20 26 billion to 50 billion almost doubling in the next four years that's incredible so again let's go back to stock analyzer i did a 10year analysis here i did 812 and 16% revenue growth i did 815 and 22% profit margin and free cash flow margin keep in mind guys my middle metric here has never been achieved in the last 10 years that's something to keep in mind here guys i want you to remember that i'm giving them more credit than what they've done i'm assuming their scale is going to make them better pe i did 18 21 and 24 because i think to myself this is going to be an ai leader they should get a premium to the market and my desired return here's the one area where you have to deviate from i put in 9% because the market average is 9 or 10 per. so i'm trying to sit there and say what's this thing worth intrinsically what's its natural market return but remember if you're going to buy an individual stock you need to put a margin of safety because if you're not going to just buy the market you'll make 9 or 10% in addition you could very well be wrong you need that margin of safety but for right now i'm going to hit the analyze button here are my prices i got a low of 30 a high of 186 a middle price of 85 so even my middle assumptions which were profit margins higher than they've had it's still a hard pill to swallow now you might disagree with my revenue growth etc but remember i did a 10-year analysis not a 5-year analysis and you modify these numbers you'll come up with your own set and that's why it's important for you to be able to put your numbers in and it's also why our users in our community use this tool over a million times per year stock number two ala beauty a stock that i own remember guys don't ever buy a stock because anybody in this world especially if someone on youtube owns the stock now you could argue that ulta beauty is the ultimate powerhouse in the beauty retail industry they have 1437 stores across all 50 us states they have an amazing e-commerce platform which allowed the company to masterfully expand its physical and digital presidence solidifying it as the largest specialty beauty retailer in the us this physical and online presence ensures it ulta is never far from its millions of loyal customers custers so inside these stores and online they have over 25,000 products from 500 brands whether shoppers are hunting for budget friendly drugstore essentials or splurging on higher-end luxury products ulta offers something for everyone and at the heart of all this success is its widely popular timate rewards program bursting a staggering 41 million members these fiercely loyal shoppers account for an incredible 95% of the company's sales underscoring the unmatched customer retention and engagement that sets ulta apart now guys i've had ulta i like the numbers and warren buffett bought alter while burkshire hathway did and then they sold it and then it skyrocket on earnings etc but let's take a look at this for one thing i love about the company 1920 billion market cap $23 billion enterprise value that's a $3.4 billion essential net debt and look they generated a billion dollars in free cash on the last 12 months that's incredible now there free cash flow is slightly lower than their net income so it's kind of an issue but i look at this and hopefully it's it's within reason because they're growing stores remodeling stores etc look at this guys gross profit margin of 39% it's almost freaking at amd and that's incredible to me bottom line profit very consistent 10 to 10 and a half percent over the last five years also beating amd currently that's incredible but even more impressive guys is the return on invested capital 21% over the last 5 years 27% last year they do a great job of getting a return on the money invested in the business and that's important now eight pillars guys apart from its 5-year price of free cash flow it's all check marks here and guys best guess what before their earnings released this was all check marks this was an eight pillar thriller but the thing i like a lot here buying back shares they're not afraid to they're not afraid to buy back shares i think they get the idea of buying back shares they understand buying at lower prices buying at lower valuations so let's see what analysts are saying about ulta earnings per share $26 a share going to 4159 here in the next five or six years and revenue growth not the greatest 11.4 billion to 15 billion mid- single digit growth nothing to write home about but they're being smart about their growth which i like so of course the next question is what's the right price to pay for ulta let's pull it up the last time i did it in our stock analyzer tool and guys i didn't do anything glamorous remember all these stock analyzer tools do not include the balance sheet but i did two four and 6% revenue growth i did 9 and a half 10 and a4 11% profit margin and free cash flow margin i did a pe of 1518 and 21 even though there's an increasing roic and a high one it's still retails so i want to i'm okay with 1518 and 21 to me it's not a 15 pe and it's also not a 20 5 pe somewhere in the middle and finally my 9% desired return hit the analyze button boom i got a low price of 327 high price of 630 middle price of 455 at current prices if you bought today you're looking at about a 10% free cash flow irr stock number three uber guys uber has done a great job of going from a company that's going to spend whatever it takes to grow to being a cash flowing business it's still continuing to race ahead forecasting a remarkable 20% year-over-year increase in gross bookings with robust revenue growth across its mobile and delivery segments guys i don't know if you saw the show on netflix about uber but this has been confirmed they said the second somebody uses uber twice they're hooked on it for life that's incredible stickiness one of its latest game-changing moves is a new collab with instacart integrating its extensive logistics and delivery network with instacart's platform to reach bman customers guys i am lazy and i've got money so i order an instacart all the time and i pay whatever absurd fee they give me because i love getting things delivered to me so i don't have to go out and go do it myself at the same time uber is revolutionizing the future of transportation through investments in autonomous vehicle partnerships in japan the company debuted its first international fleet of autonomous delivery robots for uber eats a bold step in the future of tech driven logistics now that story is wonderful but the numbers tell an even better and more compelling story uber facilitated ready for this 2.6 billion trips in the first quarter alone that is a 21% year-over-year surge with a commanding 76% share of the us ride share market and 25% globally it's solidifies its position as the world's top mobility platform but uber isn't just about the rides the company is unlocking innovative revenue streams through initiatives like incar video ads and strategic partnerships while enhancing its platform with cutting edge technology its delivery business is thriving achieving an 18% year-over-year boost in bookings now these milestones reflect uber's relentless drive to redefine mobility and delivery so let's check out uber here now like i said guys look at this free cash flow 5ye average free cash flow 570 million last year's free cash flow 6 billion doll talk about a focus on cash flow incredible their five-year return on invested capital negative last year was positive good sign there net income look at this free cash flow six billion net income 4.4 so i love that guys all around there's a lot of good news happening here gross profit of 40% okay um not as great as i thought not as bad as i think i mean it's software but they got to share money with the drivers guys imagine a world in which there's no drivers imagine that what's going to happen with the the split it's going to be a lot more cost effective all right so my guess is the pillars look crappy here yeah five x's three checks revenue growth net income growth and cash flow growth are much bigger look at this 6 billion in free cash flow last year which is a $10.4 billion increase which means they were doing a nega 4.4 billion in free cash flow just 5 years ago shares outstanding up a lot i hope this starts to stop that share outstanding increase we can go check and see how they've done on those increasing shares in the last few quarters by going to the income statement going to down the bottom all right so if you look right here it's been this is quarterly not yearly so slight increases over time from 1.96 billion in in june of 2022 to 2.1 billion still a 5% increase all right not the worst not the best got it so let's see what analysts are saying okay1 81 this year in profit going to 550 in three years huge growth on their profit and guys this what happens when companies start to focus on profit and cash flow it can be a massive growth like this well not inverting back but you get what i mean cu i'm looking at saying this company spent astronomical some money just writing just how do we get ingrain and guess what they did it and then the revenue growth pretty solid 44.5 billion to 73 and a half billion i look at uber going this company's goingon to be around for a long time it's going to make a lot more money question is can you justify the price today it's clear this company's a leader it's clear this company's doing well so let's go check out our stock analyzer tool have i done uber in the past let us see i have actually pretty recently 10-year analysis i did 6 10 and 14% revenue growth for profit margin i did 8 14 and 20 might be low i could i could see you know i'm gonna go higher in this one i'm gna go eight 16 and 24 i don't think 24 is attainable because they do 4 40% in gross margins that'd be very little that's probably pretty high actually maybe maybe it should be 10 15 and 20 and guys don't have to put equal spaces between these i just do now for a pe this is a market leader i did 15 18 and 21 they're currently at 30 times earnings and 21 times free cash flow and the 9% no margin of safety return so hit the analyze button now guys it's really important that you understand why we make these assumptions the way we make them it's so important that people see the stock analyzer tool it's been used over 1 million times in the last year alone by our users guys we have some stocks in here that have been analyzed over 10,000 times in the last year now that's not it for the software we have all of these tools here retirement calculator eight pillar search analyst estimates even a real estate calculator and we're pulling in economic data from the st louis fred website guys this software right now includes everything up there but behind the scenes we're making changes and the reason is guys we got to make the software better as time goes on this software needs to adapt to what the needs are for the users cuz when i built the software it was only built for me i did not think it was going to become something for everybody i had the software i was making videos i was writing down and people were like hey how do i get that software and i'm like yeah you can't get it it's a data feed it's expensive you can't get it and finally i said wait a second we can make this for people enough people are asking about it but as i go on i have to make better versions of the software to adapt to what i need real estate calculator was just added in the last couple years why because i make a lot of real estate investments i've bought over $35 million in real estate alone this year using that real estate calculator i just had a friend of mine he went in a contract in a building here in ohio and he said dude your real estate investment calculator was phenomenal but as we grow more and more it has to become less about me and more about how i can better serve you and other community members and this is why we update our software continuously we have many developers working the software every

changes the best news is you sign up you get these for life and you stay in your pricing tier forever so click on that link to get access to everything we have to offer and i guarantee you it'll be the best investing decision you've made all year so we hit the analyze button here the stock's currently at $60 per share we have a low of 37 high of 172 middle price of 85 guys this is an interesting company if you buy at safe price the middle assumptions occur and they don't dilute further 13.7% return you got to remember if they keep diluting that eats away your ownership and that eats a your return stock number four target another company that i own got hit hard recently but guys i believe they're set to achieve massive growth in 2025 fueled by its powerhouse of exclusive brands like cat and jack threshold and good and gather target's customer base is growing exponentially with more than 100 million members in its target circle loyalty program in 2024 now beyond this brand expansion target is heavily investing in physical and digital growth with plans to upgrade hundreds of stores over the next decade and enhance its e-commerce capabilities they've also partnered with ulta to be able to put altas into stores i think it's going to be a big benefit because women love ulta and women love target these efforts are designed to meet the demands of an even broader customer base positioning target for long-term success so this is a company that's down significantly from its all-time high back in 2021 about 3 years ago they were at 24 8 a share and now they're at $131 per share they have a dividend yield of 3.38% which eats up two billion of its four and a half billion last year and four billion fiveyear average free cash flow so they can afford this dividend it eats up less than half of last year's free cash flow current pe of 13.8 current price of free cash flow of 13.3 low double digits so the question is if this company can maintain growth how does this not work out so let's go check out the eight pillars so guys we have two x's long-term liabilities which include leases don't care cash flow declined i don't like that but guess what even with a decline of 2.8 billion it's still higher free cash flow than their 5-year average so that doesn't worry me so much from a high level so i'm looking at the saying is this essentially a 14 an eight pillar thriller could very well be what are analysts saying well they have eps growth nothing sexy but look 5% 8% 8% 16 9% all right high single digigit growth and revenue growth overall low single digit zero drop of 1% three three and a half 6.74 now guys i want you to remember people were always worried about the shrinkage how much theft was having at target not happening anymore it's been decreased immensely they went back to same store sales growth this last quarter from a drop of six 7% the previous quarter so the question becomes what's the right price for target two 3 and2 5% revenue growth this is going to be difficult but if we have continued inflation and they continue to grow steadily in new locations that's achievable profit margin 375 425 475 same with free cash flow pe and price of free cash flow 15 18 and 21 pretty good roic's but nothing to write home about but it deserves a premium because i think target is is a company that's going to be around for a while i think it's a go-to for a lot of women and my 9% return hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 131 boom low price of 125 high price of 240 middle price of 175 133% return based on today's if you bought it today's price and that includes the dividend so don't add the dividend on top of that it's a discounted cash flow return right here so if my middle assumptions are correct and they keep keep trudging along based on today's price you can expect a pretty good return i started buying this thing at 135 all the way down to 105 it went to 100 then shot up to 180 then down to 120 and now back up to 131 that is the volatility of this company over the last two years don't set your right or wrong based on this volatility principal driven investing we focus on the fundamentals of the business and paying a good price based on those fundamentals because every investment is the present value of all future cash flows stock number five nike another company that i own nike is absolutely dominant in the global athletic wear and footwear market making it one of the most exciting investment opportunities around especially because all-time high was 180 and a 52e low back in august of $71 per share and it's currently at $78 per share who would have thought a company like this would fall by over half in fact in the past we made videos people thought that was unreasonable but the company revolutionized its brand through gamechanging partnerships with legends like michael jordan lebron james serena williams who've all played a pivotal role in boosting recognition and loyalty the ongoing success of michael jordan's nike collaboration especially with the air jordan line has been a massive driver of the brand's power in fact guys of their $50 billion in revenue about 7 billion comes from jordan brand and by the way michael jordan gets 5% of that he makes between 300 and $350 million right now with nike incredible this guy is printing money nike's market share underscores its leadership with the company commanding 27% of the global athletic footwear market it also leads the charge in north america comfortably outpacing its competitors like adidas and puma just like the other companies their loyalty is incredible with 100 million members in its nike membership program the and builds strong connections gathers invaluable data that drives personalized experience and then leads to more sales in addition of that they're doing more direct to consumer which is going to drive the bottom line because now they don't have to sell to a retailer and only mark up and only lose half that revenue they can now do it directly now globally nike is continuing to grow its presence in key markets like china and europe while maintaining that stronghold in the us so let's check out nike here 118 b ion dollar market cap with a130 to $40 billion enterprise value guys 4.7 billion in the last 5 years average free cash flow last year's free cash flow last 12 months 7.2 billion you know i heard from people after they said mike saw nike stockall they said paul nike is dead how the hell do we say nike is dead how do you say nike is dead but people out there believe it return on invest in capital 18.7% in the last 5 years 20.4% last year this company has 45% gross margin that's equivalent to apple this is an incredible business with very consistent profit margin as you can see now one thing i will say their fiveyear free cash flow is slightly lower than their fiveyear net income but they had a big jump in free cash flow relative to income last year all right let's go check out these eight pillars this is one of the ones we like to see everything's a check except for valuation and these valuations aren't far off and i would argue these guys deserve a premium these guys deserve to have a premium paid for them it's nike it's probably not going away again i asked the question do you think nike will be around for 10 20 30 40 50 years of course people probably said the same thing 40 years ago with a lot of other companies this company is leading the pack and they dominate they're synonymous with trends with quality with athleticism it's hard to lose that especially when you sign the two biggest basketball players of all time to a lifetime contract so let's see what the analysts are saying here now 377 per share and profit to 636 over the next four or five years all right almost doubling and revenue growth little inconsistent but 52 billion to 67 billion so what is that mid high single digits called mid single digits not a lot of growth there but a company like nike slow and steady growth with a good gross margin and increasing that growth gross margin can really add to the bottom line very quickly if they can make their gross margin from 45 to 50% that would be huge and they could make their bottom line profit from 10% to 12 or 13% it's a 30% increase in their net margin that would be astronomical but you'll see in our stock analyzer that i don't even factor that in there let's look up nike when i did it in the past these are my nike assumptions in the past 35 7% revenue growth profit margin 10 11 12 and same with free cash flow i gave a slight bump for the fact that they're doing more direct to consumer i put in the highest pe in this video on nike 2023 and 26 i do believe it deserves that premium i could be wrong but i do believe that and my 9% desired return the stock's currently at $78 a share hit the analyze button we have a low price of 60 high price of 119 middle price of 85 not a huge number here 10% but enough where i go it's worth it for nike guys if you want to see the top five stocks that i own in my portfolio watch this next video thank you for your

2024-12-26,REZn2CpELi0,"kind: captions language: en wall street might be ignoring them but value investors are buzzing about these five stocks they're so undervalued you'll wonder how the market hasn't caught on yet so let's dive in stock number one uber the name is synonymous with i'm too lazy to walk and where's my burrito but jokes aside uber has built itself into a serious business and cash flowing powerhouse so let's dive in the numbers because as i always say numbers tell the real story first off user growth is off the charts 161 million monthly active platform users in september of 2024 which is a 13.4% jump year-over-year that's more than adding the population of mexico to their user base second volume matters and uber's got it in 2023 drivers completed 9.44 billion trips that's up nearly 2 billion trips from 2022 clearly people are relying on uber making it more of a daily habit than a luxury third this isn't just a ride hailing company anymore with uber eats freight services and even autonomous vehicle partnership uber's looking at multiple revenue streams and it's a smart move diversifying lowers risk and opens up new doors now that's all a great story but how does it apply to investing in uber analysts like uber's long-term growth potential but here's the key it's mo uber's market position is hard to replicate competitors can't just show up and say we'll do it better uber's scale and network are already too massive they bragged early on that if somebody used uber twice they were hooked on up for life and it seems to be about right but of course as value investors we still need to ask the most important question what is uber and transic value are they actually profitable or is this just a shiny object remember growth is great but cash flow is king and at the end of the day you need to be able to see some sort of expectation of the cash coming in we buy assets we buy businesses we don't just buy dreams so let's look at uber here this is a 132 billion doll market cap versus 155 billion enterprise value that difference there of 23 billion is their essentially their debt and guess what last year's free cash flow was $6 billion now look at it compared to the last 5 years 570 million that's 10x 10 times more free cash flow few years ago as the market shifted the ceo said listen the market wants cash flow we're going to concentrate on cash flow and that has been wonderful for them and you can tell right here on their profit margin from a negative 9.5% overall to 10.5% and i love that their free cash flow is greater than their net income both on fiveyear and the one-year level so we got a lot of great numbers here that 22 times free cash flow guys i'm wondering if this could be like netflix where you sit there and go okay the numbers make sense is it's a little bit of a premium but there's a lot more cash to be generated from this business let's go take a look at these income statements i mean look at this revenue growth it's great it's absol i mean only 10 years ago they did $3.8 billion in revenue they now do that almost every single month that's incredible now what are the eight pillars telling us well the eight pillars as i thought would be pretty ugly because you got fiveyear numbers in here that are absolute garbage the only check marks here he guys eight pillars this is an example of where it's useless in fact i would look at this not necessarily useless but say look how amazing things are the only thing that bothers me is shares outstanding being up that's the only one i'm really paying attention to here okay but now they're generating cash flow they should be limiting how many shares they're they're actually putting out there to market let's see what the analysts think about their eps growth potential a180 to 550 that's almost 3x guys actually is 3x that is awesome over the next 3 years and their revenue growth 18 16 16 8 and a half 13 big- time revenue growth for a company that's still being used a ton in this world now remember we are principle driven investors what that means is we have four major things foundations want to believe in one we're investors not speculators what that means is we don't look at an investment at an asset and say we want to buy it hoping somebody else pays us more in the future we're okay owning it for a long period of time two every investment is the present value of all its future cash flow third we don't buy it if we don't understand it i think uber is a very understandable business it's not some convoluted crazy tech company or crypto or anything like that it's very simple and fourth we don't rely on short-term market price movements that tell us if we're right or wrong we're going to look at this and say if we're buying a company and the stock goes down and the fundamentals are the same and getting better we buy more of it now we put this all together we have the story which is amazing we have the numbers which are amazing how do we put them together because remember a good investor is not someone who just buys a good story because they realize if they overpay for a good story they're not investing they're they're decreasing wealth and we want to change that so the stock analyzer tool here allows us to merge the story with the numbers together to figure out a price that makes sense to us so let me pull up the last time i did uber now this is a 10-e analysis on uber okay and i do 10 years on all my stock analyzers basically i did 6 10 and 14% revenue growth okay i did 10 15 and 20% profit margin and the same for free cash flow guys this could be low this 15 number could be low because i'm free cash flow they already did 14% last year now what's a pe for 10 years from now much bigger company probably a bigger moat this is a company that's probably going to be worth some good money down the road and deserves a premium for it i put 15 18 and 21 i could understand completely if you said paul you're being too conservative here that's what makes the stock analyzer tool so great that's why it's used over a million times per year by the investors in our community the reason being is it allows them to put their own numbers in and finally i put in 9% return guys this is not the return you should be buying stocks at you can get nine or 10% from a long-term etf so if you buy an individual company you need a margin of safety because the future is unkknown and we're humans and we make mistakes so you got to put a number higher than 9% but i put in nine or 10% to give me like the intrinsic value for the business so hit the analyze button boom guys i got a low price of 37 high price of 170 middle price of 85 and what's interesting here guys is pretty good return on our money here if things are right in the middle i i the only concern i have is dilution so you got to factor a little bit more margin of safety i think in to see if they're going to stop their dilution by issuing more shares stock number two intel probably the one that's going to get the most comments in this video guys i'm an owner of intel and it has been brutal they just the ceo just left on his own accord aka he was fired things have been tough at this company guys i want everybody remember this this was the darling of 2000 this is the company where if you didn't have it in your portfolio you were stupid how many companies can you say about that today things change interestingly enough the company even with how poorly it's doing has way more revenue today than it did back in 2000 and the stock has yet to hit its 2,000 peak this is a company that everyone wrote off during its rough patch but if you're paying attention there may be something big brewing here and it's the kind of comeback story that value investors dream about so let's dive in after years of watching taiwan semiconductor and samsung dominate the semiconductor foundry business intel decided to serious their intel foundry services aren't just talk they're already locked in major customers like arm for mobile chips so what does that mean intel is no longer playing catchup they're gunning for leadership you've got to admire a company that invests for tomorrow and intel is dropping billions tens of billions in ohio arizona and germany to build these factories that can do a lot of these things and here's the kicker intel is trading at dirt cheap valuation multiples while showing the signs of a turn around now could it just be a falling knife yeah it very well could be this is what makes investing so difficult we don't know the future now remember every investment is a present value evolve future cash flow we don't know what that future cash flow is but based on intel's rep and the fact they're still making a lot of chips this could be a company that could still turn things around greatly is the juice worth the squeeze even if the chance of success is 20% but the payout is 20 to1 that makes it worth it i'm not saying those are the numbers but that's the way i want you to think because if you had a 100 of those you would make a lot of money so let's take a look at intel here an 85 billion market cap business cash flow terrible cash net income terrible everything here is terrible 35% gross margin used to be 45% guys everything here screams terrible but one thing i'll tell you is price to sales ratio 1.6 this is pretty freaking low for a company even with slow low gross margin like that at 35% as a comparison and i'm not trying to say that nvidia intel are the same company but the price of sales ratio on nvidia 30 20 times higher what about amd price of sales ratio 8.35 four times five times greater taiwan semiconductor 13 times sales so again when companies having a hard time making cash flow and you can't value it off that cash flow today one way to make an analysis of it is to look at their price to sales ratio which i just did there so guys let's look at analyst estimates this will be something interesting to look at this is what's interesting to me if analysts are right and they're back to 463 per share and profit here in the next four or five years even times 18 you're looking at an $8 stock price right there again could the juice be worth the squeeze here are they right they're analysts i don't know if they're right it's hard to figure that out guys the revenue 53 billion 56 billion 61 75 89 so even analysts think that intel is going to get back to amazing revenue growth i don't know it is tough and they've been wrong so far i have been wrong so far in intel based on where the stock price is going but it's pretty interesting to look at this so let's pull up our stock analyzer tool and let's take a look and see what this thing could be worth here in the future guys i did a very poultry 02 and 4% revenue growth from here i did profit margin of 1418 and 22 same with free cash flow guys look at my pees here i did 125 and 18 and a 9% return i beat this thing up hit the analyze button a low price of 1958 which is pennies below current price high price of 51 middle price of 32 could the juice be worth the squeeze here maybe so and this is a company that was at $48 a share just recently in the last year year and a half that doesn't mean anything to me in terms of saying it's worth it but i look at this saying i made a lot of pretty conservative assumptions yes the story is really bad but the story has to be pretty bad the question is do you think intel is going away listen people were already trying to look at buying them this year that's what's interesting to me stock number three dollar general and their story is fascinating it's a blend of strategy resilient in growth so imagine this 75% of the us population lives within 5 miles of a dollar general store that isn't just convenience guys that's absolute dominance they've mastered the art of being right there for millions of americans especially in areas where big box stores can't or will not go they are catering to low to middle inome consumers a group feeling the pinch from inflation and stagnant wages when many's tight where do people go for essentials remember i showed you guys last year lowe's home depot target all saw major same store sales declined while companies like walmart saw major increases these same consumers are turning to dollar general for affordable groceries household goods and even more this demographic is growing making dollar general a consistent go-to in both good and bad economic times and here's the kicker dollar general is considered recession proof during down downturns it doesn't just survive it thrives when belts tighten customers will have to flock to the budget friendly options giving dollar general a solid hedge against economic uncertainty and they're not resting on their laurels over 1,000 new stores are being added in one single year add in initiatives like fresh produce and teleah health services and you can see a company that's adapting to evolving customer needs so again we look at look at this chart here all-time high back in 2022 april of 22 of $262 it's currently at $75 that's a drop of what 65 70% dividend 3.2% that's going to get the attention of a lot of people out there and the best part is their dividend only eats up 500 million of their 1.5 billion in free cash flow that's about 33% of their cash flow that's pretty good guys so it's probably likely that these dividends are here to stay for a while and who likes 10 times free cash flow who likes almost single digit pe that's what they have here guys they have almost single digit price of free cash flow and pe way better than 30 or 40 times what it was before back in 2022 so let's go check out the eight pillars here and see what this looks like all right a lot of debt here probably the leases on those places doesn't worry me so much um net income and cash flow did not grow along with their revenue that's something to take a look at why is revenue up 13 billion but free cash flow and net income are down not the highest return on invested capital this means that they don't get you know some astronomical return on the money that they put in the business so i think this tells me okay listen they dominate this market but this low return invested capital maybe do a little discount to your earnings multiple for that reason let's see what analysts are saying about the company okay 770 to 1216 over the next 5 years or so in earnings per share so 50% no more than that 60% earnings per share growth and revenue growth 5% 5% 5% 9% 6 and a half% so middle single digits again nothing to write home about but it's inflation plus adding some stores along the way so the question is what's the price to pay based on stock analyzer tool here are my assumptions 3 five 7% revenue growth 5 a2 6.25 7% profit margin 4.25 4.75 5.25 on free cash flow which is actually looking a little high compared to their last 10 years now pe and price of free cash flow you heard me talk about a little discount to it i did 13 to 17 with 15 in the middle and my 9% return the stock is currently at $74 per share hit the analyze button wowza guys 110 to 140 215 to 285 and 150 to 200 in the middle now these returns here include dividends but gez op this could be well worth a look i mean these are really high returns and yeah i was a little aggressive on the free cash flow margin but you look at those pees i wasn't pretty aggressive on the pe and price of free cash flow so it's something to look at now guys investors in our community have analyze over 4600 stocks this year alone and dollar general happens to be one of the stocks that our community has been discussing and analyzing a ton this year and it's pretty obvious why if dollar general is on your radar you should go have a conversation about it inside the everything money community go in here first off do a search for where it was being done you can search the exact stock it'll take you

in the description below to get access to everything we have to offer including all these investing tools in the community and i assure you it'll be the best investing decision you closed out the year with stock number four asml holdings this is another company that investors inside our community discuss very frequently it's the company most people don't know but unknowingly rely on every single day so let me break this down why this dutch powerhouse is a name that the people in our community and the investing world are watching very closely and why it's so important to the global economy so first off as sml's claim to fame is its monopoly on extreme ultra violet lithography machines when i say monopoly though i'm not exaggerating nobody else in the world can make these machines and they're essential for producing cuttingedge semiconductor chips without asml there's no ai revolution there's no iphones there's no electric cars there's no there's so many things that we take for granted now with its iron grip on euv technology asml sits at the heart of a $600 billion semiconductor industry poised to grow even more with ai and 5g but dominance like that has its challenges us restrictions prevent asml from selling its eu machines to china throwing the company in the middle of a geopolitical chess match now for investors their strategic importance is hard to ignore its machines are the gatekeepers of tech innovation but its current valuation the question is simple does the price make sense remember every investment boils down to one thing you're buying future cash flows the question is can you buy it at a discount that makes sense if asml fits that bill it's worth a deeper look if not there's no shame in waiting for the right opportunity you've seen countless times how many companies that we that people say there's no way that stock is falling will plummit 60 70 80% patience is the investor's best friend so let's take a look at this company right now currently at 710 per share all-time high of 1110 just back in july and now at at 710 guys that's a huge drop for a company this big great balance sheet $281 billion market cap versus $300 billion enterprise value now i will say one thing i don't like free cash flow three billion last year 5.6 in the last 5 years it's a little bit behind the 5year average of six but net income of 7.2 billion so they took a big hit to free cash flow focus on this fiveyear free cash flow number now 50 times 5-year free cash flow and 46 times earnings is pretty expensive and the other thing is i want to go check out how do they do in the last five years as this as this as everything surged 11.4 billion 12.3 14.5 19.4 22 28.7 they finally saw a dip in the last 12 months on their revenue compared to previous years but look at the surge i mean just kept growing and growing growing what i like about it is it's still growing even though the semiconductor chip market was really skyrocketing and started to fall a little bit toward in recent years okay so this could still be good but again 50 times free cash flow okay let's check out the eight pillars here guys what do we love seeing here just a stock according to the pillars we just need to be a little patient on waiting for the price to fall but everything else looks pretty good one thing i don't like what we talked about earlier the last 5 years seen a $3.7 billion increase in net income while only a $600 million increase in free cash flow so that's something to pay attention to and make sure it's not a trend that's going to continue on here so what are analy saying here wow $20 eps going to 51 bucks 2.5x in the next four years maybe that's why it's selling for 50 times free cash flow that's a lot of growth there guys that's a lot lot of growth and that deserves a premium if it comes true terms of revenue growth double digit 165 14 254 big time growth here so this is a company that's selling for really high premium but might be worth it based on its growth potential so let's check out the stock analyzer tool on this company because it's really really important for us to focus on what that present value of future cash flows could be worth now i did 10 year analysis i did 8 12 and 16% revenue growth profit margin 22 24 and 26 i did the same thing for free cash flow if you see here apart from this last year they had pretty good profit and free cash flow the last five years a lot closer together so i like that now for pe 1518 21 i don't know if that's right i don't know if that you if you think it's right whatever you want to put in there please do but definitely do not put 9% desired return you need to have that margin of safety with a much higher desired return i have a low price of 340 high price of 930 middle price of 560 so this tells me from my perspective i just need to be a little patient i need to wait a little bit longer wait for the stock to fall further or fundamentals get a lot better stock number five another company i own and guys don't ever own a company just cuz somebody on the internet does we're here to teach our principal driven investing process it's here to teach a process i own 24 companies and two etfs i will explain them till i'm blue in the face and i'm not going to be right on anywhere close to all of them it's about teaching that process now with that said i do think alibaba has one of the most the biggest potential gains out of all the companies we've talked about it is called the amazon of china and that that label is pretty accurate to a certain point now they're called the amazon of china and i think that label is getting even more accurate as time goes on like amazon like amazon they dominate e-commerce with tbow and t- platforms driving massive user engagement and they're not just selling stuff they're creating ecosystems and their vip membership program now has 46 million loyal high-spending users that's a powerful mode it locks in customers and keeps competitors at bay and then just like amazon there's alibaba cloud which is a juggernaut in asia and it ranks among the top four global cloud providers but here's the rub despite having a business model firing on so many cylinders alibaba has seen its stock crumble from $300 down to a current price of $84 per share that's an ey watering drop especially when you compare it to amazon which has doubled over the same time frame and trades at nearly 50 times earnings meanwhile alibaba sits at a modest low doubl digigit multiple so why is that well this isn't about alibaba being a bad company it's about sentiment and geopolitics the market sees china as a wild card and that uncertainty slashes alibaba's valuation multiple significantly even though it arguably has more growth runway with china's middle class expanding faster than america's and amazon's core us market add to that the $1.4 trillion doll stimulus package which will definitely directly benefit alibaba as local governments reinvest paying off debts and empowering the middle class to consume more and don't forget they are buying back shares like crazy they in the last quarter alone they spent $4.1 billion buying back their shares and reducing share count by 2.1% it shows that management believes in their company and thinks their stock is undervalued and willing to act on it putting the money of the company where their mouth is this is a classic lesson investing is about buying things well not just buying good things alibaba isn't popular right now but popularity doesn't drive returns in the long run value does in the short run stocks are a voting machine and the long run they're a weighing machine and at $84 alibaba might just be a gift wrapped opportunity for disciplined investors willing to ignore the noise in fact a lot of great value investors have gotten on board on alibaba under $100 per share so let's check this out $23 billion market cap 12 billion free cash in last year 19 billion over the last five years significantly different than their fiveyear average net income of 13 half billion dollars no dividend which i love they're buying back shares guys companies that buy back shares just keep increasing the value for their investors if they buy back the stock cheap that's what i love and this company's currently selling for 11 times it's fiveyear average free cash flow 11 times every single thing i hear about alibaba stock about why it's bad was the same thing it all was existed right here but yet what happens news follows the stock price as the stock started to fall all those issues that were happening started to come up that's very consistent across history so let's check out analyst estimates here funny thing is analysts might be buying the same thing $872 to $9 per share that's pretty bad not much growth in the next five or six years but again at 11 times free cash flow if they keep this the same and keep buying back their shares and they keep buying back 2 to 3% per year in the next five or six years they bought back 10 to 20% of the company increasing value and increasing that earnings per share for its investors but the interesting thing to me is how revenue is going from 130 to 180 billion and yet earnings per share is staying flat are all of a sudden their margins going to get a lot lower i don't know it doesn't add up to me very well could be the case but it doesn't add up to me so let me show you guys what does add up to me let's go to our stock analyzer tool and let's pull up my last assumptions for the next 10 years guys 3 six and 9% revenue growth nothing insane profit margin i did 12 15 and 18% and for free cash flow i did 15 18 and 21 might be a little high based on but if you look at the 10year numbers both of these 10year numbers are low are higher than my middle assumptions here so i'm going to assume they get back to really good growth don't forget china's fast growing middle class yes they have a decline in population but the average person in china makes 12 or 14,000 a year the average person in the us makes over 70,000 a year they have a lot more growth potential for their middle class that's what's impressive here and of course i did my 16 18 to 20 times earnings and 9% desired return obviously if you don't feel comfortable with china do not look at the stock any further but we hit the analyze button the stock's currently 84 we have a low price of 105 to 130 high price of 285 to 330 middle price of 175 at 210 guys check out the community $7 for 7 days go try it out thank you very much for

get started right now you have time on your side it's the most powerful wealth building tool the good news is that you don't need to save millions of dollars overnight instead work back backwards if you consistently save 25,000 year for the next 30 years you'll be well on your way depending on your spending but if that seems impossible let's focus on what you can do maybe your income doesn't support 25 a year the good news is if your income doesn't support it you probably don't need as much as you might think when you retire in order to retire comfortably if you can't start with 7 25,000 a year start with $500 a month that's $16 per day less than mo most people will spend on tak out the point is to start small get repetitive about it make it a habit and let those savings grow over time let me show you our retirement calculator which has been so incredibly useful guys just this morning i use this retirement calculator i use it as a way of reminding me of where i stand in my savings world that's what i love about it so let's sit here and go to the age of 35 you're 35 today you want to retire at 65 let's say you have zero in savings right now and you're going to save $25,000 a year and you're going to increase that by 4% a year so as your income goes up you will go increase your savings as well let's say along that time you do 9% returns you're going to do a lowc cost etf that gets between 9 and 10% let's call it 99.5% returns actually and during retirement it's going to ask you okay what are your returns during retirement well they're probably going to go down you're probably going to take take a lot more risk off the table let's take it down to 6.5% and let's say you live to the age of 90 and inflation is 3.5% and you currently make 125,000 a year and the great news is this last question what percent of your income do you want to have in retirement well guys the good news is every financial planner and every every stat out there says that most people spend less during retirement they usually have a paid off house they have they don't they don't not as fancy they don't need to buy more clothes they don't care about those things so let's say you want to live off 70% of your 75% of your income here's what's great about this calculator before i hit generate it asks so many questions beyond just when are you going to retire it'll say do you have enough to live off of the rest of your life hit the generate button boom do you have enough retirement yes and this chart to the right shows exactly what you'll have all the way down to retirement when you start withdrawing in retirement dollars as well as today's dollars you'll have $6.2 million in in in dollars at the age of 66 which is worth $2 million today that's incredible and when you pass away at 90 you'll still be wealthier $6.8 million that's incredible awesome work now let's go to the other extreme and say you can't afford this you can only afford 6,000 a year which is $500 a month but you're making $75,000 a year hit generate now you do not have enough retirement but here's the great news this retirement calculator tells you exactly how much you need to save in additional every single year you need to save another $5,500 more per year this is going to tell you do you need to cut back your spending do you need to get a side hustle another job something like that you want to be able to enjoy life in retirement we don't want you to just live and work and live and work and that's it the key is to start i don't care if it's even $100 a week you can do that write that down even saving $100 a week can put you on a solid path now the key i want you to remember is as time goes on you're going to sit there and think i'm not saving much 6,000 i'm at 50,000 i'm at 100,000 at the age of 44 i only got 20 years left but that's the power of compounding at the age of 60 you have almost a million dollars and when you retire you have a million5 right here yeah it's not a ton but based on your savings right here when do you run out of money according to this the age of 76 so you definitely need to figure out some way of either cutting unary spending start by auditing your monthly expenses do you need all those streaming services can you switch to brewing coffee at home instead of hitting the coffee shop every single day these small changes can add to hundreds even thousands of dollars saved per year here's an easy win pause this video grab your bank statement cancel one subscription that you're not using i'm not asking you to live like a monk and

half% returns will easily drop to 7.5% and after retirement let's go to 5% and let's go back to our $225,000 savings guys if you remember we retired in that scenario originally with 6.2 million let's say where we are now you have enough for retirement still but instead of 6.2 million you have 4 .3 million that just costs you $1.9 million that 2% per year just cost you $1.9 million in the other

2024-12-30,9quXe2bxlzo,"kind: captions language: en today we are diving into three incredible companies that are leading the charge in ai luxury and creative technology these stocks aren't just businesses they're movements that are shaping our future and i'm waiting for a massive sale on these three amazing companies and before we go further i'm going to hear people in these in these comments say these companies aren't going on sale absolutely they will no company stays high forever and the first one was the prime example let's get into it with google guys i love the googly mly i have people who say to me paul i just love watching your videos on google to hear you say googly mly this company has absolutely flossed in recent two years $193 per share it got as low as83 or $85 per share back at the end of 2022 right after that little bare market we have alphabet just posted q3 2024 revenue of 88.3 billion in the quarter which is a 15% jump year-over-year and their profit on that up 34% to 26.3 billion please let that sink in this company's net income in that quarter is larger than the gdp of so many small countries countries the google cloud segment is the star of the show revenue soared 35% to 11.4 billion which with operating profit going from 266 million to $1.9 billion over six times more that's not just a jump it's an absolute leap and it tells me that google cloud isn't just catching up it's carving out a significant piece of the enterprise computing pi and then there's youtube the very website you're on right now watching this channel the two largest search engines in the world google's number one youtube is number two isn't that inedible and they cracked $50 billion in annual revenue advertising dollars are rushing in and the subscription revenue is is cherry on top and of course we got to talk about search google processes over 8.5 billion queries per day that's 999,000 every single second google owns a space if you asked 100 people with the top search engine in the world how many are going to say google their ai generated answer has now reach a billion users per month which is a testament to their ability to stay ahead in innovation even weo their self driving car unit is showing real traction with 150,000 paid weekly rides in 2024 it's obviously still a long-term play part of their other bets but it's no longer a moonshot it's moving towards tangible profitability and here's the kicker despite regulatory pressures and antitrust noise alphabets diversify business model is an absolute fortress they've got dominant positions in search video cloud and ai which is all supported by their incredible cash flow but let's keep it real alphabets at stock isn't exactly cheap by most metrics the question for value investors is can we buy this incredible business at a price that makes sense until then it's on the watch list so what's your take alphabets a beast no doubt but we don't chase the shiny objects patience discipline and valuation that's how we win principal driven investing is what we're trying to teach across this entire channel so this is a $2.4 trillion company very little debt practically none cash flow fiveyear average of 59 billion last year did 55 billion net income though this is what's a little concerning a lot higher net income than their free cash flow got to understand that a little bit more high price of free cash flow 43 pe of 25 gross profit of 57.8% that is incredible let's look at the eight pillars i'm pretty sure i know how it's going to look yep bur six checks two x's on the valuations now remember guys we have to talk about this all the time people think value investors or people just want dirt cheap companies that's not the case dirt cheap means paying a discount to the future cash flow if two companies are exactly the same today but one's going to grow 20% per year one's going to grow 5% this company deserves a premium and its current value is higher than this company you should and so let's say on these two companies let's say we do it and one is worth $10 to us and one is worth $20 to us because this one has a higher growth potential if i paid $9 for this or if i was able to buy this for 14 which one's a better deal this one's the better deal even though this one is less money this is a 30% discount to intrinsic value this is a 10% discount this is what i mean when i hear people say when i laugh at people who say oh value investors don't versus growth investors no growth is an integral part of value investing which we will show you in our stock analyzer tool it's the very first line let's go see what analysts are saying about this company eps of 825 gr to 414 solid double digit growth and revenue of 360 billion going to 520 pretty much double digit growth as well incredible now guys as i was saying this is exactly why you need a stock analyzer tool this stock analyzer tool we put our assumptions about the future in we put low middle and high because there's a range of outcomes it could be we don't know the future but what it does for us is it sits there and factors in all this all this information and says here's the price to pay to get the return you want at the bottom this is how we marry the story and the numbers we put them together with our stock analyzer tool because the story is awesome we're going to have better revenue growth better profit better free cash flow and pay a higher premium if the story is lousy we decrease these numbers it's putting it all together in one place and there's a reason why this tool was used over a million times in 2024 by our community of investors here now i did temp tier analysis i did four 7 and a half and 11% growth guys you should look at this right now it's saying paul it's so low it is a little low profit margin 22 24 and 26 same with free cash flow could be a little low pe guys this is a premium company i put 20 23 and 26 for both and you might sit there and say paul it deserves higher i don't blame you maybe it's probably higher than 23 in the middle i don't know that's what makes investing difficult and finally for my desir return that i know is incorrect 9% the reason i say this is i'm trying to look for the market return but remember if you're buying individual company you got to get a return higher than 9% i put this in here so we can find out some intrinsic value for this business i hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 193 i have a low price of 118 high price of 292 middle price of 186 so this is telling me i just need to be a little patient on this company stock number two microsoft they're exploding into the aid driven future with its ai business poised to exceed a $10 billion annual run rate it's azure cloud services or skyrocketing now powering nearly 70% of fortune 500 companies enabling businesses to scale and innovate faster than ever before but the real magic lies in microsoft 365 co-pilot the ai assistant that's already shaking up productivity with 1.3 million users in just a single quarter spreading across industries like healthcare and retail and it gets even better github co-pilot is fueling 40% of github's revenue growth in 2024 with 77,000 organizations jumping on board marking a 180% year-over-year surge guys where can you find any sort of company with a$3 trillion do market cap that has any sort of division that is up 188 180% year-over-year that's so incredibly difficult on top of that microsoft's partnerships are turbocharging ai across industries just look at its deal with vone where 365 pilot has been deployed to 68,000 employees saving each one an incredible three hours per day boosting productivity and fostering innovation at every level with ai transforming every corner of its business microsoft is clearly leading the charge into the future and this is a company that admed 12 years ago a tech ceo sat in front of me and said microsoft is dead which just goes to show news follows the stock stock price but they're not just building tools microsoft is building the future of work and innovation but is it the right time to buy so microsoft is another multi-trillion dollar business 3.24 trillion $3.4 trillion do enterprise value very little debt also trailing their free cash flow from the net income 72 billion last year 61 over the last five years on average versus net income of 90 billion dollars last year and 70.5 in the last five years incredible gross profit market of almost 70% leading to a bottom line of a very consistent 35% over the last year in the last 5 years and guys look at this adorable dividend 7% it's adorable but guess what eats up $22 billion of their cash flow which they can easily afford and this really high return on invested capital of 22% over the last five years makes this eight pillars right here six of them again two x's here but what's the premium you want to pay for micros it's clearly a premium business i don't want to hear otherwise so what do analysts think about microsoft $12 per share growing to 2290 almost doubling in the next five or six years and revenue double digit growth 250 to $447 billion in the next five or six years so stock analyzer tool let's check this bad boy out let's pull up microsoft 69 and 12% revenue growth profit margin of 32 34 and 36 free cash flow of 28 31 and 34 but i want to point something out in the last 5 years free cash flow was 31% profit margin was 35% but in the last 10 years they were right in line so the question becomes this is where it's hard where you go well which one's going to be which is is the profit margin going to be higher but free cash is going to match it or vice versa we don't know pe put the same pe that i put in for google 2023 and 26 and my 9% return now guys before before i get in the numbers from microsoft if you've been to our website because you saw how successful our community and our tools are you may have noticed we have a waiting

for microsoft relative to the value i hit the analyze button the stock's currently at 433 i have a low price of 220 to 250 high price of 515 to 544 middle price of 340 370 guys if you think my high assumptions were accurate 11% return doesn't look bad for coming like my microsoft and you got to remember though it's not going to go straight up it's probably going to fall stocks don't go straight up be ready to buy more that's the whole point of principal driven investing we don't let short-term price movements in the stock tell us if we're right or wrong i'm really excited and i'm hoping that this stock falls because i really want microsoft in my portfolio because this is one of the three stocks i'm really excited to buy guys the third stock ferrari guys this is a luxury powerhouse masterly blending exclusivity and profitability to dominate the market by limiting production to just 15,000 cars annually ferrari ensures perpetual demand and cements its position as the epitome of luxury it's operating margins of 31% outshine mass market car makers like toyota and even luxury peers like porsche rivaling icons like hermes and rolex beyond cars ferrari has expanded into couture with its 202 21 fashion line theme parks like ferrari world abu dhabi and licensing deals for everything from lego sets to video games making it a cultural and lifestyle icon limited edition masterpieces like la ferrari aperta sell for over2 million why the tailor made program turns vehicles into personalized works of art ferrari's genius lies in balancing heritage innovation and prestige ensuring its legacy transcends automobiles guys my personal anecdote on this i was in naples florida my wife and i were driving there was a beautiful brand new ferrari dealership we decided to stop in and see what they had we talked to a very nice guy named paulo there so i talking to paulo and i said hey paulo if i wanted a ferrari how would i do it he said listen if you want a brand new ferrari join the list i can't guarantee you probably won't get one however go out buy a ed ferrari come back in here tell me you bought it show it to me will register it then put your order in guys i thought it was wonderful some people would sit there and say f that i don't i think it's wonderful that they're basically like listen do you want to join the club go prove you want to join the club go buy one come back in here register with us and then the next year or two you might get a new one that's incredible so let's check out ferrari all-time high of almost $500 back in september now i'm going to jump right to something that bothers me 1.5 billion in net income 1 billion a year in the last 5 years but look at their free cash flow 1 billion last year 600 million in the last 5 years got to understand why that is it might be due to reporting and currencies but go look at their actual financials from italy but look at these returns on invested capital 16% over the last 5 years 20% in the last year this is a company if they want to sell 50,000 ferraris tomorrow they could and greatly increase their profit but they don't and by by the way speaking of profit 50% gross margin every car they sell has 50% profit let me show you how amazing that is let's pull up some car companies let's pull up toyota toyota's gross margin 19% pull up honda honda's gross margin 21.6% let's pull up tesla tesla's gross margin 18.23% ironically tesla everybody says is not a c company it's a software business yet it has the lowest profit gross margin of toyota honda and ferrari i won't get into that even though tech companies have 20 have 80% gross margins but i digress let's go back to ferrari and see what the eight pillars look like guys checks x's right here and of course because their free cash flow is so much lower it's a much higher price of free cash flow than their net income guys and as you can tell this is the theme we've seen here these are great companies i just have to wait a little bit longer for them to be cheaper how much cheaper i've already shown you on google and microsoft we're going to take a look here at ferrari but that's the important part here to understand so what's what are analysts saying about ferrari earnings per share oh that's interesting not much growth here 860 to 1050 kind of surprised by that even though revenue they have growing at 10% 11% 8% 8% 3% 7% i don't know it's kind of interesting here now remember ferrari isn't just selling cars it's selling a lifestyle it's selling a dream and that exclusivity comes at a price the question is when's the right price to buy into this luxury so let's check out the stock analyzer and find out about ferrari so here are my revenue assumptions for the next 10 years 4 7 and 10% profit margin 19 20 and 21 and free cash flow 11 13 and 15 pe 2025 and 30 absolutely needed it's a premium business we have to give that big premium it's absolutely a premium business that deserves a massive premium i could understand if somebody told me no i want to pay 30 times in my middle i would get it i' be like yeah i don't blame you i don't blame you at all and it's that return of 9% hit the analyze button now guys remember $7 for 7 days this will absolutely change the way in which you view your investing so go check it out but the price i have for ferrari is low price of 80 to 140 high price of 230 to 300 middle price of 150 to 26 guys i just got to wait because a great business if you oay overpay for it becomes a bad investment so if you want to watch the top five stock value investors are buying now watch our next video thank you for your
