2024-10-25,K6wxlQvh2Pk,"kind: captions language: en we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and there is a set of stocks that are set to explode and not for the reason that you might think let me show you a quick clip and explain exactly what i mean that to just to get us to the point where we stabilize that to gdp at where it is right now here's what you need to do you need to let the trump tax cuts expire that's 390 billion you need to raise the payroll tax on every single working person 1% that's another big slug you need to what do you think does to jobs we're clearly going to have a period of contraction which hopefully that's why i was going to say it's going to be really important for the fed to be able to offset the fiscal contraction area that's going to come then you want to increase the individual tax rate all the way to the top rate of close to 50% now hold it yep i don't want to do any of this stuff what i'm telling you is is that we've got to be serious about where we are fiscally and so i'm giving you there's a whole set of options right we could go in and cut 25% of the civ of the federal workforce some people may do that i there's there's a whole there's a website where you can go look and play with all the options you can raise the capital gains rate from 21 to 28% that only gets you10 billion a year it actually doesn't get you what you need so i'm simply showing right some of the things that you can do yes you'd have to raise the tax tax rate on the top i think probably everyone over 200 grand probably have to raise that to 49 half% if you do all these things all these things ra raise the social security from 65 to 70 if you do all these things means tests medicare if you do all these things all you do is you get to a primary balance what that means is you stabilize debt to gdp you're still actually increasing your debt right you're still actually increasing it because it excludes the interest cost which oh by the way the interest bill this year is larger than every single line item except social security it's larger than defense spending larger than medicare i want to talk about why you're here which is robin hood and this conference but before i do that is this given all the things you're saying are you off buying gold and bitcoin and and hi i think all roads lead to inflation we're going to end up if you so do all road lead guys we're listening to paul tor jones and he's saying that all roads will lead to inflation this is a pretty big issue in our economy and i've made many videos now where i've pointed out that the government's lying to us with inflation they're downplaying inflation to be specific inflation's a lot higher than what we think okay they're downplaying it by manipulating the cpi basket okay the consumer purchasing index right it's a basket of of things that we're analyzing right so here by the way is the basket the cpi index okay you can see right here that you know they're saying that energy is actually getting cheaper you you see that food is actually going up a little bit but not by much and these by the way are the 12mon percentage change the consumer price index selects categories in september 2024 so this is actually a month ago or so two months ago almost at this point and uh not seasonally adjusted okay so cpi for all items rises 0.2% in september shelter food up now that's not a big deal in general 0.2% but it's a big deal because it's a lot higher than it actually is okay so i'm looking at some specifics here so the average price data here is selected items you can see here for example let's go to bananas okay bananas are you know fairly stable we can look at bread so bread is kind of interesting here with uh the prices going up eggs eggs are huge right because of antibiotics use and there's a whole lot stuff with eggs and eggs are a really big component eggs are a lot more volatile and actually back here we had um i guess there was there was actually a disease for the chickens so that's why the price of eggs for a a large per dozen was like 480 482 right so you can see a whole bunch of different things here oranges you know pretty you know not going up that much electricity but the craziest thing is there is a waiting to the price index and you know without spending too much time on this you know looking at the nitty-gritty little charts here i want to point out that right now is the most important time especially an election month right coming into election month an election year it's really important for us to be in the high quality companies i believe inflation will ramp up because they can't hide it forever i do think that we're going to start to see more news of higher inflation that's my personal take and uh paul tutor jones said the same so i do have some tips for you i want to finish off the clip though inflation therefore gold is a good investment is bitcoin a good investment i i i'm long gold i'm long bitcoin i think commodities are so ridiculously under owned so i'm long commodities i think most young people find their inflation hedges via the nasdaq that's also been great it's probably some combination i probably have some basket of gold bitcoin commodities and nasdaq something like that and it own zero fixed income if i had my cash it'd be very shortterm the playbook to get out of this you see it in japan right now they have 2% inflation 30 30 basis points overnight they don't want to raise rates the playbook to get out of this is that you inflate your way out and and you have a small tax on the consumer and you run interest rates and nominal growth rate interest rates um below inflation and nominal growth uh above inflation and that's how you reduce your debt to gdp so you're going to have the fed b they should be easy they should be should be easy they should you want them to cut just real quickly every hundred basis points given where our debt to gdp right now every hundred basis points is worth about 90 billion a year to the deficit 90 billion so yes if we're trying to stabilize debt to gdp we want to run the most dovish monetary policy that we can without letting inflation become too much of a tax on the citizenry so yes all roads lead to inflation that's historically the way every civilization has gotten out is they've inflated away their debt so guys it does look like we're going to inflate our way out of debt which is the most realistic and honestly the smartest thing the united states government can do is why would you pay off the debt with like really really hard-earned money when you can kind of inflate your way out of the debt right and then that money isn't as meaningful right it's it's easier to pay back and you know money it's kind of like a manipul it's like manipulation right it's it's paper it's up it's down the currency can be you know more or less manipulated in infl can be manipulated but what paul tor jones said right there the man's the man has so much experience so i i i had to have you watch that clip because i think a lot of things that he said is going to be a game changer and it's going to make a big impact on the market now one thing that i want to point out the most important thing for me from that clip an actionable insight is he thinks that energy is under represented which i agree with in my portfolio um you know we're doing very well we're at $3.6 million i'm on the road to $4 million guys i'm publicly showing everything think i'm personally also under on the um energy so i'm actually going to make a trade right now on xle now i don't have a whole lot of cash let me just check my cash real quick depending on how much i have a lot of cash actually just tied up in a lot of sell puts because i'm aggressively trying to get into positions i'm running the wheel strategy and i've sold a lot of aggressive puts which is why you just saw i had $885,000 of cash but my buying power is only 126k and it's because well here's an spy cell put i have it's a very short-term put i am doing a little bit short term trading here and there on spy but anyways i do have enough cash i am going to purchase xle so look i have a lot of my students especially my one-on-one students i've noticed that they have cvx slb exxon mobile i like these three companies a lot right if you look at the top holdings here you will see that exxon mobile is 23% of xle it's a it's a etf with energy sector right it have xon mobile they have chevron they have kico phillips williams uh and then here's the slb here's slum b right uh we got philip 66 we got marathon petroleum i know a lot of you guys have oxy oxy i think there was um a lot of popularity i think it was on youtube and there's just a lot of publicity on it because warren buffet in oxy you know oxy is not a main contributor it's not a main holding right now in the top 10 for xle but look i'm not against oxy i think in general energy companies are actually a really good investment they have really good cash flow really good c like really really good cash flow as well as good dividends so if we take a look at the dividend income here we got a 30-day yield of a little bit over 3% okay now it's up to you whether you go for single stocks or the etf itself i'll show you example of both right now i think that given what paul tudo jones says and given what i've been saying about about inflation when inflation goes up which they're under representing i think when those numbers become more public so to say you'll see that commodity prices will also go up and when commodity prices go up um these companies and energy will will make more money i do think part of that is priced in i'll be honest with you but i also think some of that is not priced in so if you want a good hedge and a good protection in your portfolio and pa paul tudor jones said he doesn't have any bonds guys i i say the same thing why would you even if you're in retirement just go for option income it's way more attractive than bonds it's way safer options are safer than stocks and in my opinion options can be safer than bonds obviously bonds are probably bit more safer but they also have no returns at all right so i'm not a huge fan of bonds either so i agree with paul tor jones on all fronts there now look if i were to do xle it's at $90 for the past 3 months it's going sideways which is actually a good thing i would do a couple things here okay you can run the coverage strangle strategy s puts covered calls the wheel right the wheel my bread and butter the these are my bread and butter i actually just added coverage strangle today in today's video but my brand butter is sellp puts covered calls and uh and the wheel shot right so i've been doing that for a decade now so let's go into um i would just straight up keep it really boring i would go through election and i would just sell a put option on xle i would go right here around at the money okay this is over 3% return if you want to generate income the safest income just go xle you get a sign no problem we have a strong cash flow you have a strong cash flow etf okay so i could go for something like this sell this option right here collect $300 um put up $88,500 the return is not an awful lot so here if you want to hire return what you can also do is you can also sell a call option you could sell to 95 this gives you upside this would be better if you want higher return uh a little bit higher on the risk i would say a little bit higher but not by much you can do the 95 covered call okay so the 95 covered call here essentially you would buy 100 shares of xle and then you would sell the 95 call option so when you sell the 95 call option here you get upside from 90 to 95 which is about $5 and okay and you get the $2 you get seven in total addressable or total potential upside on 90 which is you know almost 10% it's like a 7% is return in 90 days you get a 7% return now we're talking now that's good okay so it depends on which side you want to go on selling puts and covered calls are very similar in risk and return uh so this is a very similar risk and return but if xle moves up which i do think it'll move up i would probably say the covered call however if you want to run the covered strangle strategy you would do both if you have a bigger portfolio which is you know majority of you guys that i and especially the one-on-one students i work with got 50k 100k 200k 300k etc right these guys are in closer to the retirement zone but even if you're just a busy professional and you're just starting off in your option journey you're at 25k 50k look i mean i i think you can still do both right it is a significant portion of your portfolio and you have to be mindful of asset allocation and risk management but what you can do is you can sell a 90 put option and you can buy 100 shares and sell a covered call obviously i only sell cash secured puts for the most part unless it's more of my advanced strategies with oneon-one students that are you know in the six figure range so sell a cash secured put you have to have the cash and then for the covered call you also want to have you need to buy 100 shares cu covered call by definition is covered so you need to buy 100 shares now look i think aside from xle what you can do is you can also sell um you can also go to individual stock itself so exxon mobile i'll go over exon mobile and oxy maybe i'll cover slb as well uh exxon mobile has had a good performance it is the leader and the biggest holding in xle so i think you can just go directly for exxon it's about the same price just go ahead and start off with the wheel strategy sell a put at 120 go right at the money go right go get the bull buy its horns all right get the bull by horns bicep over tricep okay get the bull by its horns and go in there i think it's going to be a good play especially because energy prices i think they're going to go up because of inflation being mis misrepresented and paul tor jones said himself that he thinks that it's underrepresented so i think there's an opportunity in energy specifically for a safe passive consistent income approach to option selling on energy so i'm taking a little unique twist here i'm using my option expertise in my experience to basically apply it i think the sector is undervalued so this is a very good idea now i will also look at oxy i know a lot of people have oxy now oxy i think is a is a really interesting stock because years to date the stock is actually down so i knew that i was doing the research on this stock but it is at a good price point it's at $51.90 i think if you're going to sell a put option we've had a very hard balance here at the $50 level you know $ 49.91 so if you sell a $50 put you are getting very good uh strategic entry into oxy i would certainly look at oxy as a single play so it depends on your outlook if you just want the simple income approach and you're one of my my typical students you know engineer doctor dentist you're busy or busy professional just go xle just leave it alone but if you have a little bit more time on your hands you can go for some interesting plays on oxy go for 50 for example if i go to sell put just go for 50 i can go for let's say november 15 you can go november 15 you can go uh december you can go january guys listen the expiration date is just a time period okay you get paid in proportion to the time that you take right so you take a certain amount of time you get paid it's fine you go one month two months three months you go 3 weeks 6 weeks as long as you're under 90 days there's some nuances there okay but for the purposes of this video just to keep keep things simple options really start to decay in that last period of time as the period approaches to expiration things get worse for the option right i can make an example but i think you get the point it doesn't matter too hard on the expiration november 15's fine december uh traditional expiration is most important friday third friday of the month traditional expiration okay so if you go for a 50 here um this is like a 2% return almost it's it's it's about 2% return in 23 days i mean that's a very solid return that's 4% a month uh give or take you know we're at 3 4% a month that's exactly what you need to do to compound your wealth to get into retirement that looks beautiful to me oxy is a clear sellp put now the last thing that i want to quickly look at for energy is slb slumber also very good price point and this stock is going a little bit sideways you know in the past three months it's it's down 14% in the past one year it's down so i would say that this is a good opportunity to sell puts at 40 for um i would go november december expiration or four covered calls at the 45 covered call so you know i think paul tudor jones is on point and it's it's very on point with what i've been saying for for over a month now well over a month about inflation data coming in so yeah make sure that you're subscribed i'm going to make more analysis videos to help you guys make more money let's be safe out

2024-10-27,TgNzibRAtx4,"kind: captions language: en guys tesla stock exploded after earnings and i've made a video about unusual options so this is an updated video on how you can make more money on tesla let's jump into it now guys i'll be honest with you it's the morning i'm about to hit the gym but i was just thinking about my subscribers here i was thinking about you guys and how much money we made this week on tesla so i'm going to quickly show you that i'm up $49,000 on tesla have a thousand shares in this portfolio um i have several different option positions on tesla and i did tell you guys that there is unusual option behavior there was a lot of people buying calls specifically there was a lot of um call volume in general and there was multiple data points that made me believe that tesla would beat earnings and i'm very happy because i'm not running a challenge right now but in my challenge we sold two 10 foots which paid for the challenge easily okay so i'm very excited to give you guys more information on tesla i think this is a very valuable stock and now that it's up a lot i think people have made a lot of money and you're probably question yourself should i keep holding the stock should i sell the stock should i buy more shares what option position should i do so i'm going to make this uh video just very um informative okay i want to say that first of all there is a recent interview with dan ies i think that interview is very important to watch and understand before i give you my thought process and um some of the reasons why i'm very bullish on tesla still right now so check out this clip and then let's continue on with the video with some examples talk about tesla because those numbers are out now revenues are light but hey earnings uh what matters more here i mean the whole story is about gross margins i mean that's really been the headwind on tesla stock i'd say $ 30 to $40 of a headwind to the stock you saw gross margins i mean this is a blowout not even us thought that we could see a gross margin where essen is anywhere from a 2 to 300 bit beat this shows price cuts now under control margins start to tick back up you start to get now toward 20 % grow margins i think this is the start of the stock ultimately this will have a three in front of it as a stock as the grow margin start to trend up and as well as growth into next year from a delivery perspective so does the robo taxi stuff matter look i think longer term i would think the the longer term story here is autonomous is robotics is essentially the ai play street what they needed to see here show me margins you cannot have margins going toward 13 14% now that margins are starting to level off that is so important not just from a cashow perspective but showing the worse is in the rearview mirror and when you think about all the bears and all the negatives it comes down to deliveries will start to uptick china i think is a source of strength in the quarter but that gross margin it's a goldilocks for any bear okay it's a goldie locks for any bull the bears it's kind of a nightmare for because that was ultimately the core of the story yeah to your point free cash flow 2.74 billion ion doll at tred expectations for q3 but some of the details we're getting here on the outlook i think are also really notable they're basically saying despite the ongoing macroeconomic conditions we expect to achieve slight growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024 also talking about energy storage deployments that are going to more than double this year but perhaps this is most notable because i know you've written about this saying plans for new vehicles including more affordable models remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025 what should we take away from that when i know a lot of folks have looking for a sub $330,000 vehicle we're even expecting to get some details on that the robo taxi event which maybe was unrealistic the win pin to the story from a growth is a sub 30k vehicle and i believe that that hits by middle of 2025 that's the growth i mean that's ultimately you're talking about like single digit growth this year that's how you get to 10 12 15% type growth margins under control that's what the bulls want to see and i think the fact that they actually double down and i expect clearly on the conference call they'll focus not just on margins but more details around that vehicle look robotx today we could argue you know many would say that they're disappointed i believe ultimately that chose the vision the autonomous nei vision street need to ultimately see stop talking to talk walk to walk show the margins they did it and musk really has i think stepped up in that capacity and what's been a year of softness for ev demand and obviously more adoption of of hybrid vehicles for example are we going to look at q3 as an inflection point for that changing especially when you look at results like this today or is this a tesla specific story as they do deploy more manufacturing techniques more software more more ai both internally and externally i think it's a combination i mean you had a you you look at gm's quarter i mean that was a wano like quarter for gm and then you look at what we've seen in terms of tesla i believe this is the reflection point this right now is the start to me of what we're actually starting to see from a gross margin perspective the renaissance of growth come back they've essentially been in between two growth waves next year you have a sub 30k vehicle then the autonomous and ai vision plays out and that's in our opinion that's how you get to trillion trillion and a half mark cap now guys there was a lot said there by dan eyes i'm going to summarize some of it for you and tell you what my opinion is and my thoughts on what he said and why it's actually so important so the first thing that dan ives was saying is tesla's gross margin is in focus okay so the interesting thing is that tesla actually didn't um beat earnings they actually missed earnings but their gross margin went up guys this is something that when i was an analyst on wall street i was looking at very closely uh specifically software companies since they have recurring revenues and their revenues are pretty predictable but their margin is not so predictable right although there it's high a 1% change in margin can literally be like a billion or billions of dollars of market cap difference for example just so you know amazon has like um 3.4 or 3.5% let me actually pull it up here on yahoo finance it has very slim margins and that's because obviously amazon is running a bunch of products they have a lot of marketing cost they have people that are selling the products so they're kind of like an intermediary it's almost at $2 trillion here you can see amazon is it's also really good stock so let me go to statistics tab if you're wondering how to do fundamental analysis and understand it um i do cover this in my discord community i am looking more deeper under the hood of stocks so but i'll show you some of the stuff that i look at we won't talk about price to sales right now i just wanted to talk about margin yep uh actually their profit margin went up a lot last time i saw this was 3.5 um which makes sense why amazon stock is up a lot because a doubling in margin from 3.5 to 7% means essentially that if revenue stays the same they are doubling their earnings doubling okay that might sound crazy let me put it into perspective it's like literally you run a business that makes a million dollar revenue per year but you only take home $100,000 right all of a sudden let's say you cut cost let's say that you run a restaurant or something like that all of a sudden let's just say that you have an instagram page and that instagram page gets you a lot of customers you're able to increase your prices you're able to not spend money on marketing anymore you still make a million dollars let's say in a year but now you've taken home $200,000 in net profit and earnings really big deal right i mean doubling your earnings is no no joke right and that can be possible from the profit margin so tesla is obviously not going to double in market cap it's already pretty big but having like a slight increase in in uh in earnings so look here's tesla's adjusted eida margin um it was you know 18.7 and that was in q2 2023 then the stock you know went down a bit 16.1 15.7 15.9 14.4 and there were some you know i wouldn't say troubling signs but you know people like ah well tesla is going to grow its revenue sure that's pretty obvious but it looks like the margins are also falling that's just what happens guys with with companies at scale their margins go down so look i think going from q2 to q3 from 14. 4% to 18.5 like that is a that's a 4% pop right 4% pop though divided by 14.4 is like 30% so i'm actually surprised tesla did not go up more i'm actually surprised that tesla isn't up like 100% or like well i i get why it's not right the market cap is already big but this past week move of 21% like i had a really strong feeling that that would happen that's why i sold you see here i sold the 200 puts i had some positions expired before on tesla i sold the 210p puts in my challenge i just sent that message to like literally everyone i've had over 50 people join and i just copy paste copy paste like manually hey do the 210 do the 210 i told everyone cu i was like i'm super super bullish on this and i do one-on-one coaching now so um a lot of my a lot of my stuff is one-on-one now i'm sending a voice note or i'm sending like a a message or i'm responding to question right like my students will be like hey i have paler covered call do i roll it do i close it and i'll give them the full explanation for you specifically i think you should close because x andx reason right because not everyone should close um just some people have a higher asset allocation to paler which is cool right i mean we made a lot of money but also when someone has like 60% of their portfolium palet here i'm like look for you specifically maybe we should cut the position a little bit and here's here's my reasoning for it so it just depends and that's why i like one-on-one coaching now i can have students but i can give them more attention which i personally like and um i personally enjoy that now all right to wrap up the gross margin real quick to finish my thought gross margins are increasing which is a really positive sign for tesla you would be a fool not to realize that you'd be a fool not to be invested in tesla to some degree it makes up a huge portion of the s&amp;p 500 so i think you're kind of missing out on a really good stock i'm trying to be respectful here but you get what i'm trying to say right like i think you're you're nuts if you're not in tesla to some extent right you don't have to be heavy in tesla but to some extent all right so next thing is i think tesla's plan to introduce a sub $30,000 electric vehicle by mid 2025 is crucial for achieving higher growth rates all right so you take a look at where the trajectory is going for tesla and how they can increase their stock price they need more revenue right it's pretty obvious guys and that's how wall street runs um i want to say unfortunately or fortunately but that's just how life in business is like you just have to deliver the goods like you have to like i've over the past years and by the way thank you guys so much for the 300,000 subscribers i love you guys thank you so much i've hit all all the dreams i've had of coaching others and on option trading and i'm just so thankful but look i think when it comes to wall street right when i was studying and college and having the finance classes and they kept putting an emphasis and my professors kept putting an emphasis my mentors everyone they put an emphasis on how wall street is an like a voting game kind of like politics people are voting with their cash with their dollars what do they think a stock is worth right and if a stock and the market is really short term it's very very short term warren buffett said this as well people only care about this quarter because a lot of hedge fund managers traders they get paid salary like now like they need results now they're not thinking about long-term investing guys look in your situation right the students i work with that are looking to retire it's also hilarious you guys have time but all of you are also focus on the short term oh my portfolio had a big swing today my portfolio had a big swing last week yes how about we focus on getting to a million dollar in 5 years how about we take your portfolio from 100k to to 700k right something like that um but most people are very very short-term focused and the same thing with wall street so i would say that tesla having cars that is sub $30,000 freaking genius because at the end of the day what wall street wants to see is tesla's gross revenue going up it's kind of contradictory right because i'm making this video about margin expansion right that's essentially what i'm what i'm teaching you guys today how important margin is but you can't turn a blind eye to to revenue you can't you you have to pay attention to revenue as well so i mean the market's not dumb they're looking for all all the reasons to be invested in a company and if you want the company to do well you need both margin expansion and you also basically need top line revenue by the way my view is really beautiful i'm here in eastern europe out in warsaw poland on the 35th floor here it's it's amazing to have freedom and to be able to travel and i love experiencing new cultures i know i've said that but i hope that you guys get the same chance to to travel and if you're ever in my city i'm i i've met a lot of students for coffee i was you know i'm happy to always do that i love my subscribers i love you guys and i'm very loyal to you guys i'm always going to be here coaching and teaching no matter no matter what so i don't want to leave anyone behind even if you have a small portfolio i know i've been talking about nowadays that i work with doctors dentists engineers those just happen to be my best students and that is my preferred person to work with but by no means do i turn anyone away right right i'm i'm i love working with everyone i love working with everyone i love doing one-on-one coaching with any everyone because i get to learn a new perspective from you guys you guys bring so much unique experiences well when i do my one-on-one coaching i see a lot of successful people and it's really easy to just get more successful or to teach them options because they're already good at something so it's just easy to teach them a new skill so just yeah i love it now um i think when it comes to future growth with with tesla right having those 30,000 30,000 or sub $30,000 vehicle i think that's going to reach mass market appeal right so it's going to make it really easy for people to um be invested in the company from a investor point of view but i think it's also going to be easy for people to buy the vehicle obviously it's cheaper so even if someone doesn't necessarily want the vehicle and they take a look and it's cheaper than like a toyota corolla which is by the way my first car i've had two toyota corollas that's my first two cars i love toyota my dad has a toyota just really really reliable and i think that's also really important about tesla like they just need a cheap car they need a reliable car to reach the master like i've been all over the world like when i was in bisi georgia a lot of people had every every car every single car in the road is the uh toyota the electric toyota i'm blanking on the name for some reason why am i blanking on it the prius right everyone has a prius actually in poland there's a lot of priuses as well and i think if you could switch every prius for a uh for a tesla and they start dominating and taking more market share oh man oh man like this this company is's going to dominate not to mention obviously they have a long-term vision for ai and autonomous vehicles here looking at my notes so while the robo taxi project that they have is seen as a long-term play tesla's ai and autonomous plans are key to the company's vision and growth trajectory appealing to a lot of bullish investors so talked about ai guys back in college i had a degree in data analytics finance i studied data analytics because i i saw the writing on the wall like it was really easy to tell that companies now are experiencing lots of data and data is like the new oil i i have a video on that here's a picture of of me making a video in 2020 in 2020 i made a video here you can see it right here now was in this video all right so if you clicked in and want to know just the answer yes data is the new oil it's it's too old for you to watch i mean if you want to so look oil and data are now the same thing not really but data gives people and companies decision-making power because it tells them what what their customers want it tells them how to cut cost it tells them how to be more efficient and just a in general right is obviously a huge trend and i think it's going to dominate our lives i think some crazy things are going to happen i literally think in like 10 to 20 30 years i think i think some men are going to have like an ai girlfriend i saw that on a movie right i think the movie is called her or like if you watch black mirror or something like that i think some people will literally have their girlfriends be like ai robots i think ai is going to dominate in many many ways so from from personal relationship ships to healthare to building things to even like just going to mcdonald's i think it's going to be ai taking the order i mean we already see that we already see that happening there's a bug here on the top floor is kind of weird um and it's like winter it's cold now um so i think when it comes to the long-term vision tesla i think we're going to do good i think we're going to do very good also i want to talk about positive cash flow and the resilience of their business so tesla's q3 a free cash flow free cash flow okay that's a very important number it exceeded expectations at $ 2.74 billion so look at the end of the day i think free cash is like one of the most important who cares what you make revenue um like i i actually have a mentor of mine who um i learned from to become a better coach and he's done $70 million and and being a coach right i was like that's crazy like obviously i'm the number one option coach but i still want to improve i want to get better um i see a lot of people like kind of ripping ripping off my content now now days which kind of upsets me like even like my old students like i'm not affiliated with anyone guys i'm i'm just myself but i see a lot of people like taking my content and like ripping it off which is really upsetting to me but nonetheless like i was talking to my mentor and he was saying that basically he makes $70 million and this and that but then i even realized like even about my mentor that i asked him like what is your like profit margin and i don't even know if he was being super truthful with me i you you never know right you never know like even when you ask entrepreneurs like they also have egos right just people in general have egos and i i take a lot of things with the grain of salt right i've gotten a lot of help by no means am i being ungrateful to my mentor right and i've mentored all the other option youtubers for the most part like a lot of them copy me now which i don't i don't really appreciate it like i've been covering the wheel strategy now you see a lot of wheel strategy videos with the same exact title as me thumbnails and stuff but i asked my i asked my mentor so what's your profit margin look like i don't know if he answered me truthfully he told me like 30% is his profit margin but but when i thought about it i i think it's a lot lower so when you look at a company like the free cash flow of a company is so so important there's a reason why like like a lot of people just flex in the coaching space they'll flex the revenue and guys all the option youtubers like they make six figures a month off of coaching which is crazy it's it's a lot of money it's a lot of money and i just want everyone to be truthful and that's why i'm telling you this information i want to be truthful about it that there's a lot of money to be made as a coach but i take my coaching job very very seriously i did not do it for the money did it because i really genuinely wanted to help people do what i do right which was i became a millionaire through option trading and i wanted to show people how i made my first million right obviously i make a lot as a coach but i wanted to show people even if you have a smaller portfolio and you grow it you can grow your portfolio to a million dollars without even having to add money obviously if you add money to your portfolio it's going to it's going to go up faster i didn't really have that luxury guys you see even when i started my youtube channel back in uh 2020 i wasn't really working a lucrative job okay i said i worked at goldman sachs i've given you guys that proof i've showed my badge i actually showed my pay stuff my pay was actually $770,000 a year so i really wasn't able to put away a lot of money i really couldn't fuel my portfolio and i really didn't have any courses or discord or coaching to sell my first year of youtube i didn't really make any money and i've organically taken my portfolio from 100k to 700k and i didn't have a job right i had to i left my job i hated working i hated working in corporate i hated it i i'm not a morning person like right now i joke with my friend i'm sorry if i'm making this video long i'm giving you everything i know about tesla and investing and bit by myself right now it's like 6:00 in the morning in the east coast but it's funny cuz i woke up at like noon but that's a six- hour difference right i'm making this video first thing in the morning i hope that i look okay but um i'm not a morning person so it was very challenging for me to get up and go to work not to mention like i had to wear a suit and tie at work like that so comfortable and like i'm sweating like i kind of sweat easily i get hot easily um and i was like i'm sweating at work and it was just really not fun so you know i think that it's really important to just understand that if you're going to be investing or growing your option portfol you got to have high quality companies and free cash flow is important like i'm just telling you like what i'm thinking in my head right what goes through my head and i think about my mentor who told me about how much revenue he makes but i don't know how much like pre cash flow he has i think about some of my friends that are traveling the world as as well um you know they're in like bali and places like that and a lot of them run e-commerce stores and you know they they it's funny they always flex like i made 100k in a month they'll say or like 200k but it's revenue when you look at their bottom line it's like 10% oh okay amazon has 20% margin give or take but some of them make like 10% at scale right because they're like reaching like wider colder audience with their ads and then you know their their ad cost is very very high for selling their products right they don't ever tell you the products cuz that's a secret my friends they don't tell me i mean they tell me but i don't really care anyways cuz i'm not an e-commerce guy but when you look at free cash flow it's really really important um so pay really close attention to that with tesla it is crucial it is really really crucial then the other other thing i want to talk about is industry inflection point for ev demand so just in general analysts view this quarter as an inflection point for tesla in the ev industry with potential growth ahead due to advances in manufacturing software and ai so they're becoming more efficient at selling vehicles and looking at the competition which is really important i mean there is a lot of competition to tesla so i actually do think that some of their competitive advantage has has gone away which is difficult right because they had better vehicles but guys there is there's there's better vehicles on the market now that are electric vehicles we have a lot of we have a lot of competitors right so i think that um you know what and i know you guys already know this but tesla's a bet on elon musk in many ways because elon musk has more follow followers on twitter than tesla so we're all betting here kind of on personal branding which i'm pretty good at and i know a lot about personal branding i've helped other youtubers i' i've worked for other brands i've studied a lot of branding i've read a lot of books on it i i don't have a degree in it i thought marketing was a stupid degree actually i thought it's not i thought marketing was just for like for like the cute women but it's not i think marketing is a really respectable degree but back in college i was like a marketing that's just for the cute girls but no marketing is like is is really is really really valuable i never studied it formally but i've studied a lot of it and un formally right through books and teaching myself i love it i love it i love it because i think that branding and marketing is number one and key to a business um so tesla like the marketing the branding of it super super important so guys i guess i guess part of the reason that you may click my videos is like you want me to make like a prediction i don't know what's going to happen in the future just just straight up but if i had to predict what tesla is going to do i would say in the next 12 months it might hit 300 just like i hit 300,000 followers here on this youtube channel subscribers you guys which h i love that love you guys i'm just so pumped up to keep making awesome content to teach you you know look i don't even care if people join my program that's not why i do this i do this because i truly have nothing else to do and this is if i had if if this was free or or even if i had a different opportunity in life i would still do this i can't imagine myself doing anything else um i just love coaching options cuz for me it was the biggest game changer like i don't know i just been doing it since i was 19 so what else can i do like i'm i'm a one stck guy um and then i love the coaching aspect of it as well i love seeing students succeed and i love seeing coaching outcomes something that i didn't share on this channel is actually that by the time i was starting my youtube channel i was actually doing math tutoring on the side um for children i was teaching the math and i loved it i loved it because i love seeing people kind of it's kind of funny but i love seeing people like struggle and then they're like i don't know what to do or how do i do this and then i i like shift their mindset i'm like you can do it this way and this is how you can become successful or like in tutoring i'm like this is how that math problem works right i i taught math um this is how like this is how time works or this is how algebra works and then you can kind of see how people like oh wow it works like that and then like they started figuring out and it's like really a rewarding feeling i guess i'm just like naturally been a coach before i was even a coach i was doing m tutoring and i loved it right so i love seeing that like student outcome or i love seeing that change and i think life's about change like how can you change a lot of you guys are really comfortable and i see a lot of people actually that will schedule a consultation with my team and they'll say well i watch henry's videos and i've already made tons of money and i have a friend who's in in the discord and he made you know $110,000 and he just you know he tells me the strategies and i'm already fine right that's cool that's cool i understand if you're already fine or you're already getting good results but you can always do better in life like you should always strive higher so even if you don't have like a pain point of h whatever i'm not going to take this stuff too seriously i'm making good money i don't want to get i don't want to improve don't ever stay stagnant guys always try to improve like i think that's such a a very noble trait for people that they're like not satisfied from one perspective it's not healthy right because even myself let me close on my computer here even myself i'm like not satisfied in life i want more and more right i want more gains at the gym i want right now i'm still single i would like a very beautiful partner i want to make more option income and i think that can be unhealthy cuz you're kind of on that hamster wheel you're kind of like chasing which i don't like i prefer in life to attract i prefer um to just do the right thing have my plan with god tell god hey i want to have this and this happen and then just do the do the actions and then i know that you know i'm going to get blessed and good things will come my way maybe it's not going to be perfectly the way i want want it to be right cuz god always has his own plan he you could we can wish for whatever you want right when i was with my ex i was like i want to marry her and i want this to be my partner but god had a different plan and things didn't work out so i think having that like drive to achieve more is very was very good right because i think making money is a blessing it's like written in all it's written in the bible right it's a blessing like you should be making money and then when i make money with people like i'm doing god's work like i i truly feel that way right cuz i'm changing lives and and making money is a blessing so i think that staying hungry is really good so yeah i guess loc at margins stay hungry be subscribed and uh that's really it i hope you guys have a fantastic i'm just i'm kind of happy today because we hit 300,000 subscribers so i'm happy

2024-10-28,OQhahDREU0g,"kind: captions language: en i made this master class to show you how to outsmart the market using a few psychological techniques investor performance is 20% finance and 80% psychology so i'll be covering powerful strategies and tactics used by the cia and goldman sachs in this video i respect your time so let's jump right into it the illusion of knowledge that is the first thing that we need to talk about you don't know what you don't know okay if you want your performance to be a lot higher you need to start being aware of everything in the stock market what's driving the stock market which driving your positions and stocks and options and in this topic i want to introduce you the concept that many traders they believe they understand options but in reality they are missing some critical insights like avoiding assignment with strategic rollouts instead of letting your options get assigned roll your positions before expiration by buying back the current option and selling a new one further out in time this helps you keep control of the trade and avoid stock ownership or force selling so many people don't realize that you can fix an option by simply rolling that option i'll be showing you an example later on in this video but that is the first thing that a lot of people are not aware of now the second thing and this is really crucial use delta as a risk gauge monitor the delta of your option to assess the probability of it being in the money keeping delta low around 30 or even 20 or even a little bit less when selling puts or covered calls can help you reduce the likelihood of assignment while maximizing income next is exploiting x dividend dates in covered calls okay these are all the things that i'm talking about which most people are not aware of but you can exploit an x dividend date in a covered call here's how be cautious when selling covered calls near an x dividend date as your stock could be called away early if the call is in the money causing you both the dividend and potential future gain so that is really something that i do pay attention to i personally don't trade a lot of dividend paying stocks but if you do if you're running my double dividend strategy which i have a video on this channel then you want to be aware of when the x dividend date is because that is an attractive time for investors to actually want to exercise when i do my one-on-one coaching and my students ask me hey should i be afraid of you know basically potential assignment i always pretty much say no early assignment almost never happens the reason why it doesn't happen is if you take a look at an option a lot of its value is based on time and when you exercise an option you lose that time value so most investors don't do that because they lose a whole lot of money by exercising options early next is tracking implied volatility rank okay this is really interesting because i've talked about implied volatility on this channel i'm always bringing you guys new content so make sure that you are subscribed i want to talk about implied volatility rank or ivr for better entries if you want to actually get into a stock and get paid properly by selling options you do want to pay attention to implied volatility rank and look use implied volatility rank of a stock to basically time your entries now i'm not a fan of timing the market but if you want a better time or you want to try to time the market looking at implied volatility rank is really important and it actually makes a lot of sense so think about it this way so let's say that a stock is typically you know on average it's going to be 50 ivr right because that's like average right 50 means that it's it's average now if you look at the ivr and it says 80 right 80% that means that this stock is towards the high end of its implied volatility this is a little bit unusual okay something unusual is typically a good thing to pay attention to because if it's unusually high that also means that the premium is also unusually high so that's a good opportunity for you to sell an option so for me i don't like to time the market but you know i'm just selling options all the time i'm always selling i'm always selling my monday and wednesday coaching calls i'm just selling puts i'm selling covered calls i'm using nvidia i'm using paler i'm using apple i'm using any highquality company just to sell options and collect that income you probably watched a lot of my videos already you know when i'm selling options my goal is to enter in a stock at a better price or if i already have a stock to create income on the stock that i already have right so when i'm looking at entry ivr when it's higher means that premium's higher and i'm going to get paid more when i'm selling options so it's a good way to kind of time the market if you will although i think timing the market can be the most difficult thing ever i think that there is some opportunities to get better entry and better entry is what it's all about putting the odds in your favor making probability work for you and and having a better entry will make a very big difference in your overall trading performance it's important to be aware of your psychological blind spots or gaps in knowledge because that's where most risk lies in your wealth building journey what you don't know is what you don't know and there's a lot of risks there so i'm trying to fill in your entire gap and that was the first lesson now i want to go over our second lesson our second psychological bias okay i study a lot of psychology because the market is a tremendous amount psychology so it's really important no matter how boring you think psychology is it is extreme ex important to your profitability so our second lesson in this course is going to be overconfidence bias all right our first lesson was you don't know what you don't know and i mention you a lot of things that you may not know now our second lesson or chapter here in this course is going to be overconfidence bias which is really interesting and i'll i'll explain to you what this looks like so first of all i'll give you a shocking example of overconfidence bias and that's that when they have surveyed drivers okay 80% of drivers believe they are better than the average driver hm doesn't really make sense 80% of drivers believe they're above average but by definition average means that it's 50% so that means you'd be better than half and then you'd be worse than half but 80% of drivers said that they're better so that explains to you that overconfidence is most people think that they're much better than they actually are and i don't mean to hit any egos here but we all have an ego but you're probably not as good as you think you are because we all have blind spots and we all have room to improve right that's what i always think i've been doing this for a decade now and i have one portfolio that i've grown to 3.5 million i have a second portfolio that's also around that same value that i've both grown over a long period of time and i'm still luckily i don't know why this is but i've just been really humbled i did a lot of martial arts or maybe whatever i don't get overconfident in my portfolio i am just as good as my last trade that's what i always tell myself okay same thing with amazon ceo right jeff bezos basically said he expects amazon to one day go bankrupt he expects there to be competitors he expects that amazon may come into issues down the road and they must function as day one day one of the company okay guys i want you to have the same mindset all right because this course my chapters will teach you things that will help you trade and it's most important for you to have a good mindset that's like basically having good hygiene or good health right you can't it doesn't matter if you're the smartest person in the world if you don't take care of your health it's useless all right same thing with psychology if you don't take care of if you don't take care of your psychology you are going to get yourself in a big pit when it comes to investing because i've seen it over and over again i've seen students that are like i'm doing great i have uh you know i just talked to a guy yesterday i i made $11,000 the past two months on my $150,000 portfolio fantastic i asked him how long have you been trading for he said uh two months that's my first two months i said beautiful that's amazing how how did you do that he's like i've just watching your videos fantastic but i obviously it's been 2 months the guy is having good performance but he definitely has a lot of blind spots right he definitely has overconfidence bias said we should coach together he said no i'm going to keep doing it myself no problem we're going to see what happens there but i just want to say that the more you know and the more you're aware of potential mistakes that you can make and not getting overly cogy the better right i'm not saying something bad is going to happen i don't know right but i do see that overconfidence bias affects people very negatively they have many good months and then boom they have one bad month and it's not that hard to blow up an account also doesn't look as bad but it's actually bad i see people that have a 45% return in 6 months and they're very confident like oh i'm going to do fantastic they have one month that's losing which is 8% which isn't even that big of a loss right negative 8% the next month they have uh -2% right and then the next month is let's say 0% and they're they they start getting revenge trading okay i have a student that i actually will put on on this channel that i talk to in my wheel course which is coming out very soon make sure you're subscribe for that i have i have the best courses coming out for free youtube it's freaking insane i'm just putting everything i have here because i'm super motivated to help you guys learn i love what i do and uh i just want to be the number one coach here and give you better free information than people charge for all right because i see a lot of option youtubers and a lot of them have learned from me first of all um a majority of them and the second thing is i want to make my free content better than people's paid content that's something that i've learned from one of my mentors so giving you everything for free just to help you scale up make money and then maybe you'll want to do some coaching with me which is always the first link in my description but if i if i make you money for free it's completely up to you right i just love what i do so look what what i was trying to get out there is that if you have a 45% return and then it's negative 8 then it's ne6 and then it's -2 your overall onee return can actually be 20% that's crazy you can start off with a 45% return in the first half and because your second half is bad you end up with a 20% return it is not a sprint guys it is not a sprint this this game of investing is a long term game that's why i don't get emotional when it comes to investing it's because i've been doing it for 10 years i see the market fall i'm like yeah oh well i see the market going up i'm like uh oh well all right there's a story of um you know based on psychology and i think this is really important i'm going to give you a little bit of the story here all right so here here's the story again i'm making this video a little bit longer because i want you to understand psychology on a very deep level so if you have the attention span for this by the way congratulations because you're going to be a better trader people that don't have an attention span they're bad at trading so congratulations for being in this part of the video so look here's the chinese story all right so once upon a time there was a chinese farmer whose horse ran away and that evening all his neighbors came around to basically say we're so sorry to hear that your horse ran away this is the most unfortunate the farmer said maybe the next day the horse came back bringing in seven wild horses with it right and in the evening everybody was like your horse came back and it brought seven other horses man congratulations now you have eight horses the farmer said again maybe the following day his son tried to break one of the horses and w while riding it he was thrown and broke his leg okay and the neighbors are like oh that's such bad news that's so unfortunate and the neighbors said maybe the next day the uh officers came around to script people for the army to go to war all right and his son had a broken leg so um again all the neighbors were around saying wow you got so lucky holy moly your son doesn't get to go to the army to fight and potentially die right and you guys can guess the story is almost over uh the guy says maybe right so the whole process of nature is an integrated process process of immense complexity and it's really impossible to tell whether any anything that happens in it is good or bad because you never know what will be the next consequence or the misfortune all right you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune either so that is a i guess this is a quote from alan watts right so that story kind of paints you the picture that it's maybe every trade is a maybe don't ever get hard on yourself if a trade doesn't go your way it's okay make sure that you're playing the long game it is the long game right the guy broke his leg they said oh you know that's such bad news well he said well maybe and the next day they came to draft the army and it was good news right so bad news can be good news good news can be bad news all right this is this is this also goes back to chapter one what i said which is um you don't know what you don't know so good news doesn't mean it's good and bad news doesn't mean it's bad all right it's all how we think about things all right and when it comes to trading that is really really important that story will paint you the picture that you want to keep that long-term mindset okay and then the second chapter here that we're still in is the overconfidence bias so let's continue and wrap up with the overconfidence bias so similarly in trading most people think that they can consistently outperform the market but studies show that over 90% so i said over 80% of drivers think they're good traders are even bad than drivers traders are even more cocky than the drivers okay so 90% of traders of active traders underperform the s&amp;p 500 yet 90% of people think that they can beat the market guys 90% are you kidding me 90% of active traders can't win it's good that a teach options selling and collecting income with the wheel strategy mainly on this channel because most people win with the wheel strategy in fact in my community we have over 80% of people that join end up winning or being successful in some way whether it's 1,000 3,000 or $5,000 a month whatever their goals are they are profitable about 80% of the time from the data that i have researched so i teach option selling and collecting income with the wheel strategy because even if you are overconfident the wheel strategy is so safe that it's actually hard to lose money as you guys will see in the wheel strategy course that i make um i'm still editing it you will see how you can be overconfident and still not lose money in the wheel which is fantastic i i like to put people in winning pos positions and that's overall a win so overconfidence can be extremely dangerous especially if you're making money and then you start buying options okay i've seen that happen i've also seen people just increase their deltas and increase their deltas and chase higher and higher premium then all of a sudden you see them selling at the money puts on gamestop or at the money puts on rivan or at the money you know puts on high really really risky stock so i see that happen all the time so make sure that you're aware guys if you're aware right and i'm i'm a man of of faith you know for me it's important to understand who i am what i'm doing for other people it's important for me to have a good connection with god that is very important for me and whether you're religious or not i want you to understand that being more in tune with yourself and understanding yourself actually makes you better in all areas of your life it makes you better at relationships it makes you better with other human beings it makes you a better person overall but it also increases your results okay i'm a firm believer right i wasn't always like the most like religious guy but as time goes on i'm like building a relationship with god i'm building a relationship because i' i've achieved everything i i could possibly hope for and now giving it back to you and i'm thinking how did i do this well maybe some of it is luck maybe some of is hard work but i really think that i' i've actually been doing the right thing in life which is why i've gotten success so i want you to have that same mindset which is you know always be humble be humble it doesn't matter how much money you have i have ton of money i have more money than i show on this channel i have enough money to do a lot of things with right but i'm not getting overly cocky i'm still showing up here on this youtube channel even though i don't need money i'm still showing up yes i have a business i'm a coach i have a big team that i that i i want them to do really good good they have families to feed so i do charge for my coaching and i have an exclusive luxury coaching i work one-on-one with folks but it doesn't stop me from understanding who i am being humble and not getting overconfident that's very important on a personal level personto person level on a trading level on a driving level don't get cocky on the streets guys getting cocky while you're driving not a good idea i i do have a sports car right now that i'm renting in poland i'm living in poland i'm living in eastern europe i don't get cocky because other people could be bad drivers i can get into an accident even though i know what how to drive someone else might not so you always need to keep your eyes on the road don't get cocky in any area of your life okay luckily i don't get cocky in any area so it's really important and also a study published in the journal of finance found that overconfident traders are 60% more likely to trade options excessively believing that they can predict short-term market mo momentum or movement all right that is that's also something right so again there is a lot of proof out there that people's egos get to the better of them and i've se that across the board i would say yeah like 90% of traders fail 90% of people have have a bigger ego so it's fine egos can be healthy but you need to understand when you're revenge trading you need to understand when you're excessively trading you need to understand even in good times you have to prepare for the tougher times that can potentially come right we're going into an election year right maybe as you're watching this video the election already happened maybe we're in 2025 right but still there's always catalyst and events in the market where being overconfident will hurt you even when the market is is really bullish you can always have a bearish move even when earnings are good on a stock right see that all the time you see earnings that are good the stock can still go down so it is always humbling actually when i predict a stock to have good earnings and has good earnings and it still goes down i say it's a good thing you had proper risk management it's it's good that you had proper asset allocation i remind myself that i'm humble going into the trade because i have diversification i knew that the stock would beat earnings but the market didn't agree with me the market can still go down so i could be a genius and predict everything and i could will be wrong because this is a very humbling game also i just want to say that when you're excessively trading even if you're right um excessively trading in general is also a bad behavior because this behavior often leads to higher transaction costs and on average lower returns compared to more cautious traders who limit their volume of trades that's why in my community i'm just following literally 15 to 20 stocks and i just run the wheel sell puts covered calls i do some spreads as well for sure it's easier for me to focus on folks that have $50,000 $100,000 portfolios or more it's just easier to scale so i do prefer working with folks that have at least you know $25,000 to trade would be kind of like the bare minimum so if that is you by the way if you're a busy professional that has $50,000 and you want to scale up your income and get to five figures or you have six figures you want to get to seven figures again i do coach um one-on-one on that so look i just want to wrap up this topic before we go into the next chapter i want you to be aware that even if you're trading for many years there are still events indicators setups and trends you may not be familiar with and it's important to always be learning and improving speaking of improving before we get into the second or the third psychological trading secret in this chapter i want you to level up your premium that you collect in scale all right the next psychological chapter that i want to discuss is the false safety of limited risk options okay many traders are drawn to strategies like buying calls or puts because they appear to offer limited risk this is actually a big fake myth in the industry of option trading okay there's a lot of people offering option trading advice nowadays more people are jumping into it okay to be teachers and provide the information but literally all of them i wouldn't trust for the most part okay because a lot of them didn't really work in the industry it's really important to understand where you get your information from if you get your information even from a millionaire on the internet but they don't have the actual experience of working on wall street of actually having a degree in it i'm not a big fan of formal education but when it comes to trading and investing i am a in favor of formal education you don't have to go to college to get rich nowadays but i did go to college for finance and i'll tell you what i work with a lot of engineers and it's very similar there is a difference between self-taught engineers and actual computer science graduates there is a difference they will make you the industry there's a lot of there's a lot of um psychological tactics that industry and and in politics and and anything where money is involved there's a lot of psychology going on there right you will see that when it comes to for example getting a a job in software engineering which is a large amount of my students right doctors lawyers professionals engineers are huge like 90% of my audience for who i work with because they have the the they have the money the high income which obviously helps with option trading you can do it option trading if you're not one of those professions but that's the majority so look if you're self-taught cool you can be really good but the computer science major understands algorithms data structures they understand a lot more deeper level of programming where as someone who is self-taught may have missed some of those fundamental components and when you do look at the best people in it in innovation in entrepreneurship right when you look at sam ultman of chat gpt when you look at you know microsoft bill gates yes bill gates didn't you know he didn't he dropped out of college mark zuckerberg right but they did go and they did take their fundamentals of architecture and data structures etc etc formal education they do have some form okay whereas with your selftaught you're not going to be as good as someone who has a deeper understanding so i just wanted to point that out from both of a provider of teaching you guys perspective but also from your own perspective of trading okay both you i'm giving you lessons on multiple different levels right now okay if you want to actually be good at trading study this stuff okay understand how it actually works because a lot of the marketing in the industry right of of option trading will tell you that hey you know there is limited risk when buying options that is true but it's kind of a lie as well because the limited risk is false limited risk i'll explain that to you in a second i also want to point out that by this psychological course i hope that you're understanding in the first two chapters selling options which is my agenda what i'm teaching is also not always best there's also a lot of people that say oh just sell options you're going to make income right i have a million dollars here's my strategy for selling options right whatever that can also be false because you can also get into trouble selling options although it's it's much harder because selling options in journal is very profitable so let me let me explain to you both sides okay why it could be a psychological myth that it's limited risk to buy options and why selling options can also be either risky or lower return okay so let me go over the first one let me talk about the framing this framing is often emphasized in media by brokers or youtubers usually they don't have as big of an audience they more niche right so they're teaching something more niche to build a following on that specific mindset or structure right so they portray options as being safe right and they say oh it's it's safe you can buy options put up a limited amount of money not really because when you put up a limited amount of money and you lose 100% of that money sure you're you're limited which sounds good but 100% loss doesn't make any sense the same thing with option selling if you're not doing it properly and you don't have a good entry and you're doing the wrong stocks and you're just doing hype stocks you're also going to get messed up because it doesn't matter what strategy you're using if you're selling options on bad or the wrong stock and before i give you this example i just want to point out one more thing what gets less attention is that in reality most options expire worthless leading to frequent small losses okay that's what i said most options even when they have a high delta which means that it's likely to be okay and it's likely to be in the money if you're buying an option still many options expire worthless okay that's why i do prefer being on the selling side in general than the buying side so now i do refer to buying options as gambling or buying lottery tickets in some of my videos especially when i cover more risky strategies i have a video that talked about butterflies and i have a video that talks about iron strangles like interesting stuff right definitely interesting where you can turn a little bit of money into a lot of money however i prefer to focus on people that want consistent income and i do refer to those strategies as high income and high potential but also straight up i look at them as really in that gamblers category all right although gambling by the way can be profitable it's typically like a poker table okay where there's one huge winner typically there's nine players right i watch the world series of poker and that's actually one of my goals is to go to las vegas and play around november play the poker there's a lot of famous celebrities but look there's one huge winner there's one guy that breaks even and there's seven losers so it's really a winner takes all type of game all right when it comes to poker in many ways i mean you could have a game where it's a little bit more evenly dispersed but there's something called the genie index genie index is the the disparity between rich and poor in countries and that applies for a lot of things in life right so in poker there's one winner there's one huge there's many huge losers all over the world in china in india pakistan and russia and turkey uh south america in america it doesn't matter all the countries there's genie index people don't get paid the same the rich get richer and i took a class on wealth and power back in college the rich get richer okay the poor get poorer and disparity grows and that's why the middle class is is is in danger the middle class is in danger because inflation is going up middle class continues to make money and they're not keeping up with inflation so technically the middle class is kind of shrinking and kind of going into that bottom poor poorer lower lower middle income or lower income class whereas the rich class which i'm i'm new rich right i didn't grow up with money but i would say i'm i'm high i'm i am high worth it is much easier to make money cuz once you have money one of the strongest factors in making more money the ways to get rich is labor capital right now ai is a big way to get rich ai for sure is the number one way to get rich right now uh i'm blanking on the fourth way but um once you have money using capital to get more money is extremely easy so the rich continue to grow their wealth very quickly it's extremely easy and then the middle class continue to struggle so you have to try to get it more capital and really scale to be in the in the richer class cuz if you're in the middle it's not looking good for you it's not looking good for you i can't tell you how many engineers i talk to that are making 200k 2 20k but they're they hate their job first of all and second of all they're afraid that ai will replace their job because even if you work at meta even if you work at adobe wherever you work even if it's a good company you still have a chance of getting fired right unless you own a business or you're an entrepreneur which is also risky in different ways you're not safe even if you're a subject matter expert at a company that company can say hey we're cutting costs sorry um we're going to have to you know you're you're done you're out of here right so that could happen at any day so it's really important to get to that scale or to get to that six figure mark in your portfolio so then you can get that six fig portfolio into multiple six figures and that multiple six figures to seven and then it's really easy once you have seven figures you're good i mean you're retired just depends on how well you're retired right so look what gets less attention is the reality that options expire worthless leading to frequent losses i refer to buying options kind of as kind of gambling um i also want to point out that in the poker example the genie index which is what we're talking about and where i'm giving you stories is it's prevailing in all forms of life right whether it's the middle class and the rich class it's also very apparent in dating so if i by the way i mention dating because i have a huge interest in data guys i have a data analytics degree um finance economics data analytics degree and i look at tinder because tinder has vast amounts of data okay all the s&amp;p 500 companies in tinder is owned by match match.com or match group right i specifically look at tinder because first of all i do use it i i have used tinder i do date in eastern europe but the other thing is i like data guys data is how i make my decisions okay i make data driven decisions when it comes to psychology there's many easy ways to lie about data there's many there's a lot of misinformation online even from your option gurus that seem to have money and to seem to have a good brand there's a lot of misinformation out there okay so when it comes to misinformation i like to use data to decide okay okay and i have a data anal degree and i love using vast amounts of data guys one data point isn't enough one data point is not enough okay you need a lot of data so looking at tinder tinder has tens and hundreds of thousands of data points right and i looked at a studies i looked at a lot of studies on tinder some of them are public and some of them are taught by the ceo they you know the chief marketing officer etc on these calls they'll go out and say hey these are our data points this is what we're looking at right because as a company tinder is trying to decide how to keep people on the platform so more people are paying uh tinder and staying on the platform right when they looked at the data of men and women it it seems that men will swipe left and right so if you don't know how tinder works it's men and women both on the platform and they're both looking to uh if you swipe left that means you don't like someone if you swipe right that means you like someone if you swipe right and they swipe right you have a match and then from

2024-10-29,8n8oQVUjWzI,"kind: captions language: en nvidia is currently the biggest company by market cap in the entire world and they have earnings in about 3 weeks which is why i'm gearing up to trade options on nvidia and make a ton of money like i just did on tesla this is the perfect time to buy and to sell options this is a very unique opportunity so check out the cnbc clip on how i'm going to be playing earnings great to see you uh nvidia doesn't report until late kind of lsh november but of course so so many signals this week right um with capex from some of the meg s what do they need to show us to keep the nvidia party going look they just need to show us that demand is there and strong and ideally growing right i mean the the big concern with i mean there's a number of concerns when anything runs this much but i mean the biggest concern has just been sustainability like the numbers have gotten so big so quickly you just worry that it can't keep going and like as of right now from everything we can see it looks like it's still going like i i i get the nervousness it clearly is not time to worry this year i don't even think it's time to worry next year we we we'll see as we go farther out but i think at this point they just need to show that demand is is strong and growing and accelerating and at least from where we're standing right now everything we can see things look pretty good i think right as stacy i want to ask you about the story that sema was just talking about and that is the idea that um trump especially but perhaps both candidates would crack down on manufacturing of chips inside of the us but what we've seen from tsmc versus what we haven't seen from intel sort of talk about that and what it would mean if tsmc wasn't able to ramp up here in the united states i mean it's look i i'll be honest so i heard trump's comments as well and he was what did what did he say on on rogan he said he didn't like the chips act he wanted to replace it with ter i it makes look it's it's trump so he's gonna he's goingon to trump is going to trump but it doesn't make any sense right the idea that like taiwan has stolen quote unquote our our chip making abilities is ridiculous like that that is not true and like not allowing foreign companies to make chips on us so that that is actually what we want i mean look the the whole like the idea that we are dependent on taiwan and that is becoming increasingly an untenable situation is is very true and you know we want to get leading edge infrastructure built here in the us and to be honest from a policy standpoint it really shouldn't be mad all that much who who is building it i understand why intel is sort of named the national champion but if the goal is really to get as much leading edge capacity built here as quickly as possible we should be giving the money to the folks who who can build it and as of right now that that entity is is tsmc and you're right you know there were there was some news flow of last week that suggested that their yield ramp in arizona is actually exceeding targets and maybe even exceeding what they do in taiwan there are no other players neither in nor samsung that can make claims of anywhere near that so if the goal is to build the capacity and get it here and installed and running in the us to to you know to dest the supply chain that that's happening right now and so stopping that would be a problem sure have we have we given up on intel then well we we we'll see i they report on they report earnings on thursday i guess we'll see what they have to to say but i mean clearly you know in intel's core business is under pressure they're they're losing share and they can't rely on their own manufacturing right now they so they're actually outsourcing more which is impacting gross margins and everything like that so are their suggestion is that they believe their process rob over time is getting fixed they're going to bring that volume back into the us and it's going to make everything you know wonderful i guess we'll see you know they they they they had a a a day of a few months ago where they were sort of giving out some targets for where they thought things could go over time and it really was like a 2030 story right even if they are on track like it's it's a slog between now and and and when we would actually see things really start to improve and as of right now we don't actually know if they're truly improving or not so strap in for thursday i guess um uh it'll be entertaining uh if nothing else i'm sure yeah we're not going to get invidia for a little bit stacy but you know every so often you hear i'm sure you do it more than i do h well there's you know a small company over here that's developing a next generation chip that's going to ultimately disintermediate or or or push nvidia to the side i mean how long is their dominance do you think going to last well i i mean there's always somebody in the wings that this is an enormous market right the idea that there's not going to be others trying to take a piece of that pie is ridiculous of course they are now that being said like nvidia's built up their position in in silicon and hardware and software and systems and ecosystem over oh 10 or 20 years right and they they've put those moes into place and so anybody that is trying to get in there and and i'm not talking that people can't get little bits clearly you know a and b and others are getting you know little bits but to be like material in that market you've got to like like penetrate those moes and it's very very difficult thing to do and especially for a startup i when you just look at the the uh the amount of of of money that nvidia has to invest in these things versus you know smaller you know very small companies it it's it it's a it's tough it's very very tough so at this point i'm not terribly worried about some like young upart coming in and taking a massive amount of of nvidia i'm not even really that worried about larger companies larger competitors going in and trying to take a all right guys i want to show you my screen my nvidia position and how i'm going to be trading this stock so look check it out one of the first things so look one of the highlights here of the analyst rasgon what he was saying is that nvidia must demonstrate revenue growth for earnings and i think that he's looking at nvidia's demand sustainability so when looking at the company sustainability you want to understand if the company is growing for nvidia it's clearly and very very obvious that it is a yes so so i'm expecting earnings to be very strong and just looking at the high valuations i'm personally not concerned nvidia has had high valuations for a number of years yet their revenue growth is far exceeding what expectations are in the market the market is an expectations game guys so taking a look at nvidia they're likely to meet expectations now look the current stock price is right under $140 per share if you take a look year to date at nvidia this stock is a clear momentum winner absolutely clear okay now if i scroll down here on robin hood and i show you their earnings check it out their earnings continue to go up like basically in q1 of 2024 they barely beat earnings i know it's kind of hard to tell if i like scroll in there you can see they beat earnings by a bit they beat earnings by a bit in q2 in q3 and q4 all right they have beat earnings and by the way i think this is off just by one year because we're not in 2025 but uh robin hood is saying we are so i believe this is 2023 and and and um this is 2024 so look they beat earnings last period this is last period and the period before every single quarter that we get earnings nvidia beats and every time it it beats it gives more confidence to the market we have beat 1 2 3 four five six six of six of the past earnings okay so coming in on just under three weeks right now i am going to be trading options in a a very smart way to make a load of money just like i did on tesla i printed money on tesla literally printed okay now if i scroll up right now you'll see a couple of my nvidia positions i'm essentially selling puts but i think going into earnings you actually want to buy call options okay this is something that i don't typically recommend and i would say that obviously buying strategies can be a lot more risky so i'm going to show you a couple of different variations of how i would be buying call options i'll show you buying call options i'll show you the poorman's covered call which is buying leaps and then selling call options on it and then i'm also going to show you uh so the bull call spread so those three strategies so i'm going to show you three strategies in this video it's going to be it's going to be filled with knowledge in this video so i also want to just point out that um you know the analyst was covering competitive threats for nvidia's dominance so he was saying that despite smaller companies attempting to enter the semiconductor market he believes that nvidia's extensive ecosystem hardware advancements and financial resources provide significant competitive moes for the business which is extremely extremely important um i can't tell you how important it is to have a mo for a business that's actually the number one thing that warren buffett looks for is a mo so look one more thing before i show you some trades is earning season is a really exciting time but it's also a risky time so i want you to be aware that you can absolutely print money but it's also a potentially risky time because i mean there is a small chance that nvidia might not beat earnings right so you just want to be aware that you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket and asset allocation and having proper diversification is a thing that you do have to pay attention to even though i am making a lot of videos here on nvidia and palen here and i've printed money like my portfolio is going to hit 4 million not this year because um you know as we only have like two more months right we have november and december so it's possible but i'm probably not going to hit 4 mil this year but i'll hit it probably in january or february um you guys if you're subscribed you've seen the portfolio just rise and rise right so look let's talk about um buying call options specifically the strategy of when i would do that so let's go to buy call i'm going to go for so look we got earnings on november 20th so november 22nd would be um the expiration date that you would pick for for capturing earnings right the call options are fairly expensive i would probably go for something really close to the money like the 140 right here you can see that the delta is 0.55 so it's an outof the money option but the market expects nvidia to go up so much so that the delta is 0.55 and it's out of the money so that gives uh that paints the picture that the market has a bias for nvidia to rise like literally we have a bias for it to go up because typically an out- of- the- money option should not have a delta of over 50 because you know the market follows random walk random walk states that um essentially the market is you know it's not certain if the stocks going to go up or down but for nvidia it it's pretty definitive that it's going to it's going to go up at least based on the option activity right so there's a whole lot of volume here there's 3,000 contracts traded and almost 16,000 on the open interest implied volatility is pretty high the bid ask spread is pretty tight this is a fantastic option to buy so you can buy this um if you buy this call option you'll have to pay about ,000 it is pretty expensive all right so your break even here is actually around 150 but look if nvidia goes to say 160 by november 20 uh 2nd because of earnings then you could essentially double your money i mean that's nooke joke right doubling your money in 3 weeks i mean you kidding me i have a lot of students that have 100k 200k 300k portfolios and more so it's potentially you can make 100k in 3 weeks now obviously that's if you put your entire money on the position which you know i wouldn't recommend that at all you got to you got to be aware of risk management but uh look you can buy a call you can also sell a call so i would still stick to the 140 where you buy the call okay and then you can sell a call option let's go for you know let's say that we think it's going to go to 150 which is entirely possible here you can see how you can actually still double your money and i think this is actually a better play in my opinion so um if you're going to be buying options yeah you can buy calls you got really tremendous upside so if nvidia went to 200 you would absolutely print money on a on a buy call option but i'm not really a kind of guy that likes to bet on big moves if i can make 5% a month then pretty happy right $3 million uh that's like well into the six figures per month or even if you have let's say1 k 5% it's 5 grand a month it's really good right so i would say that i'm not looking for like a massive like crazy move but i'm still going to print money and make a lot of money by just by just basically i can go for a call debit spread so here in this example you can buy the 140 and you can sell the 150 and the 150 essentially subsidizes the cost of the 140 right so you're paying $985 but then you're selling a call option and you are collecting $535 so you're total cost is only going to be um $450 which yeah has like half off right it's half off of buying and call option and the craziest thing is you uh will actually double your money at 150 rather than like um i think in our last example was 160 right because your break even was 150 in the prior example and to make a total of $20 you needed to go to 160 because the call was at$ 140 right so you need to go to 160 here we only need to go to 150 to double our money so this is a lot easier to double your money and this is probably more or less what i'm going to open up a small position on um when the market opens up in about an hour although in an hour i have a interview with one of my students who has been very profitable so i'm going to get grab a testimonial i'm going to have a lot more testimonials on this channel guys because i have so many successful students and i haven't been posting their results which i want to share more of their results so definitely watch out for that i'm going to have that pretty soon here um it's going to be my wheel strategy um course which i'm coming out with very soon so u make sure that you have notifications on for that now um the max loss here is uh is only what you pay so whatever you pay is what you can lose so i like that it's a define risk so this is a fantastic position now uh something else i'll show you is you can also buy a leap option okay so leap option is also a very powerful strategy where you just buy a call option that goes out uh far into the future so let's say that we go for september 19 2025 obviously that captures this earnings next earnings and the next earnings right so it captures in many earnings and and that is good because as nvidia keeps beating earnings it'll likely you know rise and as it rises um this leap option will will perform very well so if i expand here this is a 68 delta all right the implied volatility is lower the implied volatility is smooth out over a longer period of time so you saw that um a shorter term call option was having a like 68 69% volatility it's a little bit more smooth at 53% so um this option you know is going to be actually a little bit cheaper because when you're buying options you know lower volatility is good and that's why you know after earnings happens basically there's iv crush typically so um right now we have higher implied volatility on nvidia because there's there is earnings right so you can buy something like this you can buy a longer term call option and then you can sell calls against it so you can go for let's say let's say i'm going to show you a little bit different of a scenario so i can go for november 22nd right and now i can say hey i think nvidia will go up but let's say that you're only moderately bullish on nvidia you can can actually now sell the 150 and say i think nvidia will go up but i don't think it'll go up much higher than 150 you can see what happens here to the chart okay so i don't this is this has its pros and cons there's no best trade to make an option trading there is just strategies for your point of view okay if that makes sense for your point of view i probably not do this strategy right here but i'm giving you the option to because you know not everyone is mega bullish on nvidia you can be slightly bullish on nvidia and still make money on it in this way if nvidia goes towards 150 right you'll make money on the leap uh option right here so you'll make really good money you can make uh well you won't double your money so i would say that this position right here would probably be best done after earnings i have several videos on the por man's covered call so i'm going to have that uh linked at the end screen here so yeah i wanted to show you the three strategies but i would say the first two are going to be much better the poorman's covered call you should do probably after earnings because um the implied volatility will go down and you'll have less risk of getting a the short call option so if you want to check out the port man's cover call video on how to do it properly i actually have an nvidia video on that so check it out right here on the screen",INTC;NVDA;TSLA,TSLA:INCREASE;NVDA:HOLD;INTC:OPEN,TSLA:INCREASE;NVDA:INCREASE;INTC:OPEN,AAPL:0.2526;ADBE:0.0823;COP:0.0239;CVX:0.0249;MPC:0.0239;NVDA:0.2526;OXY:0.0249;PLTR:0.1093;PSX:0.0239;SLB:0.0249;TSLA:0.1093;WMB:0.0218;XOM:0.0256,AAPL:0.0939;ADBE:0.0306;COP:0.0089;CVX:0.0093;INTC:0.2543;MPC:0.0089;NVDA:0.2543;OXY:0.0093;PLTR:0.0406;PSX:0.0089;SLB:0.0093;TSLA:0.2543;WMB:0.0081;XOM:0.0095,AAPL:0.1274;ADBE:0.1274;COP:0.0238;CVX:0.0238;GS:0.1274;MCD:0.0576;MPC:0.0238;MTCH:0.1274;NVDA:0.1274;OXY:0.0238;PLTR:0.0576;PSX:0.0238;SLB:0.0238;TSLA:0.0576;WMB:0.0238;XOM:0.0238,AAPL:0.0739;ADBE:0.0739;COP:0.0138;CVX:0.0138;GS:0.0739;INTC:0.1758;MCD:0.0334;MPC:0.0138;MTCH:0.0739;NVDA:0.1758;OXY:0.0138;PLTR:0.0334;PSX:0.0138;SLB:0.0138;TSLA:0.1758;WMB:0.0138;XOM:0.0138,0.9782225515222758,0.9831850409448993,-0.021777448477724226,-0.016814959055100664
2024-11-01,bpwXUxqdGsM,"kind: captions language: en can i make $5,000 or more selling puts in the next 20 minutes of this video this step-by-step guide will help you more than any other video and i'm going to be showing you proof with my live trades let's not waste any time and jump into it so right now the first trade that i want to make is going to be chipot cmg chipotle just had earnings and something that i want to do is i want to capitalize by selling a put option on chipot for good entry so i'm going to pull up chipotle on the chart i'm going to show you what has just happened so chipotle recently had earnings the stock popped down from 60 down to 56 i'm very bullish it's now below the bottom of the binger ban here so the binger ban right here is around 56 so i'm going to sell several contracts of chipotle right now as the market just opened up okay so i'm going to go to trade cmg options i'm going to go sell put and i'm going to pick an expiration date that's about 30 days out i'm going to pick november 9 i'm going to capitalize right as these earnings have hit and i'm going to go for a 30-day option i'm looking to aggressively acquire shares and right here you will see that the 55 put option right here is going for a120 this is essentially a 2% return in one month which is a little bit low okay so instead of that and the volume is zero i'm actually going to go for a little bit up and i'm going to go for an at the money put at 56 now this return is closer to that 3% mark i would say 3% in 29 days under a month is pretty good so i'm going to go ahead and go to continue now i'm probably going to be selling let's say i'm going to go for eight contracts here so eight contracts will collect $1,319 which i think is really good i'm going to go for a price here of 1.75 and let's see if i will get executed on this trade right here so i just submitted and i want to sell eight contracts and my goal is to collect around $11,400 right now i'm not getting filled the reason why i'm not getting filled is the limit price is 1.75 but the bid ask is 1.55 and 1.75 so i'm going to have to replace this order right now and i'm going to have to open up a new contract i'm going to open it up at 1.6 i'm going to go closer to the bid because i'm in a rush i want to make this video as efficient as possible cu i respect your time all right so we just collected 1,279 76 i'm going to put that on the bottom of the screen and we have sold eight contracts here now just to be frank and to be fair the cash is in my account i've already made this money but i may get a sign but i'm not worried at all when i sell puts i want to get a sign so i have just made that amount of money here on the screen right now so let's go into the next trade that i have next trade that i want to make actually i have two more trade i have actually several really important trades i want to make right now so let's actually go for american airlines this has been my most consistent play for a very long time american airlines collects a lot of money and you don't have to have a big portfolio it's also down right now i love to see red american airlines is down the first 30 minutes of trading guys can be a lot more volatile option premiums are actually slightly elevated in the first 30 minutes of the morning so it is 9:30 a.m. eastern so i'm going to be looking to um sell some put options here i do have different positions on american airlines as is but i'm going to make a small account trade and i'm going to click trade american airlines options again i'm going to go to sell put let me show you what the chart looks like on american airlines so if i go to american airlines here on the chart i'm going to go back here i'm going to go to the expiration date of you know what i can go for december 20 nothing wrong with going for expiration days guys that are 30 days out 60 days out or 90 days out i like doing less i believe in safe passive consistent income that's what my channel is about i love running the wheel strategy and specifically selling puts gets going on that wheel strategy so i'm going to go sell put december 20th expiration nothing wrong with that as long as the return is good i am happy personally so american airlines going to go to chart and right now i want to show you what the chart looks like we're getting a big bullish move on american airlines right this stock is climbing but you know if it pulls back it might pull back around this 1278 honestly i think it'll if it pulls back it'll go to $13 but i'll be excited to get into this stock because the trend is pretty clear and i want to get a entry into this stock right now so what i'm going to do is i'm going to sell a put option at the 13 strike going out 15 days now you will notice that the return here is very good it's about $49 of return and i'm only putting up about 12251 this is roughly a you know 4% return which i'm frankly pretty happy with to be clear this is not a crazy return but you know to be honest this is a good return for a optimal entry into the stock to acquire shares at a cheaper price so you know when you're selling puts you're looking to acquire the stock guys please do not sell puts on stocks that you don't like okay i'm always doing it on stocks i do like so look i think that i can easily go for 15 contracts right here um i'm going to go for uh i'm actually going to go for 0.5 see if i can get filled for $50 and i did just get filled for 14 contracts still waiting for that last contract there there we go so i got 15 contracts filled let's add $749 55 right now to the amount of money that i made on 15 contracts here and this is not a lot of money right i've used a fairly small position there to collect income so the next thing that i want to do is i'm going to go to nvidia on nvidia i've been bullish and i've said many times that nvidia because of ai because of the leadership the ceo the management very bullish and i see a big upside to nvidia i i think this is going to be an $800 stock in the next couple of you know few years it'll take a few years obviously to get to 800 it'll be one of the biggest companies in my opinion so i would say that i'm always looking to acquire shares of nvidia i'd be more than happy to own the stock anywhere at 1:30 let's actually take a look at nvidia's chart on on yahoo finance and let's take a look at the bowling ban so the bowling ban is something something that i take a look at very closely specifically the bowling band tells me where a good entry could be you can actually see right here that if i zoom into to the binger band the moving average is 131 and the bottom of the binger band is about 127 all right so here's a unique strategy that i'm going to use to sell this put option i'm going to go to trade nvidia options and i'm specifically looking to really take advantage of that bottom of the bowling band 127 now look that doesn't mean i'm going to go sell a put at 127 i'm actually going to go a little bit more aggressive than that because i want to get aggressive ownership of nvidia i i want to get assigned i'd be happy to buy the stock so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go for a shorter term expiration is actually very shortterm you know to be honest i like longer term expiration just because i am looking to do less work and i want to stick to that more passive approach so um you could go shortterm you get paid in proportion to the time of the option so a lot of my students that like weekly income i think a lot more of my students like monthly income it just depends typically when i have a student join my discord we're a lot more active we're learning quickly we're making fast money and then you know we go from making that fast money to quick money and um we just kind of mellow out over over a period of time we just get you know $ 10,000 or more dollars per month and just kind of keeping it chill so look what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to i'm going to go for a see the 130 here has 355 volume 22,000 open interest that's a lot of open interest guys this is very important by the way when you're looking at selling a put option you want to make sure that there is healthy volume because when there's liquidity that that makes it easier to get in get out of this trade and the bid ask here is very tight that's that's beautiful the bid is uh 8.05 the ask is 8.15 i mean that's really tight that means you're going to get a fantastic price on trading this option right here now this option is going for $815 like i said i want ownership so i can go for something even closer to that 40 delta mark typically my sweet spot is 30 delta but if i really want aggressive ownership of a company i may go for a higher delta so 40 delta here actually meets what i'm looking for personally right now so i'm going to go ahead and sell a put option on nvidia i'm going to click continue and this is a sizable uh chunk of money because at 132 strike it does tie up $133,000 per contract so if i were to do five contracts here you know this would be sizable enough for me this would be $65,000 bet i'm going to go for 8.95 h let's go for 8.9 just so i can get filled here a little quicker and i'm going to submit this so right now i submitted this trade wow i did just get filled on five contracts so the collateral is going to be roughly it's going to be roughly $66,000 so if you take 132 and you multiply by five that's essentially yeah it is $66,000 however i have collected 4,000 let's add right now $444 185 cents of the total amount of premium that i've collected so far in this video i think we're well into the over 5k mark now and i'm trying to keep the video under 20 minutes so we're over the 5k mark so we have succeeded i want to see how far we can go here uh in the next 10 10 minutes or whatever so look i think it's really important because the $66,000 worth of collateral here is not actually not 66,000 because the premium that i collected which is the 4,400 it will subtract from the collateral so this is going to be a little bit cheaper then again it is capital intensive to sell puts and you know you need to have the capital because if i get assigned which you know i want to get assigned on nvidia then i'm going to have to have the the cash to actually buy the shares all right so the next stock that i want to go into all right so we've done american airlines chipotle i also want to look at another small account trade i want to look at sofi i think sofi is a really good company overall it has kind of gone up in price but right now the momentum is strong so i i do have some $10 puts that i've already sold but you will notice here that these 10 puts are expiring very soon so i want to replace them okay what i do is when i sell options i wait closer to expiration as as they're expiring i will typically replace that position or open up a very similar position so i can continue making money with the idea that i have right i want to keep capitalizing on my idea so what going to do right now sofi is at 10 i'm also going to sell a $10 put and this thing is dropping pretty quickly actually put up sofi on a chart all right so let me go to charting here and i'll show you that let's actually go to a shorter term chart okay here we had a pretty sizable bounce from the 1047 level we had a double peak at 1122 i think we're going to be going sideways here let me go to the bowling band let me actually decrease the period to 10 days to make a little bit tighter so yes actually i am getting that confirmation that's kind of what i wanted to do was in the next you know two weeks or so do a sofi trade which will be at around the $10 strike so i'm actually getting perfect confirmation that in the next 10 trading days which is two weeks $10 strike would be you know very safe all right so i want to take a sellp put order i'm going to go a little bit shorter term i'm going to go for the november 15 expiration if you're watching this in the future just use the same logic thought process to collect a bunch of premium in your portfolio this stuff really adds up guys you can easily make you know5 $110,000 just by selling put options every single month so what i'm going to do is you can see here that in 2 weeks i'm essentially getting a $16 premium here which is like around a 1.6% return okay it's not super high but you know then again this sellp put strategy is very safe it's for consistent income it's for optimal entry the bread and butter of income isn't necessarily made from selling puts although it is sizable you get a little bit more from when you actually get a signed and if the stock recovers you can make even more money right so you are looking for the stock to go down the ideal scenario is if the stock falls down you get assigned and then the next week once you're assigned it just goes back up right i had that happen to me so many times and that's why i'm never worried about managing this strategy i don't need to manage this strategy because i'm doing it on stocks that i personally done technical analysis on and i'm happy to own so i'm going to go ahead and execute this in even a small position let's let's go 15 contracts here 15 contracts essentially would be a maximum you know by the way this maximum loss is fake don't don't take this at phase value because the max loss is basically if the the stock went down to zero yeah i would lose $1,745 but you know obviously when you sell puts on on these companies none of them are going to zero right pretty hard for a company to even fall 20% yet al loone 10% unless we have a bare market or a crash so this max loss isn't something to really pay attention to what i am paying attention to is that on this position i'm collecting $255 i am tying up $14,000 is in collateral but my actual risk is is not really that okay so here i'm going to collect $255 so this is actually a pretty big return you know we have have over 2 and 1 12% thereabouts here which is a yeah pretty good return i'm going to go for the $18 here i'm going to review this trade and submit it and now we will see okay perfect i got filled for 15 contracts on sofi i sold a $10 put now look if you're watching this in the future i would actually still sell $10 puts for december and for january expiration actually i can show you what that looks like right now but real quick we're going to add the money that i've made we're going to add trading during this video so far okay again i do need these options to go to expiration but you know the cash is in my account so i count this money as good as as good as mine all right so now what i'm going to do is i'll show you that you can do a different expirations on the same stock so i can go to december 20 right now i can still go for a $10 put right here and i can just open up let's say i'm going to open up just two contracts because you know i have enough sofi i don't want to over leverage into it if i go to $44 and i go for the bid right the bid is much easier to get filled you can play around with the bid ask price but you know i try to go for the bid because i want efficiency in this video as fast as possible i'm just trying to collect money and show you guys that this is really possible for anyone this is what i do live in my discord community two times a week check out the first link in the description uh if you want to be part of my uh community and get my one-on-one coaching where i will show you how to do this and optimize this for yourself look i just sold i got filled two contracts we're going to add $879 to overall how much i've made so i think i'm probably around $7,000 or so in collect a premium so far um and this is a very small position the collateral here is less than $2,000 so real quick i want to make one more trade on a sell put okay i'm going to oh actually i already know what it's going to be oh i'm super super excited right so uh robin hood actually the platform i'm using just reported earnings and look i love selling puts post earnings because i'm not afraid to sell puts into earnings either the implied volatility is high but after earnings to be clear what specifically happens is there's iv crush okay iv crush uh means that there's a whole lot of anticipation leading up into earnings after earnings happens there's obviously a big big move in the stock looks like robin hood's having a really negative move right now it's continuing to have a negative move in the early hours here in the first 30 minutes of trading so you know the iv crush has already happened for the most part iv is still kind of crushing since the um volatility is since the stock is still going down but i'm not afraid to trade puts before or after earnings but it is a different mindset okay before earnings right what you need to be aware of is that you may have a big move after earnings you already had the big move but it's probably a continuation of that move so right now what i'm going to do is i'm going to sell a put option on robin hood it looks like some of the price targets here have been lower it also looks like their earnings came out and uh they they've actually had earnings of7 per share now for me i've been following robin hood for a very long time so this reaction of the stock falling down has raised quite a lot of money from its market cap like quite a lot like a fall of 133% from the market cap of right it's basically lost over about $3 billion or so give or take so i'm going to go to trade robin hood options or hood options i'm going to go to sell put now i can go shortterm there this is crazy in one day okay this this option expires tomorrow in one day you can collect over 1% return right here okay this also is about 1% return and it's a dollar lower this is an interesting trade okay i personally don't like to do this type of really shortterm trade so i'm going to go for still a short-term trade but i'm going to go 15 days out and you can see here how the returns are still bonkers they're like wow this is over 3% in 2 weeks that's over 6% in a month that's 100% return annualized per year okay so what i'm going to do is i'm probably going to go for the 22 a2 uh the bid ask here is actually not good this is not a good bid ask 5782 means there's a lot of slippage cost not good let me go for 22 okay that's better right so the 22 and a half strike price is just a little bit of a weird strike price um and it didn't have that much volume 30 volume whereas this has 165 volume so this would be a better option to trade and i'm going to get about 2 and 1 half 3ish per return i'm just going to go for 10 contracts here nothing too crazy i'm going to go for 0.55 okay so i could go for 0.56 again i want this video to be super efficient there we go i just sold 10 contracts and we're going to add $549 70s to my overall return here for this video guys every monday and wednesday i'm selling puts if you want to be on those live calls check out the description and if you want to watch another video of me selling options live you can check out this video right here on the screen

2024-11-04,YvU8sSdJURA,"kind: captions language: en tech earnings have been completely unbelievable after i've seen the data and what i want to discuss in this video is the top four stocks that i'm buying in november because right now between the fed between elections and just going into the end of the year there's a lot of opportunity to make money so i'm going to show you four different stocks that i'm looking at where i see an opportunity to trade options with there's some serious money that we can make with my strategies and i don't want you to miss any of these let's jump right into it the first stock i'm going to be covering which i haven't covered for a very long time is actually neo so neo is a stock that is in the ev space i used to cover this stock a lot i made a lot of money with the stock and then i ended up selling it and i've actually got out of the stock for a profit um it's been a very volatile stock and now that the stock has pulled back tremendously i want to give you guys an opportunity to make money on the stock now remember you don't actually need a stock to have a whole lot of direction to make money with my option strategy often times we can print cash even the stock doesn't do too much now quickly i want to go over um neo uh and why i'm bullish on it i'm only semi- bullish on it but the good news is the strategy that i'm going to tell you about actually requires the stock to be semi- bullish i don't need the stock to go up a lot to make a lot of money so let me explain all right so first of all neo um they have a growing ev market in china the ev market in china is booming and uh there's specifically if you take a look at the economic difference between evs versus the you know gas and and diesel etc evs just have an economic advantage right they're cheaper to get in and also just looking at neo they have an innovative battery swapping model so this innovative battery swapping model um al although it can take a little bit longer to swap that battery versus going to a gas station if you look at the overall time that it requires to actually get energy into the car and actually be able to drive a specific difference a specific distance it is actually much better than tesla because tesla still takes a lot of time to charge whereas a battery swap gives you a whole lot of range okay so they have a very innovative model not to mention they are expanding into europe so just looking into expansion actually really bullish because i'm in eastern europe at the moment which is where my roots are from and um i do see a lot of chinese vehicles here there's a lot of chinese um vehicles coming onto the market and i do see some consumers starting to switch to these vehicles so i'm i'm very bullish actually on china in the long term in the short term i would say that it can be a hit or miss however let me show you the option strategy that i'm going to use on neo so my portfolio is still hovering right around the 3.667% the first link in the description and you can learn more about my challenge my discord community and most importantly my one-on-one coaching where i'm giving you um myself which is is like the best right so let me go into neo right now and let's take a look at some of the options um specifically neo is just going sideways which is actually a really good pattern a lot of people u mistaken uh sideways action is bad no it's actually really really good and i'm going to show you several different option strategies that you can run right here very simple option strategies where you can make a lot of money take advant of what's happening with with election what's happening with the growth and momentum in the market for example we'll cover google absolutely lots of money to be made a lot of money so we're making money hand over fist or a bicep over tricep we're we're staying active here and we're trying to make as much money as possible safely remember i'm all about safe passive income i'm not about taking on excessive risk okay so what you have to consider with neo the stocks at around $5 per share and yes let me point out i'm not one of the guys that's just going to hype you up and say oh we're going to make money to the moon you also have to be aware of the risks look before i give you this play on neo and the other three plays that i got china's economic challenges okay they have challenges with real estate they have a struggling and slowing consumer spend okay their birth rates have come down quite a lot okay so i think this is going to impact uh neo's domestic sales it will impact neo's domestic sales but again i don't need this stock to go up a lot because i'm looking at aggressively and when i say aggressively when i ag i ly sell options this actually means safety okay let me explain this little nuance right here let's go to the example so i'm going to go to trade neo options specifically what i want to do is a covered call an in the money covered call okay i did have a video on this so i will link that video at the end of this video an in the money covered call i will explain to you now but just wait till the end of the video you can see more about it if you still have questions so look an in the money covered call essentially is going to look like this you first have to buy 100 shares of neo that's $5 stock i mean it's only only going to cost you 500 that's a very very low amount okay you can put a very small amount of money here and then you can start selling covered calls all right so here's what you would do you would sell a $5 covered call now let me go for an expiration date that is december 20th i think this is a really interesting strategy very very interesting to make high income at a very safe way so look i'm going to go for the $5 strike this is a $66 premium so there's a few things to note here $66 is actually about 12% return in 47 days so it's about six weeks and this is about a 12% return which means 2% return basically a week 2% a week is a ridiculously high return this is a way to collect a lot of income okay now also why is it safe and specifically why is it safer than going for an outof the- money option let me explain if you go for out of the money options which i typically ally recommend i'm giving you a little bit of a different way to do covered calls right now if you were to do a covered call out of the money you get a lot of good upside and you get some get some margin of safety because when you collect the premium right here at $66 you get to collect premium it actually reduces your average cost so if you were to buy 100 shares right now you would spend $510 but we're collecting $66 so that would reduce us down by $66 which would be about $4 and you know 56 uh there about right so $4 and you know 50 or so so at $4.50 you actually get a really good discount you get a really good discount because the stock is trading at five uh $510 but because you're selling a covered call which is in the money if the stock goes down you're completely protected not completely protected you're protected down to that mark that i mentioned which would be the $456 or so right so at that point or $454 actually that that's the correct number if it goes down to 470 you don't care at all you could care less that's actually even a good thing it's actually a fantastic thing because let me give you three scenarios if it goes up okay cool no problem you make 12% in 6 weeks if it stays the same that's fine you make 12% in 6 weeks now if it goes down to say $5 you you don't care if it goes below $5 you're actually good because you get to keep your shares and now your covered call is out of the money it's below five so when it expires you don't lose your shares and you still get all the premium you get the premium no matter what but if it's above $5 which it's already starting at 510 this is a way to basically generate quick money like fast cash but you're definitely going to lose your shares if it's above $5 at expiration right so at december 20th you're going to lose your shares because it's above $5 and the person's going to exercise that's not a bad thing but you will lose your shares you are putting in capital and then that capital will be basically used and then you'll get it all back right so you'll put up $510 you'll get paid the $66 here in this example um basically you're putting up$ 450 and you're going to make about um yeah you're going to make about $66 so or about $50 $50 so you put in 450 you get 500 so you 450 you put in and then 500 you come out essentially more along those lines okay and then you can just rotate this every 6 weeks okay so i think this is a really smart strategy for nvidia specifically grow eevee market in in china yes we have some problems in china for sure and that's why i backed away from neo which was a genius move okay some of you guys watch my videos on neo and you say well henry had a tough time with neo no i did not have a tough time in neo it just looks like i had a tough time on neo on some of my old videos because there was a lot of volatility my discord members have been very profitable on neo throughout history right um i'm not going to say we have 100% win rate and to be frank i don't even think win rate is what's important what's important is how much money and what percentage return you have every single month is your net worth rising and is your income suitable to basically help you retire and meet your spending needs right if that is if those two things are true i could care less what the win rate is the win rate can be 82% it could be 91% it could be 62% but if you have a good return for a good level of risk in at the end of the month at the end of the day at the end of the month you have 8k gain $88,500 gain $112,000 gain we're good right i'm not going to go after definitions all right that's the first stock right the second stock that i want to cover and this is also a stock that i recently covered in my last video on november 1st where i went over my live trading here's the video by the way on the live trading that i did watch millionaire trader sell puts live this is a really important video uh i'm not sure why a lot of you guys missed it and we only have 16,000 views out of our 300,000 subscribers you guys should really check out this video because uh i show examples and in the in basically i traded sofi and the next stock on this list is sofi i'm going to show you what sofi looks like on the chart because i think this is really important sofi specifically is a very good company and has a unique fintech advantage okay uh what i mean by that is they have a unique fintech ecosystem all right i'm going to look at my notes here so i wrote here unlike many fintech competitors sofi offers a comprehensive suite of financial products okay this basically allows it to benefit from cross- selling and high customer retention okay that's really important high customer retention and cross- selling makes a lot more money when you have a better relation ship which is by the way this is the whole reason i started one-on-one coaching i see a lot of option gurus coming on to youtube they're kind of copying me and i have proof that they're basically making the same videos as me that's why i decided to go one-on-one coaching because i actually want to build a better relationship with you personally one to one i'm independent i don't promote anybody else i don't promote any sponsors and i don't promote any other youtubers quite frankly i've been doing this for 10 years i'm saying this because i think really deeply about customer experience and when i invest in companies i think about the same way i deliver my coaching as a coach i want to make sure that i deliver the best level of experience and that is true for sofi i'm always looking for a company that has brand that can also deliver the best customer service because what happens is when you deliver a good customer experience and someone gets results and in terms of my coaching or with sofi when someone has a good experience with their mobile banking they don't have to look elsewhere they get everything in one platform in one ecosystem that's exactly what sofi does which is why i start to really like this stock and this stock has basically gone off to the moon um a lot i mean this stock went from a $6 stock to $11 per share stock this stock has almost doubled and that's because what they're doing for their customers is phenomenal they're actually focusing on the experience i also believe when you do a good job as a company as a business owner that will foster that will foster to customer loyalty and long-term relationships long-term relationships equals money point blank that is the most important thing so when i'm looking at investing in sofi i think that this stock can be a $20 stock you know i'm buying it in november but i think it can be a $20 stock in 2025 and beyond so by the end of 2025 or early 2026 this stock if it's at $20 will essentially be a double so i'm going to show you the option strategy that i personally would run on sofi right now i do have a couple positions on sofi but i'm also going to be looking at using the poor man's covered call strategy or the leap strategy okay let me show you what that looks like all right so i'm up a little bit of money here on sofi here's what the leap strategy would look like you buy a call option okay you go out far in terms of dates all right so we'll go out to september 19 2025 um i would buy right at the money right around $10 so if you buy at $10 this is a 70 delta that is beautiful 70 delta gives you that exposure gives you that um advantage versus buying the stock because if you buy the stock well you'll have to put up about $11,000 but if you just buy a leap option it's only $315 to control 100 shares so now if i go to sell all right and i go to sell i can sell something like january and i can sell uh something like the $12 strike if i go to expand here you can see it's a 43 delta it's a little bit high but the bid out spread is amazing and you can see that if uh sofi has a bullish move in the short term which i think will be slightly bullish again this video is about being slightly bullish i'm not a mega bull right now i'm slightly bullish that i think the market will continue to run positively okay and because it'll run positively you can make $100 here $100 or so if this uh leap option were to go to around $112 per share you would actually make probably even more than that because um essentially going from 11 to 12 is already $100 on the leap option itself and then if the $12 covered call expires um out of the money you've essentially made $75 right here on the premium and then on the call option rising you'd make about another dollar so you can make a really good return on sofi every two to three months by doing the poor man's covered call strategy the next stock i want to talk about and this is a little bit controversial a lot of people um had some backlash to me but i ended up making tremendous amounts of money is going to be snapchat okay snapchat uh let's look at the year-to-date return on snapchat this stock has had a lot of volatility um i started recommending snapchat i don't know actually let me look at my history because i want to be honest with you guys um so it looks like i started trading in around october so not that long ago around october so right here well actually yeah that was last month only so yeah i've been trading it very recently so i've avoided this huge crash and then this huge rise luckily cuz i don't like a lot of volatility but now that the stock has stabilized around $10 per share i see a really big bull run in snapchat specifically i think social media in general is growing a lot short firm content is growing and you will also notice or if you look into snapchat a little bit further they're dominating on the younger demographic although this isn't really that fantastic at the moment right because you can't capitalize a whole lot on the younger generation yet they don't have a high income i believe that snapchat will start to make a lot more more money with ads um in the next few years right uh ad dollars are increasing and obviously kids and like younger generation they don't have as much money but they will um they will have money so that's the most important thing so what i would do with snapchat is i would straight up just sell some put options and look for a good entry into snapchat so you can sell something like if i go to december 20th i can sell the 10 or i can sell the you know what let's actually take a look at both if i would look at the 10 strike the delta here is just way too low which is kind of what i assumed 21 delta is also pretty low but look the the return is is not that bad for a good entry you can collect $32 you collect $32 and then you have a decent entry into snapchat now if it hits $11 then you can just run the wheel strategy which i have a lot of videos on you can check out the wheel strategy uh invest with henry here on this channel i have a lot of wheel strategy but i would essentially just sell puts to to get into snapchat now the last stock that i want to talk about in this video is going to be google because of tech earnings um i think that google is going to rise it already did rise after tech earnings we made a load of money doesn't look like it because it's only up 2 and a half% but i actually was able to catch uh google at a really good price so i've been buying shares i've been looking for entry for a long time and the swing from basically 150 155 up to 170 has been a $15 swing and you know just having a 100 shares uh has been very profit prof so you can see right now that i have 170 puts which basically i would highly recommend you have if you have a portfolio that can sell puts if you have you know 30k 40k you know or more or six figures easily you should be selling puts on google and i currently have sold the 170 put on google um five contracts of that",TSLA,TSLA:INCREASE,TSLA:INCREASE,AAPL:0.0862;ADBE:0.0281;COP:0.0082;CVX:0.0085;INTC:0.2333;MPC:0.0082;NVDA:0.3156;OXY:0.0085;PLTR:0.0373;PSX:0.0082;SLB:0.0085;TSLA:0.2333;WMB:0.0074;XOM:0.0087,AAPL:0.0901;ADBE:0.0293;COP:0.0085;CVX:0.0089;INTC:0.2439;MPC:0.0085;NVDA:0.2643;OXY:0.0089;PLTR:0.0390;PSX:0.0085;SLB:0.0089;TSLA:0.2643;WMB:0.0078;XOM:0.0091,AAPL:0.0704;ADBE:0.0704;COP:0.0131;CVX:0.0131;GS:0.0704;INTC:0.1674;MCD:0.0318;MPC:0.0131;MTCH:0.0704;NVDA:0.2148;OXY:0.0131;PLTR:0.0318;PSX:0.0131;SLB:0.0131;TSLA:0.1674;WMB:0.0131;XOM:0.0131,AAPL:0.0664;ADBE:0.0664;COP:0.0124;CVX:0.0124;GS:0.0664;INTC:0.1580;MCD:0.0300;MPC:0.0124;MTCH:0.0664;NVDA:0.2027;OXY:0.0124;PLTR:0.0300;PSX:0.0124;SLB:0.0124;TSLA:0.2143;WMB:0.0124;XOM:0.0124,0.9888753217357101,0.9916691205706136,-0.011124678264289867,-0.008330879429386373
2024-11-05,e9EoKE7kXBY,kind: captions language: en oh my goodness this is insane pal year reported earnings and the numbers are absolutely mindboggling this stock has printed me so much money in my community i need to tell you what i think about the stock right now because with this news i think we're in a very interesting point of paler overall trajectory of where the stock has been where it's going in the future and how you can make a lot more money because guys i'm looking at my research right here and the numbers are absolutely like i can't even fathom how profitable and how crazy paler actually is we're literally printing money year over-year 30% growth paler has been growing its top line like an absolute monster guys i'm pumped up i'm so pumped up because we're making money hand over fist bicep over tricep guys i'm so pumped up because what i see going on with paler is almost unheard of trajectory okay this is like going to the moon all right just like nvidia has had a huge rise paler is doing the same exact thing and i have been early on this trend i've been covering paler since ipo and now just take a look at where paler is this stock has been going up by $5 $10 and every time that's tens of billions of dollars of market cap being added every single strategy that i've had on paler has been working out and it's not even because i'm a genius at options it's just because i've picked the right vehicle and i put you guys in this vehicle so we've been making money hand over fist and i want to give you an update of what i think is going to happen to pal here because when i looked at the results last night and i'm recording this in the morning i was asking myself there oh my goodness i was bullish but this stock even surprised and blew my expectations out of the water and i've been doing research on paler for years since ipo this stock has been the number one stock that i've been holding okay so listen let's talk about the 30% revenue growth as well as what i think is even more impressive is us commercial growth 44% this company palen here where the ceo went to my high school i love the ceo i have so much trust in the ceo i have as much trust in the ceo almost as much trust as i have in myself that's crazy the ceo has been guiding the company through ai he's been innovating like crazy the talent at the company is insane and now with this earings beat i think that the stock stock is going to go parabolic i've been saying this stock is very undervalued and now we're finally seeing this stock coming to fruition i mean it's had a fantastic 2024 but with this earnings i see the stock i see this actually pushing the stock over the edge okay going into 2025 we're going to be in some really hot times okay when a stock is hot you can print money you can legally prince money okay now looking at the commercial growth of 44% guys palen here used to just be you know friends with the government they used to just have contracts with the government for the most part and they were having a challenge growing and there was many doubters people were doubting that hey palen here you know they're a one trick pony well guess what this is definitely definitely not a one- trick pony and i'm really pumped off and excited because the money that i'm making the money that my students have made in discord has actually been lifechanging you know maybe not for me i'm already rich but it's been lifechanging in terms of my net worth it's also been life-changing for the the students that i have in discord right and like looking at more of the results right here you know they gave really positive guidance guys that is a huge deal all right let let me tell you tell you something right now a company can have good earnings and the stock can still go down the reason why paler had phenomenal out of this world out of my mind out of my mind earnings but it's still continues to pop higher it's growing like my biceps are growing it's growing like it's growing like no other right it's growing i can't even make an analogy how much it's growing all right i'm i'm like shocked as as i'm making this video it's it's shocking the craziest thing is the guidance was even more positive coming from their from their team from the leadership they're positive going into the future which means this train is just taking off or this plane or this jet or this bugatti i don't know but this vehicle is just getting started okay i've been a little bit too early on the trend i've been 3 years on this stock right whenever the ipo happened i've been making videos for 5 years now okay let me tell you the guidance was so good that i think the stock is going to keep going up i think okay look when i was studying finance all right one of the tendencies or trends that happens in the market is after earnings you get a huge pop in the stock right and then it goes it goes a little bit higher okay it's called drift all right like you're drifting a car car it's drift go all right goes a little bit higher i think that's what's going to happen to palance here okay because listen 30% revenue growth 44% us commercial growth guidance was really good and i want to say that listen the past of the past i get it the stock was doing phenomenally in the past you know few months now earnings came in do we have more room to run honestly i think yes i think yes i think now we have the reasoning now i have the confidence to say that yes i think that we can run some more okay i've had uh some shares that have been uncovered okay what i mean by that i've been buying call options i've been doing poor man's cover calls on palante here i'm just straight up holding stock right now guys i'm just straight up holding stock because i didn't know how much paler was going to go up i was bullish and they surprised me me and i making like tons of money on it so look i think that now with the proof here okay the proofs in the puding they had the best quarter ever i mean the best growth quarter that i've seen and i've been covering the stock for every single week in my discord session i've been saying guys this is a fantastic stock to have in your portfolio sell puts to get in sell covered calls to generate income but looking at at this earnings i've never seen a quarter that is this strong okay it it's it's almost unheard of now one more you know a few more things i wanted to say here is look palante here they reported third quarter adjusted earnings of 10 cents all right 10 cents 10 cents a share on revenue of $725 million okay now listen analyst surveyed by fax set fax set by the way is a data provider it's kind of like bloomberg when i used to work on wall street actually used fax set super archaic software but they give you the data right data to make data driven decisions right so when i was on wall street i was looking at not ai ai wasn't around when i was working on wall street this is a little bit a while ago now but we were making data driven decisions because that's part of my area of expertise it's finance economics and data analytics my degrees now look analyst surveyed by fax set were expecting earnings of 9 cents a share on revenue of $75 million okay that means that paler beat earnings by 20 excuse me by over $20 million all right in one quarter that is a pretty big beat $20 million that it beat okay topping estimates all right now in the same period last year the company reported earnings of 7 cents a share on revenue of $558 million guys just to put in perspective this company has grown by hundreds of millions of dollars in a year it's topping topline it's topping bottom line it's not like okay we've topped topline estimates and we spend a bunch of money to get there no it we've topped topline and we've surpassed your expectations you wall street guys all the wall street analysts we've surp past all the wall street analyst expectations and we have made more money bottom line okay you can't even argue this you're top and bottom line bigger better stronger grower right that's not a word but you're growing okay now look my only my only regret guys and i've been covering pal here on a freaking basis i've been hitting this i've been hitting this stock on youtube because i want you guys to get rich as often as i've been hitting the gym lately all right because health is number one for me right god is number one for me those two things are number one for me more so than making money um but i want to help because that's part of my mission that's what that's what i want to do that's what i believe my faith i just believe that's the best thing to do with my time right and the only regret i actually have is that i didn't buy more i didn't recommend it more because i didn't want to be spammy on youtube youtube i didn't want to spam this stock but look i i i'm kind of upset with myself i should have been even spamer on youtube telling you guys buy more buy more okay look the stock it's maxed out on all its metrics right now it's maxed out all right if you know i played tennis for 15 years i love tennis i watch some american football as well um it's maxed out it's like roger feder it has good forehand all right good top line it has a good backand that's good bottom line it has good serve okay that's basically that's basically the leadership on all fronts this stock is a 10 out of 10 which is very rare i never see that in the market you usually see a 10 out of 10 stock that is priced for perfection right you know it's it's expensive i would not say right now that paler pe ratio price to sales ratio i would not say it's exuberantly irrational right there's that famous book there and that famous quote i would not say that it's exuberant l um overpriced nothing like that i would say right now we're still in line we're still on the trajectory for making more money because as this stock rises i don't think we're going to get a whole lot of resistance from the market because look hedge funds billionaires everyone on wall street now they've been blown out the water guys we blew them out the water so look i think it's a ch code and that's part of the reason why honestly ly i'm i'm a great option trader i i think i'm one of the okay there's better option traders in this world than me not on youtube on youtube i'm number one but look it doesn't even it's not even an option question this is straight up the stock itself is so good any option strategy will work on on paler right now you can sell a put by by just throwing a dart at it okay you can sell any put 50 delta 40 delta 30 delta 20 delta you will make money right now you can buy a call option for any expiration any strike and because it's a bullish strategy you're going to make money that is seriously a really really rare time to be in in the stock market right giv elections i i'm not taking any sides on election i'm not democrat i'm not republican to be honest i don't even care i'm doing what i can do to level up myself in life how can i level up with god in life how can i level up on this youtube channel how can i level up at the gym as a human i don't really care i don't i could care less about the politics i could care less i don't even live in the united states because it's a lot of nonsense okay i'm just trying to make money and i'm trying to make you guys also some money i'm trying to make you stupid rich and when it comes to palance here literally quality value growth beating top line beating a bottom line you can use right now the leap strategy or you can just stick to my momentum wheel strategy okay i'm about to show you a video on my my m wheel strategy real quick before i pass pass this video and and stop this video there's one more important thing i think the stock rising is absolutely insane the numbers are insane and if i had to make a prediction which i don't usually like to do i just like to make safe passive consistent income selling options but if i had to make if i had to make a guess of what i think paler is going to do i think we're going to have a runner folks truly invalu trillion doll valuation is possible it's not just you know it's not that if that's going to happen it's basically when is that going to happen when is a trillion dollar valuation going to come in because with this innovation with this revenue growth it's just time guys it's just a matter of time right i don't have my watch on me right now um it's just a matter of time all right so listen if you want to play paler in a smart way i would say the smartest way other than holding stock is probably to run my momentum wheel strategy that i've come up with on a unique way of doing the wheel strategy you should check out this video right here on the momentum wheel strategy my story as well and run the strategy on palance here all right congratulations for making a lot of money and i'll catch you guys in the next

difference between being profitable very profitable not so profitable and everything else in between it is extremely important and the strike that you pick will determine how much money you're going to make as well as just generally if you're going to get assigned and lose your shares or not on a covered call position so i'm going to be looking at my notes right now and i'm going to be sharing you the juiciest thing the juiciest information that will literally take you to the next level so the thing is picking the optimal strike is especially important right now with earning season if you'll notice in my portfolio which i am working to get to $4 million in the next couple of months what i'm doing is i'm picking strikes very carefully i'm usually going right above the money where the stock is currently because i want some upside plus i want to collect some premium however it's really important because if you go too close to the current price you have no upside if you go too far from the current price of the stock you basically leave yourself a lot of upside but you also left money on the table via the premium so you want to really balance out premium collection and assignment risk getting assigned on a covered call is bad because you have to pay taxes and you also lose your stock you lose a really good asset for a price that you don't really want to lose it at because it's still going up so i wrote here in my notes that basically i'm making assignments seem really bad but honestly it's just about balancing and rolling which i'll explain later on in tip number three before i cover rolling and tip number two i want to say that you want to balance between the upside that you get with the stock appreciating in value and the premium that you collect so let's go over an example all right so i'm going to pick tesla right now because tesla had earnings and tesla did very well during earnings so we've made a lot of money but to be completely honest with you although i've made money literally hand over fist bicep over tricep we left money on the table because tesla went up a tremendous amount and i ended up selling 235 covered calls and tesla ended up shooting way past 23 5 however this is really interesting i didn't panic or do anything and with the covered calls that i recently sold um yes i i did i lose the shares i have two yes i did lose the shares so i ended up losing the shares and i'm kind of just hanging out on the sidelines because i think tesla overshot a little bit so i did 235 covered calls tesla shot up i made a ton of money right but i didn't make as much money as i would have just holding the stock however this is the good news about covered calls i had a guaranteed return i had a guaranteed premium that i collected right i was i was doing my best to balance out premium versus assignment risk i personally got assigned and that's fine right assignment risk is i made it seem bad and it is kind of bad tip three i'll i'll fix assignment risk for you and tip three but it's not really that bad because you're still making money but you're making a little bit less money versus the stock so if you get assigned you have to pay taxes you make a little bit less money but you still are profitable in fact really profitable and it reduces your over overall risk because hey if if the stock went down on tesla and you a covered call you would have killed all of the other stock investors that are not doing option trading right but check this out is said 235 call covered call on tesla i got paid tesla overshot crazy went up but look it's now trending down so i'm actually looking like a complete genius like my move although not intentional right my intention was i gave all my discord members my challenge members i told them hey do a cover call on tesla and yeah i think it's going to perform very well it performed very well we lost the shares but now we're completely prot protected right so tesla's going down but we're completely protected because as it's going down well we lost shares and i didn't tell my members to jump back in yet i'm about to probably sell some more put options which you know i cover a lot of put option selling on this channel and i do that live actually i made several videos live you guys probably seen that um but here on the covered call it's super exciting actually to see a stock go down it's super rewarding when you've made money and then you're not in a rush you're not getting all emotional or ansy about getting back into the stock because your covered call got assigned so there's two sides of the coin sometimes it's bad when when assignment happens but if assignment happens never beat yourself up about it just relax and you can see right now the tesla is coming back down so the covered call that i made was honestly really genius so how do i usually do this well for me strike selection which is the whole point of tip number one is i'm trying to balance out the sweet spot of delta choosing the perfect delta delta choosing the perfect upside amount and then choosing assignment risk right because again if it's too high of a delta let's say it's really close to the money 50 delta you're going to you're going to get assigned very very likely about half of the time right so that's sweet spot for me he's honestly a case-by casee basis which is why i do live trading but i'm trying to generalize as much as possible to level up your game my rule of thumb would basically be stick to a 30 delta because 30 delta gives you upside it gives you premium too low of a delta will not give you any premium whatsoever i see a lot of people making the mistake of basically selling like 20 delta 15 delta and sure they never get assigned they also never even collect that much income and if the stock goes beyond your strike price and it's in the money or right at the strike price that's exactly what my tip three is going to solve for you already have the solution for you but let's jump into uh tip number two all right so tip number two this is going to be a small and quick tip right um i recently covered a snap trade that expired and i recently covered a snap trade that i placed live uh this was a couple weeks ago i made $2,049 in premium and another about $1,000 in upside this play that i made was absolutely genius textbook example of how to make a lot of money that literally nobody really talks about because i use snapchat which is not the most popular stock right but i made a boatload of money on it and and the position is still open and i used tip number two during that trade so i've never really covered this tip before on my channel and it's i'm telling you it's absolutely genius i want you to tell me if you can spot what i did in this 68c clip real quick i'm going to go ahead and just sell a covered call the premium here is very high this is very good so look you might think to yourself am i scared to sell at 11 a half yes and no so from one perspective i don't really want to sell snap at 11 and a2 but from another perspective this is a dollar away i would make $1 per share and then i would also collect $49 of income so i'm going to go ahead and do this on all 37 my shares wow the bid ask spread is awful this is a very bit bad bid ask spread very bad now this is not good i cannot sell the november 1st this $49.99 is really bad so i'm going to go for and that's also because it's an 11 half strike it's not it's not as popular so i'm going to go for a january 17 2025 covered call so here the bid ask is 78 and 113 that's better and here it's 113 146 not bad this is a really high income i'm not going to sell all 37 my contracts i'm just going to go go for 17 which is basically like a two grand return and i'm going to go for 1 point 1.2 i'm trying to be quick with this video and not waste time so i'm going to go for 1.2 but just so you understand i could go for 1.25 and likely get filled for more but for the purposes of this video i want to make it quick so i just kind of lost myself $5 time 17 which is like $85 so hope you leave me a like and a subscribe for that but it would have been smarter if i would have went for like a higher limit price but doesn't matter uh i just collected some income about $2,040 on snap by doing a covered call so yeah it's very good to sell covered calls for income and the average cost doesn't always really matter well what i did was i sold 17 of my 37 contracts okay i had 3,700 shares of snapchat but i only sold 17 covered calls this is something i learned from goldman sachs because even goldman sachs would implement this strategy with folks that would come in with large single stock exposure there's many ceos when i was working at goldman sachs that came in with you know millions and millions of dollars of their own stock and what we did was we can't really predict their stock so we're looking to hedge so we're looking to hedge their position we're looking to create income but we also don't want to sell all their stock right because they do want some upside so what you would do is if you have a big position in tesla a big position in pounds here a big position in whatever stock that you have right you can sell a portion of covered calls on your position not the entire amount so what i did for snapchat was i collected a ton of premium i got a ton of upside and because snapchat i was completely right has overshot and done very very well the momentum has been good um i'm still making money on the shares themselves and covered calls without having to lose all my shares and with the 17 contracts that i sold i collected a lot of premium so i want you to start implementing that in your trading as well if you're not really certain and you're scared of losing your shares you can either go higher on the delta or just go 30 delta but sell a portion of contracts on your entire position all right tip number three last tip of this video and the most important tip i think this one is going to make you a lot of money it's going to flood your pockets with money and make you stupid rich okay tip three is rolling rolling is a topic that i'm about to cover a lot more on this youtube channel because i've been covering rolling a lot in my one-on-one coaching a lot of my one-onone students they already have the skills of covered calls they already have the skills of selling puts so when they come to me they say henry i've already learned everything from you from youtube your content is number one and i'm already very profitable but the thing is there is still some more improvement that i always get from one-on-one students when it comes to rolling when it comes to margin trading when it comes to taxes and there's just little nuances that can make a really really big difference i'm a big fan of paying for coaching myself and i recently paid u my coach $20,000 just to help me with a little thing in my business and it's improved like my business so much i've had so much better customer experience in my discord community from a little improvement and i paid him $20,000 for a 1-hour session basically little things i'm a big fan of this cu i've seen it firsthand little things it seems crazy i paid 20 grand but i got the result that i was personally looking for right so it's crazy but little things can make such a huge difference rolling is that little thing that i think will make a complete difference in your covered call strategy hands down 100% rolling has saved me in bad positions rolling has helped me in good positions rolling has helped me with taxes rolling has literally i one time i had a loss um i think it was during co with tesla i was trading tesla very heavily and i made a lot of money i went from 100k to 700k during covid times um and i just kept rolling tesla higher and higher because i did do covered calls on tesla and they would hit the money right because tesla was a very high momentum stock back in 2021 um so i did do a lot of rolling myself and it has been a complete game changer so look this is going to be an analogy that i want you to understand first of all sticking on the 30 delta is the most important still okay when it comes to rolling before you get to rolling you still want to optimally set up into a position which is around 30 delta now let me explain how rolling would work and i'll give you an example i wrote here in my notes stick on the 30 delta like a football player okay when you try to stick to the wide receiver right if you watch football i don't that much but the wide receiver once once he gets separation from the defender he's wide open right when he's wide open you can pass him the ball and that's it it's game over right the wide receiver is the fastest like the fastest on the team right so when someone is not sticking to the wide receiver and they gain separation from the defender they become a wideopen target for the quarterback right quarterback throws them the ball it's game over right they uh they can score on that right so same thing with option trading you when there's separation there's a prime opportunity to pass right and it's clear for the receiver well the same thing with the 30 delta okay as you get to 50 delta you are no longer you you have separation now now the wide receiver is going to score on you okay sticking to that 30 delta means that you're sticking to that wide receiver he doesn't have an opportunity to catch the ball because you're sticking to him like a like freaking glue okay that's kind of how i view 30 delta okay before you even get to rolling i'll tell you rolling but before you even get to rolling stick to a good delta to begin with and then you'll have to roll less if you do have to roll i would typically roll out let me show you an example how i would roll out okay let's go to well tesla already i don't have current shares of tesla so let's look for a position in my portfolio that i can roll out right now i don't roll put options ever i only roll covered calls for the most part here we go we have amazon this is a really good example all right this is going to be really good we've made a ton of money on amazon amazon has gone up a lot i have the 195 covered call amazon's currently at 196 okay so it's 196 and i'm currently down on my option this option is actually going to expire pretty soon in like uh in like a week 61 delta that's not good guys because right now i'm not being i'm not being a good defender i'm not sticking to the wide receiver the wide receiver right now is wide open and he's like yo i'm going to take your shares i'm i'mma take you to the cleaners this is mine this is mine now this is mine now it's my game right i don't want it to be like that because i don't want to lose amazon hey i don't want to pay taxes on the gains i definitely don't want to pay tax on the gains because i have good gains on amazon i've been putting my discord members in amazon for for quite some time as well as nvidia paler and all the other tech stuff right we've been killing it not even going to boast right now because this video would be like 20 more minutes i have actually like 100 testimonials i'm going to share some student testimonials soon so make sure you're subscribed to the channel let's stick to the point let me not ramble here amazon i don't want to lose the shares i really don't want to lose the shares right now i would have to pay taxes and what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back to a 30 delta because right now the wide receiver is open and the ball is already flying towards him right the guys the person that has this 195 call is already thinking i'm going to be exercising i'm going to be taking these shares away from uncle henry all right i don't want that to happen right the ball's in midair i better speed up and intercept this ball that's about to hit the wide receiver here's what i'm going to do i'm going to go to roll this position and actually uh it's 8:30 so the market is not open but i'll show you what i would do i always make these videos in the morning um before i do my coaching sessions live so 195 covered call i'm simply going to go out 30 30 days one expiration i'm going to go from november and i'm going to go to december guys really easy really simple i'm just moving from one month to the next month no crazy amount of time no long wait and very lowrisk um very lowrisk roll so here we go i'm going to go up to 200 okay so actually let me take a look the delta here is 0.5 so actually this would not be my definition of sticking to the wide receiver very heavily but this is this would be in my opinion but this would still intercept that ball right because this would be above the current price of amazon i'm going from 195 which is in the money wide receiver is about to get that ball to to 200 no i'm going to intercept that ball and there's nothing to exercise because 196 is below 200 so i can easily move to 200 here so i can go from 195 to 200 that means that um i'm going to move up by $5 10 contracts and actually because of the 35 days which options have a lot of value because of time i'm actually going to collect a net credit of $12 per contract or you know since each contract's 100 shares i'm going to make $11,000 by rolling this higher so i'm literally getting the benefit of going from 195 to 200 and i get paid for that it honestly doesn't even make any sense but it's feels like it's too good to be true but it's not it's because time equals money and options make money off of time so this right here is the best tip that i have for you if you want to improve your covered call strategy not lose your your shares not pay taxes and basically intercept that uh that ball going to the wide receiver if you appreciate my analogies and some of my humor here make sure that you are subscribed to the channel and also check out this strategy right here where i talked about the momentum wheel strategy a strategy that i made up using covered calls and selling puts to just generate consistent weekly and monthly

2024-11-07,xiiWMo2sfqc,"kind: captions language: en i'm going to show you exactly how to make safe consistent and totally passive income this video is long because i want to give you everything that you need provided stepbystep examples answers to most common questions my students have asked me about this strategy and i've made millions of dollars using the same tools over the last few years and i made this video so you can to so you can copy my logic my thought process and make it happen for yourself i respect your time all right let's get started the wheel strategy is a powerful and systemic approach to option trading that aims to generate safe consistent and passive income at its core this strategy involves just selling puts and selling calls by the end of this course you'll understand how to implement the wheel strategy effectively using step-by-step examples from a to z with research-backed answers and studies the wheel strategy is not just about generating income it's a comprehensive approach that helps investors navigate the complexities of option trading i think it's the number one strategy ever because it creates income safely and it's very easy to implement i love the simplicity now let's talk about stock selection for the wheel because stock selecting is the most crucial part the wheel won't save you if you pick the wrong stocks but the wheel will generate a lot of income if you pick the right stocks the stocks you select is crucial for running the wheel strategy picking the wrong stock in trading is like buying a cl classic car without checking under the hood you see the shiny exterior it looks amazing it's all the dreams that you ever hop for you imagine cruising down the road but when you turn the key it doesn't start although i can make a course on stock selection alone and i might if i get enough comments and subscribes i'm going to keep it simple the most important is to pick a stock that's growing in value that has a market cap of $10 billion or more and has option volume of over 100 for a typical day at least when you look at an option around price of the stock either on calls or puts volume is essential because the liquidity and the volume that you see is exactly what you can trade if there's no volume you're not going to get a good price if you were to trade an option the wheel is run on companies that you like no exception this is the hardest rule of this entire course you must run the wheel on companies that you like because the wheel is a bullish strategy now let's talk about market conditions let's start off with the bullish market the ideal scenario in a rising market the wheel strategy thrives as stocks are more likely to appreciate in value selling cash secured puts can result in profitable assignments while covered calls can generate significant income as the stock price climbs so in an ideal situation we have a bull market and here's what the actions look like look for high quality stocks with strong upward momentum to maximize returns that's apple that's nvidia that's sofi that's paler that's many many stocks as long as it has an upward trend the wheel strategy is going to be good and practically anything that is rising is a good company to invest in as is but running the wheel strategy will help help you get a more optimal price we'll talk about optimal entry and strikes and all that good stuff later on in the course now let's talk about the ideal scenario for um the wheel strategy in a sideways market okay because we have sideways market we just don't get a whole bunch of upwards action we don't get downwards action we're just kind of kind of teeter tottering to the sideway i personally call this a range-bound market where stock prices fluctuate within a divine range selling puts allows you to collect premiums while selling covered calls can generate income even if the stock doesn't move significantly it's actually what i love about the wheel strategy is you can make money in sideways market you're unaffected completely unaffected because the premium that you collect actually benefits when the stock doesn't do anything so here's the action choose stocks that are stable and exhibit less volatility making it easier to profit from premium collection without facing a drastic price movement that's exactly what you should be doing when the market is range bound now let's talk about low to moderate volatility when the market is not really moving too much so not a bare market not a bull market just low to much volatility here's the ideal scenario the strategy benefits from low to moderate implied volatility so it allows you to sell options at a reasonable premium while avoiding the pitfalls of rapid price swings so when there is a market with low volatility that's perfectly okay higher premiums are available during earning seasons so you can capitalize on that or significant news events but consistent volatility is actually very good for the wheel strategy in many ways cu the premium goes up in a low volatility environment you're going to collect less income because options are more valuable with higher implied volatility volatility is low well you can still run the wheel strategy you just will make bit lower returns now here's the action monitor market conditions and avoid initiating positions during periods of excessive volatility but also avoid opening when there's no volatility at all when there's no volatility at all and it's very low it actually makes sense to buy options in general obviously this is a course in the wheel strategy but i'll just say not all situations you want to use the wheel strategy i would say in 90% of the cases wheel strategy is good but hey when volatility is really low you're going to make less money and in many cases may make sense to just buy options now let's talk about fundamentally strong stocks and running the wheel strategy on them so here's the ideal scenario focus on companies with strong fundamentals including solid earnings healthy balance sheets and positive growth prospects this provides a safety net when executing the wheel strategy as fundamentally sound stocks are basically the best stocks that you want to be in because they're unlikely to experience a drastic decline in the weakness of the wheel strategy is if there is a drastic decline so here's action conduct thorough research to identify stocks that are not only fit for the wheel strategy but also have strong fundamental metrics companies that in the last 12 months have not really experienced a draw down of more than 10 to 15% find stocks that have a little bit lower volatility but seem to um possess that strong upward momentum so find stocks that basically make sense for you know low volatility environments now let's talk about the most interesting part market corrections or dips this is something that everyone fears okay market crashes dips pullbacks corrections here's the ideal scenario during market corrections or dips consider implementing the wheel strategy to capitalize on undervalued stocks so for example i would look at stocks that are around the 52 we low that have been beaten down a stock that is not an all-time high that's the most important thing also you want to look for low price earnings ratios so if the price that earnings ratio for example historically has been 20 and now it's 17 fantastic you're looking for undervalued stocks okay that's the ideal scenario in a market crash because market crashes affect all stocks but they affect growth stocks more than value stocks so since the wheel strategy is essentially selling puts to get in and covered calls to get out selling cash secured puts allows you to potentially actually acquire quality stocks at a discount so even during a market crash you know i have studies here from goldman sachs that i' that i've read over and over um from different papers different articles across not just goldman sachs where i used to work but other banks and um the research shows over and over that selling puts on high quality companies is lower volatility than than the stock market it's than the s&amp;p 500 in fact this wouldn't be an invest with henry video if i didn't show my portfolio my results and some real stuff here so look at this this is a covered call strategy risk versus return from 1996 to 2022 now this is a source from goldman sachs global investment research as of march 17 2023 check it out so on the left hand side you have total annual uh return and then on the the bottom axis right so there's a y- axis and there's an um an x- axis on the x-axis you'll see standard deviation standard deviation is just another word for vola so you can see here how on the very right hand side you have s&amp;p 500 which has you know 18% um standard deviation and about 9% return well covered calls which is part of the wheel strategy as we will discuss shortly possess way lower risk way lower risk than the s&amp;p 500 so already you guys know that very few people can beat index funds very few people year-over-year beat index funds including the biggest best professionals the wheel strategy as you can see is safer than the s&amp;p 500 also % out of the money covered calls which we will talk about it's not only safer it's higher return so this right here is proof that option selling is better than s&amp;p 500 the facts are very clear so i'm also going to be using my portfolio and going over real examples in this video so you're going to learn a lot now here's the action identify strong companies that are temporarily down in price and consider selling puts at the 52 we low or the bottom of the bowling your band which we will talk about in our technical analysis portion of this video so here is the steps to running the wheel strategy i'm going to show you some live examples in my portfolio my portfolio is at $3.6 million i've grown this portfolio from very small amount and it's taken me a lot of time but it's been a very good journey so here's the first steps i'm going to go step by step and then we'll continue the course with explaining why i'm making these steps how i'm making these steps and the best ways to manage and close these type of positions so first of all i'm running this wheel strategy on a lot of stuff on apple right now any cell put that you see is is the wheel strategy and covered calls are also the wheel strategy so i'm selling puts on apple so i'm starting the wheel strategy there and american airlines here i'm actually finishing the wheel strategy by selling covered calls i'm about to get out of the stock at $11 running the wheel strategy on google which is one of my favorite stocks on nvidia i made a lot of money on nvidia on paypal and on tesla i have different uh positions as well but let's start off from scratch okay let's take a look at a stock and try to find something that will make sense for us to essentially start the wheel strategy on so i've got yahoo finance open i'm going to go through some of my stocks here you know what let's go for google okay i think google is a good uh stock pick because it's not yeah it's not near its all-time high it's not even close not even close it was at over $190 per share back in in july and as we approach december here in november um you'll notice that the stock is down a lot but it's also not at 52 we low i think right here that it was oversold it also went way below the bowling band next now we've had a lot of stability so this is a sideways market well it's it's a bullish market but this is sideways action for google and i would say that it would be good to sell a put at the bottom of the binger band as i mentioned the bottom right here looks like it's around h if i scroll if i scroll in here it looks like it's around just over 160 okay so this is just over 160 around $1 161 per share so if i wanted to get optimal entry and start the wheel strategy on google i would simply just sell a put option at probably around 161 okay and um if you sell it at 161 this gives you an optimal entry much better than the current price of the stock so i'm slightly down the stock it is what it is so if i go to sell put and i go to so by the way we'll talk about expiration days and and strike selection and everything like that in this course and i'll go into great detail but let's just first off start off with a 30-day option so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pick an expiration day that's around 30 days out and then if i sell something like the 165 here the delta 042 you can see here how the premium is actually really really good so in one month i'm making over 3% return and i'll talk about strike selection here this is a a highish delta i'll talk about the different deltas that you can use in strike selection but this is just an example like if you sell a put at 165 here you collect really good income and from there on we'll talk about managing and everything like that but um once you have a stock if you do get a sign then you just sell covered calls so two parts of the wheel strategy selling puts to get in and selling covered calls to basically generate income when you do get assigned and i'll talk about a to z in just a moment so let's talk a little bit about strike selection a secret about strike selection in the wheel strategy is to choose strikes based on implied volatility rather than just price levels high iv which is high implied volatility increases the premiums that you collect allowing you to target strikes further outs of the money options okay outs of the money options are safer okay the further out it is the safer which is why i would do the wheel strategy on something like nvidia so if i type up nvidia you will see that if i were to go for an option on nvidia we're going to make more money than the example that i just showed you on google so if i go to trade nvidia sellp put okay i'll go 30 days out november 29 and if i you can see here how it's it's less the strike price is less yet the premiums are or or way more so at 135 the premium here is is $7 and that's all essentially due to the implied volatility so the higher implied volatility you can go out of the money more and get the same returns so i was showing you 580 here i can go all the way down to 132 and uh i can still collect uh the same premium and this is obviously putting less money to work than the example i just showed you on google which was in the 160s this is in the 130s so it's a very big difference and picking um options based on implied volatility is is a very lucrative tip so out ofth the money options give you higher probability of keeping premium without actually getting assigned the goldman sachs article that i read during my time there by the way um pointing out four different cheat codes when it comes to strike selection so i remember this article like it was yesterday when i was working at goldman sachs what i would do is i would i had a portal and i would research every single article that i could so i spent a lot of time there uh just understanding options and teaching myself even though i was a financial analyst so let's just talk about the four cheat codes okay out of the money delta expiration date and implied volatility all right let's go over each one so in a recent note and this is by the way this is directly from goldman sachs john marshall john marshall is the head of derivatives so the head of derivatives research at goldman sachs revealed the results of a long-term study analyzing the effectiveness of a variety of option trading strategies and one strategy that produced profits for investors for over two decades this strategy was overwriting which is a term goldman sachs uses for covered calls and although the rest of the options community mainly refers to overwriting as covered calls i'll refer to as overwriting just for this article purpose but then we'll go back to callon and covered calls so overwriting is when an investor writes a call option against a stock that they own in the hopes that the option won't get exercised and expire worthless if it does then they get to collect a premium and limit any losses and if it doesn't well then they still get to collect a profit so after studying the results of various overriding strategies over a variety of time periods john marshall and his colleagues found that the most overriding strategies result in higher sharp ratios than simply buying and holding stocks however only one strategy has been in the market for the last 18 years and they have estimated okay let me show this study again this was just part of the study i have a few that i went over we estimate that selling 10% out of the money one month covered calls on stocks with liquid options in the s&amp;p 500 generated a compounded annual return of 12% since 2003 outperforming s&amp;p 500 total by about 1% annually john marshall wrote the most interesting thing is you can also see here that in this um goldman sachs global investment research from 1996 to 2022 on my screen that 10% out of the money covered call strategy was more lucrative and less risk than the s&amp;p 500 so obviously covered calls are part of the wheel strategy and we're discussing that portion but it's part of the wheel right so part of the wheel is getting assigned and then being able to essentially generate income and when you go 10% out of the money it's facts it's proof that 1996 to 2022 is higher return with less risk so it is the best of both worlds and now give you a little bit of takeaways from the analysis all these covered call strategies have better risk adjusted returns sharp ratio than underlying benchmark so running options strategies whether it's selling puts covered calls or the wheel they p their parts of the wheel is better than just holding etfs so when people tell me oh options are risky they're not if you know what you're doing they're not risky they're safer than stocks so a cover call strategy reduces the volatility of the portfolio and the magnitude of of this reduction is a function of the premium is written basically the amount of money that you make it gives it it's the cushion it's the reduced volatility in other words an at the money strategy brings in more premium than out of the money strategy and therefore reduces volatility by a greater amount so this is true for covered calls okay the wheel strategy sell puts covered calls the sell puts portion the lower the delta the safer the covered calls portion the higher the delta delta the safer because on a cell put a lower delta means that it's further out of the money it's far away so your chance of getting a signed or low for a covered call a higher delta means that it's likelier to get assigned but it's lower risk it's not not lower risk of getting assigned lower portfolio risk okay because we're looking at overall volatility and overall volatility going for say i have 100 shares of nvidia all right to properly hedge and get the most value to increase my sharp ratio the most most to increase the premium the most i would go for at the money so it's at 140 i would sell a 140 i get 590 here see how the further up i go the lower the premium becomes it's because the chances of nvidia going up higher are lower than the chances of nvidia being at the current price it is right at 140 or above so the more it has to rise i mean the less chance it'll it'll do that so investors obviously know that and that's why the premium here is is more for an in the money or at the money option of 140 so going for an the money option is going to produce a better sharp ratio our sharp ratio or the sharp ratio is a measure used to evaluate the risk adjusted return of an investment all right in simple terms it helps you understand how much extra return you're getting for the risk that you take this is just one study by goldman sachs which i remember reading and there was a several studies here that i've went through and the sharp ratio is a very important metric it helps you understand how much extra return you're getting for the risk that you're taking i mean that's that's what what you should care about so to summarize the long research report they recommend going out out of the money by about 10% this is very simplistic and i will go into much more detail than this throughout many examples i cover in this course the key takeaway you should have is selling out of the money options both on puts and calls is more profitable and better it's more safe and consistent than buying options or going closer to the money so again for selling puts going out of the money is better and for covered calls going out of the money will give you a bigger return cuz you have more upside but going closer to the money gives you more cushion so it depends how you want to look at risk i personally go for a 30 delta on both okay i found the sweet spot to be around 30 delta for selling both puts and covered calls for the wheel strategy but of course in this course we will talk about going higher and lower on the deltas and more in the more advanced section as an option coach i prioritize risk management in my teachings which sets me apart from many others in the industry while many focus solely on chasing profits i believe that understanding risk is essential for anyone looking to generate safe passive income into retirement by incorporating the sharp ratio i'm trying to give us the optimal return for the level of risk that we take after all there's no point in making huge money that you basically get but you don't really get to keep or that's inconsistent inconsistent returns don't compare to stable returns i take pride in using data from my past 10 years of experience to make better decisions when it comes to expiration dates i will stick very hard to one month option time frames this is for multiple reasons i mentioned high iv increases the premium that you collect allowing you to target strikes forther out of the money options which gives you a higher probability of keeping the premium without getting assigned so there's a couple factors here one factor is getting premium the other factor is you don't always want to get ass signed when you sell puts you don't mind getting assigned but when you do covered cuse you might not want to lose your shares well beyond one or two months implied volatility is actually lower and more smooth because it negates random events that means in the short term options can be a bit more pricey because more events or things can affect the price so the volatility is higher but over a long period of time like 2 months 3 months 6 months options have much smoother implied volatility so it really depends on your goals what you want to accomplish but let's say that you want safety and passive income and consistency which is what i teach i prefer just one or two month options now look it's really important to also understand that when you sell a put option you don't mind at all to get assigned but when selling a covered call you may want to be very smart about your strike selection because from one perspective you got a stock that you like and then the covered call you generate income but you may not want to lose your shares because if you lose your shares a it's a taxable event you have to pay taxes on the gains which could be fine if you're okay with that i mean if you made money you made money fair enough but also you might not have another idea to reinvest the money or redeploy the money into so sometimes better to roll the position higher which we'll talk about later in this course as well taking that covered call option that you initially sold and bringing it up to a higher price and also looking at two month expirations the reason why you get paid up front i think this is the best idea ever if you do two-month expirations the market participation often expects a lot of extreme volatility especially in the volatile stocks but as time progresses the influence of short-term news and and events and diminishes uh leading to a more normalized perception of risk so the option can go for quite a good amount of money in one or two months but in one or two months the stock may end up doing nothing which is fantastic for the wheel strategy because again stability is good volatility is fine as well and both scenarios the the wheel is so versatile that it really benefits from just time as time progresses the influence of short-term events and news goes away theta which is the time decay which is one of the greeks the most important greeks are delta and theta delta is basically going to look at the options sensitivity to price movements and it also takes a look at the chances that the option will expire in the money so if you sell a 140 so going back to my screen here if i sell a 145 covered call on nvidia the chances that it's going to be 145 is about 35% 34.9 3% that's because delta it's a sensitivity of the option but also basically explains the chances that the option will um end up going to that price that 145 price in this example so delta is very important to look at and theta as an option seller and the wheel is essentially selling puts and covered calls you greatly benefit from the passage of time as time goes theta kicks in and theta continues every single day from day one until the last day but it really kicks in towards that end of the 30-day mark and really starts to eat up the option value which as an option seller is good because when you sell the option let's say you sell it for 400 in this example hey and in 15 days if it's it could be worth a 100 so you could have made $300 and in half the time hey at that point it could make sense to close out this position and take profit i mean it's never really an issue to take profit i do hold until expiration we'll talk about that but i know if you can make 34s of the option and like half of the time time or or less then it makes sense to close out that option position so if you look at the 3 to 6mth option they have lower returns and lower implied volatility on the other hand short-term options like one week out i typically refer to as uh this is a new term i'm going to call it a disrespectful option i'm making it more dramatic and calling it a disrespectful option but i'm being serious because short-term options they don't really provide that much more income and they take up a lot of time so they take away your most precious asset in life which is time so it takes four times the amount of of management of weekly options as it does monthly options for little to no benefit that's why when i u work with my one-on-one students you know who are busy professionals doctors lawyers engineers nurses etc and they tell me about weekly trading i say no it's better just to do better just to do monthly trading because a weekly trading is four times the work but i mean it's like would you rather two grand than in one week or would you rather 7,900 in in a month i mean i get it you can make a little bit more more money trading weekly but the the added money that you make which is so little doesn't really compensate you for the four times the management so in my opinion is not worth it now with that being said i'm going to jump into my portfolio right now and we're going to actually make some live trades we're going to see how much money i can make today it's actually a very cool day because i have some capital here and the market is about open just open right now it's 9:30 a.m. as i'm making this video so let's go into my trading portion here i'm going to go through my portfolio and my trades all right so um if i go to my account i'm going to just check out how much cash i do have available 413,000 okay and i have a decent amount here as well i am using some margin already so i have to be careful i'm going to probably put to use 100k or so right now in the wheel strategy all right so i'm going to show you both sides i'm going to start off the wheel strategy here by selling puts which is step one we'll talk about that so the first thing i i do is i just take a look at my watch list i'm looking for any detractors because for me obviously running the wheel the put option i want to sell a stock near to 52 we low or a stock that's kind of found really good support and stability actually tesla might be a really good one because tesla has recently um fallen down you can see here tesla back in september october was almost 250 now it's at 29 so what i'm going to do is and i already have a 200 cell put here but you know i i still i still like this stock a lot so i'm going to start off the wheel strategy by selling a put option so like i said one month out is a good expiration for a put up to two months is fine as well so i'm going to actually do december 20 sell put you know what i can actually do a january 17 since this is a course and you probably were watching this in the future i want it to be as relevant as possible but you know if you're watching this in 2025 then you know the same logic in thought process obviously applies option training doesn't change much so as long as you know how to think about it i mean yeah a lot of good stuff can happen and this information is ageless it's timeless so i'm going to go for something like the 200 here expanding it you can see that the delta is 0. 29 i did tell you that my sweet spot is 30 delta 30 delta just means that i'm going to win about 7 out of 10 times and you know 29 or 30% of the time i'm going to get assigned which you know it's fine with me so this is going to be a 20k trade essentially i'm going to sell the 1190 click continue and um said i wanted to put 100k to work i'm going to do two contracts here i can even do i'm just going to do three contracts yes i'm going to do three contracts but again you could do one contract or whatever is comfortable for you um for the purpose of this video i'm not going to play around with bid ask spread i don't want to waste time so i submitted this trade and i got filled so i actually just collected 3,000 uh $3,586 191 so i just collected that and i start off the wheel strategy here by selling a put option on tesla again looking for that entry into tesla at $200 per share it's currently at$ 220 so i'm giving myself essentially 10% discount hey now i want you to check out this interview with one of my students this is going to be extremely helpful just start off with how's how's things going like how's your trading it's going good i uh i've been trading options and i've worked for a prop firm and whatnot and just could never really get that final missing piece and so since i joined the discord and just got that last bit of confirmation on trades or even just of uh refining my strategy it's been going really well and you know i make back my profits pretty quick now awesome so yeah awesome i am making a wheel strategy video so you'll be featured in the video i just wanted to know if you can give people advice on how the wheel has been going for you what are the deltas that you're picking what are the strike prices and just having a conversation around how we go about the full process of the wheel yeah i mean essentially it usually comes out to about a 30 delta if i'm just selling a put and usually i'm still looking at technical analysis maybe if it's something like palante tier you i just sold the 36 strike today for two weeks out um even though it just pumped a bunch which uh i'm not too worried about it's just such a good stock if i have to buy it at 36 i'm not going to be mad so i don't worry as much for a stock like paler um but one of the other trades that you had in the discord was the american airlines and basically when it was close to $11 i was more than happy to sell the puts there i don't even know what deltas they were but it was pretty close but i knew that that support was so strong that i didn't worry about it at all awesome i know we're trading a lot of american airlines and palance here um what do you think why do you think we're successful on those trades i want to get your perspective from you know the student perspective i i don't know exactly what you guys do on your end but it seems like there's a lot more research than people just going in going hey i'm going to sell the 30 delta uh just no matter what the technical analysis is no matter if there's earnings but essentially for me i usually look at that a trade like that and when i first saw american airlines in the discord i just looked at it and pretty much every reason that was posted in discord made sense to me i just wanted to confirm it myself uh just do my own due diligence and then i'm essentially just extremely comfortable with the trade go through the math i go okay this is how much i'm expected to make and then i i always

2024-11-08,BMI4rXieiuY,"kind: captions language: en elon musk made a big bet on tesla and it's creating a huge opportunity for investors if you think politics and business isn't mixed you're absolutely crazy and elon musk did the unthinkable which is going to pay off big for tesla what's even more crazy is how much money we're going to make on tesla and to set us up i want you to quickly watch this clip of dan ies and what he had to say does that change that number look i mean i think this it's a strategic bet that musk made that ultim could pay dividends for tesla in a huge way for the coming years i think $40 to $50 per share it adds just for beginners not just because of what could happen from a tax credit perspective i think leveling you playing field you take out the detroit automakers and then that's really going to give them an advantage from a cost scale and scool perspective biden the big thing here trump could ultimately fasttrack autonomous fsd and our whole view as we've talked about in the show trillion doll hours evaluation just on ai alone this is going to unlock it that's a key makes a lot of sense is there no scenario in which relations with china take a big hit and musk is asked to pick a side is in a sense yeah and and i think that so on the other side especially it's not just for for tesla also apple as well for musk i think there's a comfort in him being in this situation that he could almost be a pseudo sort of you know ambass call a 10% politician 90% ceo in terms of making sure that the retaliatory or the carve out i think that's going to be important the carve out piece from a tariff perspective and i think one of the reasons that you see nvidia up today you see semi you look at apple despite some fears about what we're going to see on tariffs there's a view maybe with mus there bar could be a little worse than the bite when it comes to tariffs specifically on ai and i think that's really right now what's what's key not just to to ab but to the broader tax you you started off by saying you think this could materially help tesla having him in the white house how what what sort of regulations are we watching so i think there's three things uh one is that the ev tax credits get taken away and i think that even though negative for ev sector bullish for tesla because of their scale and scope so from from a price perspec for detroit though potentially bad for detroit bad for of course bad for gm bad for cover as well which and and my view going into this was like that was a potential risk but i think mary and the team have kind of pulled back a little so it's not like they've bet it all on evs so i think one is going to be that where they get an advantage two and i think probably most important is this autonomous fs state because when you think about cyber cab and everything we've talked about 26 could that be 25 now s of trump clears the path there this changes the whole paradigm i i think for are those regulatory authorities that oversee full self-driving federal in nature all right guys so look we're going to be looking at my notes and i'm going to be opening up my portfolio and we're going to take a look at tesla stock because as you can see i'm up $79,000 on tesla and i am not playing options at the moment but i am thinking to start opening up a few different positions so listen up the first thing that i want to say is elon musk has a strategic bet on donald trump right he was a big trump supporter this is very very interesting and now that trump has won the election this is going to be a really bullish setup for tesla and i think tesla was going to be a $500 stock in the not so distant future okay let me explain what's going to happen and how i'm basically going to capitalize on this look the first thing is trump will help tesla because ev tax credits will be taken away now from one perspective you're like eevee tax credits will be taken away that's bad for tesla isn't it no it's actually not bad for tesla so i was doing a lot of research and i'll tell you why tesla is more vertically integrated than many other auto manufacturers producing its own batteries producing its own software and producing its own components this integration reduces cost it improves margins and allows tesla to weather the impact of losing tax credits better than competitors guys this is a relative game people have to buy cars they're going to be buying cars so when a company like tesla is vertically integrated and they basically make everything within themselves and they're not reliant on other suppliers that is a really big deal because what what's going to happen is when tax credits get taken away other manufacturers are going to suffer a lot more their margins will be a lot lower or negative potentially meaning they can't hire a good talent and if they can't hire a good talent tesla is going to win tesla's already won right but they're going to win harder in relation to competitors and as that happens the brand's going to increase the quality is going to increase and most important economies of scale let me talk a little bit about economies of scale because during my college education i was finance analytics and econom the thing is with economies of scale what that means is when you produce one good right just one time it's really really expensive because well let's say that you're producing a car you have to buy the whole you know the whole manufacturing plant and and all these employees right if you would sell one car the one car would cost you like a billion dollars right but if you would have a billion cars sold then the cost goes down because your fixed cost like you know the employees the lights etc it gets covered by a huge amount of volume okay the more volume a company does the better because they have better unit economics unit economics means that it's cheaper to produce each vehicle so if tesla were to produce let's say a million vehicles it might cost them $50,000 right per vehicle but now if they produce 10 times more vehicles it's 10 million vehicles maybe instead of $50,000 now it'll only cost $30,000 per vehicle so their profit margin actually increases not decreases it actually increases from having more volume okay so that's the biggest cost and scale advantage that tesla is going to have and under the trump administration i think we're going to see a lot of advantages for tesla another one is uh trump supports us-based manufacturing which i highly agree with as an american why would you want china to have all of the money manufacturing and their economy booming why don't we have it in our own country where our own plants are designing manufacturing and we have our own suppliers within united states that way the money stays within united states stes so i think that's going to be really interesting for tesla as well and i think a lot of people are going to start realizing that this is a very dire time for america right america is in a very critical point and things are getting a lot worse and now is the time to basically have america turn things around we really need to turn things around right so when it comes to elon musk he understands that so he made a huge bet and i think this is going to be reflected in tesla i think tesla is going to reflect the good times we're going to experience right now in the economy and again i'm not trying to predict market and i don't have a political side i don't i could care less i'm just trying to put the most amount of money in your pocket and i am also trying to scale my portfolio past $4 million so right now you can see that tesla is at $297 we're almost at $300 per share and my average cost is $218 i've been making money hand over fist with tesla like literally hand over fist bicep over tricep on tesla because i saw the writing on the wall okay when i looked at tesla's chart when i looked at their business i was is really bullish for the election i already had a feeling right who's going to win based on social media and looking at tesla i think that tesla is going to continue to rise and that's actually why i don't currently have any covered calls on tesla you guys know on this channel i'm a big proponent of running the wheel strategy right selling puts and covered calls i've been talking about the wheel strategy for basically 4 and a half years now all right i think that tesla is actually not a good wheel strategy right now because the momentum is so hot you should be jumping in with some leap options with some buy and call options or just holding stock which is what i've been doing now look before i give you this play one more thing about elon musk elon musk is 90% ceo as we saw that dan i said and he's basically 10% politician all right elon is a genius and dan ies basically said that the stock was going to be $300 shortterm well hello we're already at $300 in the short term so the next stop is basically going to be $500 per share for tesla and in my opinion $500 is actually going to happen a lot sooner than you even think and the last thing is the ai all right i think that ai is going to play a huge component for tesla and tesla is going to dominate because the ai story right now we've seen it with nvidia we've seen it with a lot of other stocks in the market ai is going to be a big contributor to tesla so let's jump into my portfolio let me tell you what i'm going to do with tesla right now i have uh 1,000 shares in this portfolio and the these are two plays that i gave out to my discord community um but they're basically going to expire worthless right i sold 200 puts and 220 puts tesla is nowhere near this tesla is around 300 so what i think would be a smart move right now is a couple of different strategies okay the first one would be to sell puts look you want to sell puts on tesla to get in however it's not it's not necessarily cheap so what i would do is i would go out to an expiration like december 20th okay and then i'm going to try to get tesla at around 260 all right so the delta here is 0.2 let me explain how this is really unique all right typically my sweet spot delta is 30 but for tesla right now i would go for around 20 you can see that the volume here is 5,000 contracts have been traded and the open interest is is 10,000 so the trading volume is really really huge on the strike price right now 260 i think is a is a no-brainer right cuz if tesla's at 300 if it pulls back 10% we're still going to be at 270 per share this is 260 strike price so literally nothing happens if if tesla goes down you're fine if tesla goes up you're fine if tesla goes sideways you're fine that's actually why all right i don't want to i don't want to open up pandora's box right now but i'm actually selling puts on tesla my other portfolio on margin so straight up i have more tesla than i can afford to buy in my other portfolio at 260 all right now how you should play this is if you have cash don't go as extreme as me i'm a i'm a professional i've been doing this for a long time a decade all right take it easy if you're a beginner or you're an intermediate or even if you have a big portfolio have some experience regardless i would recommend right now that you take a close look at the 260 and sell puts to basically get into the company all right what you want to do is you want to acquire shares of tesla if possible at a cheaper price however if you also want aggressive income and you're not super bullish on tesla what you can also do is you can purchase tesla stock you can buy 100 shares and then you can sell a covered call option at the $300 strike as tesla opens up here in the next you know i'm making this video in the morning so if tesla opens up higher let's say it's above 300 i would go for the most aggressive close the money covered call now when i say aggressive that doesn't mean that it's risky i'm saying aggressive in terms of income generation so i'm looking at selling a covered call option at tesla to begin the position now me personally doesn't make sense because i have owned tesla for such a long time i've been recommending it in my discord community for a couple of months now so i'm just going to keep riding my shares higher so you have three choices you can sell puts to get in at 260 you can um buy some shares of stock and ride it okay or you can do aggressive covered calls for aggressive income and i really call it safe income because a covered call is going to have less volatility and margin of safety versus buying the stock so i would recommend that you be either on the sellp put side where you're acquiring the stock or the covered call side where you're getting aggressive income versus the middle point which is just buying stock now one more thing i want to mention is i would be buying leap options absolutely i would be buying leap options right now and i've showed leap options many times on this channel but i'll show you one more time so i'm going to go to september uh 19 2025 you can go buy call option now the whole point of a leap option is you want to buy something in the money to get that upside exposure now tesla options are expensive they're not cheap so they're expensive but this strategy still saves you a lot of money so versus buying 100 shares at uh you know 297 which is going to be 30 grand you can still buy a call option for $8,600 so it's still an expensive strategy but you know the strategy is a little bit better than just than just having shares so i would buy let's say for example you can well that would be a lot so let me go for five contracts i i would buy something like five contracts and just ride tesla higher now if you want to uh lower your cost per um contract here you can also sell covered calls against it or even run a bull call spread okay let me show you what a bull call spread would look like or actually let me show you the poor man's covered call first so let's go to january 17 and if i were to sell a call option since i think we're headed to $500 per share in the somewhat future i can't predict when right i'm not a genie guys i'm not going to pretend to know what the market's going to do but i am bullish so i'm going to sell the 350 for example and here you will see that i am reducing my cost by $1,100 so this 350 covered call on the leap would basically be $11 that would subsidize my cost against the $8,600 so my new cost would basically be $7,500 which would be pretty advantageous now another strategy that you can use is you can sell a call option for the same expiration so i can go for september 19 as as well and you know i don't know if tesla will reach 500 by you know next 9 months or next one year so it might reach $400 so you can just sell something like the 400 and you can instantly basically get $3,000 off so now your total cost would be $5,500 as you can see your your total max profit here would be pretty pretty sizable to be honest you can make a really big uh a really large amount of money here by um essentially buying a bull call spread you can also run the wheel strategy on tesla i have recently just made a course on the wheel strategy it is the best course that you can possibly watch i have two different testimonials in that video i know it's a long video but i highly encourage you if you want to get good at option trading you must check out this video right here sit down take some notes and do your best to at least go through half because i guarantee you it will change the way you look at the wheel strategy and it let you acquire stocks for a cheaper

2024-11-09,X_65DAMIzPE,"kind: captions language: en i used two option strategies to make $36,988 per per month now guys check it out my portfolio i made over 8% in the past month and i'm running very safe very good passive income strategies and the number one i'm going to cover is going to be my wheel strategy this has been something that i've been covering for a number of years now and i'm specifically going to go over every single position from american airlines to amazon to tesla to chipotle to nvidia to starbucks to sofi more nvidia more palen here more sofi more target walmart apple and so much more in this video so this is going to be a raw video where it's unscripted and i'm just going to bring you the best of the best knowledge that i can possibly give you so you can level up your option trading because this stuff is no jokers some real stuff that has made crazy money like in the past month i'm able to buy lamborghini even if you have a 50k portfolio 100k portfolio if you can make 8% per month and you start compounding that over the long term especially if you're playing some of the higher volatility names like tesla and nvidia you're going to grow your wealth like crazy you're going to eventually be able to not have to work a 925 job you're going to be able to have a lot more freedom you're going to be able to have more money that is just passively entering your account you can put put 5 10 tech $20,000 in your account even if you don't have a million doll portfolio so look $316,000 a lot of this came from tesla which i've made 100k to 700k in 2021 a lot of people i don't want to say they doubt me but even when i get one comment that says i'm not sure if that's true oh i just want to prove it wrong because i've been trading tesla and tesla and nvidia right now are the top stock hands down i've made so many videos on palante here guys i've gotten crazy results we've literally just had a $3 million account and now i'm almost at 4 million i thought that this would happen in january or february of next year but given what happened with the election you can also see what i did on tesla in yesterday's video when i posted yesterday uh about tesla what i'm doing we're actually about to hit $4 million all right so look the the strategy that i'm using right now is the wheel all right so you can see that i sold a put option these are my expirations for 11:15 all right these are all the trades that i put out in discord by the way in discord here's how it works i have monday and wednesday sessions for 45 minutes i trade live and i give all of my plays and i make sure to answer questions go over technical analysis and i just give plays so others can copy they can watch me and copy but then others can also ask questions then i also have a one-on-one coaching program which includes discord that program i'm very focused on because i run i used to run boot camps and a lot of my competitors run boot camps because i've trained my competitors all the other option youtubers are my students for the most part so now what i'm doing is i'm giving a higher level of service and actually doing one-on-one coaching to scale folks from 50 or 100k into the multiple six figures that's what i'm focused on right now that's where i found the best results so if you have a 50k portfolio or more and you want one-on-one coaching i would love to help you scale and get up to 8% maybe even 10% because the times that we're in right now there's a lot of money to be made so don't leave money on the table go ahead click the first link in the description and you can learn more and just schedule a free consultation learn more about my coaching and see if it's a fit for you it has to be a fit both ways because it's one-on-one coaching there is limited spots i only have so much time in the day but i do have more spots as i continue to have more successful students that pump out i have new spots that are opening up so go ahead and see if there's some spots and click the first link in the description all right so american airlines 11 put 13 put all right i'm selling puts on american airlines because i'm running the wheel strategy amazon selling puts cuz i'm running the wheel strategy more amazon 182 put this made $2,000 this made $1,500 $100 amazon covered call this one i will have to roll up okay so uh as soon as monday comes and i typically record my videos in the morning like yesterday tesla it was crazy yesterday since i'm in europe i was recording tesla in the morning right i i bought tesla at 200 actually let me show you instead of telling you guys instead of talking i'm the youtuber that shows real results right i don't want to tell you i want to show you so uh i have tesla 218 per share and now i'm up i'm up $100,000 that's crazy that's insane so i have it at 218 and yesterday when i was recording the video it was literally at 297 and then boom like it ended up 320 for the day so it seems like my videos are late but they're not they're just in the mornings right before the market opens up i do my research and i spend like 2 hours in the morning just to research stocks and then you know as the market opens up i typically don't trade the first 30 minutes so i had a uh pretty good video actually in the past i'll link it down below it was essentially that in the first 30 minutes of the market i typically like to wait and see what would happen because if the market's up in the first 30 minutes it's typically going to finish the day up and if it's down it's typically going to finish the day down there typically is a skew effect so if it's down a little bit it's going to continue to go down a bit if it's up it's going to continue to go up a bit so i do find a little bit of an advantage there although i'm not a market timer i do my best to find good timing right so i wouldn't say that i time the market but after the first 30 minutes then i try to make a clear decision and that's why i coaching that to 10:30 a.m. live because after that first hour i have a pretty good sense of what's what's going to happen during the day right it's really unlikely that if the market goes down 1% by the way that it's going to go down another 1% so on a red day although there is a skew i i base it off intuition because if i see the market is down 1% i really highly doubt that it's going to be down another 1% therefore on a 1% down day i do sell more put options i go a little bit more aggressive right i just put a little bit more a little bit more force into that so i can um get a little bit more exposure ure all right so the next stock uh so this one i will i will roll on monday so as soon as monday opens up i'm going to be rolling higher um because very typically i do roll my covered calls i do not roll my sell puts though all right so the chipotle 55 cell put made $8,000 okay i've been bullish on chipotle chipotle reported not so good earnings and a lot of people were also again doubting me because their mindset is incorrect hey chipotle went down that's a bad play no chipot went down and it's a good play i made $88,000 because when you sell out of money options the stock can still go down as long as it doesn't hit your strike price you're safe right you're completely safe so on chipotle i made $88,000 that was beautiful on chipotle i have a covered call so guys i'm i'm doing the covered strangle strategy all right i'll have to point you in the right direction on my channel again actually have a lot of really good playlists guys you have to check out my playlist i put the best videos in my playlist and i have uh a lot of different videos that you should watch out one of them is the covered strangle strategy this is essentially where i'm selling puts and covered calls at the same time this is kind of of a modification of the wheel right i specialize in the wheel i've been teaching the wheel for 4 and a2 years now since i basically got on youtube in 2020 and i started you know goldman sachs all that other stuff that i usually mention i started back in 2014 2014 so it's been it's been quite some time chipotle i'm doing coverage strangles okay i'm selling puts and covered calls and it's been working out beautifully i don't need a whole lot of volatility to make a lot of money chipotle uh sellp put 55 and 60 covered call now this is expiring but for you guys out here in the youtube community that you're not in my discord that's fine just go ahead and sell a 55 put for december 20th and then also sell a covered call uh at 60 for december 20th and then you can run the coverage strangle strategy as well and to be honest that's probably what i'm going to do on monday anyways so there's a trade for you guys you know if i ramble on you ever get upset at me for that there you go there's a trade i hope i've provided enough value now for you to probably make a couple thousand do on that trade i would do like five contracts on sell putut and five contracts on the covered call covered call means that you have to buy 100 shares so yes you need 100 shares to run that strategy now next uh hood right so i made 520 on hood um i'll actually have to look at hood one more time on uh closer to monday morning because basically i'm bullish on hood they actually have this new robin hood legend feature which i'm not using personally uh because for my coaching i prefer to just keep it really simple robin hood legend i don't i don't feel like using it but i i do think it's a good advantage because there's a lot of folks that first of all robin hood has kind of bad customer service so you can't really reach them which is something that's a really big issue with my students um but for the most part i think it's a really good platform so you know that's why i invested a little bit in selling puts i did not get a signed but we'll see if i do nvidia i have 130 puts 129 puts made 2 grand 6 grand um a lot of my games obviously are from tesla like 100k okay my one week produced all the returns so that's crazy but but uh yeah my one month return 8.8% and and tesla's a oneir of my results so hey nothing wrong with that uh kind of like the 820 rule you guys heard the parto principle right so 80% of the action sorry 20% of the action gets 80% of the results hey nothing wrong with that that's how life works so yeah onethird of my results are from tesla and back in 2021 like 50% of my results were on tesla hey it doesn't matter only the results matter guys that's also why i don't charge monthly or anything like that for my discord community it's because i am the best option coach i've taught all the others i've been at this for the longest and because of my results i charge accordingly for my time because my time is very valuable because i do get results and there's a high demand for coaching it's all about the pto principle guys i heard about this saying right if you want something fast if you want it high quality and then you want it um correct then you have to give up one of the other three right i don't know if i'm saying that quote correctly right but you can't have something fast and good right like cooking good food takes time and if it's fast it's probably not going to be like the highest quality right so there's a trade-off right so that's that's kind of my reasoning there now look uh there's also paypal paypal i've been killing it i've been honestly i've been killing it on paypal let me show you paypal real quick guys i think you should follow my place you should follow what i'm doing i get a lot of students that come to me hey what do you think about smci i'm like bro please stop watching the other youtubers they don't have degrees and anyone that talks about smci or anyone that talks about their students who have a high win rate are clearly scamming or at best just marketing their programs and courses guys don't go for lowquality companies stick to the highquality companies ideally just stick to uncle henry's youtube channel because i'm looking at other information out there and it's ridiculous i see a whole bunch of nonsense going around that looks like it's a good idea but it's not a good idea guys keep it simple run just the wheel run coverage strangle strategy honestly stick to nvidia stick to tesla stick to paler okay and then also watch watch some of the stocks that i covered because they're not so popular but i i've like literally destroyed it like $35,000 on paypal let me show you walmart because walmart has been like a shocker for people people think people don't click on videos that aren't like the hottest sexiest stocks they don't they just don't click on the video because they're they have confirmation bias which i covered in my psychology course it is super important guys if you want to actually be a good trader i'm going to link a video at the end of this video about my psychology course not many of you watched it but it's literally a gamechanger one thing is confirmation bias in a bull market you look like a genius but when the market pulls back you're going to you're going to punch yourself in the face for not actually watching my psychological video because something like a walmart will outperform something like a you know a paler or or one of the other higher flying stocks you got to hedge you got to properly have diversification and you have to realize that some of the stocks that i cover that aren't the sexiest stock it's because i'm trying to help you guys right it's not just about views for me this video that i'm making right now is highly not optimized for the youtube algorithm like the other youtubers who just cover one stock over over over again i'm giving you guys a different type of content right now that's going to hurt me and views but because it helps you i actually want you to get really good results and i need you to realize that something like walmart which i'm up $197,000 on has to be in your portfolio you can't just be in three stocks or five stock you actually have to i'm going to list you the stocks that you have to have walmart being one of them walmart is a crazy good play i'm up $197,000 okay i have some 85 covered calls which is right about to hit the money right so i'm probably going to have to roll that but i'm going to give you a few more plays okay another one is going to be sofi sofi is fantastic starbucks guys starbucks we made a ton of money after the dip and now it's coming back up all right i'm going to give you a few more stocks right now because i need you to be properly diversified i hate it when people just have a concentration of the stupid stocks or some of the bad stocks that other youtubers push right i i can't understand that you should be in google in microsoft i would take it easy on meta right now meta is a little bit high another stupid stock in my opinion mara okay this is just my opinion guys bitcoin is okay all right if you want if you want bitcoin exposure just buy bitcoin stop it with the mara stop it with the riot these stocks up today maybe tomorrow they're going to crash and like look one of the stocks coinbase i'm not a super fan of coinbase either right i'm not a fan of betting on a brokerage i'm more of a fan if you want the asset buy the asset okay same thing with like gold versus gold miners just buy gold i would not be making individualized bets on these little brokerages right really risky also um i might be adding airbnb cuz it fell a lot but you guys need to have 10 to 15 stocks i know i say that but look at your portfolio actually look at your portfolio do you have 10 to 15 stocks and is each position no more than 20% because i'm telling you right now we're in good times guys i get it we're in good times everyone that gives me a call you know we do one-on-one coaching it's easy right now my life's easy because everyone's getting results but how about the bad times we have to also think is there going to be a market crash because we are at all-time highs s s&amp;p 500 is at over 6,000 i'm bullish on the economy but that doesn't change that we have to pay attention to risk management all right we do have to pay attention to risk management now i also look at some companies like hs i have a small position there my other portfolio uh shop is really good as well and uh craft hinds is good for my double dividend strategy now something i do recommend bigger portfolios is if you have 100k 200k 300k etc and you're getting closer to retirement it's really smart to be an exxon mobile it's really smart to be in craft hind all right let me show you what xon mobile looks like i don't currently have a position because i've been a little bit more aggressive lately um making 8% returns per month and trying to get my portfol to 4 uh 400k 4 million um but on exxon mobile i think this is a really good play right now because that has a good dividend and if you're running covered calls on exxon mobile i would literally go for 40 delta now i typically say 30 delta but for a company like exxon mobile you can go 40 delta because it really doesn't have a whole lot of upward movement like if you look at the past three months this stock is just three % up so imagine doing a 40 delta covered call where you collect 3 or 4% on the covered call and the stock goes up three three or 4% um but you don't get your shares taken away so look that's a really easy strategy because 90 days out you sell a covered call stock goes up 3% and your covered call you know is 3 or 4% that's a 7% return in 3 months i mean i don't know about you but 7% on really safe company that just goes up and you can do that repeatedly consistent ly stable right 7 or 8% in 3 months right 8% 8% 8% four times is going to be compounded a little bit more than 32% right because it's it's compound so let's just call it about 35% look 35% return is more than a majority of investors it's more than wall street it's more than s&amp;p 500 safely like are you kidding me that is a really good strategy to have a portion of your portfolio in and then obviously the other portion is the stocks that i cover the higher implied volatility stocks that have huge high momentum and those strategies can make you know more four 4% a month is typically what i go after like look 8% per month 88.8% per month is what i did this month but like i'm not going to promise that right because the worst thing is when i give too high of an expectation a student joins and then they don't have a good experience like that that's bad right so i'm always trying to um under promise and overd deliver so that's why i say 4% although i have many months that are over 4% i don't want to promise cuz obviously i can't guarantee that right we're we're working with the market here guys we have to use logic and and there is fluctuations but look if you can have a portion of your portfolio making for 5% per month and then the other safe portion of your portfolio making you know 30% per year you're going to get 40% per year return which new slash warren buffet gets 20% so i'm literally uh doubling one of the best investors and that's why you know i go with safe as possible i i take some aggressive but smart calculated decisions that's what it's all about and that's how in the last month i made

2024-11-10,k2WVXt8U01g,"kind: captions language: en when i was at goldman sachs the number one mistake i saw that other option professional traders were making was taking big losses when they didn't have to so in this video i'm going to show you exactly how to never lose money on a trade ever again rolling can be the difference between a profitable option trader and a loser and i want to show you with examples how you can save losing positions with rolling options rolling has been absolutely a game cher in my portfolio and i'm going to show you how to roll different positions using live examples so right now i want to show you how i would roll american airlines to make more money so look first of all what is rolling rolling is basically adjusting your position from one strike in one expiration to another strike in another expiration think of it as a way to fix a position completely manipulate it and change it into something else that is more beneficial for you rolling is actually a very easy strategy and most brokers actually allow you to do it in one click in either way even if you can't do it in one click all rolling is is closing one position and replacing it for another so let me show you what that would look like on american airlines right now i have american airlines at you know it's $13.90 i have an average cost of $12.89 i'm running covered calls i'm selling puts let's focus on the covered call right here this is a 13 covered call now this 13 covered call is in the money so if i want to make more money on this position i need to roll it that's because when a covered call is in the money you technically no longer have shares because i will be losing my shares a covered call that's in the money means that someone else is going to take these shares from me closer to expiration so as we get to expiration i'm going to be losing these shares so what i'm going to do is i'm going to roll this position close out this position and open up a new one robin hood lets you do that in one click so i'm going to go to roll this position and i'm going to go to a future expiration i'm going to pick an expiration date let's say jan january 17 or i can even go out further it doesn't really matter all you need to know is that you're rolling usually out okay outs meaning more time so if you're in january you go for february if you're in february you go for march if you're in september you go for october you're always probably going out about 30 to 90 days okay adding more time creates value because options are really based on time time is a huge component actually i can show you how much of a component time is so you see there's a 13 call here and if i go to another 13 call i haven't changed anything with the strike price however i'm collecting here $910 which is a lot of money on a small position and you can see here that the time change is 105 days so by moving out 105 days i'm collecting $910 on a essentially a position that's around $113,000 that's 1,000 on 13,000 that's like 8% return in 100 days which granted is not huge money but it just points the picture that time is money when it comes to options okay now because time is money when it comes to options you can easily fix an option and correct a mistake or correct an option being in the money by moving higher so for example here you will see that i can move american airlines higher from 13 to 14 by rolling this trade and it'll go from 106 i will have to close it for 106 right but the new position which i'm selling which is the 14 covered call is only uh well it's not only it's giving me 143 so this 143 is more than this 106 and because the 143 is more than the 106 i have a net credit so i'm collecting $370 i'm getting paid to roll this position higher okay that is the first example of a covered call i can also show you what rolling a put option looks like so i'm going to look at uh chipotle uh put option because chipotle did report earnings and it is slightly down and i am a little bit in the money so let me show you what rolling this 56 put would look like and trotle is barely in the money but let's say for whatever reason um you think the stock is going to continue going down and you want to protect yourself and uh go a little bit lower on the strike price okay so again you can just close out this position so i'm going to close out the 56 put option i'm going to look for new expiration dates expiration date that i typically go for 30 days out 36 days out 45 days out any of that is fine all you're looking to do is you're looking to add time because time is money so when you add uh time essentially you are getting um you're getting paid for that right so that's why it's beneficial all right so you can go for let's just say we're going to go for the december 20th expiration right now if i were to go from 56 down to 50 you'll see that here this would cost money because it is too extreme of a roll it's going from 56 to 50 which is just a little bit too high um instead what you would want to do is you would want to be less severe in the amount that you're going down so you can go from 56 to 54 and you'll get a total credit you'll get a credit of $170 you know that's fantastic because you're getting paid and you're reducing your risk and you're going down so on a sell put you want to go down right so we're going to go down from 56 now to 54 whereas in the covered call we're going up right so why why does it work that way well we're going down to reduce risk from 56 to 54 so now if if we get a signed well we won't get a sign right cuz 54 is lower than the current price of the stock which is at uh $554 as i'm making this video so this is very different on a sell put you want you want to move down on a covered call you want to move up so you can make more money and and just rolling in general will make you a lot more money and also save you a lot of money i can't tell you how many times i've seen traders that could have completely fixed their position um by just rolling the trade now most of the time they do but i i've seen some big mistakes when i was working on wall street because one of my jobs i was actually involved in risk management in the pit when i say pit i mean the new york stock exchange pit the trading floor right i was watching how brokers uh r ran around and the traders were trading i can see their p&amp;l you know sometimes you get really big blowups in a stock and you can fix a lot of that you can fix a pretty big move medium move right if the move is really big it can be very hard to roll i'll try to show you some examples right now actually but you can fix almost all positions let me try to find my biggest loser i don't really have i don't really have a lot of i don't have any losers at the moment actually that are like big enough to be very significant so let's go through an example on actually you know what let me show you an example of making more money on a roll so for example here nvidia i i'm actually going to place this trade here i have nvidia which is basically flat and this position expires in december but let's just say for example that i wanted more exposure into nvidia and i'm like well i sold the 128 put but you know i think nvidia i'd be happy to own it at 130 let me show you what that would look like if you go to roll this position all right and i go from uh the december 20th to let's say yeah let's just say january sure if i roll up to 130 you will see here that i collect $2,400 in net credit so i'm becoming more aggressive i'm taking on a higher risk but i'm i'm okay with that right so adjusting and rolling means that you can fix the strike price you can change it it's manipulatable or or malleable right so so you can go from 128 to 130 i can increase my position here from 128 to 130 no contracts the contracts are not changing i'm only simply changing the strike price and um because of this and because of the time i'm increasing my my total credit here by $2,400 which is really really amazing so you can also roll up your uh sell put now i've showed you three examples three different examples let me also show you a fourth different example this fourth different example would be basically taking a covered call lower okay so if the stock fell you can also take a covered call lower so for example if i have now i rarely do this but let's say that starbucks for example uh we can use starbucks well this would be an in the money covered call so this would be an example of you do not want to roll it down this would be pointless to roll down uh since it's already in the money but you can roll this up so i can go to roll this position and i can take this position from november 15 to let's say again i'm going to roll it out to december which is about a month and i can go from um this each of these examples is going to be very unique so i can go from 95 to 100 okay the net debit here would be 138 but pay attention because here i'm moving up by $5 which is a significant move it's going to cost me $138 however i literally get $240 more upside why starbucks is at 9740 my cover call is at 95 it's $240 in the money so if i roll up to 100 i immediately get $2.40 more of a value i'm paying 138 to get a guaranteed well basically a guaranteed $2.40 now so this is an absolute no-brainer i'm paying 138 to make 240 and i get upside right i get a lot of upside i get upside because you know still starbucks is not $100 as i'm making this video so that means that the st starbucks can go up to 100 i would make even more money so i'm getting the intrinsic value of starbucks how much it's in the money right now from 95 to 9740 and i still get more upside to 100 this is a no-brainer this gives me $5 of potential upside and i'm spending $138 so this would be a debit roll nothing wrong with the debit roll absolutely nothing wrong with the debit roll because i'm paying $138 to essentially get $5 of upside $240 of it is already realized so this would be a fantastic return this would be absolute nob brainer return this is exactly what i do all the time in my portfolio all right guys now what i want to show you is actually me rolling more live examples i'm actually going to be rolling more trades in my portfolio okay so right now you'll see i'm going to look for trades where i'm either um i want to make more money all right so what i'm actually going to roll right now is the paler 31 put so i've made a ton of money on paler already pound here is down today this 31 put has already made me a ton of money there is $200 left to it but i would rather have a lot more risk on palen here right now and i can make a higher return by rolling this higher so i'm going to go to roll this position and i'm going to go from 11:15 and i can simply go to like december 20th here and i can roll up from 31 to say 35 so this will actually give me a net credit of $11,000 and i'm going to lock in the gains that i already had on palance here so i'm going to lock this in i'm going to go for $1 here review this trade and submit now it is telling me collateral 4,000 because i have moved up in my cost basis and the strike price has moved up so i'm going to have to put up a little bit more collateral but that's not that much uh collateral there if you ask me same thing with tesla tesla i've made money so i can actually close out this trade and open up a new one or i can just kind of roll this option up so i'm going to lean on rolling this option up because you see i'm up 91% um so i made most of my money so i'm going to actually take profits earlier and i'm going to roll up this trade from the current price of 200 up so i'm going to go to roll this position and we're going to go from november 15 and i will go for again i'm going to roll out by the traditional expiration so i usually go for uh the traditional expiration which is the third friday of the month okay so i'm going to go from 200 and i'm going to roll up to let's see i'm actually going to go up probably to let's see the 220 has a 18 delta still nice and low really good volume open interest is 11,935 so i really like that the implied volatility is fantastic and the the bid ask is really really good so this trade right here will just net me a lot more money i'm going to net $ 25 $45 here so that looks really good to me so let's go for $5 and uh eight $5 uh so this is going to be like $58 per contract with five contracts boom there we go that's tesla which is beautiful i collected some really good money rolling tesla there so so far we've probably somewhere in the in the couple thousand range but potentially let's also do let's also do square so check it out square right now i've sold a put option at 67.2 it is showing a loss so i wouldn't actually need to roll this since uh it's still out of the money this is not at risk so there needs to be no roll there another position i may want to roll is target so let's take a look at target right now this is the 160 call now i don't think target is going to reach 160 so therefore i'm actually going to roll this covered call lower i do have a really good gain on target of $20,000 and i have the 160 call here right so on seven contracts so i'm actually going to roll this down so i can make some more money so i'm going to roll this position and because the stock doesn't have much returns i can actually go for the same expiration date as well so i can go for the same expiration date i can go from 160 down to 155 so this would be an interesting role right here because you don't have to actually change the expiration date you can change just the strike price so i can move from 160 down to 155 because it's not really looking like targets having any big moves so i can roll roll this down so i can click continue and i can roll my six cont seven contracts down to 1 point uh let's go for 1.6 just so i can get filled quickly i could definitely go for 1.65 but i respect your guys time perfect we got filled there so let's add that to how much money i made here on the bottom of the screen as well so these are just simple rolls these are just how much money you can make just cleaning up just rolling your portfolio just adjusting positions that you have here i have another paler so we can uh adjust palante here as well right now here we have paler here this position is slightly down hey i can i can create this down position into an up position right so i can go from november 15 to december 20th and look i can i can actually probably i can reduce my risk i can go down to 35 so i can go down to 35 reduce my risk and collect the total credit i think that's a no-brainer right there so i'm going to click continue i'm going to go for point uh 38 collected here review and submit and boom so we just collected some more premium i'll have on the bottom of the screen right here so yeah it's it's actually fantastic just to adjust and change your portfolio as needed as you see fit basically my my thought processes uh for each one it's it is an individual uh decision based on where i think the stock is going to go but it it's never bad to adjust with the stock so if the stock moves down you can also move your sell put down if the stock moves up you can move your covered calls up you're always kind of moving with the stock i do them every friday so my community i do monday and wednesday coaching live calls and on friday i do like just rolling and adjust doting so that is what i'm doing all the time um but you know sometimes you don't have to do it now also you can i know i have some google so let's go into google real quick i like having risk on google i have a couple google positions i actually ended up doing this position right here it is much more difficult to roll a poor man's covered call so for example actually let me show you what rolling a poor man's covered call would look like this is going to be really really interesting my poor man cover calls videos that i'll i'll leave at the end of the screen here but um at the end of this video mean or in the description but look right now i was right on google the stock shot up right so i made $3,630 and i just bought this position for $20,000 not that long ago right about 10 days ago as i'm making this video i bought a po man's covered call essentially because what i saw with google was i i thought google would go up with earnings so it did google had a pretty positive week of 6% higher so i ended up making about 20ish per so that's that's the beauty of options by the way option buying strategies i made really good income here on this uh poor man's covered call however since google is above 175 now just a little bit i can actually look at rolling this 175 call somewhere up right because it is going to be at a loss it's at a this the whole position is at a gain but it's because my leap option is actually it's it's made a lot of money so i can either decide to take profit here or i can roll this 175 call option up so yeah i'm going to probably roll oh i see so robin hood actually won't let me roll this in one transaction um i will just have to buy this to close so for example i can buy this to close and sell a new one okay so if i buy to close the 175 okay so i'll have to go for i have 10 contracts here so i can this will have to be two separate transactions okay nothing wrong with that so i'll have to buy the close at 10 so i'll go 9 i'll probably have to pay 9.9 for it or even 9.95 all right let's see if i get filled for this so i'll submit this and then i can sell a new contract here so there we go i just sold this sorry i just i just closed this so i actually just bought it back so i had to purchase it it cost me almost 10 grand but now i can sell a new position so if i go to view all options and i go to sell and i can now sell a new position so let's say i go january or february something like that and let's say that i want to sell for yeah for 180 okay so for 180 so now if i were to sell 10 contracts here i'm going to collect a credit of a little bit over $10,000 so i'm actually going to be making money yeah so if i wanted to go for like uh collect the income i can go for like 10 point let's let's you know go for 10.3 here i will collect about $10,300 so the difference here will will now be i've paid so we have to kind of adjust this there going to be a little bit of a difference here i paid the the previous amount and now i'm going to add $10,999 70 as i execute this trade so you can see here how profitable rolling can be and i'm only moving this option right here by 1 month and now i get myself up upside so i'm going from i went from 175 now to 180 by essentially executing this trade now actually i want you guys to learn a little bit more about rolling from some of my students in my discord community so check out this clip right here where i'm going to talk to one of my students and we're going to

2024-11-12,MMIw8uLZOH4,"kind: captions language: en hey guys here's my discord and in the past month we made over 8% returns so i've put out a lot of trades some of them being chipotle some of them being american airlines covered calls nvidia i've had a lot of trades actually on nvidia on google on apple on tesla lots of tesla some sofi more apple and today i've actually had a lot more trades on google amazon apple tesla and all the same names that i'm trading all the time so if you guys are interested in discord i post all my trades i have live coaching two times a week and i also do one-on-one coaching so if you're interested go ahead and click the first link in the description and you can learn about the black friday special in the holiday discount that i have going on right now for 2024 all right guys so i want to show you in this video how i'm selling put options on spy even if you have a smaller account i'm going to show you a cheat code on selling puts with smaller amounts of capital and raking in consistent cash flow so here's my portfolio by the way we're about to hit $4 million this has been a fantastic journey in 2024 and i'm about to make a lot more money guys i promise you now let's go into an example on spy because i want to show you this cheat code that i think is really going to help out some of the smaller portfolios but also this is a really good strategy for using even if you have a bigger portfolio now look first of all i do have a lot of shares of spy i've had spy in my portfolio for some time this is a very big diversified etf spy is one of the best because the expense ratio is super low and here's the top 10 holdings they have nvidia apple microsoft amazon meta alphabet broadcom birkshire hathway and tesla the expense ratio is 0.09 meaning 9 cents for every $10,000 that you invest so basically the expenses are non-existent this is a very cheap etf now look i'm going to go to trade spy options the spy strategy i'm going to show you right now is really good and easy for retirement now it's also really good for building up a small portfolio i would say that this is one of the best strategies period for running on spy so if you're going to be selling options on spy this would be the way to do it what you want to do is you want to go to sell put okay now i'm not going to just be selling a put i'm going to make another leg here so i'll show you what that means so first of all i'm going to pick an expiration day you guys already know that i like consistent monthly cash flow i'm not against weekly cash flow either but for this example i want to go for monthly cash flow now look if i were to sell a put option let's let's go to 590 right here let's check this out all right so this is a 31 delta if i were to sell this option right here it's going to be expensive it's going to be a whole lot of money now that is a problem right because not everyone has $58,000 laying around now i know spy it's simple it's easy it's fantastic for retirement but still what if you want to trade it with less capital well here's the thing here's what you can do let me tell you how i would modify this okay now first of all i do want to teach you a little bit about expiration how it works managing this strategy and i also need you to understand how to how to actually profit on the strategy consistently because that's the most important thing when you learn a new strategy you need to understand how to profit from it very consistently and properly close this option and manage it from you know from open to close it's very important because so many people enter into a position and they don't properly close the position that's why i want to talk about this up front because there's so many beginners by the way they make this issue by entering into a trade entering into a position and then not closing that trade on time okay or not getting enough profits just closing it out too soon all right so we're going to go to sell put all right like i said december 13 when it comes to expiration you can go for 30 days but you can also go a little bit shorter term i can show you actually a modified right now 14 days because that's going to be somewhere in that middle point okay between that one week and that 4-we period that's when time decay really kicks in so if you're looking to sell options for income and you know two weeks is also a very good uh expiration dat so i want to make money on the fear guys by the way i want to make money on fear and capitalize on that from the market so here's how it's going to work i'm going to go down i'm going to scroll down here i'm going to go for let's say i'm going to go for 590 okay the delta is going to be a little bit lower because the chances of spy going down to 590 um are going to be a little bit lower in this shorter amount of time right so if i sell this right here what i'm going to do is now i'm going to go to buy option okay i went to go sell put option now i'm going to go to buy a put option look i usually go for a $5 uh spread but you can also go for a little bit wider of a spread so in this example right now i'm going to go ahead and buy the 580 now look this is very important because if the market pulls back a position like this can get hurt so you need to understand how to manage it properly because i want you to make money on the fear i want you to capitalize on market volatility and on spy this is basically the only way to really squeeze out some big returns like right here you can see it's $126 all right that's how much i'm making and the capital that i have to put out is $874 so right here the return that i'm going to get is you know roughly 1/8 okay so the the percentage return is over 10% i'm well over 10% in 14 days so obviously if i were to do this two times a month it'd be over 20% and this would be an extremely high return so you have to understand why is it so high well the reason why is cu this is a put credit spread this is a po red spread position and you will benefit as long as spy stays above 590 okay if it stays above 590 591 or 595 or even if it spy goes up you will be in the green okay this is your green zone all right anything above 600 you're in the green anything uh under 600 you're still in the green right up until this point your break even point of 588 74 now look selling puts is a very basic strategy where you sell puts and collect money right that's pretty easy but the worst thing is when the stock ends up falling down on a put you get a sign well on a put credit spread it's it's pretty difficult because the way to manage this is if it goes down you need to actually close or roll okay you can't really get a sign assed on a put credit spread you don't want to get assigned because you don't really have the capital you don't want to put out the capital to buy 100 shares so this is a smaller account strategy where we're going to use a very small amount of money only about $800 uh to make a hundred or you know $126 now that's not so bad and the worst case scenario here is basically if spy ends up going lower if it ends up going to 590 this is when i would start to think about actually closing out this trade now look if i just wanted really safe and passive income i i would not actually pick the 590 i would actually go lower cuz look the lower that you go your premium will go down so if i go to 580 right here and i open this up your delta here is much lower okay it's 12 and the volume here is is also pretty good all right but this is going to be much safer because it's out of the money so if i sell the 580 and then i go ahead and buy the 570 the return here is lower okay it's going to be uh you know about 5% a little bit over 5% or so okay but this 5% is going to to be coming in about 2 weeks so it's still a 10% return per month now this trade is a lot safer because the delta is only2 so with the 12 delta that means there's a 12% chance of you actually having to close out this option or actually this 12% chance is actually spy hitting 580 okay there's a 12% chance that doesn't mean that it's going to be below 580 it's just it's just the chances of spy going down to 5 580 now what i would do in this scenario is most likely spy will not go down to 580 because that is significantly lower right that's $18 lower than the current price of where spy is at right now so this is a fairly safe put credit spread and spy is an expensive etf so this gives you the potential to get into spy for a much lower price and you can trade shorter term options and really have fun with it but also at the same time as having fun be profitable okay profit is the most important thing so if you can get in and get out within 4 days for a 5% profit i mean look if you add that up that's going to be a really huge return per year now of course it's going to be very difficult because you have to manage this perfectly if you want to be right you know every single twoe period some twoe periods you're going to have to manage this in a proper way because if you mismanage it right here's let's talk about the flip side of things if you mismanage it and it goes all the way down so in this example if spy goes down from you know to 570 you will end up losing the entire collateral here the entire capital that you put up of $950 and that's that's not something that you want to do you always want to manage this position in a way that if it hits your strike price that you think about closing the position or at least rolling down okay you can roll down and completely adjust this position and essentially manage it in a way that you do not you know have any of that risk right for the most part you can't control where spy is going but you can control when you get out of the position when you close this position because for me i would never want to lose the full amount uh because look if you if you make 50 bucks that's cool right you make it 10 times in a row but then you have one losing trade and wipes out all of your winners that's no good so uh what i would do is if this uh spy etf were to go down to 580 i would basically in 90% of cases i would immediately close in the other 10% of cases i would most likely roll this lower now i'll talk about rolling in just a minute but i also wanted to cover one more important thing the position sizing that you want to have is really crucial for your risk management because if you don't properly manage your risk that's essentially not going to be good overall portfolio management in general right when you're managing a portfolio of money your goal is to grow that portfolio um but it's it's actually to grow that portfolio at a reasonable risk level right anyone can grow their portfolio fast i have so many people that contact me and say i've made all this money in a short amount of time but then as soon as the market pulls back they end up losing all that money that's because they don't understand proper risk management they don't understand how to manage their position from from beginning to to entry to closing that position to rolling that position all of these factors are extremely important now i wouldn't really worry about making the maximum amount of money i would first worry about getting to profitability on a consistent basis consistent is 6 months in a row every month for 6 months you're over 10% a month on spreads that's consistency that's what i mean by having a consistent passive income not you know one month is 15% up and then the next month you're you're down or you or oh oh my goodness i've seen this happen some sometimes where big portfolios can blow up their entire big portfolio with credit spread you need to be really careful now look when it comes to rolling what i typically do is i will typically close out a spread and i'll open up a new new spread so let's say that spy goes down to 580 i will immediately close the position and i will go from 580 on the sellp put and the 570 byut i'll close both legs and i'll go down an immediate $10 i'll go lower because when i go lower that again gives me that safety and i can protect this $950 especially if some time has gone by look if if spy goes down slowly and slowly and slowly and we approach expiration you may actually still have a gain on the position if it goes down to 581 it's a little bit out of the i may say to myself hey i'm actually still up on this position let me once again create safety okay it's kind of like a balancing act when i'm trading options i am looking at the market and deciding for myself when will i roll when will i close this position for safety because safety and risk management is the most important thing it's like flying in an airplane you want to be very safe you want to make sure you get to your destination and if you have to be 30 minutes late but you're going to be safer that's the way to go okay same thing with driving a car i'd rather be you know slow and get to my end destination even if i'm a little bit late then you know putting myself in harm's way the same thing should be applied for your finance you want to use credit spreads to increase the value of your portfolio quickly but do so in a smart way and spy is one of the best because what i'm trying to do is i'm trying to make your journey to becoming wealthy and basically growing to a sixf figureure portfolio and a seven figure portfolio as efficient as possible with the least amount of pain because i've gone through the pain so now i'm here to share my journey and my knowledge with you on youtube so you can do the same so you can also grow but hopefully with less pain than i've had growing and look the options on spy they're just an absolute dream like check this out if i go to the expiration days look how many expiration days are there's zero days one day two day three day four day you know 7 day 8 9 10 11 the expirations here are an absolute dream the liquidity on spy is also a dream so when you're looking at expiration days they're actually not super important you can go for one week two weeks or one month all three of those options that i just gave you can be extremely lucrative and profitable as long as you're selling out of the- money options the options on spy are absolutely a dream and there's so many good factors about them like the choices but also the volume itself so look if i show you the volume it's 112 okay this is not even that typical of an expiration this is like a weird expiration day and still there's a lot of volume okay there's 112 volume here now if i were to go to let's say sell put i'm going to go to a different expiration day let's go to december 20th here you will notice that all these options here if i expand them there's a lot of volume 351 volume here there's 747 volume so the volume is really good because what that means is it is liquid and in the beginning of the video i've already said that you know liquidity is super important if you want to be consistent you need liquidity with the option like for example imagine trying to sell a luxury car versus a standard car it's much easier to sell a toyota fast versus a ferrari there's a lot of people in in the market and the price isn't so much right for a toyota but when it comes to like a ferrari it's it's much harder to sell because it's more luxury and niche well spy is like toyota everyone is trading it everyone is an spy so by jumping into spy you have a lot of volume you have a lot of liquidity there's always a buyer and there's always a seller and the bid ask okay that's really really important okay check out this bid ask this is top tier bid ask this is this is the top tier bid ask you can possibly ask for the bid is $683 and the ask is is uh $686 okay right now it's trading for a 2 c bid ask that is a super strong bid ask so this is really important because when you're looking to basically trade you want to analyze the option chain okay something that i always look for is i'm always looking through the option chain and i'm looking for the bid ask spread to be typ i'm looking for there to be solid volume like wow this right here has over 2,000 options traded just in one day okay and that's really important now the other thing i'm looking at is delta all right so delta gives me a really good sense of my profit zone so the lower delta is look the better because it's inversely correlated with your chance of profit okay meaning a 20 delta means there's an 80 chance of profit a 10 delta means there's a 90 chance of profit a5 delta would mean a 95 chance of profit so you really want to analyze the options on multiple levels and really take a look at the option chain for liquidity for volume for bid ask spread and you want to trade the put credit spread in a smart way because for me you know i have the sweet spot down when it comes to selling puts covered calls and my wheel strategy my wheel strategy i've been doing for almost like you know a decade now right i' i've been using the wheel for a decade but i'll be honest with you spreads is is something that i have been using but with a lot more volatility i just you know i don't even want to say it's myself just in general spread they have more volatility so there's a lot more opportunity but you want to be careful and you want to do it in the smartest way possible by managing your risk getting into the position properly managing that position from all the way from a to z until the end and then look i don't worry about early assignment but as soon as it hits the strike price at any time i am thinking about rolling because i'm looking to preserve as much capital as possible even though uh myself i'm only using spreads about 5% of my portfolio i'm still always trying to you know smartly manage that position because the worst thing that can happen is if you end up losing money on a spread you know it's not good because making back that money can be very difficult and i'm i'm all for the slow and steady approach to building wealth passively and just really scaling up from you know five to six figures in a reasonable amount of time then once you're at six figures that's when net worth really explodes i'd love to help you if you want some help scaling your portfolio feel free to hit that first link in the description i showed you discord

2024-11-13,pjUTGjhsajI,"kind: captions language: en elon musk just created a huge opportunity for tesla what's even crazier is how much more money there is still to be made in this wonderful company in this video i'm going to break down how you can still make more money on tesla given that we are now post election and with the federal reserve meeting this window of opportunity is closing so there isn't much time that we have here to still capitalize on this opportunity we can't afford to wait there's a setup that i really want you to get into so i'm not going to waste any of your time i respect your time let's jump right into it watch this quick clip on gan monster and what he said about tesla because this is going to be an absolute game cher if tesla gains 50% share of the us ride sharing market by 2030 which actually i think is is a reasonable target we'll save that discussion for another day but that would add about 20% to operating income and so stock's up 15% that adds 20% now they can take this in other parts of the world but a lot of it got priced in in a hurry i'm a big believer and what that means the one piece that maybe wasn't priced in today is that if they sell more robo taxis elon's talking about 2 to four million a year ultimately that' be about a third of total tesla deliveries i'll take the under on that i think it's probably closer to one to two but uh that's another piece so melissa to answer your question i think that this kind of fairly reflected or started to price in some of the robo taxi opportunity yeah and that's where analysts and and so many wall streeters got so bullish after that cyber cab event um that's where they sort of said you know the the market cap could be x y and z above what it is right now guys check it out tesla has been on an absolute tear and we need to talk about this i have 1,000 shares of tesla i made $121,000 in a really short amount of time on tesla stock and specifically i think that the market cap is going to reach $2 trillion now why do i think that well actually this is a thought from gan monster as well as many other investors on wall street they're looking at tesla and they're predicting that the stock will have a total market capitalization of 2 trillion right now tesla's at around 1.1 trillion so i'm going to be sharing my research with you and going down the list of what the opportunities are in tesla and what i'm specifically going to be doing with the stock because right now the stock i'm up $120,000 in a short amount of time a lot of my options right here are just put options i do not have covered calls i'm letting my shares completely run and that's been the best decision that i've made this year so far and i think there's still a lot more money that we can make here so look check it out a lot of this actually has to do with robo taxes which i want to cover as my long-term thesis but first i want to go over my short-term thesis because you might not have time to watch this whole video so let's just first give you the the whole blueprint the summary of the short-term thesis the short-term thesis is this elon musk is an active supporter and campaigner for trump in the election that equals power okay now that trump's in the white house and elon musk and trump are like buddy budddy that's going to be a very big uh benefit to tesla now i don't know to what extent but i'm telling you there is going to be influence and power and that's going to translate into some regulatory stuff that's going to translate into tesla stock having a really really good four years like i said elon musk will have influence over the white house and you know maybe this has nothing to do with the business of tesla but it's going to impact tesla indirectly all right now i also want to say that in trump we musk okay i saw that quot or comment somewhere and i thought it was really funny in trump we musk okay so given this relationship i think there going to be the best four years of tesla and also just looking at you know obviously politics are really important if you think politics don't play a huge role in making money you're absolutely out of your mind politics is money it's a business everything's a business doctor's a business everything's a business right politics is especially a business and i think politics is really important for tesla due to regul regulatory actions right as well as ev tax credits right ev tax credits have been a huge contributor to eveve adoption and they're going to be going away which i actually mentioned in my last tesla video before tesla was over $300 per share you can watch that video but just visiting my channel that ev tax credits are going to have a big impact on tesla now let me tell you because i've gotten a lot of questions and myself as a financial analyst i used to be a financial analyst on wall street let me tell you what i think about the valuation and because i've analyzed tesla's numbers and i think the valuation i have a lot of thoughts to it okay so here let me go down through my research this is from the research that i've done i spent a lot of hours on this all right tesla's forward pe ratio is jawdropping guys it's like its pe ratio is 100 that means for every dollar that they're earning you are paying 100 times to own this stock okay that is jaw-dropping numbers now look to put that into perspective look at nvidia nvidia is a fantastic growth stock right it's only at 39 times earnings and even giants like microsoft and amazon they also sit in p ratios of well below 50 okay the best companies in the world the fastest growing are below 50 teslas at 100 the valuation on just from the fronts right if you're just looking at it from the front view it's shocking it's alarming right i am concerned however let me point out something very important when it comes to tesla and how i made a lot of money and why i think there's still more room to run for the stock folks it's very simple all right this stock doesn't trade on fundamentals it trades on momentum which is something i've covered a lot on this channel and i've actually had my momentum wheel strategy which i think a lot of you guys saw my momentum wheel straty this stock is running on momentum okay momentum is the biggest force in the market it's kind of like gravity but the opposite right we're pulling up right now and we want to ride that momentum it's like a wave okay you don't have to have the biggest boat to benefit from a you know a wave the wave goes up you're all all rising boats there that quote right all tides all high tides rise boats right so this stock is going to continue to run and i think it's going to continue to run to $500 per share because of elon musk his campaign support and trump in the election which is going to equal power his influence over the white house to some degree i don't know to what degree right i'm not a predictor of politics i'm not even a political guy i could care less right i'm trying to put some money in your pocket i'm trying to gain more wealth i'm trying to do you know i'm not trying i'm the best option trading coach that's my goal right i don't care about so i don't know to what degree although i do think that there will be some influence there now i've talked about fundamentals because that's obviously what you know i've been doing on wall street for some time right i i wasn't on wall street for the longest time i didn't see a point i wanted to be investor as fast as possible if you want to make money the best way to make money is working for yourself and investing it's not working for someone else and it's not paying high taxes all right so look tesla i have sold put right now i'm letting my shares run i would say right now if you're thinking about jumping into tesla i would honestly aggressively sell put options because i am tempted to buy the stock as it goes to $500 per share in the next you know 2025 2026 but right now it makes a lot of sense to sell puts and i would aggressively sell puts so if i go to trade tesla options i would break all my rules because right now we want to ride momentum and there's two ways to ride momentum okay here's the first way first way i would just sell puts short term you can sell puts for next week and you can go for an aggressive put sell just to get just to acquire shares right now look unfortunately the big momentum spike has already happened right everyone has already made money i've made six figures and i have tesla two portfolios i made multiple six figures on tesla by not doing covered calls by simply just having the stock okay i decided that back when tesla was around 250 per share that there was enough momentum for me that i couldn't really ignore it what i thought about was tesla is going to have upside i don't know how much i did not feel comfortable selling covered calls therefore i actually bought back my covered call and i let my shares ride the same thing i've done for paler okay tesla and palante here are two stocks i've been absolutely 100% correct on and i've let both ride okay i'm super thankful because given election i was really bullish on on the results i i pretty much knew who was going to win and i thought that would be a bullish move which is why i've been telling you guys buy options actually lately do covered calls sell puts get 100% into the market that's what i've been saying right that's why we have so many students right now that are making like 8% 10% per month in fact here's a student actually that has been with me for a few months now and here's his results so far here to date i am up around $200,000 and i started my portfolio with around $90,000 at the beginning of this year i think that the most helpful thing has been the community the community the the the coaches being there to resolve my questions my doubts sometimes it can be a little scary at the beginning because you're talking about a lot lot of money so being behind people that already gone through uh those learning paths and are very willing to show you and share with you uh the their insight and their most important in strategies it's really really helpful so i did my homework before joining i almost joined another discord which at the end was a fake one or or not a a one with this kind of great leadership uh and so the other thing that i would say is there's a high roi on investing in this community i mean the the amount of knowledge and insight you will get from joining this community will very easily pay the investment you will make all right guys so look i'm going to sell puts at 330 all right i'm going to just hold on to my stock that's all i'm doing sell puts aggressively don't even worry about delta well the delta here is actually .3 so this actually goes according to my sweet spot i actually thought this would be a higher delta this is only3 so that's actually perfect go for 3.4 delta if you want to acquire tesla stock if you're already in tesla stock just let the shares run if you have covered calls roll those covered calls up okay watch the recent video i've had on rolling because you want to roll to make more money there's a lot of things to do with tesla there's just a whole lot of money to be made i can make this video super long but i'm trying to be as efficient as possible because i respect your time let me cover my long-term thesis i've told you my short-term thesis i've told you why i've told you how much i think is going to happen and i and i even gave you that fundamental breakdown now look you know this is this is my long-term thesis here so here's a long-term thesis i personally assume that tesla's going to have about 1 million robo taxis over the next 5 years okay over the next 5 years i think we're going to see driverless cars just driving us around okay that's scary and i kind of don't want to get into a driverless car but nonetheless economically it's going to happen right because not having a driver and having the car drive you means that a there's going to be a lot of people that want to get in on business are going to buy tesla like crazy and then b at the end of the day i mean people want to save money right unless you have money falling from the sky you want to probably save money right for the most part i think 90% of people or or or more right given the choice of a uh you know $45 ride with a with a person or a $27 ride with the tesla i think people are going to pick the $27 ride right because that is a decent amount of savings that's a whole lunch right there right so people are going to have free lunch i guess which in economics the principle of the first one of the first lessons of economics is there is no free lunch but i think because tesla literally has such lower costs it's going to actually provide like a free lunch in terms of like the cost savings that there's going to be a million robo taxis over the next 5 years and let's just say people are estimating $200,000 per year on these robo taxis let let me just say the low end we're going to have $100,000 so look 1 million robo taxis $100,000 per year that's going to be a $100 billion of revenue now tesla might achieve $40 net margin uh which i think is comparable to you know software like margins a lot of software companies do have 40% net margin all right and since tesla could earn both on the subscription of you know the tesla autonomous vehicle as well as you know other revenue streams i don't know all the revenue streams are going to have but i think it's going to be around 40% that would basically be you can see on the screen 100 billion revenue times 40% margin which is $40 billion in net income now a tech earnings right i was a tech analyst a tech future earnings or a forward earnings multiple right let's say that this is common in the market is 25 pe ratio tesla is at 100 right now me putting a 25 pe ratio is being very reasonable all right 40 billion time 25 pe ratio that's a $1 trillion valuation that is what i think will be added to tesla's valuation over the next 5 years but maybe that'll get realized sooner maybe that get realized later i'm not going to try to predict the stock at what when it'll do that it's just i know it will i don't know what time period exactly but i'm telling you in the next 12 24 months just like i predicted pal here just like my portfolios at you know is it's it's approaching $4 million actually let's take a look at my onee results cuz i they they were pretty good my onee results 5.9% just like i've been right on the money with so many options you can see all the options here i believe tesla will approach a $2 trillion valuation in the next couple of years and i think right now it's a really good time to ride the wave okay unfortunately you might have missed out on on a lot of the easy gains but i think there's still more gains to come so $500 per share on tesla i think very reasonable in the somewhat near future",MSFT;NVDA;TSLA,NVDA:OPEN;MSFT:OPEN;TSLA:OPEN,NVDA:INCREASE;MSFT:INCREASE;TSLA:INCREASE,ABNB:0.0519;ADBE:0.0003;COP:0.0001;CVX:0.0001;INTC:0.0026;KHC:0.0753;MPC:0.0001;OXY:0.0001;PLTR:0.0004;PSX:0.0001;PYPL:0.0812;SBUX:0.3141;SLB:0.0001;TGT:0.3141;WMB:0.0001;WMT:0.0797;XOM:0.0797,ABNB:0.0159;ADBE:0.0001;COP:0.0000;CVX:0.0000;INTC:0.0008;KHC:0.0230;MPC:0.0000;MSFT:0.2314;NVDA:0.2314;OXY:0.0000;PLTR:0.0001;PSX:0.0000;PYPL:0.0248;SBUX:0.0961;SLB:0.0000;TGT:0.0961;TSLA:0.2314;WMB:0.0000;WMT:0.0244;XOM:0.0244,AAPL:0.1099;ABNB:0.0138;ADBE:0.0009;AVGO:0.1099;BRK-B:0.1099;COP:0.0002;CVX:0.0002;GOOG:0.1099;GS:0.0520;INTC:0.0021;KHC:0.0138;MCD:0.0004;MPC:0.0002;MSFT:0.1099;MTCH:0.0009;NVDA:0.1099;OXY:0.0002;PLTR:0.0004;PSX:0.0002;PYPL:0.0138;SBUX:0.0520;SLB:0.0002;TGT:0.0520;TSLA:0.1099;WMB:0.0002;WMT:0.0138;XOM:0.0138,AAPL:0.0696;ABNB:0.0087;ADBE:0.0006;AVGO:0.0696;BRK-B:0.0696;COP:0.0001;CVX:0.0001;GOOG:0.0696;GS:0.0329;INTC:0.0013;KHC:0.0087;MCD:0.0003;MPC:0.0001;MSFT:0.1919;MTCH:0.0006;NVDA:0.1919;OXY:0.0001;PLTR:0.0003;PSX:0.0001;PYPL:0.0087;SBUX:0.0329;SLB:0.0001;TGT:0.0329;TSLA:0.1919;WMB:0.0001;WMT:0.0087;XOM:0.0087,1.0385553615751877,1.0154582386664255,0.038555361575187685,0.015458238666425483
2024-11-14,F-Qgzn2dCwU,"kind: captions language: en palente here is up over 250% year to date and a lot of investors are asking me if it's too late to buy the stock even though i think this is one of the best ai companies in the entire planet i wouldn't be buying palen here for over $60 per share i would be buying leap options instead i'll show you how to buy shares a paler or essentially get the same benefit as owning shares for a lot less money and still get all the upside with less risk up front so rather than buying shares at all-time highs it would be a much wiser move to buy leaps instead so in this video i'm going to give you the full blueprint on buying leaps and show you some examples all right guys so paler is at $61 per share i'm up a whopping $2,383 guys my current average cost of pal here is $21.7 and i have $311,000 in capital here for from this portfolio alone in paler now look i'm going to be giving you guys some examples of the leap options i'm going to buy but first i want to say that billionaire ken griffin of citadel i was looking at the research because look guys there's something called a 13f all right a 13f essentially i'm looking at my notes here it's a required filing from the securities and exchange commission right from the sec for institutional investors with at least 100 million in assets under management so if you have a lot of assets under management you're a hedge fund you have to report and ken griffin the billionaire he reported that he added over 1,000% to his position on paler that means this billionaire has noticed that paler is a good ai play that's most likely why he purchased it right we can only make i can only make speculations here right and this tool by the way this 13f filing it's exactly what some of the people look at when they want to follow one of the you know some of the smartest money managers out there the 13f filing is a tool that the smartest money managers basically you can see exactly what they're doing there's full transparency because they have to be transparent it's not that they want to that they have to so i was doing some research here in billionaire ken griffin of citadel you know one of wall street's biggest success stories essentially has bought a lot of palons here so i'm super bullish on palance here but as i've mentioned in the beginning of this video i don't know if i would be buying shares at this level i'm definitely not selling shares by no means i'm still bullish right but i'm going to show you a better strategy so i'm going to go to trade paler options and we're going to actually be taking a look at several different positions for leap options and how to manage those leaps how to open the leaps and basically close the leaps um i'm going to give you lots of different ideas here so make sure that you pay attention to all these examples the first example is i would probably go for um something like october 17 2025 okay very far into the future honestly i think paler is going to have some upside but will it be $100 next year i don't know i actually think there's a good chance that if i had to make a bet that paler it's gone up a lot 250% guys that's like nvidia like returns but i still think we can squeeze out some more gains i do think this stock will easily be over $100 per share just not sure on the timing i don't i don't want to lie to you and and promise you say hey i know because i don't okay but i do think this is a smart strategy right here because specifically a leap option gives you that benefit of owning 100 shares without owning 100 shares you actually get the same benefit because when you buy a call option each call option represents 100 shares therefore if i were to buy a $60 call option like this right here it is going for $15.85 which is $1,585 not cheap but also it's not as expensive as having to buy 100 shares of pound here which would be over $6,000 right now pretty insane right i mean i bought this stock at $21 that's my average price that's when i recommended this to my discord community by the way my discord community is the first link in the description you can go through the quick simple process we actually don't have any spots right now i have a lot of demand for the coaching but um once we have spots open up then go ahead check out the discord link and i also have one-on-one coaching which is also full at the moment so yeah it's kind of crazy $60 call here um you know i would purchase this for 2025 and it gives you a lot of upside you can see how you start off in the red now why do you start off in the red well there's always a give and take relationship with all things in life right with whether it's like you know romantic relationships or money or business or or really anything right there's always a give and take in life whatever we want we have to pay for right is it physically or mentally or financially etc when it comes to option trading if you want to own 100 shares a paler and you don't want to pay the $6,000 you want to pay a fraction you will have some break even cost okay there's going to be some cost here that paler has to go up for you to break even i'm going to show you a little loophole a little bit of a trick on how to reduce that break even and get it lower in just a little bit but essentially when you buy a leap option yes palen here does need to go up more than just owning the shares right with the shares you get immediate benefit with the leap option i'm just being upfront and transparent with you you need it to go up a little bit more right to break even that is the cost that you pay for owning a leap option now i'll show you how you can actually reduce the cost of the leap option and basically make it a lot lot cheaper you know what let me just show you one more example before i show you how to reduce the cost because it really depends if you want to go october that's a long weight you can actually also go for a little bit of a shorter strategy here you can go for may which is 180 days okay about 180 days about 6 months this would be half a year and you can make this a lot cheaper by just going for like a 70 buy call option now i'll also show you how to reduce the cost here as well cuz in both scenarios so here's some foreshadowing i'm going to be selling call options with the buying call option so i'm going to buy two call options i'm going to show you two examples and then sell two call options i might show you three examples we'll see so look 70 call option you buy it's a lot cheaper i'm giving you lots of options i'm giving you all the bullish strategies that i know in this video because there's just so many ways to make money on pound here actually every single video i've made guys has literally made like double digit returns per month all my students right now making double digits per month it's the easiest time in the market to make a ton of money like if you're not making 8 to 10% a month right now you're doing something wrong like it's just not enough right now there's just crazy amounts of money to be made and like i showed you a few days ago i made over $300,000 in a month it's a little less than 10% return 8 eight something return all my you know almost $4 million portfolio there is just crazy amounts of money to be made right now so you should be doing something like in this example you buy the 70 call and then you can sell i would go 80 call okay now typically i recommend $5 with spreads but straight up there is a lot of upside and i do think we can see $80 per share and pounds here by may 16 that would basically be my base bull case okay if i had a bull case i would say we're going to be at about 80 per share on palance here so when you take a look at this you're you're going to be putting up about $260 uh in in terms of the cost but you have 750 profit you can you can turn $260 into $1,000 that's a 4x return that's four times your money you can put up 250 essentially and your total max gain would be the 80 minus the 70 which is $10 you're so you're putting up 2.5 to get 10 that's a 4x return so you can literally 4x your money in six months if paler goes to 80 that's a little bit of a riskier bet like for the most part i am sticking to selling put options guys that is safer but in this market right now especially if you're bullish and you want to make a bet on paler i'm going to actually make a different bet i'm just showing you this example because i think this is a good example if you're very bullish on paler i am more moderately bullish i'll show you two more examples but in this first example if you're very bullish this is what i would do because you can four times your money right here and essentially even if you put up let's say a small amount of capital like 2.5k you can get to $10,000 so you put up 225,000 to get to $10,000 and if you you know spread your risk and you have all the other stocks i'm talking about which have been making tons and boatloads of money right you know amazon google you know you name it nvidia all these stocks are basically i'm just printing money literally right now you should have diversification obviously you should have 10 to 15 positions as usual i'm not going to be changing anything that i say right i'm sticking to my plan sticking to my strategy i could actually be making way more money right now if i was buying call options but i prefer steady pass of returns i'm always going to go for i always say i'd rather have $1,000 a day than you know $115,000 one day and then or you know one week you have $50,000 week and then the next week you lose 10 grand like there's no point of that volatility i don't personally like that roller coaster ride at all in any areas of my life financially i don't think it makes sense so not that it makes sense in any part of life right so i would say that i'm always going for steady passive returns this strategy right here would be a fantastic high growth strategy but let me show you the leap strategy i would prefer i would say the leap strategy would be much better so going back to the leap strategy so let me go to october uh expiration again and let me show you buying a call option that was a little bit more expensive right this uh 60 call option so this was fairly expensive right $1,500 which is a lot more than the $250 i showed you but this position does have some advantages so if you are going to buy this call option and then you sell some shter term call options you can essentially turn the leap option into a poor man's covered call or a covered call right so this is a much better like leverage strategy and i would say that if you're not you know in the sixf figure range if you don't have 100k 300k 500k those are typically the students i i work with you know someone who has 100k is easily able i can work with someone even with 50k but the bigger portfolio you have the less need you would have for this strategy the smaller portfolio you have the more you would need this strategy or the more aggressive your risk is and the more aggressive of return you want um if you just want to make more money this this would be literally the the strategy this would be the strategy to use on pal here okay this in my opinion would have medium risk it would have some medium risk whereas the other option i just showed you that bull call spread i just showed you would be pretty high risk right because if pal here doesn't really go to 80 you don't get the full benefit you know you would you would really need pal here to go up a significant amount now with this leap option you actually don't need it to go up a significant amount you just need it to steadily go up and you'll actually make pretty good money the way you would do this is you can go ahead and sell a 70 call option and right here you'll see that this is a very interesting chart i'll zoom in here you can see this is a very very interesting chart essentially this is a bullish strategy where you actually are very very incentivized if the stock were to go up a little bit up to 70 right at 70 you would really really hit that sweet spot of a really high return so at $70 you would essentially make in the short term on this option right here it would definitely swing in value it is hard to say exactly how much would swing in value i'll give you my experience okay this option is expiring in october if paler swung up to $70 in the short term i'll i'll tell you how these two options behave okay now this is going to be some deeper level stuff that no one really talks about because they don't understand options to the degree i understand i've been doing it for 10 years look the long call option has low theta it has very low theta because the option expires in such a long time right it's expiring in 11 months theta doesn't really kick in super hard until the last 30 days to 60 days okay some will say 90 days but it's really in that 30-day last period you have a lot of time decay right it makes a lot of sense because the option as it approaches expiration the time decay increases in speed so that's how that call option will work whereas this call option right here you can see the 70 call option this will uh decay a lot faster okay and there's also another factor this one has high delta value this is a very high delta because it's an in the money option okay and the delta is over 50% here i know it's over 50% because an option that's at the money that's exactly at the money is going to have a 50 delta that means okay that this option has a lot of sensitivity it's very sensitive in a good way okay so when paler rises in value this 60 call option will increase a lots in value so if paler goes up by $10 this 60 call option will experience about a $6 move how do i know that well because the delta is roughly 60 it's probably 55 or so okay and if if paler goes up by $10 this option will go up by the 6ish delta so6 * $10 which is $6 okay so this option will no longer be $1 1585 it'll be about you know $16 plus6 which is $22 okay this will be about a $22 option okay because the robin hood's not going to explain to you the how much money you're actually going to make that's why i'm explaining to this to you because this chart doesn't show it okay this chart doesn't really show you your max your max true profit it doesn't inste 50 but no that's not really correct it's close but it's not correct so for poor man's covered call it's a little bit harder to calculate because there's two different options that are expiring in two different days so technically if you really want to understand this on a deep level it is a little bit more complicated it doesn't have to be i'm just giving you all the details and all and and all the background of it so if you appreciate my full explanation i would love it if you would subscribe to this channel we're trying to hit 500,000 subscribers and we're trying to grow our family and just make millions of dollars together as a collective group i've been right on point and i have not sold out and i have not made videos on stocks that i don't believe in i only covered the real stuff and i transparently show you my portfolio and we've been on a good journey here so let me shut up and let me keep going here 60 call here okay this is going to be very sensitive all right so if delta is sensitive 60 delta is very sensitive it's a high delta we're going to get a lot of good upside so at $70 per share we're going to make $6 here on this option okay this option right here now on the 70 call if p here just goes to 70 this will be worth zero okay so you will make the full premium prium because theta will kill will absolutely demolish and destroy the 70 call option so it'll be destroyed which is a good thing cuz you've sold it so you want it to fall in price this option will go up this option will go down beautiful like freaking fantastic right so this 70 call option will lose 250 bucks this will gain six so you're going to make about $850 now this may lose a little bit of theta so let's just call it 800 bucks so that's why i said this is close but not quite you'll make about $800 so $800 that you can make and you're putting up about $1,300 on this position so you know if i were to do the math and i'll quickly do 800 all right so we'll take 800 divided by 1300 that's a 60% return folks i mean 60% return you i mean that's a fantastic return palen here can move up by $10 which would be roughly an 18 20% return you're going to get 60 so with this leap strategy that i'm showing you right now you're you're essentially getting three to four times leverage factor you're getting a huge upside factor and it's just i would say it's it's freaking fantastic and i'm recording this video late in the evening cuz i want you guys to make money this is the easiest time ever to make money and i'm tired but i'm still creating this video um and i'm actually going to tell you some more important things about palen here okay what i think i mentioned ken griffin okay earlier in this video what i think ken griffin really noticed by the way and the reason why he actually pulled the trigger and and bought a lot more palen here cuz i took some research here i've spent hours of research what i think ken griffin is doing was that he noticed that paler had the best quarter ever since paler had the best quarter ever ken griffin said huh this is an obvious ai play like he's not stupid the guy's not stupid okay he literally realized that palen reported third quarter adjusted earnings okay of 10 cents a share on revenue of $25.5 million and they beat the the consensus the consensus was $75 million so they beat by over $20 million that huge beat is not is not unnoticed guys when a company beats earnings there's a reason why that stock pops a lot it's because there was one expectation and something else happened okay when reality hits differently than expectation we have shock and there's emotion and that emotion drives the market okay i'm sure you can think of lots of different experiences in your own life where expectations were different than reality and you're like huh in a bad way or huh in a good way that's exactly what ken griffin saw because expectations are over 20 million and i think uh i was looking at the research in the same period last year the company reported paler and i' i've said this in prior videos guys this isn't anything new i'm just showing you how to make more money because there's still more opportunity in this i'm going to keep making videos as long as i see opportunity for us to profit and if i don't see opportunity i'm still going to going to tell you that i don't see opportunity i'm going to be straight up honest with you and you go i don't sugar coat anything i don't need to i have enough money i'm doing this because i want to i think there's so much opportunity right now that it's crazy to ignore last last period they had seven cents a share on revenue of 558 million we are going to a trillion dollar in revenue for palen here so i'm extremely bullish on the stock i'm also extremely bullish on the commercial sector there's a lot of use applications for paler let me go um let me actually show you palen here's chart a little bit i think that we've seen lots of reactions and over the past like year to date i think a lot of investors here they weren't expecting palen here to have a huge huge commercial use okay we know that palen here has been trying to go away from the government contracts because government money is good don't get me wrong but if you want to get to the trillion dollar valuation you have to be you have to be broad you have to you have to help government you have to help commercial you have to help everyone right you need you need as much revenue as possible to become a billion dollar company you have to have truly large impact well i don't think that's going to be a problem for palance here with ai ai is going to be i forget what the research was showing but it was like trillions of dollars it was like 15 trillion by 2030 okay ai is so interesting guys it's going to change the way we live it's going to change the way our work is it's going to change everything and paler is at the forefront of that and i'm i'm really behind this stock uh i know i've said the ceo went to my high school that's actually how i learned about the stock because word went around that alex carp went to central high school in philadelphia where i grew up and you know that's kind of what got me interested into the stock okay i'll be honest with you i didn't know that this was going to be the best best stock from day one but i really got behind it because i knew the leadership was good guys it's all about it's all about the person okay do you trust the person okay i trust alex karp i trust if i trust the ceo to me it's half the battle it's already half the battle okay the rest is market research i want to make sure they have a good competitive advantage i want to make sure they have a good product but i know they do because of the ceo so look this is a crazy stock that continues to go up i would personally use leap options on it i'd be a little bit cautious on buying shares right now but i you know if this stock pulls back i will also be selling put options on it so thanks a lot guys my coaching is full i'll do my best to open up some more spots i wish you guys a uh you know i wish you guys lots of success health enjoy this

2024-11-15,Jql1SyWuW_w,"kind: captions language: en are you trying to make a boatload of money are you still trading nvidia or holding nvidia because nvidia is honestly still one of the best stocks it's been a few weeks and we have to talk about what i'm doing with nvidia cuz i'm up over $1,000 on options nvidia is actually still one of the best stocks and right now it's actually at a perfect setup to do multiple different option strategies so i'm going to show you my portfolio because look right now i have shares but look at all these options positions we need to discuss each and every single of these option strategies so you can make a lot more money now look also on monday i'm going to have an emergency meeting check out the first link in the description i haven't done this before but since we're in post elction i'm going to have 10 different stocks that i think are going to absolutely blow up in 2025 and i promise i'm going to make it worth your while i'm going to have a 2hour webinar where i will go over different strate ies stocks i'm going to present i'm going to also give you a complete discount and trial on discord all the details will be in the description on monday i don't want to waste any of your time i respect your time so let's jump into the video but if you want to be part of my emergency meeting then go ahead and check out the first link in the description all right so look on nvidia i'm about to print even more money i promise you this market right now is just really easy all right so look i have different strategies i have sold puts we're going to talk about selling puts we're going to talk about covered calls i'm also going to be talking about debit spreads and credit spreads all right we have a whole jamack video this is going to be this is going to be a killer all right look the first thing i want to say is the easiest strategy i'm going to start from the easiest to the more complex strategy all right the easiest strategy on nvidia is going to be selling put options i've been selling put options on nvidia for some time now because i've been buying nvidia bicep over trip guys i've been buying this thing like no other all right you can actually see right here i have the 130 cell putut i have 129 cell put both of these are worth just 6 cents because i've sold them a while ago now they're decaying and they're going to be expired this week they're going to be gone so i'm going to be selling new put options on nvidia looking for a new entry however i also want to point out that i've also been doing covered calls guys for the past 10 years i've been trading options and for the past 5 years i've been making youtube videos and i started off with the wheel strategy i've been teaching the wheel strategy from the very geto because that is the safest strategy the wheel strategy is a combination of selling puts and covered calls on the same stock but nobody said that you have to wait to sell covered calls you can do it right off the bat this is called a covered strangle and this is a strategy that i have brought to youtube and i brought to our community here because i think it's a very powerful strategy the wheel strategy and the covered triangle strategy are kind of like cousins okay and it all goes back down to the simple basics of selling options for income selling puts for income and selling covered calls for income i've been running both of these simple and easy strategies on nvidia and i think that right now it is still not i think it's absolutely still a good time to run it on nvidia and i'm going to do that again and i'm going to be doing it for december expiration and as my options approach expiration in december i'm going to be selling more options for january okay so i'm always selling options on a monthly basis that's where i find my consistent cash flow now look here's my play and i'm going to show you multiple plays in this video first of all this will be gone and expired so will this my covered calls at 148 are very close to the money and you know i can say that i probably will have to roll this position up so i'll show you step by step for each of these positions how i'm going to replace because right now i have the golden strategy here i have six different strategies or six different option positions on nvidia and each and every single one i'll tell you what i would do for december first of all for nvidia expiring this friday okay as i'm making this video i'm going to sell some more put options except now i'm going to do it at 135 strike so i'll come back to these options in a moment let me just show you some nvidia options by going to sell put i'm going to go for december now look you guys already know the reason i want to buy nvidia is because ai innovation they're price to earnings multiple is actually very reasonable i covered tesla yesterday and tesla i said had a 100 pe ratio pretty insane obviously tesla is not trading based on valuations it's trading based on momentum nvidia is actually a very similar story and i think nvidia stock will be about $200 per share in 2025 i think we can see another 33% pop in the stock okay i think 33% pop in the stock is going to happen just like i got a 33% pop on the bicep all right 33% pop in the stock means that you can actually make a lot more than 33% if you're using option because the other strategy that i'm going to show you which is going to be a bull call spread shortly if nvidia goes up 33% you will absolutely double or triple or even quadruple we'll take a look at the exact example your portfolio so by being an nvidia you will make way more than 33% in 2025 if the stock goes up 33% which i think is kind of like a base case like my base case is nvidia will ride up by 33% i mean we've had over 200% in a year right so 33% i'm really not asking for too much and i'm not really asking for anything i'm very confident i'm good at my trading skills so i'm not really asking for anything just based on my view and based on my belief i think we can probably honestly double a portfolio we can double a portfolio or double the investment we make in nvidia because let me correct myself you don't want to be fully invested in one stock that makes no sense right i mean not good risk management and i would never recommend that you guys go too heavy into one stock even if we're super super bullish and i've been super bullish on pal here we made a killing i've been super bullish on tesla we made we're like raking in we're raking in the money it literally feels like money is unlimited but hey we still always want to be in the protection mode rather than just the you know being overly aggressive so look nvidia i'm going to sell put i'm going to go for december 20th and i'm just going to look for entry i'm going to show you the option that i was looking at i was looking at the 135 i'm looking for entry right here this is about a 28 delta okay the delta here is0 279 which is 28 essentially the volume is 9,600 guys like 9,600 that is so much volume that is fantastic why is it fantastic because when there's a lot of volume on an option that means there's a lot of liquidity okay and i've said this in another video that if you're looking to sell a toyota you can sell a toyota real quick because the market is huge everyone's trying to buy a toyota toyota's cheap and everyone can afford it if you're trying to sell a ferrari even if it's going for a good deal it's still a luxury niche right same with options guys it's very simple the biggest mistake i see is people trade options that have no volume the more volume the better okay so that's why i'm trading nvidia and tesla that's why i'm making a boatload of money because i'm following where the money goes where the money's flowing i try to go there right you know some man's getting rich some hedge funds getting rich but i'm there kind of like intercepting and i'm trying to get some of the some of the drops of of the of the water right the water is you know you seen that picture i'll put up the picture right here the water's flowing to this to big you know corporations and head funds but i'm just trying to take a little piece right i'm trying to take a little piece of the profits all right the profits are flowing in and i also riding the wave okay with all the hedge funds with all the billionaires with all the people that know what they're doing because i also know what i'm doing because i still have connections at wall street after working at goldman sachs i'm still in touch still in touch i still have you know the scoop of what's going on and what's driving innovation okay you don't even have to have an inside scoop on wall street or have work there if you just understand that the ai is is going to be trillions of dollars i'm looking for entry in nvidia and i'm not scared at all i'm not scared whatsoever 135 right here when the market opens up i'm making this video in the morning i'm going to be selling more options here because typically what i do when my options are expiring on friday i will think about closing this option so today i'm going to close these options because they're only worth 6 cents right i have two more days but they're tying up a bunch of capital i've already made 99% on the option that i showed you i'm going to go back and show you some more but i've already made 99% so i'm going to close those options and i'm going to open up a new position here now check it out in 36 days i can make 3% with an optimal entry guys you always think about how do i time the market how do i get in properly listen nobody knows when to get into the market properly or at the perfect time but if you sell a put option that's out of the money and you get assigned on nvidia at 135 when nvidia's at 147 you're going to be winning because you're getting a $112 discount paid you're getting paid up front literally the cash enter is your account you can take that money and go to whole foods with it once it's in your account you've gotten paid now you just have an obligation to buy nvidia at 13 5 but what's wrong with that obligation like tell me what is wrong when you have to buy nvidia which is a good quality stock at 135 that's why i'm going to be probably opening up like 10 contracts here i'm probably going to make another 135k bet right it does require capital i'm going to cover some smaller account strategies obviously folks that i work with in my discord have some capital right you need capital to sell puts it's it's mandatory so this this will have to each contract here will be $113,000 roughly capital that you put up and now robin hood says max loss no no no no no that's not the max loss that's if nvidia went to zero which is not going to happen it's not even going to fall down to 100 most likely so look that's that's the first play i would do let me go back now and let me show you the other plays that i would make because simply said we're looking to sell puts for optimal entry but we also want to do covered calls right so covered calls right off the bat are also going to be more profitable so why are cover calls more profitable well guys we're in a big bull market because we're in a big bull market post election which is also why i'm having the emergency meeting on monday if you can make it that would be fantastic it will be recorded so just check it out the reason why now is such a vital time literally such a vital time is because post election we have a market rally all right a market rally you have to ride the momentum momentum is like what i mentioned in the last video it's like when there's a title wave right and and and there's a huge momentum in like water all the boats rise right all boats rise in a rising tide right that's what they say so when that is happening when all boats are rising you want to have your boat docked right if you want to go higher you want to be docked you want to be there to enter into the trend before the trend takes off you think jeff bezos you know how did he become such a billionaire because he was early on the internet i'm trying to make you guys early on the trend okay i can't say we're early anymore i've already grown to multiple millions of dollars and i've already helped 2,000 uh students do the same and we're not early per se but we're continuing on the trend okay at least i can say that there is still opportunity it is not too late so i would say on nvidia i would jump in buy a 100 shares and then do a covered call at 150 okay here's what the covered call i'm i'm literally buying this uh stock hand over fist you people have forgotten about it i'm telling you you're making a mistake if you forgot about it you go to sell covered call okay so i would go to december 20th right now and i would straight up i'll tell you what i'll do i'll straight up i have the 148 no i will go to 150 150 is going to be a little bit better because you are going to get some upside when you do a covered call you want to give yourself a little bit upside now look it's a give and take situation you can go and do a 300 covered call guess what the 300 covered call is going to be worth nothing absolutely nothing because the further out of the money you go the less it's worth right that we don't even have 300s 290 is three three pennies and i'll tell you this you won't even get filled for three pennies cuz the volume here is going to be i was wrong holy moly you will get filled for three pennies i thought i thought you wouldn't get filled because the volume's low no the volume's actually that's crazy people are actually betting people actually are betting on nvidia going to 290 in that quick of a time i think that's crazy uh look you don't want to go that high what you want to do is the higher you go the less money you make because there's a lower chance of that happening now you go too too close to the money then you don't get enough premium at all so that's not good either so what i would do is i would sell a covered call at 150 guys give yourself a couple dollars of upside and collect $860 worth of premium 860 is going to be about 5% yeah it's about 5% because 10% of 15 is 15 5% 7 and a2 this is this is actually 6% in 36 days tell please if you have a bigger portfolio and you can make 6% plus you have some upside 8% 8 to 10% in this market guys let's say we can do that for 3 four five months in a row right 10% that's 50% if you have 100k you're about to make $50,000 that's literally what's happening in my discord community right now that's literally how easy money is right now you don't want to miss out on nvidia okay this is just one of my safer easier place let me show you another one the other two strategies that i want to show you is going to be be a debit spread so let me show you this debit spread that i recently opened up in discord i'm already up $849 i actually opened this position up not long ago on november 4th it's been 10 days and i'm up about 10% 10% in 10 days that's 1% a day so that's what my smaller account strategies can do for you it's 1% it can be 1% a day easily cuz you know small account strategies are a little bit on the riskier side you know obviously especially when i'm doing my buying strategies but you can make tons of money so i'm up a percent a day i did this 10 days ago and i opened up a smaller position i ended up investing $8,800 uh and i opened up three uh contracts here this is actually a poor man's covered call now i've covered the poor man's covered call and actually you can watch yesterday's video on the poor man's covered call where i covered it for palen here okay this is my best strategy guys i'm giving you my best secret sauce on youtube for free you don't need to buy anything you definitely don't need to buy any of the other option youtubers because they all learn from me and they're all just you know for the most part copying me so you don't need to buy nothing guys i'm trying to give you the best education on youtube for free you don't need to buy anyone's stuff you don't need to buy my stuff it's all free you don't need to smash nothing you don't need to do anything if you subscribe i appreciate it but i'm just trying to help you out and i'm literally giving everything away for free because i have enough money i'm looking to help more people that's my duty that's my higher calling from god so for me that's that's what i feel pass passionate and happy about and that's why i show up here every single day making the best videos all right so i would say that when it comes to the poor man's cover call you can check out yesterday's video if you want extra help i'm going to explain it briefly right now uh because i respect your time i don't want to make this video too long look a poor man's covered call will look like this i have the uh right here i bought september 120 calls i bought three september 120 calls that gives me that deep ownership okay i kind of made that up right now deep ownership means that there's a high delta right if i expand this option right here i'm going to go into it is deep ownership means that i have a lot of upside my options very sensitive all right so if nvidia goes up which i think it will um this option is going to profit a lot you can see how this option is up about $1600 the delta is very high all right so for a poor man's cover call you want to go for a delta that's going to be about 70 delta right so when the stock goes up a dollar your option goes up. 70 all right so you're getting that strong ownership now this strong ownership costs some money it doesn't cost as much money as owning 100 shares which is why i love this strategy for growing a mediumsized portfolio you get a really really good upside with with this strategy without really having to put up that much capital which i know is beneficial even even if you personally have a bigger portfolio it is still nice to put up less capital to make the same or more money so this absolutely makes sense and obviously 10% in 10 days is just typical right now in this market it's just typical this is just an average day this is an average week for me now the 150 covered call that i sold here is is for january okay for uh nvidia january 2025 uh this right here has um has subsidized my cost of the 120 call okay it's subsidizing my cost and it's it's costing me less to own this because i've sold this option so that's actually the benefit of the poor man's covered call strategy is you get to basically do covered calls as a poor man that's kind of why it's called that all right so i also real quickly i just want to go over my portfolio real fast cuz this is the expiration guys this is the expiration that i have for november 15 i have a win win win win win it's just all across the board guys we're winning and i would say that you should be in the situation now or you will be in the situation now by just simply selling options by simp simply selling options on nvidia i mean i'm obviously using american airlines apple amazon chipotle hood nvidia nvidia paypal starbucks sofi for this expiration i have one loser judge me by my losers $162 loss on s&amp;p 500 and it's a cover call not even a loss i've just literally made a little bit of money this week and this this will sell off judge me by my losers because right now i have none i have some in life of course i'm not perfect but right now this is why i have so much experience and this is where the experience really shines can you make a lot of money in the bull run and when there's a bare market can you save yourself a lot of money that's the most important part right everyone's making money right now but how much are you making and when we have a pullback it's not if we will have a pullback how will you be positioned because the strategy that i'm showing you today in this video will actually protect you will actually protect you very well because if nvidia pulls back let's go back to nvidia you'll be very safe especially with the cell put the cell put that i showed you for 135 you'll be safe the covered call that i showed you for 150 you'll be fairly safe because when the market pulls back you have more margin of safety i showed you in the example was $860 of of cushion premium that you collect on the covered call okay on the poor man's covered call you put up a small small amount of capital so you have lower risk guys everything i'm putting you into is designed to help you make money at a lower risk because i care that's what i want for you guys i want you to grow your wealth just like i have i'm at almost $4 million it's going to happen any day now any bull day i'm going to be at 4 mil i have another portfolio which i've grown a little bit more aggressively it is for my one-on-one coaching i do uh one-on-one coaching on zoom and i am working as a one-on-one coach now that is something that i am focusing on very heavily just because i've launched the boot camp model here on youtube and then everyone has basically done the same all the competitors that offer boot camps have learned from me they're my students and then they also offer boot camps so i want to differentiate myself i want to be different and i want to go a level further into one-on-one coaching which has been going very phenomenally i've worked with many successful doctors lawyers engineers medical professionals or even everyday 9 to-5 folks i've helped them in my one-on-one coaching and i'm just working with them they're able to text me anytime they want and giving them specialized plays and i am occasionally jumping on zoom calls with them just to help them one-on-one because this is what i love to do so i don't mind working all day to get you results i love doing this and uh i truly have nothing better that i would want to do with with my time then give back help others and grow and right now is the best time especially post election so go ahead check out the first link in the description if you want help and if you just enjoy my free videos hey thank god i hope that you keep

2024-11-16,HIf75Bv63zs,"kind: captions language: en are you looking to make $10,000 or more per month well i've been helping investors scale their portfolios for the past five years on youtube and i've been trading for the past 10 years in this video i'm going to be showing you some proven facts and ways and strategies for you to scale your wealth i really respect your time let me give you the first one minute summary if you don't have enough time you're trying to bounce off of this video and you're in a rush here's the one minute summary and then i'll give you the full overview the one minute summary is if you want to scale from like 100k to 500k what you should do is wheel strategy leap options you should actually be buying some options maybe 5% of your portfolio and then you should be using spreads i would do 70% wheel 20% leaps 5% buying options and 5% spreads that's basically what the doctor ordered so there's your prescription use these strategies and use them on the high quality companies that i cover on this channel like paler nvidia i'm about to cover these stocks right now in tesla use these strategies on high quality companies that are growing use it that's the secret sauce you will scale from 100k to 500k if you just use those strategies and use them on the proper stocks all right now that i've gotten that out of the way if you have some time let's talk about the full guide here on how to actually do that i'm recording this video in the evening because i was sitting here and i felt really passionate about taking myself back in time from when i scaled my portfolio from 100k to 700k and i was just sitting here i was just saying god has been good to me financially god has been good i've been very blessed to get my portfolio to a very good level where i can now retire and live on the funds that i have in the portfolio and i've been thinking to myself if i could tell someone from the very beginning or someone that has multiple five figures or 100k how can they scale how can they really take their portfolio from 100k to 500k basically like what i did from 100k to 700k and it got me thinking what would be the fastest way well here it is i would use paler nvidia tesla i would also use some other high flying companies that have good momentum but still very solid fundamentals so i would look at companies that have solid fundamentals that are growing and i would start by doing the wheel strategy this is the simplest strategy this is the strategy i've been covering for a long time however if you want to actually scale your portfolio aggressively guys aggressively i mean quick and actually get fast results you will need to do some option buying and you will need to do some leap options i've covered leap options very recently on a paler video that i made but basically let me show you an example of what i would be doing with leap options i would use leap options all across the board let me start off with tesla tesla for me honestly like looking at what elon musk is doing elon musk has influence in the white house if you don't think that's going to affect tesla positively you're out of your mind tesla is going to get a big boost from the regulatory side i don't know to what extent right i said in my last video i don't know to what extent but i'm very bullsh on tesla tesla's currently at $320 per share my average cost is $218 per share told you guys to get in but i still think there's opportunity here so if you want to scale up from like 100 k to 500k i do think tesla will be a$2 trillion company you can watch my full analysis on tesla i believe it'll be $2 trillion in probably in the next two years and what you should be doing is just honestly doing some leap options so let me show you an example i'm going to go to trade i'm going to go to buy call i'm going to go and just buy a leap option a leap option is just anything long-term okay a long-term call option essentially so a long-term call option technically is 180 days out it's 200 days out so all of these expirations right here would be perfectly viable now i'm going to go for september 19 i just like september 19 i think it's a good expiration date well my uh screen there changed dark mode uh i think se uh september 19 is really good so i'm going to go for something that's already in the money now guys the reason why you want to go in the money is because it gives you that upside if you go for an out-of-the money option the facts say that options typically expire out of the money so an out ofth money option is not going to be really your best bet if you want profitability and you want to scale your portfolio from 100k to 500k or really anywhere from 50k to 100k whatever right whatever your big goals are i encourage you that it is possible you you will make it happen if you properly trade if you properly get in with proper delta out of- the money options not really suitable i don't recommend them and i don't personally use them and i have not really used them to grow my wealth the way i've grown a lot of my wealth is by going for in the money uh so for example i would go for something like let me just expand this 73 delta perfect it's like i have another sense for these options i know know pretty much exactly what i'm looking for which is a 70 delta right i picked a 73 delta i already knew that because this option is pretty much in the money by a lot but it's not super like crazy in the money this is just in the money by about $45 so 25 and then tesla's at 320 so this is currently $45 in the money that's pretty good and you can see how if you had to buy 100 shares of tesla it would be $32,000 it' be 100 shares of 320 but this 275 call is going for $9,300 so in my opinion i mean you're spending onethird of the cost versus buying 100 shares what do you think is going to happen you if it goes up you're going to get a huge leverage factor you're putting up onethird of the capital three times less and you still get to control one shares that's why like sometimes i debate back in the day when i was buying shares i honestly debated that options can just completely replace shares altogether because an option gives you control of 100 shares so when you buy a call option you have access to 100 shares it honestly doesn't even make sense all the time to own shares when you can own a leap option i'll give you two different variations by the way because right now you might still be thinking to yourself well you know this option's expensive and it doesn't exactly move like stock let me explain very very simply the 275 call option right here it's going for $9,300 and the delta is73 that means if tesla goes up like 10 bucks this option is going to go up by like s bucks so it's moving similar to shares very similar actually but not exactly because shares if it moves up a dollar you make a dollar but on an option if the stock goes up a dollar because your delta is73 you'll make 70 cents however you make a dollar on the shares here you make 70 cents but you only put up $9,000 instead of $30,000 so70 on one3 of the capital technically is like $210 i'm multiplying 70 cents by three you can see it on the screen because well we're only putting up about 10 grand versus 30 grand so if if i were to do three of these leap options that would then be 30 grand like buying 100 shares therefore if i do three of these i literally control about $21 cents for each $1 move in the stock so basically if the stock goes up a dollar this leap option goes up 70 but because a sleep option is like basically three times cheaper than owning shares that means i can own three leap options and if i were to compare 100 shares versus three leap options the three leap options will actually be 2.1 times stronger on the upside okay because the delta here is about 7 so i'm just multiplying 7 by three times which is about 2.1 so i actually get double the strength for the same amount of money that's why leap options are so powerful okay let me actually show you a different little variation here though if i were to go for something like the 200 strike you can see this is a lot more expensive but it's literally now 88 so this is about the same if not very very similar to just the stock itself so when the stock moves up a dollar this leap option is going to look pretty much like stock there's almost no difference except you get to put up a lot less capital in fact half of the capital so this wouldn't be as good because you can kind of do the math for yourself here this is about half the cost of tesla if i were to buy 100 shares i can pretty much do two of these leap options for the same price as 100 shares and 2 * .9 is 1.8 so here i get 1.8 which is like i get 180% of owning 100 shares so in the first example we got 210% and here we got 180% long story short basically buying leap options gives you control and upside on the stock so hopefully you guys understood that i'll make a lot more simple examples now so look one of the most important things that i want to tell you about is that with tesla for example my parents they bought tesla 4 years ago when tesla was at a peak now my parents are doing okay but they definitely have that soviet union mentality where they're afraid to invest their like savings right they have some money in real estate because they believe in hard assets more than option trading and stocks but options are way better because they don't take much time so i always try to convince them of that and they've recently realized yes options are better because tesla went up and they're like we made so much money i'm like yes but you would have made more money had you dollar cost averaged okay so here's how you can actually dollar cost average not just with stocks but with options as well okay i'm giving you guys a lot of new information you can actually dollar cost average into leap options so let's say that you buy a leap option like i just showed you right you can actually buy a leap option every single month or every single two weeks as you have money available you can dollar cost average into a leap option just like you dollar cost average into shares so so literally i am bullish on tesla i'm bullish on paler which i'll cover in a moment and i'm also bullish on nvidia so what i would be doing if you want aggressive growth and you don't mind the risk please be aware that buying options has risk because when the stock market goes down these options will be worth less now because they're so deep in the money and they are very similar to stock you are unlikely to lose the entire premium you're not likely to because these are very deep in the money options like tesla's not going to go to 200 but you can can lose money if we enter a bare market and i will tell you one thing when i was working on wall street and i was i basically had multiple jobs and all of the people that i worked with all basically said the same thing because they were all making tons and tons of money okay i was at one hedge fund and basically the quant told me stocks have a tendency of rising okay that was rule number one rule number two i had an internship at group one trading in new york city where i was working on the the floor the new york stock exchange and it was a very volatile day still remember it um and i sat next to this trader who was making about 12 to $15,000 a day profit for himself uh because i could see all the pnls and i told him it's a really volatile day he smiled he's like yeah but i love volatility i was like why he's like volatility is great for options especially when you sell them so that also like really changed my mind right so i was like huh there's actually a lot of money to be made in the option market and across the whole board i don't worry about bare markets guys i've been through some tough times i know some of the common complaints about me not not really a complaint but some of the hindrances before someone becomes a student of mine they say i'm too young well i've actually been through many tough times yes i didn't go through 2008 because back in 2008 i wasn't really trading i didn't have any money i was like what in high school or something right but i've been through covid and i've done perfectly okay yes i had a declining six months i lost quar million dollars back in co times i made it all back and more within 6 months after that big uh fall that big uh you know crisis that we had and i've seen many other crashes and i've done just fine i never worry about bare markets because my strategy that i teach on this channel are time tested and i've been a coach for four and a half years and i have so many successful students none of them lose money if they actually follow what i do some people lose money because well you know some people will get into my discord and they just don't follow what i do they they do their own thing which i don't really understand why would you join the discord and do your own thing but a lot of people they just do their own thing and they go for really risky stuff i always tell people if you follow a formula that works i've been doing this for a decade you will get similar results to me and if you want to scale from 100k to 500k just follow the simple formula i have it all laid out in my discord it's literally like i told you in the beginning we're going to use high quality companies i just showed you leap options let me go into the next let me go to the next stock and next like strategy or the next idea my next strategy my next idea because i want to get to the point here as fast as possible give you as much high impact actionable insights is go for safe passive income yes buying options is it can be very lucrative but still the way i buy options is longterm like i just showed you a september expiration you want to get into the trend ahead of time why do you guys think i correctly predicted paler nvidia and tesla it's not really because i'm a genius it's not um maybe i'm above average i don't know where i'm at but i'll tell you this much i'm not a genius and the way that i've been able to predict stock after stock after stock that outperforms for years now is that i'm following the trend i'm doing my research on what i believe to be on a high a positive momentum trend i made a video recently momentum will strategy i've talked about momentum and actually at one of the hedge funds that i worked out we had a quant i was a quantitative analyst and this was back at pnc in philadelphia okay i worked at the bank we looked at different factors okay it's called factor analysis and one of the biggest factors of all was a momentum factor okay and this makes a lot of sense this will blow your mind but when a stock is doing good it's likely to continue doing good mind-blowing right but that's what momentum means so what i'm doing guys is i want to be early on the trend and then i want to ride momentum if you can do two things like that you will get stupid rich you will get insanely rich to the point where money doesn't matter like for me money doesn't matter i'm not on youtube cuz i need money it's definitely not the case i'm here here because i feel super passionate and this stuff has changed my life and the two biggest things that will change your life if you want to make a lot of money is be early on a trend unfortunately we are not early anymore on paler nvidia and tesla but good news is i personally believe number two okay we're not early in the trend but number two there's still a lot of momentum to come which is why i keep making videos on these stocks and that's why you have literally money falling out of your pocket that's literally what it is lately it's just money is falling out of your pocket because i'm looking at momentum it's positive and i'm riding momentum i'm not worried about a bare market and if you want to scale from 100k to 500k you can't worry about a bare market because bare markets happen but every single time i've gone through them easily all right so look go for safe passive income even though we're going to be doing some buying option strategies which i'm going to show you in just a moment okay it's still pretty safe and passive income even if you buy options because we're only using 5% of our portfolio i'm not going to recommend that you use more than 5% of your portfolio folio for straight up buying calls because i believe that 70% of your portfolio should be the wheel strategy i've been a i don't know what what do you want to call it and even jealous i don't know i've been like the man of the wheel okay the wheel has changed my life because it's so simple it's like a system it's a process and i've been running it over and over again like if i go to my portfolio actually uh there's a big expiration date so i have oh it's okay so a lot of my options expired you can you guys know that in the last video i went over all my options now they've all expired right cuz it's i'm recording this uh basically saturday morning it's like 2 it's like 2:00 a.m. for me but a lot of my options expired so i can't show you all of those wins but you know i'm still running the wheel strategy that's even expiring on 11:29 1220 1220 1220 i do prefer monthly options so all my current expirations are going to be going out to 12:20 because when you open up options on a monthly basis it's very low work and i believe in longevity like i want to you know trade for the rest of my life i hope that's many more decades i hope to coach students for many more decades to come that's my goal and when it comes to longevity and scaling your portfolio from you know 100k or 200k or or you know five or six figures to the next mark which is six or seven figures or six and seven figures to eight figures which is the path that i'm on right now you need longevity you need to have balance in your portfolio you have to properly manage risk you have to properly manage your positions you have to have proper diversification okay and you can't just be in the top three companies like paler nvidia and tesla that i cover on this channel you can't you still need the other stocks that i cover i don't cover them on youtube they're not as popular but the other stocks that i cover are just widely just blue chip stocks like there's nothing crazy about them i buy good quality blue chip stocks because i studied finance i have a degree in this stuff and after like reading every single waren buffett book after being mentored on wall street i realized that blue chips are kind of like that cheat code to scaling your portfolio if you want to scale from you know again 100k to 500k as the title says you can do so with apple you can literally do so with safe companies you don't need to recreate the wheel you can run the wheel no fun intended right trying to trying to make some jokes here as it's late i just feel compelled to make this video right i could be relaxing right now and messing around and whatever right but none of that matters to me i'm i'm dialed it i'm focused because i'm trying to make you guys as much money as possible because that's my mission that's my passion that's what i like so and by the way if you appreciate that just subscribe it would been the world to me that's that's what i'm here for i want to help more people so tired that uh let me keep going here all right guys let me wrap things up with just saying that uh i'm looking at my notes here because the next stock that i want to cover is paler i'm just really fired up like it's evening and i'm still fired up because the opportunity is just so big it's so big right now on paler we've made so much money on paler it feels it honestly feels like we're printing money and the results that they've come out with like 30% year-over-year revenue growth insane us commercial growth 44% and i've said guys that the commercial growth is probably more important than the government contract growth because it's all about expectations the market is about expectations because the market already expects palante here to win you guys aren't being you're not geniuses and neither am i a genius to say oh paler is going to do good with government contracts duh they're going to do good of course they're going to do good they've been doing good so it's this isn't a risky bet so the market already has that baked in guys it's already baked in like a pie it's already priced in that if it's priced in you can't make money the way you make money is when something is not priced in i personally believe that the commercial growth for paler is not fully priced in now i'm not saying that paler is going to explode as a stock in the near future because it has already done some exploding but in the longer term i would sell put options on palance here so i showed you a buy leap option on tesla because i think tesla has a clear path to two trillion with palen here we also have a clear path here to a lot of gains but because we're currently at $66 per share and i'm up a whopping $228,000 on this stock which is hey if you' been part of the channel you already know uncle henry picks the best stocks the best stocks for you to make money you already know you already know all right we're going to stop bragging and we're going to get to the facts the facts are palen here i believe will go into some sideways action for the near term and in 2025 it will reach $80 or more in the near term i would look for a better entry i mean guys how can i get excited about paler when the stock is up 11% in a day i don't want to be a fool i don't want you to be foolish with your money you worked really hard for your money that means that i want to respect your money like i respect your time and i can't say that you should buy call options or go too aggressive on paler right now you should look for optimal entry and you should maximize your profits as much as possible and for paler i would say that we want to look for an entry around $60 per share okay because if we can get in 60 i do think that's a decent margin of safety to own the stock so what i would do is i would go for january 17 um i would look for a shorter term pullback to jump into the stock but you know selling $60 puts right here they're going for $340 so you will tie up about you know $5,500 $ and you're going to make about $300 for doing that i would say that the return here isn't massive but it is a good return of a few hundred to get assigned on palance here if palance here goes down you will thank me later because if you are going to own shares and it goes down you get hurt right away but if it goes down and you have a margin of safety like right here p is at 66 if you sell a 60 put for $340 worth of premium i mean you tell me what's better you already know right if someone has a $66 per share shares and it goes down to 55 well that person lost $11 right 66 to 55 is 11 bucks but if you sold the 60 put for $ 340 i mean it goes to $55 per share you'll be down $160 but you're really not down that much you're only down 160 bucks whereas other guy the shareholder is down ,00 right 11,100 so $1,100 where you're down 160 i mean that's literally like a 10x difference so it is a 10x difference now if paler decides to take off a lot more i will show you one i'll show let me show you a buying strategy play which you you can run because i do think paler i do think it can hit $70 per share so i would do a bull call spread all right let me explain this all right now i hope this video is jam-packed with a lot of info so i know it's going a little bit longer but i'm hitting you with strategies and i'm hitting you with what i think will make money so you know look 65 right here if you buy okay let's go to buy 65 okay we can buy the 65 call option okay that's going to be kind of expensive but then if we sell the 70 call option this right here this will help you scale your portfolio fast like you will take 100k to 200 to 300 to 400 even if you're using a portion of your portfolio for a strategy like this call debit spread which i call the bull call spread okay they're just two two different names right they're same thing look if you buy the 65 call and you sell the 70 call you're subsidizing the cost of the 65 call with the 70 call so you're going to be having a total cost of $220 but you have a total reward here of 500 you're putting up 220 to make 500 this isn't a 60-day period this is two months guys that means if you're putting a portion of your bigger portfolio like 5k into this position that 5k can be 10k right in 60 days obviously you don't put in too much money into this position because we use our mind here and we diversify and we have 10 positions at least least in our portfolio but this right here it's it's a powerful strategy buying a bull call spread on a high momentum stock like paler which has 30% revenue growth right has 44% us commercial growth the guidance by the way is freaking fantastic from wall street which is really important guys that's also why i'm still bullish on pal here is because the guidance is strong guidance future okay that's what people care about people don't care about the past many of you guys have already forgotten that i put literally tens of thousands of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars in your pocket with all these plays we're thinking now what's going to happen in the future and i understand that guys it's human nature so i'm here to provide that value and tell you how we can get even richer how we can get more money and that is going to come from guidance guidance on paler strong which is very important i mean if you're looking to scale your portfolio you got to take some aggressive bets you're not going to get rich uh aggressively by just selling options with 100% of your money if you really want to scale and i mean scale quick like i did you are going to have to do some smarter and more aggressive buying strategies and i think that this could be a really good buying strategy just like i told you on tesla buying leaps on tesla and buying bull call spreads on tesla has literally printed money in the discord community i was just thinking about one thing just i got to share this right guys i like taking risk i personally like taking risk i'm a risk taker and that's why i've had a lot of good results is cuz i use calculated risk right and i have my own coaches i'm still in contact with folks on on wall street i still get coaching from you know former goldman sachs professionals who are really freaking high up because i understand the power of mentorship like i'm still learning i'm still improving guys i'm i'm 10 years at this game and i'm still getting better i think that's what makes me the best on youtube because the only people that are better than me are definitely not on youtube they're professionals that have already have eight figureure network they've already made it they've made it way more than me i have mentors that are way richer than me and that's what you want that's that's what i want i want to look up to people and i want to grow to the next level and i'm bringing all that wealth and all that knowledge to you guys here on youtube cuz i don't see anyone else doing that all the other youtubers they're taking my wheel strategy and they're regurgitating and copying my content but that's not how you actually improve guys you need to improve by actually getting better by picking the right stocks by picking the right delta by understanding rolling i made a recent video on rolling by using leaps by diversifying by there's just so many things that that we can improve on the risk management side of things when do we get out of a position all of these stuff by the way it's always something that i am improving it's always something that i'm getting 1% better i'm always trying to get 1% better when it comes to my trading because if you can avoid even one big mistake per year and get a little bit better at the wheel strategy and managing it and and picking the right stocks before earnings by the way if you're at this far in the video i want to give you a little golden nugget that i'm about to cover on nvidia stock because nvidia has earnings very soon if you're watching this in the future every time a stock has earnings it's very important but specifically i'm going to make a nvidia video uh right before earnings here because that's going to be a big big opportunity okay when it comes to a stock that reports earnings that is the golden opportunity for you to make fast cash okay if you're looking for fast cash fast money goldman sachs actually uh came out uh with some research that said 3 days before earnings you should be buying call options so that's what i'm going to be covering in tomorrow's video make sure that you're subscribed if this video is already getting old and you're watching this in the future always prepare for earnings be very vigilant on earnings okay let me show you right now what i'm going to be looking at when it comes to earnings i'm going to use nvidia because before earnings happens i always try to understand how big will the earnings be in comparison to the expectations i don't care how big actual earnings will be i care how different it will be from expectations because when you get a shock from expect ations that's when you get a big move in the stock i have a really small position on nvidia in this portfolio because my other portfolio is where i have a few thousand shares of nvidia and this portfolio i'm taking it a little bit light i mean it's $42,000 it's not that light but it's fairly light and what i'm looking at right now if i scroll down with robin hood they do have several interesting and analyst ratings and stuff i'm my own analyst guys i don't look at analyst ratings i'm my own analyst i listen to myself i don't look at really too many analysts you know it could be an interesting opinion but i listen to myself and my own research at the end of the day look at these earnings this is actually really interesting because nvidia has met earnings each time one but it did meet earnings here but here it beats earnings beats earnings beats earnings met earnings beats earnings i have a really good feeling of what's going to happen next mark my words and i'm going to you know what i'll just cover it tomorrow's video not to leave you on a cliffhanger i just feel like it's not that relevant to this video on scaling let me give you this short summary i'm going to explain it more in the other video i feel bad leaving this this video without telling you i think that nvidia will beat earnings but i think the stock won't move up that much i'll give you the full explanation later but in general what you want to look for and nvidia doesn't really have this pattern right now it doesn't really have this pattern is you want to see three consecutive huge beats which is not the case for nvidia let me show you a different stock i'm going to find a different stock that has actually p here i think pal here will be a good example i'm going to show you pal here nvidia doesn't quite have that trend paler has it like crazy pal here has huge beats you see the difference here is massive massive massive massive and massive when you see massive beats that's a much better indicator and i would jump into three days three-day uh call options three days before earnings because goldman sachs already proved that that strategy returned 95% in a week during earnings weeks so it's a little bit longer of a story because obviously that is on a larger set of data and every single study that they have is obviously to some degree obviously with data you can cherry pick so i'll go over that in a future video if you're interested comment down below sorry if there was some rambling in this video i obviously it's late for me but i wanted to give you guys as much jam-packed value as possible and give you as much insight to help you improve your trading make sure you subscribe and i'm going to put an important video on the screen for you guys to watch if you have some time right

2024-11-18,6KA8xMwHrjg,"kind: captions language: en nvidia has earnings on the 20th and mark my words if you have the proper position which i'm going to show you in this video you are going to make a ton of money and if you don't have the proper position you're going to miss out on a lot of cash from nvidia's earnings even worse if you're up on nvidia and you don't play it properly on earnings you may give back a lot of the gains that you already have so this is the most important week for nvidia and look mark my words what's going to happen is nvidia will beat earnings but the stock won't rise too much because expectations already baked in i'm going to show you a quick clip right now on what the options look like and why the call options are skewed right now and i'll explain to you what skewed is and then i'm going to tell you what wall street has in terms of expectations and how we are going to play nvidia watch this clip and then let's talk about it you know i am long i don't have cs right now so i don't know i'll look at something they're not going to be cheap that's for sure sure but i do think though going into the right before it the skew will be toward the upside the calls will be more expensive than the puts um so i'll look at that i think it's a more bound setup despite the the run in the stock because i just think expectations are lower eventually they have to fail on earnings eventually there's got to be something right so you you you don't get to go into vegas and keep betting on one thing and have the hand perform eventually but but they's still 85% of the market market tim said it every other stock that you look at in the sector the chart is horrendous this is the go ahead no ian eventually you will miss but i mean is the miss a function of analysts getting too hyped up over it and so therefore they're setting the stock up for a miss if they didn't ratchet up their earnings expectations they would easily jump over i mean it's all matter right it's the context of it's a point of reference it's it's where you're coming into so karen's completely right you would like them to talk it down the problem is every time they've talked it down in the past it's leaped over them and they've looked silly all right guys so look there was two things that were really important that were mentioned first was the skew and second here in my notes is them actually having to talk down they want to talk down nvidia but they can't because every time they talk down they beat earnings so now they don't talk down on nvidia which is an issue because they mention something along the lines of of you can't keep playing the same hand in a casino and expect to win so let me explain to you what this means first of all the calls are skewed and there's more investors looking to buy calls that's because there's more bulls on nvidia than bears that's very interesting and that's one of the warning signs that i have for a stock that may be reaching a peak and that's why i said that you know basically mark my words i think that nvidia will have good earnings but it won't rise more than 10% and that's a really big bold statement for from me but that's pretty much what i'm sure of because i believe that they're going to continue to beat earnings it's very clear about the trend however the expectations in the market are so rosy they are very bullish from all investors including myself that we are not going to be able to really pop on this stock like 20 30 40% like there were in the past because of expectations so let's go over how the chart actually looks like i'm going to go over my position on nvidia and how i'm playing it because i am going to give you two different plays on nvidia that both will be profitable and make money i'm 90% sure obviously can't guarantee cu i'm not a financial adviser and i can't predict the future but this is how i'm going to be playing nvidia and what i think is really smart uh in terms of the skew on the options we already talked about that and the expectations so now it all comes down to where are our expectations because the stock market the way you make money is by making smart bets that beat other players of the stock market this is a really tough game where we're trying to take money from other smart people so luckily i've been at this for 10 years uncle henry has your back so let's go into this right so look i personally have a very unique view on nvidia okay now my my view isn't the most unique because i'm bullish but i am moderately bullish which is very different from just being a blind bull okay there's a lot of blind bulls that just hold on to a stock and they're kind of blind to when a stock pulls back that's not me i'm always looking for upside opportunity but i'm also looking for pullbacks i'm also looking to hedge and i'm looking to be smart with my money right so when it comes to nvidia i have a few hundred shares in this portfolio my other portfolio i have just thousands of shares of tesla that i'm just holding i'm not doing covered calls i'm not selling puts i'm not doing options at all on my nvidia position in my other portfolio because i have been so bullish and because we are in a bull market i have had shares of palen here of tesla and nvidia the three top stocks that i've covered on this channel over and over again because i'm so bullish and i have been 100% correct on that i hope that you've made boatloads of money on this plays i've actually left my shares uncovered guys uncovered which is kind of weird from an option youtuber who's been making option videos for years and is the og on the wheel strategy there's three strategies i'd be running right now the first one is literally just having your shares uncovered just going into earnings and let your shares run however i will say that some of us have bigger positions and we should be playing options to a certain extent so right now what i'm doing in my main portfolio here which i've been documenting from you know a couple thousand up to almost 4 million now what i've been doing here is i have shares and i've been selling different types of options so let me explain to you these different types first of all i have a 148 covered call into nvidia that's not going to be that good because i do think nvidia could go up to 150 okay so first of all this is something that i'm personally going to have to close and i personally will have to roll on my monday call in discord okay i'm going to have to roll this higher because 148 is a little low and i don't want to lose my nvidia shares so remember when you're doing a covered call you get income from selling a covered call right you sell a call option you get income from selling that call right away that cash enters your account immediately however now you may lose your shares if the stock goes above the strike price right so in this example or this position if nvidia were to go to 150 155 i would lose my shares i don't want that so i will be closing out this 148 covered call and i will be selling a 155 covered call that will capture earnings okay let me show you what that looks like all right let's talk about the first position which is going to be a covered call so if i go to sell call option we can capture earnings by just going for november 22nd okay right now nvidia will have earnings on november 20th so on november 22nd if i sell a call that will capture earnings you can see how if i go up here to 150 for example this is an okay option the implied volatility is wild it's 101% implied volatility the volume is i don't even know what to say this is astronomically high volume this is one of the highest volumes i've ever seen and that's that actually means that there's a whole lot of buyers for nvidia options right now it's strictly in an nvidia option market as well as tesla as well as paler okay paler has been a huge win for me but right now we see just crazy call buying okay on nvidia so that is a little bit scary because nvidia is likely to go up there is a whole lot um more volume actually on call options than put options in fact look this 150 call option has 165,000 volume but if i show you what the one you know let's go to 150 on the put it has only 8,000 do you see what kind of skew that is do you guys notice that the volume literally on calls is 20 times more i can go to an out of the- money option right at 140 it's going to have more volume i already knew that right because 150 would be you know an in the money put option which is a little bit unusual for people to buy but even an out ofth money option like 140 which would be the biggest hedge right now okay this would be the biggest hedge if you want to hedge you would be well buying put options okay selling put options buying put options it's the same volume here so if someone wants to hedge their nidia position they would be buying puts but you can see here how the volume is only 29,000 versus 160,000 plus on the call option so there is a whole lot more call options and i am bullish on nvidia i do think expectations are priced then so when we do get the good earnings the stock will go up but it's not going to pop up like huge amounts okay i'd be happy if it does don't get me wrong if nvidia goes to 160 170 great but that is not what i expect the chances of that happening are very low okay my base case would be about 152 153 like i could see nvidia just being up like 5% 6% and you know that would be some some good money to be made so i would look at doing a cover call so sell call at 155 because i don't i don't think it'll go to 155 i think it'll be 152 153 we'll get a pop but not huge pop right so right here you will basically collect $250 and hey that's some extra money in the pocket and that's that's my first strategy that i would basically do on nvidia just a simple covered call strategy the next thing that i would do is if you want to make a longer term play and you are bullish on ai like i am i'm very bullish on ai uh i would do a leap option on nvidia and say hey hey i don't know what's going to happen during this earnings i'm bullish i'm i'm with henry i you know he's been right i'm bullish i i hold nvidia whatever your reasoning is but hey i don't know what's going to happen on the 20th i'm bullish in the long term for sure then i would do something a little bit more longer term in nature okay so instead of having to predict short-term you know what's going to happen i know a lot of folks that i work with are retired and you know we don't necessarily care about the short-term one week we want to get richer for sure over the next you know several months several year we want to have a positive 2025 except et right so it's it's also about that long-term view so here's what i would do on a long-term view i would go to buy call and i would do something like uh you can go for may you can go for a halfe option okay let me show you a halfe option usually when i do a poor man's covered call or leap or what i'm showing you right now which is buying a longer term call option it's all the same thing right uh i usually do go out about 9 months of expiration but here i'll show you an option that's going to just go out 180 days okay this gives you 180 day bet that's very good right you get 180 days to see what will happen to nvidia as the expectations continue to rise and with 100 uh 80-day option you basically have two earnings events so you get this earnings and next earnings so that's that's really good right because something that does happen let me tell you about a new topic that i haven't covered on this channel it's called post earnings drift what post earnings drift means is when a stock reports earnings and it's positive and it goes up let's say you get a momentum swing in the stock 8% 10% you name it right x% and upside you will typically see the stock do some more drifting or some more running to that side okay let me explain if the stock goes up 10% over the subsequent couple of months it may continue to go up another 5 10% it typically kind of swivels up right it's it's called an earnings drift so it drifts towards that side right that's actually really common that's something that i've seen over and over again even back when i was in college and not even really trading so much yet i was not even fully trading doing option trading full-time i didn't have my uh goldman sachs uh time yet i didn't work at goldman sachs yet i was just taking my basic courses and my finance degree and they were already telling us about post earnings trip so that's something that has been covered long long time ago but i do see it in action all the time i see it happening in the market all the time we've seen it with palen here actually palen here reported good earnings we had earnings drift and it got included in the s&amp;p 500 fantastic it went up then nasdaq and then you get a whole lot of earnings drift essentially in talenter case there was other factors but earnings drift was definitely part of it so what i think will happen into nvidia and why i'm showing you this 180 day expiration option is because if nvidia goes to $152 per share and the next week right after earnings we can still see it go to0 and 170 over the subsequent months because of earnings drift okay so i would do a uh leap option where i would just buy something like the 130 okay if i expand the 130 here there's not a whole lot of volume that's really good actually there's not a whole lot of competition for this option and the implied volatility is actually half of what we see right now in the short term so if you want to kind of ignore the short-term volatility of everyone's trading nvidia and options are expensive especially when it comes to buying them okay in the short term i think it's smart to sell them in the longer term i would say that it is smarter to buy uh an option on nvidia to really get in behind nvidia and to ride ride the earnings drift to ride the momentum to ride the stock uh you know performing very well so you can see how the implied volatility here is just 53 which is half of what we currently have going on so i would buy the 130 okay this will be about $2800 which is much better than paying $4,000 or $155,000 for nvidia stock if you were to buy 100 shares it's a lot better actually so this is a lot cheaper it's like a very small fraction of having to own 100 shares but the leap option gives you the same power and the same strength and uh you can basically buy bicep you know bicep over tricep on the on nvidia without having to put up 100 shares worth of capital so you really get that that strong upside without having to put up all that capital i would say that this is hands down one of my top option strategies that i would use to really scaling your wealth a lot faster really getting to that retirement point and i would just buy the 130 call option okay the bid ask here is actually very good very good bit ask spread there's only a 30 c difference so fantastic the delta here is 68 and i've said in many of my videos uh the ideal delta for a leap option is going to be around that 7 delta sweet spot it gives you that good upside without becoming too expensive so i would straight up buy this uh call option and then if you want to decrease your cost essentially you can sell shorter term call options to generate some income like a like a covered call except this would be a poor man's covered call because well for a covered call you need 100 shares for the leap option here you don't need 100 shares so that's uh what makes it a really strong strategy so i would look if you want to be safe by the way and you're like hey i don't want to risk losing my shares i don't want this leap option uh to go into the money right what you can do is you can go a little bit higher all right so you can go for the 160 covered call here you can see that there's good volume the implied volatility is actually a lot lower for january a lot lower i thought it would be higher i thought it would be somewhere in between 50 to 100 but it's still on that bottom end of 50 so that's not that good because when you're selling options you want higher implied volatility but nonetheless i mean here you get $600 so if i go to sell call all right you get $600 uh and you really get that $600 versus what you pay which is about 3k thereabouts so that's about a 20% return that you can get in 60 days which is about 10% per month so you can get a 10% per month return on nvidia by running this strategy which is obviously a fantastic return 10% per month you will well do well over 100% per year in return if a strategy like this works out in in a single year which it will for nvidia i strongly believe nvidia will will be up so this is actually one of my uh best plays this is what i'm going to be opening up monday morning in my discord community this is one of the positions as well as the covered call position and honestly i will be selling puts as well i will be selling puts on a video let me show you the several sell puts i have and then give you a new recommendation for sell puts because um look we have 132 oh actually i had some options expired profitably so currently i only have the 132 i would i would actually sell 135 puts right now nvidia if you want more option strategies more of my ideas on nvidia you should really check out the last nvidia video i made and watch it in its entirety because this week on nvidia is the biggest opportunity that i've seen literally you should be taking advantage of this you should be making money hand over fist guys right now it is an easy time in the market make as much money as possible because there are going to be times where the market is not going to be as hot it we may see a bare market and i will make some videos on how to protect yourself and manage your risk because i really care about your overall well-being when it comes to option trading you want to understand how to manage your portfolio from a to z in good and bad times but right now it's a good time so get your wheelbarrow out

2024-11-20,btZrYjyvZWw,"kind: captions language: en paler is up over 300% this year so far and a lot of my students are asking me henry is it still a buy at these prices even though paler is one of the best companies on this entire planet when it comes to ai i would say there's actually a better way to get into paler right now given that paler has pulled back just a little bit we actually have a very good opportunity in front of us to sell put options and buy palen here for a much more favorable and optimal price versus just buying the shares alone all right guys we're going to jump into my screen right now you will notice something very special about the portfolio today well we're actually 20k short from that very special moment of what i've been saying we're about to hit 4 mil in the portfolio so we're on track here to make some big returns and i would say that paler is still one of my very favorite positions and actually i'm going to make a live trade right now on palen here it's finally a time when the market's open it's late in the evening for me but the market's open so we're going to make it now check this out on paler right now my average cost is $21.7 this is a very low price compared to the stock obviously at $60 per share it's at 61.89 right so i'm going to show you how to get a much more favorable price now guys just to remind you real quick i'm not going to spend too much time on why i like palante here but the three reasons are one i see a lot of billionaires buying this stock right we i've taken a look at ken griffin of citadel he posted his 13f not that he wants to post it but big uh organizations hedge funds when they have $100 million in assets they have to report what they're buying and what they're selling so ken griffin he's buying palons here hand over fist guys hand over fist he's buying this stock and i think that that's going to be a really interesting catalyst because he increased his position by 1,00% and guys you know earnings is not soon on pound here but i'm already starting on this channel i'm already beginning 2 and a half months early mark my words we're going to have some amazing earnings coming up and i'm going to give you a price target in a future video if you're subscribed to this one today we just want to cover how to sell puts and enter into paler for a good price and get that runup because i think due to the trump rally as well as you know just end of year stuff i do see the market continuing to rise we're in full-fledged bull market mode guys the market i see is very hot and i'm actually not worried right now i think we're going to get a really hot rally as well as the january effect so the january effect is something that a lot of experts call and anomaly and basically this january effect anomaly means the stock market goes up in january so hey guys for the next couple of months we have to make as much money as possible hand over fist guys hand over fist all right the second reason is topping estimates i saw that the revenue for palen here was astronomically high i've already sent in another video we went $20 million more than expected and then the third reason is and i already mentioned it is actually the earnings coming up okay so look i have over 300k invested in palance here right now this has been a big position for me in this portfolio and um i'm still very bullish so look check out my positions right now guys i think that the most optimal entry for palent here there's actually two optimal entries the first one let me tell you is the 55 cell put i would easily sell 55 cell put go as much as 10% of your portfolio i think 10% of your portfolio in palance here is honestly a no-brainer i wouldn't say that that's anything crazy or anything like out of the norm right we want to have 10 to 15 stocks in our portfolio that's just a typical and stand standard amount because when i was covering risk management back in college i was taking a risk management course the numbers showed that 12 stocks in your portfolio is basically diversified if you get 13 14 15 stocks yeah you get a little bit of benefit but it's diminishing returns think about it as you eat a first hamburger you're really hungry that first hand burger tastes like heaven right you're like oh god thank you so much for this hamburger but the second hamburger you're like well this is still good the third hamburger you don't want to eat it cuz you're full right the same thing with diversification that's the same way that it works you get diminishing returns which is one of the standard pr principles in economics hopefully i'm not talking too fast i just want to hit you guys with some fast um actionable insights on paler and how to make more money cuz i do respect your time so um we're going to keep this video short 55 cell put on paler that's what i would do for 1220 let me actually show you why i'm doing that right i'm going to go to trade paler options and i'm going to go to sell put option i'm going to show you the delta because i think delta is really important to understand when it comes to paler and any any option that you trade knowing delta tells you so much about the option a delta tells you the chance is that the option will go down to that price okay so if i go to the 55 option right here i'm going to open up some more watch i'm going to open up a lot more pounds here right in front of your eyes i'm not bsing you guys i have 300k into the stock i'm going to open up some more right now just to show you how much i support this stock and how much i believe in it guys i don't make videos on stocks i don't believe even if i can get a lot of views on this channel i do not do that i'm not going to sell out i'm only going to tell you stocks that i 100% i have my money in that's it if i'm not talk if i don't have my money in it i'm not going to recommend it to you guys i'm not going to cover that stock that's not how i am for me it's all about the truth okay so here's the 55 cell put look the delta is 0. 21 that means that there's a 21% chance of palance here reaching this price which honestly i you know that that means there's an 80% chance of me being successful i have an 80% success chance on this trade and a 21% chance that basically palent here will go below 55 but i'm not concerned $55 per share guys is a phenomenal price selling put options is what i personally call a non- losing strategy that's what i want for you guys i want you to have that safe passive income but i also want you guys to have non losing traits cuz i hate it when you know investors they go into a trade they lose money no i want to put you in trades that are so easy to make money that you just basically profit and you don't have to do too much work okay that's why selling puts for me you're going to get an optimal entry into palance here and that's where you really maximize profits if you're looking to maximize profits you don't always want to buy the stock at the current you know price so instead of buying it at 6181 i already covered a video on leaps but i'm also going to just say we're going to sell a 55 uh put option right here and you know i said i'm going to go big guys i said i'm going to go big so let me go let me go 20 contracts here and let me see that's going to be 107k bet and i'm going to collect some income right here and most importantly the income is nice guys that's cool but what's really cool is if pounds here pulls back to 55 56 i'm going to look like a genius because i'm getting paid to wait that's one of my sets i'm getting paid to wait or i'm getting paid to enter so either paid to wait or paid to enter either way this is going to be a beneficial position so i'm going to go for 1.37 just because i want to i want to do this quick i'm going to go closer to the bid i can go for 1.38 but i'm trying to get filled fast so i got 16 contracts filled right there boom i got 20 contracts filled i'm going to post this in my discord community right now as well every single trade that i make i post in my discord away we are fairly full right now but we still have some one-on-one spots open so if you're interested hit the first link in the description but look i have another play for you on pal here i said i have two plays for you i have a shortterm play right now december 20th so uh this one is uh we've already uh opened this up $2,700 in in cash collected premium now that's 2700 in cash collected premium and i count that as good as mine cuz that has actually entered my account i can i should have showed you my investing balance actually before i made this trade but i had 28k now i have 31k so so now my portfolio is at 31k but it was at 28 so but look i'm going to make another trade you'll see this trade though i'm going to make it a little bit smaller i don't want to tie up capital you know right now i want to make fast money i think right now there's really really good opportunities that's why i'm going for fast money but look i could i could also go for a little bit more safer of a play i know some of you guys are in that retirement zone where you're really going for that safety so i just showed you a really good play on palance here now i'm going to show you more of that safe passive income approach where uh you can have both guys you can have both you can have the 55 sellp put but you can also go for the 50 this would be a really low delta now to be honest the 55 is going to make you a lot more money but i'm just going to show this for some of the retirees okay so 50 cell put i'm going to go continue and i think this is good to have diversification across different expiration days all right something that goldman sachs taught me no other youtuber talks about that because they didn't work at goldman sachs they don't have that experience there when i was working with large portfolios i've seen really big portfolios of ceos that had 50 million $150 million in their own stock and they basically i had to be a an expert at risk management understanding their portfolio now i wasn't going on the meetings guys i'm being really clear i was not a financial i'm not a financial adviser now and i was not a financial adviser before i was working with financial advisers and private wealth management as well as a financial analyst and a hedge fund analyst and a quant analyst i had four jobs and i i worked in consulting as well so i've had a whole lot of jobs i i was a big fan of getting experience learning everything i could and then applying it in my own portfolio and that's why guys we're at multiple full seven figures and that's why because the shortcut is knowledge and mentorship knowledge and mentorship i paid a ton of money for knowledge and mentorship so look we're going to go ahead and do the three contracts right now nothing crazy i just want to show you this example and i want to put my money where my mouth is and go heavier on pents here this is going to be u i'm going to get $335 nothing crazy but look when you have positions like this on tesla on nvidia you guys know that i've i've been right all along with tesla nvidia and palance here so i just post posted that trade you see now i have three contracts sh that i sold short this is a very low delta if you want higher income i would go for the 55 delta if you want really high del uh actually let me give you a third play right now uh 60 cellp put would also be fantastic entry guys it would be fantastic uh entry this is a little bit higher on the delta this is a little bit higher than my sweet spot my sweet spot is 30 delta here the delta is a little higher than what i like but still this would be a very good entry and $4 this would be over about 7% return in 60 days okay a 7% return i just know 7 * 6 is 42 and this is 425 so we're at little bit over 7% return if i click this right here you'll see that i have to put up about $5,500 worth of uh capital now let me tell you why the the strike price here is 60 but i'm collecting about 425 which makes my total capital outlay 5,575 don't worry about the max loss the max loss is incorrect that max loss just means if pound here went down to zero you would lose 55 $0000 but paler is not going to zero so forget about that you don't have to worry about it it's not going to happen so there we go that's the place that i would have to maximize paler and have a better entry into paler stock right now versus just buying the shares and i think that this stock is going to have really good performance so if you're trying to make more money hand over fist i hope you've already been making money handover fist we've been growing the subscriber base here on this youtube channel a lot and that's because we've been

2024-11-25,6lfcSLiyjho,"kind: captions language: en nvidia reported some big numbers and i have an idea what's going to happen next in december before earnings i correctly predicted by saying this mark my words what's going to happen is nvidia will beat earnings but the stock won't rise too much because expectations already baked in so what will happen next let's explain why earnings did not make a really big dent in the stock and while the earnings were so fantastic yet the stock didn't move exactly as i mentioned and most importantly what do we do next and how do we make more money on nvidia going forward that's the most important thing in our mind and that's the most important thing that we care about is how do we make more money in this market so that's exactly what i'm going to cover in this video i'm going to show you a couple of plays we're going to dive into my portfolio by the way my portfolio just hit $4 million as you can see on the screen right now we have $4 million $1,000 so exactly as we've been making money hand over fist guys bicep over tricep i haven't hit the gym it's been been a lot of work lately and some travel so i'm in a new location but look long story short let me just get to the point here i respect your time the whole point here is nvidia had earnings the stock didn't really rise that much which is exactly what i thought would happen so i'm going to pull up nvidia right in front of you and i'm going to show you my my position here let's see if you guys like this format this really raw format of me filming videos but you guys already know you get my authentic self no matter what 14177 and and this stock really didn't pump anywhere right so i'm fairly flat on the stock in this portfolio i've had nid for ages and ages um but i started a new position by selling puts by doing covered calls as you guys can see here on the screen i have several positions which have all done very well i mean i recommended doing 15 uh3 and 155 covered calls those did not hit in the money i have the 148 uh covered call which is also making money i 132 put which is making money so there has been several positions here which um have been making money sorry if i have my finger my fingers in your face it feels a little bit weird we'll see what happens with this video's comment i'm trying a new style here in my hotel guys i i'm going i'm going to look at my notes right here so excuse me if i'm not looking at the camera so look i i don't think they they really mattered for the stock too much even though they had good earnings guys it's all about expectations and the expectations were already high guys so like i'm saying the most important thing that you need to understand is that the stock market is an expectations game nobody actually cares how well the stock did nobody actually cares about anything other than what they personally expect because the shock factor is exactly what makes a stock rise or makes it fall it's all about emotions the market isn't really a science and that's why in my discord community when i do my monday and wednesday uh trading sessions i always say guys listen here's the facts here's what i see here's here's my the the facts but here is also my opinion here's my intuition because i've been doing this for 10 years that's what makes me the top option coach in the world is i have the biggest experience and sometimes i do make my decisions based on hey i think this is what i'm seeing from other folks i'm taking an eye i'm looking at other people because this game is all an expectations game it's pretty common sense if you can understand social velocity which i am always tracking i'm tracking social velocity very heavily and actually this market that we're in right now is is honestly a purely social velocity and momentum-driven market there's not a whole lot of science going on if you look at some of these companies they have really high priced earnings ratios and they don't always really make a lot of sense a lot of these mag s stocks actually don't make sense on paper which is why you need you need someone or you need yourself to understand why this company is going up so much so look i said i i track social velocity a lot but i also want to point out and i want to show you a quick clip of bank of america vivic arya as he explains it really perfectly this is going to be a one minute clip i said what do you think the disappointment is here i mean there was disappointment is that yeah the supply chain um you know is scrutinized very closely uh it's followed by a lot of uh people and every time the company uh reports uh expectations continue to uh build up naturally for this size and what the stock has uh done uh but there are always constraints uh when it comes to uh not just getting the supply but actually building the products getting them uh to customers and what we have seen from nvidia over the last two years is that uh they are able to beat their own guidance by two to2 and a half billion dollars consistently you know last time they guided 32 and a half billion and they reported 35 billion so that's why i'm not surprised to see uh them not exactly come to the high end of where the whisper expectations are but if i look at the usual range of beats they have we will come pretty close i think once they actually uh report the quarter so i think this is more a case of you know expectations in a transitions quarter uh it's nothing to do with the long-term fundamentals of the company all right guys so look uh keeping this video short as possible i'm going to wrap up with my notes here and then i'm going to jump into the stock and how i'm planning to how i'm planning to trade nvidia stock h my my fingers in in the in the in the in the camera shop nvidia i'm going to probably do a couple of things i'm going to sell covered calls and pretty much continue to run the wheel strategy and i do have some cash and collateral here it is before market open but i am going to open up this position because i am light on nvidia in my current portfolio so i am going to open up a position on it now look to finish up with my notes i think expectations drive the stock market period hands down period end of story okay and nvidia's recent earnings are a textbook are a textbook all right smiling right here a text textbook example and case which you guys have to learn and never make this mistake again okay i wouldn't call it a mistake cuz we're still making money with the stock going sideways but if you bought you know a lot of call options or if you're really aggressive and buying options in the market market that is a mistake especially for a company that has already the highest expectations possible like everyone is already in the stock so that's why selling options is so profitable on on nvidia and i think we're going to get a lot of upward movement on nvidia this stock is going to double but it might take some time like it's it's late november right i think in 2025 we're going to see this stock basically it could double it could double you just can't time it don't time the market be on the trend be on the trend like you guys need get rich overnight no you don't get rich for sure like uncle henry right here we're at $4 million right i thought i would hit this in january and february i hit it earlier that's what happens when you ask for less you get more when you ask for more you get less that just seems to be the case with with how life works all right so look nvidia success in ai is no secret guys and the traders were anticipating that these results would happen well in advance right a lot of if you look at nvidia's history it just continues to beat so uh traders know it's going to beat that's why i told you it's going to beat i was i never try to predict too much in this in my videos but i literally predicted nvidia because it's not hard to predict it's not that i'm a genius it's just that i have a lot of experience so i i can tell what's going to happen right and i can't predict it but with nvidia it was it was easy it was easy so guys moving forward the real opportunity lies in identifying whether nvidia can deliver unexpected upside okay unexpected not expected if it's expected it's expected it's nothing special unexpected in areas like new ai partnerships or accelerating demand and key markets in the future that's where i think the answer if you ask me can nvidia surprise again and again and to the upside i think the answer is yes it can and i think that's why the stock is going to double and that's why i'm going to show you some specific option plays in just a second but look if you want to know how long i don't know because that's a fool's game to play it's a fool's game to play of when nvidia will rise a whole lot that's just a fool's game i just know it will i don't know when all right we're going to have to find a scammer to tell you when i don't know when that's that's just a scammy thing nobody knows when not no no professional okay now look i've been in this game for a decade and money is really easy if you know how to analyze and properly analyze a stock and properly analyze the option and long term is where it's at because great companies like nvidia thrive over the long term right what happens is they keep growing their revenue because they keep gaining contracts and customers and business and they keep innovating and they either they grab more market share or you know the mar the pie is growing right all the fang other stocks are buying nvidia gpus so nvidia could technically lose a little bit of market share but if the pi continues to expand and get a lot larger then that's also fine that's how a company grows they just need to make more revenue now listen after revenue they need to make more earnings in bottom line profits so that is going to happen naturally and nvidia has some insanely high profit margins okay really really high profit margin in fact it's so high that you may see some government regulation down the road saying that it's a monopoly okay we don't have to worry about that right now we are going to think how do we make money today and how what's the future look like yes they may have some regulatory issues down the road potentially but that's not something to be really concerned about all right so relax there i'm just trying to give you guys an objective view of the good and the bad because i want you guys to have the full picture all right so last but not least here's what we will do i'm going to jump into my portfolio and uh let's go to uh i'm going to sell a put option i already have a put option that i have sold i'm going to tell you what a good entry is i would probably go for two different expiration days okay one is going to be um one is going to be december 20th and other one will be uh january guys i'm buying this thing hand over fist bicep over tricep all right got to hit the gym a little bit but you know this thing is doing really well it's doing really well and it doesn't have to go to the moon to make a lot of money i'm doing just fine growing my portfolio to $4 million and a big part of that is just options expiring on nvidia and just you know monthly expirations so i'm going to sell a put and i'm going to go for something a little bit more aggressive now that earnings have come in we have had an iv crush okay an iv crush let me explain to you lots of education in this video all right and ivy crush basically is pre- earnings okay pre- earnings what happens is the stock will have high implied volatility all right so when i showed you guys the call options before earnings uh if i remember correctly this is like a few days ago uh before earnings let me go to the option i was looking at which was the 152 covered call uh the implied volatility was i think it was around 96 if you guys watched that last video which many of you did so i think now it has fallen by half okay the implied volatility has fallen by literally half and that's just a function of before earnings you have one of the highest implied volatility times that a stock can have right and that's because a lot of investors are expecting a big move because there's an expected big move implied volatility is higher to account for that expected big move so the options are going to be like twice as expensive which is why buying options before earnings can be very risky but can also be very profitable it's a double-edged sword okay it's a double-edged sword of of what can happen so right now that earnings have already come in implied volatility is low it's less attractive but it's still high enough to make tons of money and because it's still high enough to make tons of money i would simply just stick to the easy wheel strategy that i've been covering for the past 5 years on this youtube channel we're about to hit my 5year anniversary so i hope that you make another you know thousands and thousands of dollars by just sticking to my simple formula of covered calls all right so what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to look at the 135 you can see here that the delta is 30 oh my goodness i just picked the random option and it happens to be a 30 delta which is exactly my sweet spot of what i say is my sweet spot 30 delta how did i do that well honestly it's just because an out- of-the money option that's just a little bit lower is typically around a 30 delta right so i just intuitively picked a 135 strike and it happens to be 30 delta perfect implied volatility 43 that's pretty good uh implied volatility of 43 is is also like a good implied volatility it's it's it's fairly high the volume is amazing it's at 8,600 that means that you're going to get filled in this trade fast as a as a a mf right that's as a mother right uh i don't curse on these videos just trying to make these a little fun today uh the volume is 8600 it's fast you're going to get filled fast bid ask 335 340 that that's that's a perfect tight bid ask that's that's tight as as a bicep curl all right that's tight that's good the tighter the bid ask the better because when it's a wide bit ask spread all right you basically are not going to get um a good fill you have to basically play around with the bid ask spread and most likely than not you're not going to get filled for the best rate which just means that you have slippage costs all right that's what i call slippage cost you're just losing some money it's like it's like a ferrari it's like you're trying to sell a car a ferrari or toyota it doesn't really matter let's just say a ferrari okay it's a $200,000 car you're trying to sell it on craigslist now i don't know why you would sell a car on craigslist a ferrari but let's say someone comes to you and then they they just say hey i buy it right now for 199,000 you're like dude all right fine right you're not going to say no but you see see that's that's $1,000 slippage cost which is right it's like what 0.5% cuz 1% would be two grand and then he just knocked you down by 1,000 so it's a half a percent loss it's kind of a big deal guys it it kind of adds up when you're making many trades over a single month right if there's a high slippage cost you can be short a couple hundred bucks and in a year that's a few thousand i mean it it really does add up so you want a tight bit ask spread all right so i would go ahead and sell the 135 uh here for december now also for january i would go to january 17 this is the traditional expiration and for january i would also look you can go a little bit lower so look this is the good news with with going out further in time so you can go lower so for example let me pick the 130 and i bet you this is going to be around a 30 delta again uh 26 delta so it's a little bit lower so you can see how i actually went from 135 to 130 but it's even safer like it's literally even a lower delta so the more time you give an option this is why i do like to do monthly trading and two month trading is because the more time that you give an option the more premium you collect up front so a lot of you guys that are in that retirement zone that have a couple hundred, which is uh many of you guys and i work with uh i work with folks oneon-one and i do zoom chats and i just text them back and forth all market hours that's what my one-on-one looks like i actually give you my time and i see a lot of folks that have a few hundred, and they're easily just selling puts and creating a really solid income source right now in this market $10,000 a month is easy it's just easy like i have so many students that are making like 8% 15% 20% in a month and that's it's just an easy market i don't assume it'll always be easy there's good times there's bad times there's seasons right in everything in life right and with nvidia right now i think it's we're still in the early innings i don't know if i could say early in innings but the mid innings where we're still going to get some more uh momentum upside which is why i'm still planning to cover the stock on a very regular basis and keep you guys up to date if you're subscribed to running covered calls selling puts and just the wheel strategy now let me tell you real quick about how to run the wheel strategy and manage it uh i can show you an example as well so look you sell a put right on nvidia at 135 or 130 whichever you personally prefer one is not better than the other i just showed you two plays i didn't click it but here let me click it it's $400 in income one is not better than the other guys they're both fine all right they're both meaning that you will have to buy nvidia at 135 or 130 if nvidia pops down or declines below those strike prices now look if that happens at expiration you don't need to do anything you don't need to roll anything you don't need to do anything guys i'm a fan of doing less and creating passive safe consistent income i see a lot of people over trading and that's a big mistake and i teach passive income so you want to wait until expiration for these put options that you sell just hang out do do other things in life if it goes below this is how you manage it all right a lot of people want to know oh should you close it should you roll it no no listen when we are selling puts on a high quality company the whole reason we sell puts is because we don't mind owning shares and we want to get paid to own the shares for a cheaper price than the market so if you want to manage it or roll it you just watch too many youtube videos about you know other folks that tell you you need to manage it and roll it they don't really know what they're talking about what you need to actually do is just to hold the position until expiration get ass signed and then sell covered calls you want to sell covered calls above your average cost so look on nvidia if the average cost is 130 okay cool what you go do is then you sell call options now these are not going to be accurately priced right now because basically i showed you the 130 and in the future if it were to be 130 these options would be worth less right just they would be worth less like if i were to go down to the $130 it's not going to be worth $17 that's $1,700 it's going to be worth a lot less maybe it's $400 $500 who knows uh right now but nonetheless you want to sell covered calls at your average cost or above so if you got it at 130 then you're just going to sell 135 covered calls and essentially you're just going to collect premium and then if it goes up to 135 it's fine guys it is it's fine you you made money okay you don't need to do too much if you follow my strategies they're very easy to print money with doing less work that's that's my strategy and that's what i teach on this youtube channel if you guys have questions feel free to email me down below i'm going to add my email if you want one-on-one coaching i am the only and best one-on-one coach on option trading and i can show you how to make $10,000 or more per month if you guys want one-on-one coaching i still have 12 spots left for one-on-one coaching this year it has been an amazing journey with all my one-on-one students many of them doctors lord engineers but you can be anyone you can just be a hardworking professional or someone that's close to retirement that wants to create a big source of income really scale up their portfolio and just wants to you know really learn these strategies i teach i show i show you how to fish but i also give you fish so this is the best program that if you want to scale up especially in these times i think there's so much money to be made these next three months like legitimately i hit $4 million in my portfolio in this market we might even hit 4.2 million 4.5 million in the next couple cp of months right times are good so yeah take advantage of these times stay safe invest safe

2024-11-26,Z38SDPa7TKk,"kind: captions language: en whether you're almost ready to retire or you just want to make more money in this economy covered calls are one of the best ways to produce consistent safe and passive income my portfolio has surpassed $4 million as you can see and we're on our way to 5 million now and a lot of this has to do with the covered call strategy that i'm going to reveal in this video i'll show you with examples how you can do this for yourself and if you stick to the end of the video i'm also going to show you ways to avoid making mistakes using covered calls so when doing a covered call you want to have a 100 shares i'm going to be using my notes and my portfolio here to go through some live examples you can actually see that i have a significant amount of covered calls already open in my portfolio you can see i have a covered call on amazon i have a covered call on nvidia i have some covered calls on palen here and in general covered calls have been a fantastic way for me to generate consistent income so you do need to have 100 shares but you can still do this with a small account portfolio because you can have 100 shares of a cheaper stock and there's plenty of names out there one of them is american airlines there's a lot of cheap stocks that you can use that you can run 100 shares buy 100 shares and essentially sell covered calls now i'm going to be showing you an example right now using nvidia because nvidia has been one of my favorite stocks that i've been covering a lot on the channel so i'm going to go to nvidia stock right now and i'm going to show you how you can basically run the covered call strategy and i think right now is a very interesting time because nvidia is just under $140 per share and by the way the options i'm going to tell you right now the options on nvidia are absolutely delicious they are like the best options that you can possibly ask for for so for nvidia it's currently at $138 per share and i do have uh 300 shares not that much and i want to actually acquire some more shares so what i'm going to do right now is i'm actually going to buy some shares let me just go to my account and see how much money i have i have 25k which is not a whole lot but i can still work with 25k so what i'm going to do is i'm going to invest and buy a 100 more shares than i have right now so i'm going to go to buy nvidia do uh so this is set to dollars i'm going to go to shares going to go to buy 100 shares you can actually buy 200 shares and i'll be slightly on margin and i'm okay with that because i'm going to be collecting a lot of premium later today when i have my discord trading session so i'm going to be slightly in the margin which is fine i'm going to go ahead and buy 200 shares right here boom okay i'm actually going to reduce my margin um right now i'll show you what this looks like so check this out if i go to my account right now you will notice that i have margin used now of $2,000 you can see this little gold thing right here so i'm using $2,600 wor margin however i'm going to show you that i'm going to pay this down right now so i'm going to go back to nvidia i'm going to sell um a few covered calls so i currently have 500 shares and i've already had some covered calls at 148 i'm going to show you how to sell some covered calls right now and it's actually going to bring my margin usage down guys and that's because when you sell a covered call essentially get paid right away you get paid the cash right away the premium that you collect on the option so of course what i'm looking for is i'm looking for a high quality stock and i'm looking for strong fundamentals okay i'm also looking for strong technicals all right so i pulled up nvidia on a chart i'm going to just show you how the chart looks like right now okay you can see that that i have a few different indicators here and this is the new view of yaku finance so used to this view however i'll just show you what i'm using i'm using the binger band 20 and two you can see that there's this bowling your band channel and right now nvidia is actually somewhere in the middle okay so it's in the middle of the bowling your band which tells me we're neither expensive nor are we like really cheap we're just somewhere in between which is actually a really good time to do covered calls this is the most important thing that you should actually look at which is technical analysis on nvidia because nvidia doesn't really trade on fundamental analysis i've said this on many other stocks that i was absolutely correct on like palen here and tesla they don't trade on on fundamentals these stocks trade on technicals especially in this bull market right now we can make money hand over fist guys or you know bicep over tricep as i say on a company like nvidia and as long as it's not at the you know peak peak then we should be okay right so right now it's not at the peak it's not at 151 so we're more than good to sell covered calls the green flag i'm waving the green flag right now we're definitely a green flag the rsi is also 4 7 so we're right in the middle we're right in the middle on the bowling your band we're also in the middle on the rsi and the in the moving average we actually just popped below the moving average which is actually a buy sign okay so there's a buy sign or a buy signal on nvidia so i'm saying right now is a fantastic time to jump into nvidia you can actually see some of the stocks that i follow there on the right hand side of my screen so yeah for nvidia what we're going to do is i'm going to go to sell i'm going to sell a covered call option now expiration dat is really important and i'm always looking for a stock that you know has pulled down a little bit at least so i can get a better price and for nvidia the stock has pulled down below 140 so i think this is a a really really really good time guys to jump into the company and to invest at a fair price i'm always looking at what is fair because it's actually not the option strategy that's the most important it's the stock selection itself which is what i do in my discord community all the time i'm always looking for stocks that are fairly and reasonably valued because if a company isn't fairly reasonably valued then uh there is no strategy not the wheel strategy that i covered not selling puts not covered calls none of those strategies will work however when you find a stock that has really good strong uh fundamentals and technicals and it's a good growth company like nvidia is for many reasons i've already mentioned in prior videos right ai the management is good um the trend is good so all these things i'm paying very close attention to that's what makes the company a good buy and covered calls is just the strategy that you use to generate income on the stock that your reite uh like so so this strategy still makes sense to me and even if you have a small account even if you have to put a little bit more money than you want into nvidia i think it makes sense nvidia is one of the top stocks along with apple to be honest with you i do a lot of boring stocks where i make a lot of money in my private community because on youtube i can't always cover all the boring stocks because people aren't interested in them but i'm making money like hand over fist literally on many other names and nvidia just happens to be one of the top names that i am sharing on youtube publicly so a covered call what i do let's talk about management let's talk about opening the position and closing the position first of all let me just open this position to begin with so i'm going to go for december 20th for me a good expiration is anywhere from 1 to six weeks even a little bit longer is fine because i'm all i'm all about passive safe income i'm not about day trading and i don't want to do too much work i just want to create enough income to uh you know live a good retired lifestyle which is you know fairly early for me but uh for many folks i mean you can really retire with just covered calls or or the wheel or you know any of the other strategies that i cover on this channel i do specialize in in retirement and that's what i do a lot with my one-on-one coaching i do a lot of retirement strategies so um i have the 148 let's go back to the technicals here you can see if i if i zoom in we had a double top pattern we had a actually like a quant tuple top pattern right here right usually it's a double top like this is a double top but then again we had like another double top or a triple top i mean the stock has really been at these levels for quite some time and this is since uh you know this is for for about a month now uh the stock has just been sideways sideways action and unless there's a big earning event or there's a big catalyst guys i i think the stock will continue to go sideways i don't really see it going above the 140 roughly 146 level i think at 146 we're going to get a little bit of short-term resistance and it's all about just eyeing it and understanding where's support where is resistance for me right now shortterm and video is going to have some one uh resistance at 146 so right now i am going to go for this 146 covered call and we had $2,600 in margin i'm going to show you how i'm going to reduce my like the capital that i'm putting up right now so i'm going to go for two contracts okay i'm going to go for 325 here or actually let me go for 320 because the bid just went down to 320 and i want to get filled here as fast as possible because i respect your time i don't want to take too much time here beautiful so i collected $639 194 and actually if i go to my account right now you can see it actually did get reduced from 2600 down to 1,900 i'm about to make a lot more money during my live trading session that i do in discord but you can see here how just you know just the covered calls here already kind of put cash into my account so when you doing covered calls the cash does go into your account immediately and that is spendable cash that you can use right away and by the way the portfolio is just doing phenomenally like i'm up 1% today this is the easiest market to make money in we are fairly full for one-on-one coaching we do have a few more spots left if you want to hit the first link in description you can and you can have a free consultation to learn more about one-on-one coaching but we're we're fairly full right now we're making a lot of money you know i wish there was there was more of me but i'm trying to share as much free content as i can here because i really care about you subscribers all right let's go back to my notes here i think the one of the most important things that you guys want to watch out for is delta okay when i'm selling options i'm typically going for a 30 delta on the selling put side and the covered call side okay right now the i actually didn't even look at delta because i've been trading for such a long time that often times i just either use my intuition or i use technical analysis but i do want to pop back in to the option here so i pulled up the 146 uh option that i just sold and the delta is actually 33 so you can see here how i instinctively already sold an option that was around a 30 delta without even looking right as i'm making this video it's unscripted i don't have a plan for this video i'm just sharing everything i know from the past 10 years of experience that i've had from working on wall street goldman sachs my finance degree all these experiences i'm trying to share them uh as much as possible online here for you guys because i want to make sure that my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff because everyone else is kind of copying me people that run boot camps and that that have programs they're kind of mimicking my programs cuz i've been here first and i've trained a lot of other option youtuber so i just want to democratize option trading education give you guys as much free info as possible i don't think you you always have to pay for something when i can give it to you for free unless you want one-on-one coaching that's cool too but you don't have to so look the next thing that i want to cover in my notes is i'm super confident super confident on nvidia just absolutely super confident and a lot of that has to do with the ai trend with management but i'm also just super confident because i've been trading for such a long time now i understand how to manage this position if it goes against me look on a covered call in most cases if the stock goes to 146 for example andv is shing around 138 so let me show you back on the chart here if it goes to 146 and it starts to reach this top i'm not going to be worried i'm not going to be concerned whatsoever only if we break out of this top pattern then i will say huh what's going on here so if it breaks out of this pattern above 146 towards 150 then i need to either close this position all right i need to close it out if i don't want to lose my shares or i can roll this position higher now look there is a third scenario okay there's three scenarios scenario maybe four scenarios okay here's one scenario one scenario is the stock goes down all right well the covered call strategy will have losses because it is a bullish strategy it's a neutral to bullish strategy depending on the strike that you pick right now i'm showing you a bullish strategy so if the stock goes down you're going to lose money on the stock but you have some margin of safety have that cushion from the covered call itself however of course you know a lot of people will say hey i'm losing money yes you will be losing money but so you would also lose money if you're a stockholder but with the covered call you're actually doing better so a covered call is safer than just investing a stock so scenario one if the stock goes down you just hold your covered call and really nothing happens to the covered call itself you you make money on the covered call and you lost money on the stock as anyone else would on the stock when it goes down now if the stock goes sideways you will make money on the covered call itself which is still amazing and the stock will make nothing but you've made money overall the third case is if the stock approaches 146 but doesn't hit 146 that's fine that's good you're making money on the stock and you're making money on the option that's actually the ideal scenario you know nvidia is trading at 138 pretty much right now on 3797 what's going to happen is if it goes to 140 that's beautiful that means the stock went up you made money and the option decays and pretty much expires out of the money and then you can sell a covered call again if it goes to 142 or 14 3 you're still in really really good shape now only if it pops above 146 and continues okay if it hits 146 you can be as concerned as you want my uh opinion my non-financial advice here right i'm not a financial adviser but i'm better not a financial adviser in my opinion if it goes above 146 you just don't do anything yet i know it's concerning but really don't make the mistake of closing positions too early way too many traders i see do that and that's also why as a coach i have coaches myself i have mentors myself i i'm connected with some of the golden sachs folks that i used to work for uh with not yeah well for yeah with and for so for me i'm always looking to gain an edge and get better and um i think one of the biggest mistakes is just cutting positions too early and i i make that mistake myself so do not make that mistake if it hits the strike you still have to assess do is it going to go higher and in most cases it's not because you see the top of the bowling her band here is is roughly um 151 so it can't really go that much higher so in this scenario that i'm giving you it's really an easy money play i'm literally giving you an easy money play on how to make easy money on nvidia because it is likely to go up but it's not likely to go up that much which is what i said in the last video that i made um basically saying that earnings will come in hot hot they came in hot guys the earnings came in like fire but the thing is everyone already expected they already expect it guys that the earnings will be good so for that reason the stock did not rise a lot and right now we do not have a catalyst to to make the stock go up in the short term so we can make money steadily and safely and pretty passively by just waiting up until the next earnings and right now the stock will probably have some type of earnings drift but you know typically earnings drift either goes down or up and nvidia just didn't go anywhere which is exactly what i said i thought that nvidia would go up towards 150 um but you know it's under 140 so if it was my bet i would say that we're still going to go back up to 140 142 something like that we're going to see the stock rise especially right now into the end of the year and into into the january effect as well as what hedge funds are doing when i look at the volume of what hedge funds are trading right now it's it's bonkers they're just making lots of money and they're putting a lot of capital to work and i think a lot of that is obviously going to go into nvidia and just looking at the support we have strong support we we really do have strong support but we also have a clear resistance which is why the covered call strategy right now makes the most sense and like i said the covered co strategy is a bullish strategy so i am moderately bullish okay don't get confused a lot of people think oh i'm crazy bullish no i'm actually moderately bullish and i've said that in many of my videos which makes me very different from um the hype youtubers out there some hype youtubers are like oh it's going to go to the moon i'm not like that guys i'm just trying to make right now on this market 10% per month or you know a little bit more because this is a hot market and i've gotten this portfolio lots of lots of upside um and i've grown it pretty quickly i actually need to take money out of it because the portfolio is getting too big and a lot of a lot of you guys think this is impossible for you to do yourself but you are absolutely wrong a lot of you if you're listening right now i'm telling you you can do it you can grow your portfolio from five to six figures and then six to seven it's all about compound interest the money gets really easy if you have the right strategies and you're picking the right stocks i mean so many of my students just follow me they don't even know what they're doing sometimes and they just follow me and they print money now obviously i want everyone to know how to trade for themselves because my interest is is not to have someone on the hook like a financial advisor and to charge them fees like many financial advisers do i just you know obviously my time is valuable and i but i teach everything i teach everything right up front i don't hold anything back because i want more successful students at this point we have many of them uh so that's what i like doing so look one more thing that i want to say and this is actually i have a few more things to say this video is getting long i apologize i'm trying to give you so much in this video if you appreciate it please do subscribe i would really appreciate it if you do look one thing that i want you guys if you're a beginner or not a beginner this strategy is all about generating income you don't have to get fancy with the covered call strategy please you do not need to just use it on high quality companies literally nvidia is one of them or you can use it on different stocks i'm just trying to give you my blueprint if you want to have other stocks that's fine as well now check this out if you want to make more money on the covered call strategy you can actually go a little bit closer to the money i'm going to show you the tradeoff right now on uh on nvidia stock i'm going to show you the tradeoff that you're going to be making so i showed you the covered call okay let me go back to december 20th let me show you a little bit of a variation all right so let me show you strike selection and and picking optimal strike is really important i showed you the 146 but look let's say that right now you're afraid of a market crash okay which i do i do see some folks asking me my in my community when i'm making my calls what are you going to do when there's a market crash listen i don't try to predict market crashes and i always have a joke me and my team my team i have i have a coach on my team my one-on-one coaching it's me and another coach and during my onboarding process you know when you guys book a call you schedule a call using my first link we have a consultation and during the consultation people say what are you going to do during that crash and i give them the same joke every time i say listen you know michael bur michael bur predicted 2008 right everyone's like yeah he's a genius right but something that you guys didn't know is michael bur has predicted 17 of the last two crashes 17 of the last two crashes you get what i'm saying do you get that joke he overpredicted more crashes than there are so i'm not going to be doing that guys the reason why i have the best results hands down on youtube um they're the only investors that are better than me are not on youtube i'm telling you i watch all the other channels telling you they're i'm the best option coach the only people that are better than me are actually working on wall street and they're not they're not on youtube i didn't want to be on wall street because it's i don't want to get up early and i don't want to go to work i don't want to wear a suit and tie i enjoy traveling and look i'm just i'm comfortable here right i like coaching a lot more and helping individuals i don't want to really necessarily help all these corporations and everything i want to help the everyday person so sorry if i'm going on a t i'm just trying to give you the full the full picture here look sell sell call i'm going to go for a sell call that could be 140 why would you do this this goes back to what i was just saying about predicting crashes if you're one of those guys or gals right i have lots of women that i coach as well i love working with women uh there needs to be more women in finance and managing money but that's besides the point the 140 covered call okay this will be a lot closer to the money this is a lot closer so you have less upside but the premium here is higher it's 540 the closer that you go into money right the closer that you go to the current stock price the more premium that you will collect okay why because there's a higher chance of this actually happening you're going to get compensated more for this higher chance you see option traders are not dumb they understand the chances and the probability that the option will go into the money that's why the delta here is going to be 048 it's going to be a lot higher than the 33 delta that i traded before and because the delta here is higher you're going to get paid a lot more you're going to get paid almost $550 now look the other reason i keep showing you guys in nvidia is because i'm a big proponent of trading options that are liquid liquid options are better liquid means there's a lot of volume there's a lot of open interest and the bid ask spread is tight this is extremely important guys i'm always looking at showing you guys what is the most profitable not what is the most hype not what the most interesting is what is the most profitable because i know when i make you guys money you do end up wanting to get some coaching with me either way i want to make you money i'm not looking for the hype stuff so look i wanted to cover spy in this video as well in trading on spy i won't have time to do that as this video is getting long if you guys want an spy video let me know down in the comments below i also do have another spy video that you can

2024-11-27,DdK02X_6890,"kind: captions language: en tesla stock is up over 40% year-to date and a lot of my students are asking me is it still okay to buy tesla stock and how do i maximize my profits and make the most amount of money right now on tesla stock using option even though tesla stock is up a significant amount i found a very big reason i think you need to pay attention to that is actually going to make tesla rise more up to $400 per share in 2025 in my opinion i just sat down and over a few hours of time researching tesla i redid my price target and i'm going to show you why i think tesla is worth this much i'm also going to show you a leap option and how to profit off of tesla here in the next few months now look i know that some people don't have enough time so if you want a one minute summary and you have to balance out of this video totally understand you need to leave here's a one minute summary okay first tesla stock will go to $400 per share due to self-driving and having a bigger impact tesla stock will go up to $400 per share due to self-driving having a bigger impact than car sales themselves second thing i'm going to cover is elon musk will influence trump and the white house as they develop the relationship and i think there's going to be two really good freebies for tesla one of them is going to be regulatory favoritism the other one is going to be trade and tariff um negotiations that are going to help tesla a lot now three the actual play i'm going to make in this video is going to be buying a leap option at 330 strike price i'm going to personally put 5% of my money into this leap option play on tesla and the expiration will be for september 2025 so i'm going to go out till september 2025 and buy a leap option and most likely i'm also going to sell some calls to subsidize and make the leap cheaper but nonetheless i'm bullish so i'm going to be buying the 330 call option and i believe tesla is going to go to 400 and uh and the last one is i just want to wrap up the little summary here it's going to be pretty clear guidance for me personally that tesla is going to have disproportionate returns here in uh the rest of 20124 and going into 2025 i think we'll see $400 per share in the first quarter or the second quarter of 2 so there's my summary if you don't have time go ahead go bounce and do your do your thing and i'll see you see you guys later but uh for the folks that have time let's jump into the full explanation right so by the way the portfolio is doing really well we're at $4 million so that's amazing i'm going to open up tesla right now and go to my position here on tesla and tesla's currently trading at $342 per share i do have a th000 shares which is about 8 and a half% of my portfolio i have 1,000 shares at $118 this is a play that i put out in discord i'm currently up $125,000 and i have several different option plays one that i recently opened up is actually a sellp put position but i'm actually going to open up a new leap play in this video so you guys are really in store for some for some really good sauce here on how to make more money now i first want to cover before i go into like what i'm going to do i want to tell you why i'm going to do it because i think it's really important you need to understand why i'm doing certain things so then you can be a better investor and make more money and and reach retirement and hit hit the goals that you want to hit all right so here's the reasoning why first of all i'm going to i'm looking at my notes here regulatory favorit ism for evs okay that's the first reason i have that i think you need to pay attention to and elon musk guys it's not even a question he is going to impact donald trump in in the white house why do you think they're they're buddies right typically people are actually not usually friends unless they have a joint benefit to each other okay even you and your friend you probably help each other whether it's laughing or money or whatever when two people come together it's for a reason and politics is for money politics is straight up money i al actually think democrats republican same side they're just making money on us right really clear so why is elon musk becoming buddy buddy with trump well the reason is can you guess it it's money all right real simple real straightforward elon musk could influence trump to maintain or enhance policies that support ev such as infrastructure investments guys as an example that's ev charging networks that's a really big deal because i have a friend who has a tesla and he doesn't really enjoy driving long distance because you have to plan ahead so when there's more charging networks when there better cost better price win win win win across the consumer and tesla as a company that's a really big deal guys telling you that's going to be a really big thing it's going to streamline i think if trump streamlines regulations more specifically for autonomous driving that's going to be a game changer that's going to be a complete game changer because autonomous driving not i don't even i can't even say this is an opinion it's just basically a fact the price of earnings multiple on autonomous driving since it's like a software um revenue stream is going to be way more valuable than the core car business when tesla sells a car okay that justifies is one multiple but the reason why they are going to hit a $2 trillion market cap and this company is going to crush it is because of ai autonomous driving and all of these software trends that we see software guys goes for multiples that are way higher than traditional businesses and that's why from the very beginning tesla has been valued more than gm and all these legacy automakers um because software has better margins way better recurring margins high margins okay so that's the first thing right now was second thing for regulations is trade and tariff negotiations all right must could leverage his influence to push for favorable trade agreements or reduce tariffs okay reduced tariffs also going to be a really big deal because that ev tax cra credit of $7,500 or so is going to go away so right now musk has to be quick he has to be really quick the timing has to be impeccable because as these ev tax credits go away the tesla vehicle is you know in certain states right it's not in every state but it's going to be a less favorable option for for the consumer to pick so if they if tesla wants the consumer to still go for tesla then they obviously need the pricing to make sense economics has to make sense okay economics pretty much has to make sense in everything unless unless you're talking about love and even still in love most people still marry for money and most people are still you know relationships are still based on money so everything is literally based on money politics business relationships everything right youtube all the youtubers that copy me in my content they're doing it for money many of them learn as an example right everything's about money guys and i need you to understand you need to plan accordingly and you need to be smart because the smarter you are and the more you understand how the economy actually works and how the individual company works on a micro level yeah there's two different things there's micro and macro right i'm hitting you with a lot of facts right now because i'm literally trying to take your trading level to the next to absolutely retirement level right to 10k mon 20k month etc for free on this youtube channel you don't have to pay for nothing i'm i'm making my free content better than people's paid content because that's my mission that's my goal here so if you appreciate that mission and goal please go ahead and subscribe all right so look let me stop rambling let me get to the point i'm just trying to give you the full picture lowering tesla's production cost is a really big key for elon musk this man is a businessman this man is an influencer this man has a personal brand something that you guys don't think about all the time but everyone in youtube has a personal brand i'm just being honest with that's how it works elon musk is a personal brand he has his own initiatives he has his own plan he has a way of marketing elon musk personally has more followers on twitter or x right then tesla itself so he is a personal brand and the way he's trying to influence the white house is basically to get the production cost of tesla lower why because you have more economies of scale economies of scale is basically economics 101 okay if you didn't go to college for business school and you're an engineer doctor dentist lawyer that's a majority of my clients which i understand that's why you're watching my videos you're coming to me as i'm an expert in the field worked at goldman sachs have a degree in this stuff economy a scale is basically when a company can produce more vehicles in the the more or produce any good right any good or service and the more it produces the lower the cost gets and the lower the cost gets the better because they can fulfill that product or service at a lower cost beating all of the competition so tesla wants to do this because if they can lower their cost they can pass that lower cost on to the end consumer and they can lower the price of tesla vehicle uh price per per vehicle or price per service for the autonomous driving or for the insurance that they have or for lots of different products that they have and services that they will have in the future and if it's cheaper it's going to make economic sense for the consumer to take action on that right it's pretty pretty simple to be honest it's really really simple why he's doing this right now look um here's a quick clip 90 seconds i need you to watch this because i've already mentioned another video but i want to explain it to you in a different way tom naran right um he is an analyst and he said it perfectly he said that autonomous driving and new regulations will change the landscape for tesla and justify the valuation easily easily okay watch this quick 90 second clip and then i'm going to explain it to you tesla shares though popping today on a report that said that the trump administration is planning to ease federal rules on self-driving driving vehicles now this follows news on friday that trump's team is also reportedly planning to kill the $7,500 tax credit for ev purchases so joining us now is tom nian of rbc capital markets tom it's great to have you on let's start right there what's going to matter more for tesla and for the vehicle market and any of these ai plays that might be attached to autonomous driving is it going to be uh a different regulatory landscape for autonomous vehicles or is it going to be taking away uh that that tax credit what's going to matter more yeah it's going to be giving uh less regulatory restrictions on robo taxis definitely uh federal restrictions was one of the big reasons why gm uh stopped making its origin uh purpose-built vehicle right that allows you to make a vehicle without pedals and steering wheels so you need that federal deregulation if you were to call it a policy framework in order to allow for that that's what the tesla cyber cab is why is that important it cuts down a lot of costs right you know currently the competition is you know wh mo you guys talked about that uh it has pedals steering wheels it's another car it's another car company making the vehicle right so if you can make your own vehicle at lower costs doesn't have steering wheels or pedals you can bring down the cost and tesla's argument is they can actually gobble up market share and if you look at autonomy and ai etc that comes at a much higher multiple you have a trillion plus dollar market cap for tesla you know is are you going to get there with an auto business for selling more cars or through ai autonomy right so autonomy is the way they can justify that market cap more they can from selling cars all right guys the last thing that he said there was auto business or ai autonomy which do you think is going to be worth more of course of course ai autonomy guys ai autonomy is going to be worth so much more as i said in the beginning of this video than than just traditional legacy you know cars okay tesla's not a car company tesla has been mistaken for a car company this is an autonomous driving company this is an ai company this is a data company all the things that i've covered on this channel with nvidia paler i'm in tesla for the same reasons guys it's really simple here right i'm in this company for the same reason so so look i think autonomy is going to make a lot of sense and i think we're going to see $400 per share in early to mid 2025 now what i want to do is i want to go over a leap option i've explained to you why i've explained to you what i've explained to you everything now i'm just going to show you what i'm actually going to do and i'm going to buy some leap options now real quick if you are a beginner to leap options or you probably see it all over the youtube right now it's a super popular topic right i wonder why i've been covering leap options for a number of years now but leap options um let me explain to you three three three simple ways of how how a leap option works while you want to do it number one guys is lower capital requirements leap options are super powerful because you can basically control the same amount of shares okay when you buy a leap option is buying a call option you can control the same amount of shares for a lot cheaper of a price so as i show you let me actually get into this example right now um let me go to trade tesla options and i'm going to buy the 330 i already said in the beginning i'm going to do the 330 for september i'm going to go to september expiration because a leap option is something around 9 months uh you know thereabouts one year by definition probably one year or longer but a leap option is simply a call option that goes out further in terms of date so don't don't let anyone confuse you or make it complicated it's not all right now tesla if you were to buy 100 shares would be $350 per share would be $35,000 now if you buy a 330 call option then you only paying about $8,400 here okay and you get the same benefit so you get to put up about 1/4 of the price all right so 1/4 of the price is fantastic and that's how you put up the lower capital upfront you get the same ownership and you and it provides you a very costeffective way of owning 100 shares now the second thing i want to cover which is what i've been saying for a long time guys right now it's really easy to make money hand over fist guys i'm buying all these companies i'm making money bicep over tricep as i say but okay there is going to be a pullback at some point don't ask me when and if someone tells you when there's going to be a pullback that person is a complete 100% scammer they're scamming okay no nobody knows not even the smartest people so look instead of me trying to predict the future which i can't do i've made a lot of money by not predicting the future but by playing options in a safe way i'm always trying to use less capital make more money and reduce risk okay these are the three things i always tell students as soon as they join my one-on-one coaching the first thing i say is i ask them their goals and everything and then we go over the three the three foundations okay we got time money risk the third one nobody talks about nobody talks about risk management nobody talks about managing positions the way i do because i've actually worked at goldman sachs and i have a i have a lot of experience when it comes to risk management guys you think i didn't want to blow up my portfolio you think uh in my 20s when i started gaining a bunch of wealth 100k 200k portfolio you think i didn't want to double down on some certain positions and just go to the moon i did but i didn't do that guys i'm not not one of these guys out here that's going to let go of my long-term vision for my short-term wants i'm going for what i need i already hit what i need so i'm just having fun at this point teaching cuz i want to teach and i enjoy this this is what i very passionate about but you think i didn't want to do it when i had 100k when i didn't want to work anymore in in corporate when i didn't want to you know when i wanted to have a nicer apartment when i wanted to travel you think i didn't want to make it faster i did but i and i would say i did make it pretty quick i had a year when i had 100k to 700k and i've already went over that story in several of my videos if you if you watch them but it's not about that guys you want to limit your risk it's time money and risk all right so with the leap strategy you can really reduce your risk because when you're buying a leap you ma your maximum loss is really limited to the leap option uh premium that you pay in this example it is going to be roughly $8,400 so you know that is a lot less than having to put up a 100 shares which is going to be around the $35,000 mark so here it's a lot cheaper and it's a lot more efficient so that's why i like the limited risk nature of leaps and now the third thing is i said there's three things is there's just an extended time horizon so leap can look like shares it can really look like shares if you buy a long-term leap it's really function fing in the same way if i expand this option right here this delta is 66 so it's not as high as 70 or 75 as i usually say but it's close enough you're getting a lot of benefit if the stock goes up to 400 so basically it'll go up by $50 and this option right here will be $50 times the 66 delta all right so that's going to be about $33 higher $33 higher i did that math in my head real quick really love math back in in uh in school $33 is going to be how much this option would rise and because that $33 is actually a lot of money on $84 so if tesla goes up by 50 this option increases by 33 33 you know you know as a portion to$ 8,400 so$ 3,300 is what you would make on $8,400 that would be like around 40% return or so 40% or so return but you know if you do the math if tesla goes up by 50 bucks you know that's really only a 15% return or so on the tesla stock so had you had tesla stock you would make about 15% but if you have this leap option you're going to make about 40% so you have almost a 3x leverage factor here with the leap option you get almost 3x the same return if you were to use the same capital or basically you can think about as you're able to use oneir or you know about 40% of the capital so instead of you know putting out you know 35k you're only putting out 8,400 to get the same benefit and if the stock moves up you get huge you get huge benefits you can close at any time that's also what i want to point out you guys do not have to hold until expiration the reason why i have a discord community is because obviously it is a case-by case basis i can't just blanket statement say do this with this situation because the situations vary and the market does pull back and we do get bare markets and we do have changes in volatility and we do have sometimes bad volume or bad bid ass spread we have there's so many things to consider and i'm trying to educate you guys as much as possible but simply said leap options just make a lot of sense if i wanted to reduce the cost of a leap option i would simply sell call options to reduce the price you can pick various different expiration days so i can go for august i can go for june i can go for may one is not better than the other guys option trading is all about choices and preferences all right it really depends on your risk appetite uh for me let's just say we're going to go for march 21st i'll give you this example right here this about 115 days out and this is the time frame i'm going to use because i said i think in q1 we could reach 400 but you know it could be a little bit early in q1 so i'm comfortable enough to to go for something like the 390 uh call option right here so if i sell this call option i will collect $3,000 and i can reduce my cost down to only $5,000 you know give or take $52.90 so by reducing my cost here to 52.90 or $5,300 that's fantastic because now i get even a bigger leverage effect than i mentioned earlier for more help

2024-11-28,45292DvRbvw,"kind: captions language: en many of you guys are eating turkey but i'm getting ready to make 10% on my money in the next 10 days in this really crucial point in the market this is like the only opportunity that you have to make money early on a trend that's not even early if that makes sense this is the only opportunity that i've seen in the market for the entire year maybe even the past couple of years where you can make money early without actually being early if you're looking to make $10,000 or more on your portfolio if you have a six figure portfolio or wherever you are here's the one minute summary so i don't waste your time because i know right now it's thanksgiving time so here's a one minute summary of what i think from my research right here the ai revolution in my opinion is hitting the next phase and we're about to see a lot of stocks squeeze higher i think a lot of the stocks will be tech stocks and i have three specific stocks which is snowflake nvidia and paler these three stocks along with many other tech stocks i'm also going to cover meta i'm going to cover apple in this video i'm going to cover sofi these stocks these tech stocks which are really they call them the magnificent 7 i think there's like 15 of them right now these stocks are going to squeeze higher and in general being in the hottest tech stocks right now is going to be very profitable because i see a short squeeze uh potentially going to happen i don't know if it's going to be exactly 10% but i see stocks at all-time highs i'm going to show you proof right now on basically how these stocks in the short term are likely to keep rising because this market momentum is very clear and the trend is clear so although a lot of people are trying to relax and have thanksgiving i think that we're going to see a 5 or 10% pop in the stock market especially when it comes to tech stocks especially the ai stock so you should be fully invested right now if you have cash on the sidelines you're afraid of a crash i personally think that's a mistake because into the rest of 2024 this is the easiest time to make money without actually being early all right and by the way for evidence i want to put up dan ies because he finally is saying what i've been saying about the ai uh revolution and his statement was so confident all right i need you to watch this clip because what dan i said not only proves that he's super confident it also confirms my beliefs and it supports my statements here in this video and i also think it it creates the perfect tech stock setup because i think this is a tech market that's going to be on fire not just for the going into the end of the year this week but what i believe right now this ai revolution it's hitting its next phase and i think this is just still the start of a fourth industrial revolution all right still the start but you always say it's 9:00 it's got to be 9:30 no i and i've said i actually said it now it's 9:30 to 10 p.m. in the ai party that goes to 4:00 a.m. all right so you have a number of upgrades in the space specifically in the software space when it comes to ai uh one of them is snowflake the other one's actually elastic we've been fortunate enough to have the ceo on the show kind of a broad uh based play they do cloud they do security as well why these two names look i think and we've come about l here on the show now the second derivative the software piece of ai is here i think in 2025 that's going to be the key you look at elastic snowflake names like mongod db they're the ones now that file names like paler in terms of the software the use cases i believe the the software ai age is now here 20125 that's going to be front and center that's why we upgrade those names all right so both of those names have recently had earnings actually we're going to show the charts big jump snowflakes up over 25% since earnings elastics up over 20% since earnings what's going to push them even higher i mean they've had big spikes post earnings what else is going to happen that's going to be another catalyst that's just the appetizer in terms of where i believe these stocks are going because now the consumption model what's happening across enterprise ai obviously it starts with godfather vad jensen nvidia but now you look at the consumption piece these lm models what you're going to start to see i believe earnings and overall growth is being underestimated potentially by 15 20% over the next few years that's why you look at names like snowflake elastic mango it all starts obviously messy of ai paler but this software phase is here and it's just the beginning all right guys so instead of me just talking let me show you some charts let me go through four stocks i already mentioned a few more stocks in the beginning of this video but let me cover the four stocks so first of all meta guys let me talk about meta i haven't covered meta and i want to make my videos different i don't want to just keep repeating myself so i'm going to cover four kind of different stocks here so first one is meta look look at the meta chart all right we've had meta really you know there's a lot of analysts ratings right here by the way a lot of analysts were raising their price targets on meta and that actually they're late guys analysts are typically late like look how late they are like the stock already went up and then there was like three analysts back to back they're like oh hold up let me do my job and let me change my price target you know most of them are are late to the game don't you wish like they were early you know that's that's what i'm trying to recreate here one of the best investors actually i was in median columbia and this guy was worth like a hundred million he said you don't have to be smart you just have to be early all right so i'm trying to put you guys in early trends look there was a double top pattern right here on meta here was at 593 then again about 590 look this is not a 10% squeeze on meta per se but if you use options you can almost get a 10% move in the stock let me show you guys what's up in with with meta i don't currently have any meta this is a position i'm thinking about starting because of what i see going on in the stock market and i am making a lot of money on the other plays i i typically talk about but i don't see anything wrong with opening up something like this as well now there's two plays i can show you on meta real quick so look i think we're going to get a squeeze higher so i'm going to show you a small account play and a bigger account play on a bigger account play first i'm going to go to trade meta options you would simply buy 100 shares that would be fairly expensive but hey i have a lot of sixf figure folks that i work with so i would go for something going into the end of the year december 20th that's literally right you know before before christmas so we're going to get a 23-day move here and i said 10 days but you know we'll make it 3 weeks 21 days or so i'll also have a couple short-term plays as i go through my examples here but look so for meta again we had that double top pattern here at 5 590 is so if i go to around 590 you'll actually see that i can collect about $930 in premium so not only do i get that upside here about $20 or so i also get $9 so i can make around three grand on a short-term move that's going to be about 3 weeks so three grand here is about a 6% return total return so about six grand on about 50 55k right so the three grand over the 55k is roughly 6% or so so that's a 6% move in 3 weeks here's another play i would do for a smaller portfolio now this is going to be a little bit riskier but if it moves you're going to make so much money look it's going to be 575 okay this option right here has a 51 delta very high delta good volume hit ask sprad is okay it's not great um so if you buy the 575 and then you just go ahead and sell another call option to create a bull call spread a bull call spread screen just turned white 7 a.m. for me or 7: a.m. in east coast but i'm making these videos out in europe right now 585 if i do a sell call this right here will subsidize the cost of buying the 575 option you can see here how my max loss is 468 but my max profit is about 532 so it's roughly betting 500 to make a th000 so this right here will squeeze out a 100% return i guess i'm under promising and overd delivering in this video because you can literally double your money on this play right here i would not do more than 1% of your money on this play though so if you have a 100k portfolio you would just do two contracts here so you would do two contracts where you essentially uh b buy two contracts that's $1,000 worth of risk and then you have 2,000 potential dollars to exit the position so you can turn like 1k into 2k so yeah that's my meta play now let's go into my apple play so a lot of you guys lose focus and attention because apple isn't as sexy as other youtubers that cover your micro strategies and mcis and all that other nonsense stuff guys i've made more money than everyone else by not doing the nonsense stuff all right cuz i'm not looking to blow up a portfolio if you're watching other channels that cover these crazy stocks it's not my style not my style i'm not into that i'm into just creating safe passive income i say that in a lot of my videos but honestly like i've made crazy money on apple let me show you my apple position and let me show you where i think apple's going to go based on technicals and i'll actually go into some fundamental analysis here i'm going to try to make this video not too long though so apple 234 i have 4,9 shares this is 28% of my portfolio i have apple at $81.99 per share and apple is actually breaking some limits right now which is what makes me really like the stock on the six-month chart we're about to hit this really key resistance point so look guys what usually happens is there's a psychological level here that investors once it hits a key resistance point if it breaks through which which looks like apple will that's going to change a lot of people's beliefs and a lot of people are going to start jumping into the stock and we're going to see some some really good momentum so if i go to the chart actually let me show you what the volume looks like because i said for me the the volume is actually you know it's becoming more indicative like look there was a lot of selling pressure here on apple stock and since then we've been kind of not having much volume but recently i've been seeing a lot of uptrend in more volume and the stock is going up this is a very positive momentum sign that i learned from uh working on wall street not at goldman sachs this this specific tip i learned basically when i was a quant analyst working in philadelphia for a hedge fund so this is some another information that i learned from one of my um experiences and uh the fund i was working at had about $9 billion and nvidia was actually a play that they had this was a long time ago this i think back in 2017 or so 2017 actually yeah seven years now so look the volume here is really good and the uptrend is very clear i think we're actually going to finally finally you see i drew some lines here not sure what the second line is here maybe that was an accident but this first line here this purple line was my technical analysis where i really thought i drew this a while ago by the way i don't know when i drew it but it was a few months back at this point when i actually entered into apple to begin with the stock i saw a really clear trend to 250 per share i was a little bit off but i do think we'll hit 240 per share so given that i think that we're going to finally get to 240 again i'm not i'm not promising anything big i'm ju i just think we're going to get a little bit more of a squeeze because as people come from thanksgiving everyone's happy you know some people most people are have eaten turkey and stuff like that and everyone's in a jolly mood i think that there's going to be more money being put put to work plus the the the dan ies clip that i showed you guys i think we're entering ai revolution and and apple is part of that even though it's not a standard ai pick like some of the other names like snowflake i'm going to be doing some more research into snowflake because i do have a lot of students that have stock in it so you want me to do analysis on snowflake let me know down in the comment section below look so apple you know 2 234 i think we're going to get uh 240 on apple sometime at the end of this year so i'm going to go for a covered call position here for december guys i don't have a whole lot of cash i'm already fully invested i put out all my trades in the discord community so this is just stuff for you guys that are not in discord to also take advantage of some of my safer plays that i put out on on youtube to put cash to work because you should be fully invested something i actually teach in my one-on-one coaching is that we we should be beyond fully invested we should be on margin as well using safe margin i use safe margin but that's not i won't cover that on youtube that is something that i only leave for my one-on-one students it is a little bit it's it's definitely higher lev stuff 240 uh we can go for sell covered call now this right here would mean that we'll get about $6 of upside for apple on a covered call and then you know the two the $234 that you collect is just icing on the cake guys that's just you know little bit of sprinkles and and and icing on the cake so you know you can just enjoy that as premium that you collect so look you get $6 plus 230 236 so it's about $85 give or take about eight bucks which is roughly like what a three a 3% return so this right here is a 3% return but again i'm going to show you a smaller account play right now which is going to be that bull call spread the bull call spread can easily just be 235 and 240 so very simp simple guys every time i do a covered call if you have a smaller portfolio you could do a bull call spread the robin hood calls that a call debit spread same thing i will say it's a higher risk strategy because with the covered call if the stock goes up cool if it goes down that's also fine you have the stock now on a bull call spread if the stock does not go up then you do lose the capital that you put in so i want you to be aware of that so it is a disadvantage to have a smaller portfolio but you know that's just that's just how it is right that's why it is easier for me to work with folks that have 50k that is why i say you know if you want oneone coaching you should have uh multiple five figures the more you have the better for sure so i do kind of dq smaller portfolios there just cuz it's hard for me to work with them but i have a bunch of free content here for you guys as well so look 225 on the max loss and the max profit is 275 so you can again double your money so you can get a 3% return if you're going to be ultra conservative and ultra safe um on the covered call and if you want to go a little bit riskier you can just simply put you know two contracts here nothing wrong with that even if you have a big portfolio put in a couple contracts and you know if the stock goes up you get a 3% return on the covered call and then you get a more than double on your money here and then you mix that return mix that return up mix these strategies up a little bit you put 1% of this uh maybe even half a percent you can put even half a percent on the bull call spread here and then all of a sudden there there we go we're we're building our momentum we're building the portfolios really quickly going into december 20th this next month i really think we're going to be printing money pretty crazy all the students are making lots of money this is the easiest time i've ever seen this is the easy like if you're not making money right now you're never going to make money forget about it like honestly just quit because this is the easiest time so if you're not making money right now you are absolutely doing something wrong cuz it's it's freaking easy right now look next stock i wanted to cover is sofi i know there's a lot of folks that do like sofi sofi is a good stock overall uh i've actually have a friend who works at sofi he's had some experience at sofi that i also worked with him at goldman sachs he actually built options.com options.com is the link in my description is the third link i don't usually promote it it's just a software that helps you pick pick options it's an option recommendation engine i contributed some of my technical analysis knowledge to that software my friend built it so you know it is a tool that i do use to pick good options there's spreads there's covered calls on that software so if you're interested check it out i usually almost never promote it's been months but i have it down there in the description sofi is a really good company the past 6 months this stock has gone parabolic which to me is you know i do want to pump the breaks and say hey this stock's at an all-time high i don't want to be a hype youtuber and i don't like picking stocks at all-time highs however momentum is a thing guys when i worked on wall street uh momentum is definitely a thing it's definitely something that works and if you you know here pe people have said hey the stock is really high but it went from 14 to 1515 so you know that's like a $150 on $14 that's that's a 10% move that is a 10% move in a in in a short amount of time so we went from november 11th to november 27th about a two-e period a 10% move so can that happen again the answer is yes it can happen again so i want to bring to your attention that sofi has a a good business it you know it has some ai components it's not one of those ai hype stocks so it's not going to be ong with the trend like nvidia which is the next stock i'll cover but this stock has had some you know really interesting uh facts and figures this stock has a really high forward pe ratio again just pointing out this is not a stock that is the best fundamentally i'm simply playing off of momentum and i'm telling you if you want to participate in the squeeze this is a little bit of a different strategy than what i cover i want to diversify and give you guys a different perspective and my personal opinion of what i would be doing if i wanted to be a little bit riskier because i am playing stocks like this in my in my personal portfolio but i'm using small amounts i'm being super clear with you on that because i hate it when you guys lose money and i have a huge responsibility here here and in my discord to perform that's my number one goal is to give good results and performance it's not it's not for fun guys it's for results and i'm actually trying to deliver something here that will actually help people so look the the fundamentals here not the best right so if i scroll down the profit margin is okay we we got 8.5% profit the revenue per share is only 247 this company is going for for not a cheap valuation not a cheap price of sales and not a cheap price earnings ratio now i also want to point out that they do have a lot of cash so i'm not worried about the stock going bankrupt or something like that it's a good company not the best valuation but i want to say that you can play the game where you can buy expensive and the stock gets more expensive because of the clear momentum and the tech market uh heat up i really think that that's going to be a a good investment for the next 2 three weeks so let me show you what that's going to look like i'm going to go to sofi right here and i'm going to show you uh the options that i would be playing right now so on sofi you can either try to get into the company by selling a put option i have several sellp put videos you just type in to youtube invest with henry sellp puts you will get a you'll get my top two videos most likely youtube will recommend them the recommendation engine here on youtube or you know you can do covered calls so you can sell the 15 put here this is a this is a 4% this is over 4% return right so this this would be decent entry into the stock but also to be honest because we are trying to play that momentum you can just straight up go into a this is going to be really interesting but you can go into an in the money buy call option at550 and then you can sell something like the 17 and a half and this right here is going to give you this is going to give you some big some huge returns now this is somewhat unlikely to happen fully to 17 and a half but i don't don't expect soi to go to 17 and a2 fully you know i think it may go to 16 a2 maybe 17 so you would open up to 17 a half honestly it's a smart bet and i said this on target recently guys i don't cover this on youtube it's just too boring people's attention span isn't enough to to listen to my boring plays but my boring plays have printed money in discord i i picked up target right after the earnings and we went from 110 to like 1 120 and i bought call options freaking printed money printed money and this is the same scenario where i see that sofi in this market it can really print more money like if it goes to 17 and a half this would be a triple you're you're betting $65 to get 200 you know i don't know if we're going to realize at full 200 my strategy here would basically be if it were to double if i were to double my money i'm not going to open up this play i have enough plays from from my discord i'm not going to open up this play but i'm just showing this on youtube i think this could be a really interesting play and the way i would actually manage this is i would not hold this position until expiration typically i am holding positions till expiration but on this one i think you should ride some momentum if you believe in the dan ies trend the ai the next phase here and the bullish 2024 which is the theme that i do believe in i think that here if you see a short-term rise in sofi from 1564 whatever 16 to 16 and a half you see a good profit on your hands you just cut that position take profit i would not really hold this until expiration just because it is unlikely for sofi to reach 17 and a half but it it can it can i wouldn't i wouldn't nothing is impossible in this market truly nothing is impossible and if i can put 20k 30k 50k in your guys portfolios in the next you know three four weeks great great then uh why not why not that that'll be a good thing all right the last stock i want to cover is going to be nvidia so i have made a lot of nvidia content i've been i've been spot on on nvidia i've been spot on i've been like like roaring kitty with gamestop or whatever i've been very vocal about my beliefs on nvidia and i've been early on nvidia and i'm still making content on nidia to to just double down on my beliefs here all right i really really believe in the ai trend and i have a data analytics degree and i've seen the writing on the wall with nvidia right i think the stock is going to do very well i think it's going to be like a $140 stock uh easily maybe 145 here in the next two weeks so again i'm not saying that this is stock is going to blow up and go to 200 or 500 or something like that in the short term it it's it's probably not let's be realistic here but it can absolutely go to 145 so this is this is something i'm actually going to be trading on monday morning in my discord community if you want to be part of that hit the first link in the description you already know what

2024-11-29,BdAalfGEON8,"kind: captions language: en whether you're looking to retire early or you just want some safe passive consistent income in this video i'm going to teach you how you can retire with $212,000 and i'll talk about in a very short summary why that's such a specific number and i'm going to show you the wheel strategy and how you can do it and even in this economy i think that right now you can squeeze out so much money i'm going to show you how to produce so much cash flow that you can actually retire with $200,000 which is a lot less than what most people are doing and i'm going toover several stocks and examples so let's not waste any time and let's just jump right into it here's the one minute summary by the way because i know a lot of people are busy and um a lot of you guys appreciate me getting to the point so here's the one minute summary you can use spy to use the wheel strategy and sell puts and covered calls on spy on a monthly basis 30 days to expiration with a 27 delta and that will produce about 2% per month in income now if you want a higher income you're going to use single stocks that are going to have more volatility to be specific more implied volatility those stocks are going to be ones that i covered in this channel nvidia paler but you can also use other tech stocks so that could be meta that could be netflix and actually any stock that has an rsi that's under about 40 is a really good candidate to begin running the wheel strategy or if the stock is towards the bottom end of the bowling or band because when you're running the wheel strategy what you want to do is you want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that is fairly cheap okay you don't want to run the wheel strategy on a stock that's at a 52 we high which is kind of difficult in this market which you know that was my short summary but if you have time let me explain to you you how to actually implement this all right so see you later if you don't have any time and now if you have some time let me go into the specifics so look i want to debunk the myth and i want to completely change the the 4% rule okay the 4% rule states this and you guys might may have heard of it the 4% rule is you can take out 4% per year in income when you're retired which is a bunch of bs to be honest if you're running the wheel strategy i can make 4% a month okay a month not a year so it doesn't make any sense to me that's that's why i like options so with the $200,000 portfolio $222,000 as i said in the title i think this is a really good position because 4% is essentially approaching the $9,000 mark which is going to be six figures per year and i think that's a really good income source right so you can really retire or have a full-time income or a really strong secondary source of income now i quickly want to say that in my experience i've been running the wheel strategy since i had 100k okay when i had 100k in my portfolio i i just start to really focus on the wheel strategy and i did a little bit early but i left my corporate job when i had 100k which is maybe a little bit ear um let me show you on spy i'm going to start off with the safest etf i'm going to get riskier and riskier and then how to really capitalize and make four five even more perc per month so portfolio is at 4 million i guess our next target is 5 million i've been doing very well and very happy and very blessed so spy all right i do have a position here i have a pretty sizable position and i um or actually running the wheel strategy as i mentioned all right so look let me explain to you what spy is and why you would want to use it spy is going to be on the safer side of things spy is safer because it's an etf that has 500 company companies in it essentially when i was getting my degree finance everyone talked about beating s&amp;p 500 and that's because this benchmark is truly difficult to beat it is truly hard to beat for for the average investor and even many hedge funds do not beat the s&amp;p 500 so it truly is a very interesting metric to look at now the s&amp;p has all the sectors in it like technology consumer cyclicals consumer services consumer defensive utilities real estate energy industrials healthcare and financial services all right so this etf has the top holding is apple which i have a huge position in and i always say on this channel like you don't need to have the hottest stocks to make good money with options you don't you can make a lot of money apple nvidia microsoft amazon meta all these stocks fantastic stocks and in my video the other day i mentioned how we are in a very bullish market there is a lot of money to be made so look with um the wheel strategy and running it on spy i said in my little short one minute summary that you can go 30 days in 27 delta so let's go sell a put option i'm going to show you how this works so sell put let's go for 30 days right so that's going to be basically basically into january basically going into the new year so spy january okay i would let's let's take a look and see a 27 delta here 587 27 dels okay 587 that was really close i picked 586 587 uh here has $400 now let me explain this is going to be in the lower end of returns and then i'll tell you how to get higher and higher returns with the wheel strategy on the lower end of things if you just want that safe passive income and you're kind of retired and you're just busy you won't be able to probably produce look $400 on 50 50k so on 200k you're only going to produce about $1,600 a month all right so that's on the low end of things but i will explain that when you're selling puts the put selling portion is the lower return portion on the covered calls you can make about double all right let me let me show you an example how that looks like so here you know in a month it's $400 but on 200k it' be $1,600 per month nothing really that big right nothing really that big however on the covered call side and before we get into the single stocks on the covered call side if i go to sell call let's say that you got a sign at 600 right so you got a sign for 600 if i were to sell like the 602 right here um which is very close to the money and i'll say hey you will lose a stock or the etf if it goes into the money but we don't really care because the whole the whole goal here right is that we're just trying to create a lot of income into retirement that that's really it guys we're trying to create income into retirement that's the goal of of this video is to show you how you can run the wheel strategy and just the wheel strategy you can literally go 100% wheel strategy on spy or single stock so to finish up this spy example the put side of things would only create about $1,600 of income now the covered call side of things would create a little bit more income so we made about $400 un covered calls it's about 700 or so plus you get $2 of upside let's say this you know the etf's at 600 it goes to 602 so you get two plus you know about seven so it's $9 right so we got 400 to sell puts and now we get now 900 an upside for the covered call side of things right so $900 on the 50k or so you know if you multiply that by four you get at 3600 so you can make between 1,800 on the bottom end to 3600 okay so 1,800 to 3600 on just spy i think that's a pretty good monthly income for having 200k right most people can't figure out how to make income it's pretty easy on spy now if you want to create more income and you actually want to have that you know $8,000 mark $99,000 $10,000 mark you're going to have to use single stocks okay because you know going 30 days out in 27 delta on spy is going to produce 2% per month in income or so 1 and a half 2% but if you want to get to the four 5% mark or i honestly these past couple of months i'm at the 10% mark it's it's just ridiculous i'm making money hand over fist just hand over fist and all these stocks guys you know bicep over tricep as i say but look i think that spy is an okay start if you have a bigger portfolio but if you're at 200k you're going to want to use the single stocks that i'm about to cover right now before i cover the single stocks let me just go through my notes real quick i want you to know that selling monthly options is probably the best although i have seen a lot of successful people go for two and three monon options because they're busy professionals i work with a lot of engineers doctors lawyers nurses accountants etc these folks have jobs they're busy and they don't even have a lot of time to go on my live calls they don't even have a lot of time to really trade okay and that's okay because you can just set these positions and forget about them two months out three months out so i want to say that you can retire using the wheel strategy either you can create weekly income if you have more time and you have more desire or you can go for that monthly and two months out and three months out expirations right other thing i wanted to say is this strategy allows for consistent monthly income and for me that is probably my favorite right every single month i i like to get income i don't like to do weekly i also don't like to do two to three months either so i think this is a really reliable way to turn savings into cash flow into retirement so of course s&amp;p 500 is is high quality but if you really want to get that bigger income let's go over some examples in my portfolio so um my videos are unscripted so i'm just going to go through a couple of examples here by the way let's just go to my total return i just want to show you guys that i've been doing pretty well a lot of my positions are are going for a good win right now let's go into something like a chipotle okay i think that chipotle is going to be the next level of volatility it's not high volatility by no means like if we go look at this option right here the implied volatility is 29 so to be honest with you this is just only a little bit more i guess risky than s&amp;p 5 00 it is a single stock so it is definitely more risky but the volatility is not that that much higher all right so if i were to go to sell put and that's how you get started in the wheel strategy real quick i have a whole wheel strategy course here my free stuff is better than everyone else's paid stuff my free content here on youtube is basically everything that you need to really level up your option trading my free stuff is better than people's discords it's better than people's boot camps and better than people's coaching so i try to give you guys everything as much as possible for free um because that's that's my mission that's my goal and i 100% believe in that and i've seen iten happen over and over folks are making full-time income look sell sellp put well january 17th will be 50 days out let's go for january 3rd about 30 days out and if i were to sell i would go for about a 30 delta so let's go here that's 18 delta that's way too low huh that's interesting okay 30 del right here so on this position right here let's go and let's put $200,000 to work let's just say hypothetically that we want to put all $200,000 to work all right so if i go for 20 contracts here let's go for 35 contracts that's 212,000 roughly let's go for 36 contracts $212,000 here you're going to make $3,000 a month right for selling puts and then once you get assigned you can expect about double all right like i just showed you in the spy example when you sell a covered call you typically have a bit of upside okay and the covered call can be closer to the money so here $3,000 okay let me just show you if you had already been assigned on chipotle and it's currently at 62 you can go for something like 63 so this will give you a dollar of upside plus 145 so this right here would be a lot more attractive obviously on the cover callide because you have some upside on the stock itself so this right here would probably be $3 to $4,000 a month thereabouts right it depends on volatility depends on market conditions so that is the next level so you can go from spy which is 1,800 to 3600 to to something like a like a chipotle which is like fairly low low risk and that would be between like three 3 to 4k okay so that would be a bit higher there now let me go to something like a tesla all right so now tesla would get you a lot closer to that really big income okay and by the way i think you need to have a combination of all these things you need to have some spy you need to have some safer stocks you need to have some riskier stocks it's just a combination of things that i think is really important so let's go for january 3rd again okay and for tesla i'm pretty bullish so if you are bullish personally like i'm bullish on tesla you can go for a little bit higher delta remember the delta is just a give and take relationship the higher the delta the higher chances are that you will get assigned okay and the lower the delta is you know essentially the lower chance you'll get a sign however the higher the delta the more you get paid the lower delta the less you get so it's all about uh risk and return it's a it's a clear trade-off so 320 if i were to sell a put i'm going to go a little bit higher on the delta all right the implied volatility volatility here is 50 so 50 is obviously better than the 29 that we just saw for chipotle so this this position right here is going to be uh a lot more lucrative it's going to be a lot more lucrative for for selling options and running the wheel strategy so if i were to do five here that's 150k 7 this would be about 212k so you can see here how on the sell puts i would already make almost 10 ,000 okay on the covered call side of things you can make you know this strategy can produce1 to $15,000 a month obviously it depends on the market and the in the wheel strategy is not a perfectly flawless strategy there is no such thing as a perfectly flawless strategy but i'll tell you how to manage it all right let me go through my notes here basically the way that you would manage this strategy is first of all you have to pick stocks that you like i always say that in my videos if you're not trading stocks that you like if you don't know why you own a stock i will challenge you that you don't even know how to invest you don't know what you're doing a lot of people are into like the micro strategy or the smci stuff i believe those youtubers that are covering these stocks are kind of on the scammy side of things because i don't like the hype the reason why youtubers cover hype is for views i mean everyone likes views on youtube but i'm not going to disregard what i actually believe to be true and for me i would always recommend do not go for hype go for safe highquality companies spy would be the safest side and then the middle you know would be your craft hind would be some american airlines it would be you know your utilities your financials like your banks and jp morgan and and bank of america stuff like that and then on the higher side of things i i'll show you one more example on nvidia it would be your your tesla your nvidia the palante tier the higher risk stuff that i've covered that has absolutely paid off all right it's it's absolutely paid off we've been making money hand over fist bicep over tricep as i like to say uh we've been doing fantastic so i hope that your guys pockets is like full of money and then yeah you're just happy so look with 212,00 or you know let's say $250,000 um you can make a full-time income selling options and just looking at these positions right here on tesla i think that it is a it's an absolute no-brainer to to run this on tesla now you can also run this on on a stock like nvidia nvidia is also going to have high volatility and when you go for a higher volatility stock that's really good because it makes financial freedom a lot easier you can make a full-time income with 212,000 or 250,000 basically in around 200 to 300 k range because we're going to disregard you know 4% per year typical standard rule you can make 4% a month when you can make 4% a month on 2 to 300k that's what really brings you to that $10,000 a month mark right so for my portfolio i i'm okay with even just you know a little bit less i don't even go for it's kind of hard to say because lately i've been making like 10% so in the last like month i made like $400,000 or so and that's what pushed me over the $4 million mark so you know it just varies but i'll say that as you scale it just get it's easier and easier but don't be discouraged if you have you know 50k 100k it just takes time to scale right it's it's a journey but i want to say that the typical financial rules out there you got to you guys got to fire a financial adviser all right i mean you can hire me as a one-on-one coach i'm going to be much better than financial adviser that just takes 1% of your money every year or you know it really is so simple or just watch my free stuff right you can make a lot of money by just running the wheel strategy and you don't need to have like this million dollar account to really hit some retirement figures right money is is actually not as hard as most people think it's it's not right so i'll talk about managing and everything like that i just want to go over nvidia i want to show you i have you know 500 shares of nvidia but let me just show you how i would run the wheel strategy on nvidia so you'll go to sell put and again i'm going to go for the same for the same expiration i'm going to go for about 30 days out or so and i will go for the 130 strike that is a 31 delta actually nvidia's implied volatility is lower than tesla's so tesla is going to be our highest play which makes sense like on 200,000 if you can make 10k a month you kidding me 10k a month is like more than most people make per month and $200,000 i don't think is unreasonable at all to make 10 $10,000 per month so nvidia right now is actually lower implied volatility and therefore when i go over this example when i go over 130 if i do like uh it's actually going to be about 17 contracts yep 17 contracts um you're going to make about 4250 per month so on the covered call side let me go through the covered calls so this is about 4k and then if you already had invid and you were to do a sell call let's go for the 139 45 delta is pretty high but again we don't care if we lose a stock this video is just going to assume that you just want high income to retire you need that income you're going to be using it for your needs right so you don't mind getting that income so the 139 strike here has a 45 delta implied volatility here so here it is going for $5 um but you also have some upsides so we're going to go basically $4 up right nvidia's current price is 136 thereabouts so at $1 139 that's going to be $3 of upside plus $5 of premium so that's $8 $8 you know is pretty good that's $800 on on 13 grand so again if i go for 17 contracts here all right 17 contracts uh this will be a lot of money this will be about 8,500 plus some upside so it's 4 to 10 grand right why is it that wide guys well it's because option trading isn't like it's not a job you can't get $7,500 per month 12 months in a row some months are going to be 6k some months are going to be 10k my month's 400k as as my portfolio grows bigger i see a lot of people that say i can never get there you can get there it's just a matter of time just i'm farther along in the journey than you are that's okay it take it just takes time you'll also get there if you stick to this game so i mean the results are going to vary but give or take on $200,000 if you make 4% it's like 8 grand and all you have to do is just sell puts to get in i would say 30 delta and then on the covered call side you are going to go a little bit higher so you can go for 35 or 40 delta it actually depends on on yourself like it is a case by case basis that is why i do one-on-one coaching it's because i'm not only doing my live trading and giving trades and covering questions and going over technical analysis and fundamental analysis i also do one-on-one coaching because it varies on people's situations like if you want to retire your risk level is going to be different from someone else's risk level your time horizon is also going to be different so that's why i do one-on-one coaching obviously you can check that out if you want and if you don't want to totally fine just wanted to point that out so look a couple more tricks i want to go over before i wrap up the video adjusting your risk and reward is really easy here and i just showed you three examples spy nvidia and tesla look at the implied volatility pay attention to it the higher the implied volatility the riskier it is right however you also want to pay attention to rsi and the bowling band if the rsi is under 40 that's a good indicator that the stock is not necessarily oversold but it's it's much better than buying at a 52e high the lower the rsi the better all right so you want to jump in by selling puts and beginning the wheel strategy now if a stock is at a 52 we high i would honestly probably not trade that stock just because if you think about it a stock that's already expensive using the wheel strategy which is a bullish strategy can be a little bit dangerous it's not a bulletproof strategy there is no bulletproof strategy and that's a lie right every single option has its pros and has its cons all right being whatever there's everything has a pro and con in life there is no nothing is like necessarily like good and nothing's necessarily bad it's just how we think about things and there's trade-offs and everything right being rich and famous can have cons right being poor can have pros same thing with each strategy it just you know the wheel strategy has cons the con is when the market goes down the wheel strategy suffers however it doesn't suffer more than a regular stock strategy so if you're looking to retire it's still make sense to have a 100% option portfolio that might sound crazy to you but it's actually safer than stocks so it's literally safer so having a 100% option portfolio is what i would do and i would use the wheel strategy to essentially retire and that's essentially what i've done i'm just running the wheel strategy with my positions for the most part i have some other strategies some are for fun some are for teaching but if it was up to me i could be fine with just 100% wheel right i know it's easier for me to say i get it i have a 7figure portfolio but if i had 200k i would still run majority of the portfolio in just the wheel strategy using a combination of some etfs actually xlk and xl y is also good xlk is the tech uh spider tech etf and then xl y is the consumer discretionary etf you can look into those as well in this market there's you know i think etfs are are good because they save you a lot of time and they have built- in diversification now i was saying how adjusting your risk and reward is really easy well you you can also just lower your delta right it's not just about implied volatility it's all about delta so if you want to go lower in the delta when you're selling puts fantastic do so um especially because in my one-on-one coaching i do teach margin trading and i do go for lower deltas in the margin trading because there's a way to collect free income selling puts but i don't cover that strategy on youtube i think it's a little advanced so you know if you want to go higher in the delta you will get a sign more often on both selling puts and selling covered calls so you can go higher in the delta for selling puts and that's perfectly okay you can go higher on the delta for selling covered calls and you'll also get assigned more again that's fine if you're generating the income that you need and you actually need that income for retirement i don't think there's anything wrong with that you will be paying taxes i'm not a tax advisor nor am i a financial adviser i'm just the guy in the internet that has tons of experience more than most financial advisers but you know it's it is a taxable event so running the wheel strategy is high you know regular income on the taxes but you know it's also one of the best ways to build your wealth and it's also one of the best ways for high income producing activities so i would say that pay attention to delta in my discord i'm always looking at deltas i'm always trying to understand what is the best strike to pick stuff like that just like little nuances but you guys get the general picture let me

2024-11-30,A3Mq7iq_jpk,"kind: captions language: en guys we have to talk there are certain stocks that i'm going to cover in this video today that are going to make a lot of money in december and as december approaches which is right around the corner i need you to watch this video before monday 9:30 a.m. because these stocks that i'm going to cover like sofi like paler like nvidia i have some news and updates on these stocks and i'm holding them in my portfolio my portfolio is at $4 million and i'm going to be going over my most influential stocks so i'm holding tesla paler i have paypal i have american airlines spy nvidia let's not waste any time and let's jump right into it starting with the first stock which is sofi i haven't covered sofi a lot on this channel but i've done a lot of research and basically here's why i think sofi is going to continue to rally and this is one of the most influential stocks that i plan to actually buy on monday so the market is rallying due to a combination of doish federal reserve all right those policies that the fed is coming out with right now are very doish and that's actually going to be a big benefit for soof file explain in just a minute look a record $7 trillion is sideline right now and that cash is moving towards stock in a big area and fintech is where the money is moving fintech is getting a lot of cash because investors are looking for high yield and attractive opportunities this market has tons of them but what is the most attractive sofi is set to benefit from falling interest rates a favorable regulatory environment which is super super important we know that from tesla regular regulatory environment is one of the most impactful things on a stock also what's impacting so far is tax reforms and all of this is going to give it a competitive advantage over traditional banks now guys i worked at goldman sachs and when i looked at goldman sachs's software and how traditional banks operate their business i was like are we in 1990 like is this company operating before i was even born the type of technology that you see at traditional banks is awful and i think that's going to be a really clear disruption play and sofi is going to benefit from disrupting these banks i mean it's all about disruption when a new company a new competitor comes in and they actually disrupt the market that's when you get huge market share and that's when you actually dominate and make a lot of money so sofi it's basically going to challenge traditional and outdated banks all right they're not going to completely wipe them out obviously that would mean that sofi would be trillions and trillions of dollars but just looking at sofi i'm going to pull up the stock i'm going to show you check how much the stock is up in the past 3 months i think it's finally blown going up because investors realize that this stock is a really attractive play now i have sold 14 puts and $10 puts um being honest with you guys i do not have shares but at least i show you my entire portfolio and i'm very transparent about what i have and what i don't have and i plan to buy sofi uh on monday i plan to buy it on monday although i am very cautious because the price earnings ratio is very high but the market cap's only $17 billion i think this company can be a $50 billion company in the next two years years and specifically what i think is going to make a lot of sense is that sofi is going to dominate in terms of taking market share from some of the traditional banks but i also think that they're going to be positioned to capitalize on regulatory modernization okay i think that a digital first banking trend is very clear in the market a digital first banking trend just means that you know there's like this bank there's another bank chime there's another bank ally some of these banks have you know store fronts and stuff but more of these banks are going digital okay that means that there is no storefront that's not like a you know a bank of america branch where they have branches all over the united states becoming a bank that is more digital is actually a genius move because you don't have the cost of having a storefront you don't have the cost of having brick and mortar you know traditional stores where i have to pay for rent pay for more employees and this is similar to like a robin hood play in my opinion where robin hood is you know it's a free app free right they have certain other costs i won't get into that in this video but robin hood has dominated and has democratized finance for everyday retail investors and i think sofi is doing something very similar because they can offer cheaper prices they can offer better services because they don't have the brick and mortar uh you know storefronts robin hood doesn't have uh stores all over america like you know the other brokerages like tdm trade or schwab schwab bought tdm trade so the potential for sofi is really really big so i'm going to be buying some sofi stock when monday the market opens up i'm also going to be looking at selling some more put options i have showed you here that i have the 14 put the $10 put but i'm also going to be looking at probably selling some $15 puts and in a certain way i don't want to chase the stock up but at the same time the momentum trend is so good i actually think this is a good stock to buy call options on because if sofi goes to $20 per share let me show you the options here and then we'll move to the next stock cuz i want to be efficient in this video if you look at the expiration date and i go to let's say january 17 and i go to buying a call option you can actually get a really interesting action here on the 15 so i was looking at the 15 uh this morning it's a 67 delta this would be an in the money call option this would be worth $2 so you would have to spend $200 but check it out if sofi continues to move up and it goes to $20 per share you're going to have $20 minus the 15 strike price which is $5 that you're in the money so you're spending two to make five right boom right that's that's what you will do if you are also bullish on sofi there's no need to sign up for any master classes or free webinars i'm just giving you guys all my all my ideas for free my free content is better than people's paid content so just being honest with you sofi i'm bullish and the best way that i would play this is either buy some shares of stock and dollar cost average into it number two i would sell puts at 15 strike price for january 17 number three i would use a small amount of capital and actually buy an in the money short short-term call option which i haven't really covered on this channel much but basically that short-term call option gives you all that movement to the upside it gives you movement to the upside on a high delta with only investing 200 bucks so that's the play now the next play that i want to talk about is going to be pal here i'm going to go jump back into my portfolio here guys paler its current pe ratio is freaking high it's high as my biceps right now but you know if you take a look and you try to understand paler from a business perspective look this is a side because a lot of people get this wrong paler here is really misunderstood the high pe ratio does not matter it doesn't matter because a lot of people that are skeptical and saying that it's overly expensive were those people also saying that amazon was really expensive with that tesla was really expensive and nvidia was really expensive back in its growth phases maybe if those people were even investing because most of the time those people lose their shirts and quit altogether but that is the same type of person that also looks at tesla amazon nvidia and says oh it's too expensive i'm going to be in my spy only which is fine spy can also make you money and i'll talk about spy and what i think the market is going to do in december uh in in a few minutes but look if you want the big results you need to go for something that has potential to give you big results which is paler paler solutions have been also proven by the way guys i do pay attention a little bit because i'm out in eastern europe paler solutions have been invaluable for ukraine and the middle east right the the two wars going on the situations that you know i can't believe where the you know our world's still in war these days but the the war is happening in ukraine middle east and palen here you know looking at my research here they are showcasing rapid deployment capabilities in active conflict zones okay so palance here is a big you know you can call it a help you can call it a contributor you know i don't want to get into politics and i don't really pick sides i don't care to me democrats and republicans are the same thing they're just both trying to get your time and your money and your attention i know they have different opinions but they're the same thing right to me because it doesn't really matter it's all we can do rather than paying all this attention to politics look without getting political paler is going to make a lot of money paler ai solutions are going to be very helpful because i was taking a look at the research and it's it's a little bit sad but modern warfare is going to probably continue unfortunately there's probably going to be conflict and differing opinions you know how different cultures they don't agree with each other and there's conflicts right so what's going to happen is that there's going to be a lot of conflicts that are going to be cyber okay conflicts and warfare are shifting to cy cber and aid driven strategy so war is going to be kind of ai driven it's going to be more technologically driven and palen here is positioned as a leader in basically you know being a solution during these wars which is you know for better for worse or for whatever not picking a side it's going to make paler a lot of money it's going to make paler a lot of money and that's why analysts like dan ies describe pal here as the messi of ai all right it's the messy of ai they they are innovating they're certainly very valuable on the commercial side they're very valuable on the government side and for me palante here is a position that i'm going to continue to hold obviously i've been early in this play and i don't want to spend too much time on it because my position is really clear let me show you what my position is actually i have i have a couple positions at palen here 45 covered call which i need to roll up if you want to watch a rolling video just type invest with henry rolling on youtube i have a palen here 50 covered call i also need to roll this up and then the rest of my shares are actually uncovered uh i've been smart enough to not sell covered calls on my entire share i have 5100 shares at $65 uh the stock's at $65 right now my average cost is 21 21 so i made $222,000 i also have more p here in my other portfolio i have two portfolios so i don't have too much in in one portfolio and i've been publicly tracking all this so if you guys appreciate all my transparency here you know all you can do is subscribe no free master classes no no discord stuff you don't need that stuff i just i have that if you want additional help but you don't need it i'm here to give you everything for free all right my next play is going to be tesla i did cover in my video two or three days ago on tesla essentially um buying a 330 leap guys 330 leaps right now are are the move for tesla i'm going to just say one sentence and then we're going to move on from tesla autonomous the autonomous play i could argue guys that it's the most undervalued part of tesla so the market isn't really pricing it in fully because there is obviously risk to autonomous not working out regulatory issues but in my opinion autonomous is the most undervalued part of tesla's business and this week tesla is i can't say is for sure right i don't know but i'm pretty confident that tesla is going to pump up and the reason why i think it's going to pump up is tesla's actually had a really interesting um move recently on the technical chart like when i was looking at tesla after this huge rise right we had kind of like a peak at 350 and then another peak at like 352 we've pulled back but you can already see the market's like nah no no i want more tesla and i was taking a look at the volume the volume is very indicative to me and the technical analysis is very indicative to me that tesla is going to move higher so i think that we have a little bit of a short-term dip from the 350 range down to 330 range but i can see the stock going back up to 350 so that's why i don't have any covered calls you can see here i have 300 sellp put 220 sellp put 200 sellp put um i'm up $7,800 on the options but i'm not selling covered calls cuz i am still bullish okay i am still bullish i have a th000 shares average cost of $218 per share i am still bullish 300 leap option my leap option will go out to september of 2025 okay so go ahead if if you want to own tesla buy shares if you want to put money to work without having to put up a lot of capital but get upside on tesla go with the 330 leap option just check out my channel i already went over a full video on why i'm doing the 330 leap option now let's move on next stock i want to cover that i think is going to be interesting for this week is nvidia nvidia has been pulling back as well very kind of similar to tesla where it has reached you know some really nice highs but now the stock is pulling back towards the 135 range and i'm going to be selling 130 puts let me show you here let me show you the nvidia chart nvidia has pulled back from about 140s down to 135 pre-market here you know nvidia is looking pretty good but for me i'm going to go for 130 cell put i have 132 sellp put for 1220 expiration you can actually go for 130 or 132 either way i am bullish on nvidia and i want to look for entry into nvidia more nvidia shares why because nvidia is one of the best ai plays and i've already made a lot of videos on nvidia so we'll move on but you should probably know why i'm bullish on nvidia next spy guys before i cover the last two spy and smci will be the last one something interesting there i'm bullish on spy because i think as uh we have a new president that's going to be entering office bullish on the republicans doing very well um although you know we're going to get some more money printing etc the stock market will do well mark my words we're going to have a very strong 2025 and there's a huge opportunity here in the next couple of months to make a lot of money so i'm just bullish on on spy in general and spy the market i think will go up about maybe 2 3% or so in december and then into january we're probably going to see a further rise because there's something called the january effect where stocks do tend to rise in january so look spy is good now last one last stock i want to cover is going to be smci because i want to put out a big warning for you guys all right smci is a gambling stock all right it's a gambling stock there is no reason to own this long term and if you have a few bucks to throw away you probably have a 50-50 shot of winning on smci i don't know about you guys but i'm not into 50-50 bets i don't like flipping quarters i like having an edge i like to have a high win rate i like to have a high probability of success i'm not following smci closely and i purposely will not invest even a dollar into smci and i think this company is just not a good company overall i don't like following hype i like to make consistent safe passive income so i don't care if the stock is undervalued i don't care what people think about in the short term what's the point of trying to trade the crazy volatility on smci and try to make them money 50/50 this company is trash in my opinion so there's no point of investing save your money and invest safe last thing i want you guys to go ahead and check out this video it's not a popular video however it's it's the really boring but important stuff and it's the secret option trading strategies to outsmart the market psychologically which a lot of people are really not into if you look at the time stamps on this video i go into the illusion of trading exploiting x dividend dates early assignment implied volatility rank a lot of stuff that i don't typically cover and i don't typically cover it for good reason i spend an hour on the video and we have you know not that much uh not that many folks actually interested in this but i think this boring stuff is important guys so check out this video there's a lot of stuff about overconfidence false safety at risk consistent approach data driven examples anomalies buying options fallacy portfolio examples volatility and honestly just how to outsmart the market i think this video is really worth watching and it's kind of upsetting i can't make content that actually helps you guys so if you actually want to make money in this market please watch something that might not be the sexiest video or this once ever opportunity to quadruple your money but actually get better at trading options and psychology and trading it will do you a big big benefit all right i'll leave that video right here right now and i guess i'll see you guys

2024-12-02,Ni7UeFTIDfQ,"kind: captions language: en as you can see i just invested $1 million into tesla stock and i bought 3,000 shares of this stock so why did i do this and why do i think tesla is one of the best opportunities right now to make a ton of money i just put $1 million more dollars into tesla and i think it's undervalued for three main reasons that i will cover in this video as quickly as possible i respect your time so here's the main explanation okay dan ies mentioned that regulations are going to get a lot better for tesla now that elon musk is in the white house and he is friends with donald trump so i have an updated price target for tesla into 2025 but i first quickly want you to watch a 30- second clip to know one of my three reasons why i just put $1 million into tesla stock and one of the three reasons is regulations listen to this real quick that's bullish for attack i think what a big reason when trump came in when you think about kh out the ftc that's bullish or big tech i think less regulations and then who's at the table right next to trump it's musk and i think that's going to also play a big role unofficially in terms of some of these picks and where this all goes but i continue to think in terms of this ai revolution it is 1000 p.m. at that party that goes to 4:00 a.m. and i don't see any of these appointments that's changing that party or that party closes early i think we have a tech bull market that goes well into 20 2025 2026 so dan ies thinks that we're going to be in a bull run in 2025 and 2026 i'm going to give you my take but i'll start off with he's absolutely right about regulation the reason why you'll see here that i put 3,000 shares more into my portfolio i already had a couple of put options i sold a put option at 235 and i also sold a put option at 300 both those options expire in december but i was tired of selling puts guys selling puts has been good but i just decided that i'm going to buy some shares i'm tired of waiting to enter tesla stock i want to be right in tesla stock so i bought it 3,000 shares for $332 per share dumping $1 million into the stock so far i'm up $ 36,960 now you know you don't have to have a huge portfolio to invest in tesla let me give you the whole reasoning the reason why i put $1 million more doar into tesla is it's clear to me that the stock is going to $500 per share in 2025 the valuation of tesla looks pretty big but it is going to get bigger for some key reasons so that's the short answer if you need a bounce from this video you know $500 price target i think that you should follow my last video where i said buy $330 call options leap options into september 2025 and just ride tesla higher i'm so confident i put a million dollars and i actually showed it to you here on my screen of real money not just talking like other youtubers showing all right so that's it hope that you enjoyed that now if you have some time let me talk about all the reasons that i have for tesla and why i made such a big bet this is a big bet in my other portfolio this portfolio i typically only cover with my 101 students and i take big bets there different types of strategies i do some option buying i also do margin trading i do a whole lot of interesting strategies but it is for sixf figureure and seven fig investors that already have a sixf figureure portfolio that are trying to scale i still do one-on-one coaching i still do one-on-one coaching in discord but this is just my highest level where i'm taking on a little bit more risk and that's why i usually don't showed this portfolio on youtube with that out of the way let's talk about what dan ies really said and let's disregard his pink suit because uh what dan ives kind of wears is kind of a little bit ridiculous but you know the man's been right more often than he's been wrong so as long as we're getting the results i guess he can wear all the pink suits that he wants look dan ies is bullish for the next 12 months and i think this is for good reason with elon musk now helping uh trump and in general dan eyes was just bullsh in 2025 on the tech sect he had a different clip where he said fire right he's had fire this market's on fire and i completely agree i think that we're going to see a lot of upwards movement and the big reason for that is guys that we do have a doish fed so with interest rates going down this is very positive for tech companies specifically tech companies can hire more workers and they can raise more money and a lot of these multi-billion dollar and trillion dollar companies you think they're taking out debt because they need the money no they just take out the debt if it's cheap debt it makes sense okay like i said i use margin these companies are also technically using margin you think apple needs debt no they don't need it they're just taking out cash so they can hire more employees so they can spend more on marketing they can grow their business and if de is cheap why not and with the doish fed this is going to be very very positive for tesla you know robo taxes aside all the other stuff ai stuff that i'm going to cover in this video aside this is very bullish because a dubish fed intrinsically just creates more value in the stock mark okay warren buffett has talked about now look i'm making money hand over fist guys on tesla on on my other ai plays and i've been absolutely right and i believe i'm very confident in 2025 that i'm going to be right on tesla and i made a $1 million bet now i was telling one of my doctor students this basically i was having my one-on-one session i said listen doc it's kind of like a big harvesting season right now if you were a farmer and you had all these fruits and veggies you're eating all them you still need to store them away for winter cuz guys right now is the easiest time to make money and we should make as much money as possible because we are going to get a pullback in the market eventually right i'm not going to be an idiot here and say we're going to go up forever no we're not we are going to have a pullback at some point but while the opportunity exists you want to make as much money as possible and that's the same way you want to take as many fruits and veggies as possible and freeze them for the winner so that way when the tougher times come your portfolio is up 40 50 60 70% or even double we're going to give some of it back that's inevitable okay even if i protect myself and i hedge my portfolio to my best ability we're still going to see a pullback at some point so right now it's important to make money hand over fist guys like it is the easiest time all right so that's that's one thing that i want to point out that with tesla i think that we still have some more room to run so as we approach $500 it's not going to be smooth sailing we're not just going to go up like this we're going to get some volatility along the way that's why i'm selling puts and that's why i'm actually going to be doing leap options i'll show you that leap option example a little bit later on in the video but i want to give you more reasoning so i said i had three reasons to be honest i honestly hope that you guys don't mind that i have more than three reasons i did give you guys a little summary in the beginning i have a few more reasons you know hope that's not a problem i'll i'll leave you alone after after this video i promise look there's $7 trillion on the sidelines all right so when i think about the $7 trillion on the sidelines that is going to get invested in the market and the top stocks are going to reap the most rewards mega cab stocks reap the most rewards because they're the safest and they're deemed the most investable by institutional investors basically if you look at the facts guys tesla's market cap increased $300 billion do following donald trump's election as the 47th president all right with the media and analyst speculating on its implications on tesla and elon musk right there's a lot of speculation and the stock is up a lot but please notice the stock going up $300 billion or $330 billion is not just retail investors it is not just retail investors in fact this stock has gained a lot of momentum because of institutional money aka smart money all right retail investors like you and i are not really moving the stock especially not tesla it's a mega cap stock even my $1 million bet is nothing it's like it's like just going into thin air basically but i will say that institutional invest vors are investing in tesla and the volume is very clear and this is something that i like to follow when i see a stock that's up a lot it's up a lot for good reason these institutional investors are not stupid so i'm telling you right now that musk's close relationship with trump will enhance tesla's prospects through favorable policies on manufacturing okay on innovation and overall economic growth that could be in the form of different policies some of the policies could help reducing energy costs deregulations obviously trump is a fan of that there could be tax incentives i know there's going to be an ev tax credit that's going away but there may be some new tax incentives coming in corporate tax reductions right that's going to be a big thing as well that can impact tesla very easily and all of these little benefits trust me they add up they add up to the revenue the top line and they also add up a lot to the bottom line of tesla which just further increases what analysts are going to be you know thinking about the stock now guys also i want to tell you one thing about analysts and i'll tell you the dark truth here okay because i i worked on wall street i've seen how analysts work i have a degree in this stuff and to be honest analysts are likely to revise tesla's price target up but not because the stock's actually good but it's still a good reason the reason why they actually will revise their price target up is because as tesla surges these analysts feel stupid they feel dumb all right because as tesla goes up and they have a price target of 150 they have to raise their price target which creates kind of like that spiraling effect okay as analysts are like wait i'm way too far from tesla i look stupid let me raise my price target up more analysts copy each other it's a copying game guys you think these analysts are not looking at each other they're just copying each other all right so when the company surges in value like tesla has and it reflects in the company's growth the analysts are like well duh this was an obvious play so they start raising their price targets and that's actually going to help tesla's price per share maintain its value because as more analysts raise their price target more retail investors realize this is a good opportunity now guys i understand i'm not early on the trend i was early on the trend but in today's day i'm not early on tesla but you don't have to be early to make more money that's just a fact of it my parents actually bought tesla stock and it was kind of interesting because my parents are believe more in hard assets my mom and dad have like real estate and stuff like that and they don't really believe in the stock market as much right cu growing up in the soviet union you know they just don't have that belief in in the government or or in the the processes like a stock market right back in soviet union they didn't have stuff like that right so they believe in hard assets and now they bought tesla a couple years ago for a really high price start get actually and as tesla fell down i told my parents to dollar cost average and to buy more shares but my dad said nope i have enough in it and now that tesla has surged back up which i i was saying it would it will recover i was like dad it's going to recover for sure trust me he didn't he said okay i'm just going to wait now that tesla popped up so much he really kind of regrets he's like well i should have dollar cost averaged more and this is kind of like something that you really want to pay attention to and that's the reason why i put another million dollars into tesla stock is because i'm just dollar cost averaging i'm dollar cost averaging up and there's nothing wrong with dollar cost averaging up i'm clearly up already $37,000 i put out this play in my discord community and we're making money on it if i see a shift in demand i will absolutely you know either cut the position i will hedge it more aggressively with covered calls i may even buy put options there are option strategies that i do cover when i do my one-on-one coaching because option buying does deserve to be in your portfolio however option buying is something riskier and if you're a beginner you should be sticking more to selling op options but option buying can be very lucrative and it can be a very good hedge um just it is an individualized basis which is why i don't really cover it as much on youtube now look so last thing i want to say is the reason i put a million dollars into tesla is because i believe in their mission i believe elon musk is going to continue executing i believe this is an ai play and uh tesla's market cap will likely be $2 trillion in 2025 so i'm going to leave you with this 3 minute example on a leap option on tesla which i just covered a few days ago but i think it is is super valid if you don't have a big portfolio and you don't want to just buy shares of tesla i think it's super valid for you to go with a leap option so here's a three-minute example of a leap option and how i would play tesla right now as well as selling a covered call on the leap option in this short 3 minute example you can really reduce your risk because when you're buying a leap you ma your maximum loss is really limited to the leap option uh premium that you pay and this example it is going to be roughly $8,400 so you know that is a lot less than having to put up 100 shares which is going to be around the $355,000 mark so here it's a lot cheaper and it's a lot more efficient so that's why i like the limited risk nature of leaps and now the third thing is i said there's three things is there's just an extended time horizon so leap can look like shares it can really look like shares if you buy a long-term leap it's really functioning in the same way if i expand this option right here this delta is 66 so it's not as high as 70 or 75 as i usually say but it's close enough you're getting a lot of benefit if the stock goes up to 400 so basically it'll go up by $50 and this option right here will be $50 times the 66 delta all right so that's going to be about $33 higher $33 high i did that math in my head real quick really love math back in in uh in school $33 is going to be how much this option would rise and because that $33 is actually a lot of money on $84 so if tesla goes up by $50 this option increases by 33 33 you know you know as a portion to 84 so$ 3,300 is what you would make on $8,400 that would be like around 40% return or so 40% or so return but you know if you do the math if tesla goes up by 50 bucks you know that's really only a 15% return or so on the tesla stock so had you had tesla stock you would make about 15% but if you have this leap option you're going to make about 40% so you have almost a 3x leverage factor here with the leap option you get almost 3x the same return if you were to use the same capital or basically you can think about as you're able to use oneir or you know about 40% of the capital so instead of you know putting out you know 35k you're only putting out 8,400 to get the same benefit and if the stock moves up you get huge you get huge benefits you can close at any time that's also what i want to point out you guys do not have to hold until expiration the reason why i have a discord community is because obviously it is a case-by casee basis i can't just blanket statement say do this with this situation because situations vary and the market does pull back and we do get bare markets and we do have changes in volatility and we do have sometimes bad volume or bad bid ask spread we have there's so many things to consider and i'm trying to educate you guys as much as possible but simply said leap options just make a lot of sense if i wanted to reduce the cost of a leap option i would simply sell call options to reduce the price you can pick various different expiration days so i can go for august i can go for june i can go for may one is not better than the other guys option trading is all about choices and preferences all right it really depends on your risk appetite uh for me let's just say we're going to go for march 21st i'll give you this example right here this about 115 days out and this is the time frame i'm going to use because i said i think in q1 we could reach 400 but you know it could be a little bit early in q1 so i i'm comfortable enough to to go for something like the 390 uh call option right here so if i sell this call option i will collect $3,000 and i can reduce my cost down to only $5,000 you know give or take $ 5290 so by reducing my cost here to$ 5290 or $5,300 that's fantastic because now i get even a bigger leverage effect than i mentioned earlier i hope you enjoyed that example i also hope that you appreciate my transparency of sharing my portfolio where i actually invested a million of my own dollars into tesla stock i'm going to keep sharing my stuff with you guys here make sure that you're subscribed and if you want any coaching or one-on-one time with me go ahead and check out the first link in the description and i'll catch you guys in the next one have a blessed and happy day

2024-12-05,Is662tG7DzE,"kind: captions language: en we have a chance to make even more money on pal here the stock has been going up every single day it's over $70 per share i call this play but i'm also going to call a new play where you can make money using leaps and there's a special opportunity that's a setting up right now that i'm going to go over in this video i'm really excited because we're about to make money hand over fist bicep over tricep i'm super pumped up because what i'm seeing right now really rake in a lot of premiums and in this video i'm going to walk you through exactly how i'm going to be using options to play paler in a very smart way because it is reaching all-time highs and i am very cautious in some ways which is why i would say you should be doing leaps or nothing right now literally leaps or nothing right now i'm telling you the reason why you want to go leaps or nothing is because having your money stuck in paler right now is kind of like dead money dead money means you have a whole bunch of capital tied up but i don't think the stock is going to have too much more upside and if it does it'll have fast upside at a higher level of risk by the way before i go into this leap strategy i am having a webinar this saturday going over my entire leap strategy with seven plays that i don't have on youtube i'm going to be spending two hours of time just basically going over the leap plays that i have why i'm doing them teaching you guys a lot on a zoom call so go ahead and check out the first link for that now i think right now it's not too late to jump into leaps on palance here and this is a very special opportunity let me show you an example of why i think this is the case and by the way i've been making over 15% per month in this market right now you guys can see that i'm up $253,000 on palante here if i had used leap options on palen here with my entire position i would actually be up a lot more money so instead of having shares instead of having these 5,000 00 shares had i been in leaps from the very very beginning i would be up way more money probably like $750,000 that's because leaps have a leverage factor they give you 3x the return so let me show you what i'm going to be looking at right now paler is at over $71 per share it's been up like like a complete monster this stock and there's a lot of reasons for it i can go over the reasons let me just show you the play first cuz i respect your time today i'm going to mix it up a little bit i'm going to go with the option play first and then the reasoning why later all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go for a december 27 we're going to have an end of year play all right let's say that the end of the year and i said december is going to be a huge month i've been right so far we're only a couple days into december but i said it's going to be a huge month and we're right on the money right now because momentum is high and one of the most important factors in the market is momentum when i was working for a hedge fund the guy told me that the higher momentum is the more likely the stock is likely to continue having that momentum so there's only two plays that are going to make sense i'm going to show you something really unusual by the way first i'm going to go to buy call option i i would say that right now you can have a leap option for a shortterm and a long-term play so i'm going to show you three different positions not two actually excuse me i'm going to show you even more than what i said so december 27 you can go in with the buy call option now look i would not hold this up up until expiration okay let me explain if you hold an option until expiration more often than not they do expire out of the money that's why buying options is risky because often times they expire out of the money however nobody said that you have to hold an option up until expiration guys it doesn't make sense what does make sense is is if you see the stock moving higher like pounds here with clear momentum like it goes up 6% in a day you can bet that that can happen again and if it goes up another 7% which is getting less and less likely but in this type of bull market you can see that the end of a bull market is where a lot of profit is realized a lot it can be dangerous which is why i'm saying don't put a lot of capital on this position just buy several call options and ride those call options and close them really early what i mean by early is literally this is expiring december 27th i would just jump in for like a week now this is something that i would consider as a fun play but also a very high-profit potential play because there's very little capital that you have to put at risk here if you buy a couple of call options just two it's only going to be $365 per contract so two contracts is about $700 and if this stock pops under 7% you're essentially going to see the stock go up by about $5 but this option will go up by about $35 so you know or $25 actually because the delta here is 0.5 so if the stock goes up by five the delta of 0.5 means that the option will go up by $2.50 so if you put up you know 365 and it goes up you know $2.50 that's going to be about you know 75% return so not quite a double on your money but thereabouts so you can basically turn like $700 into like around $1,200 which is a really nice gain that's like $500 on a really really tiny amount of money imagine if you 10x that and depending on your portfolio size if you're working with six figures which is majority of folks that i work with lawyers doctors uh engineers um you guys that can put in a five figure amount into a play like this cuz you have a sixf figure portfolio i've seen guys making so many multiple five figures in these months because in a bull market again you want to take advantage of the hotness it's not always like this i mentioned in my last video it's like basically right now there's been a lot of rain on our farm all the fruits and veggies are growing there's so much abundance of fruit you have to take them and freeze them for the winter because it's not always going to be this hot okay so when there's money to be made take it with like basically like we're taking these fel barrels okay we're putting all the money up in there we're like all right this is ours all right the fruits the veggies we're just missing the protein all right so that's what you want to do right now on pal here and you know i want to say that i'm paying very close attention to the stock and i'm actually paying attention to what the insiders are doing okay by insiders i mean someone like ken griffin right from citadel advisers back in september actually he ended up selling off 5 million shares and guess what my man was wrong he was wrong i ended up making way more money you know percentage wise than many hedge funds because many hedge funds cut something like pound here which is a really stupid move so ken griffin did that de shaw right david shaw he's another hedge fund billionaire that basically trimmed the stake in p here during the third quarter um which he sold off 8.7 million shares so the reason why i'm saying that some people are selling off some people are buying it's cuz when there's so much volatility this is the perfect opportunity where you want to jump in to buying some call options because there's a lot of controversy there's a lot of controversy there's a lot of volatility you can actually do two things and you should be kind of buying options on pound and by the way you can buy calls and puts let me explain all right so this this position right here to finish off my first trade 72 call just jump in do not hold until expiration i would just give it a week and if paler goes up cut the position take profit you're out you're good i'm just trying to squeeze out as much money from the bull market as possible so we will get in get out we're good all right now the next play that i would make is paler is a good long-term play let's just be honest it is it's been and i've said it's been for since iplo since ip guys since i i said that all right buy call september 19 you know look for for leap option you do want to go in the money so i'm going to scroll down here to 62 a2 and this is a 70 delta so this right here if you put up $22 which is about $2,200 it's a lot better than putting in $77,000 in buying the stock so again 3 to 5% of your portfolio 5% would be on the little bit of the higher end 3% of your portfolio no problem so if you're working with $200,000 you put in you know six grand you buy three contracts here nothing wrong with that right and you do not also have to hold this until expiration in all buying scenarios i usually don't hold until expiration i pick an exit point where i'm happy with the profits so for example let's say that paler goes to $80 per share in the next two to three months all right and february it's at $80 per share and the stock went up basically $9 my option went up let's say by $6 right because the options not as sensitive as the stock it's not going to move dollar for dollar it's going to move about 71 which is the delta right so delta actually measures how much the option moves so the option is up so if the stock is up $10 the option would be up about $7 that's how it works that's what delta is trying to say delta has two definitions first definition is the sensitivity that the option has when the stock moves and the second definition is the chances that the option will expire in the money so clearly the delta here is 71 which means that there's a high chance of it expiring in the money which is a very very good thing now what i would do in february if this option were to be up you know $6 that would give me a really good return of about 25% so in 2 or 3 months if i'm up 25% listen i'm not complaining guys i'm making money hand over fist 25% it's not bad just to take profit especially because i do think paler will be peing at some point this stock cannot just go to the moon fundamentals do matter and stocks aren't rocket ships like elon musk's rockets right they have some type of center of gravity from physics perspective just when it comes to stock investing they have something called mean reversion which means that a stock will come back down to its mean now now the mean is just the average of what it's worth right but pounds here continues to be worth more and more because revenues are rising so it i'm still very bullish on it don't get me wrong but we're not going to go to like you know trillion dollars overnight so it's going to take time and if you jump in with this call option the 62 and a2 i would hold it for one or two months if you want exposure to tesla without having to buy 100 shares and you know put up all this capital you can put up a lot less capital now what i'm going to show you as well is actually in addition to having these call options you can o hedge your position by buying some put options or potentially put deit spreads so let's say that you're fearful and this is i i don't personally do this myself but i think this does deserve a position in your portfolio okay maybe it's on paler maybe it's something else when you have a big position use a strategy like this all right so i'm going to go for january 17 44 days out and look this is going to be buying a put option or a put deit spread all right so you can buy something really simple and hedge at $70 this would be expensive right this is $470 that's a fairly expensive hedge so what you can do instead is we're betting on pounds here going up with the leap option right but let's say that it pulls back well you also want to win on that you want to win on both sides i'm trying to create as much winning potential as possible i'm trying to put you in a winner's position right so it goes up you make money it goes down you're like well you can also make money or basically cover some of the cost that you have for buying a call option this is an interesting way because now i'm buying options from both sides sid i'm buying a call option on the upside and i'm buying a call option on the downside and specifically when does this make sense and when does this not make sense listen guys this makes sense right now in this market because we have so much volatility the stock is going to pop a lot higher so unusual events like bull markets which by the way i consider a bull market kind of an unusual event because typically we don't see 15 20% returns in a month this is insane market but it's also a good market right that's besides the point when you have this type of activity it's like to continue a lot higher and be hot or maybe we'll get a maybe we'll get a bare market or a crash that could happen like this guys don't underestimate the market when i was working at goldman sachs the adviser that i was working next to he told me the market's job is to make the most amount of people look stupid and i was like whoa that is a very bold statement the most amount of people to look stupid i thought the market was about making money he's like it is for the smart and the rich okay but if you want to make money let's say you're doing well but you're not a multi- multi-millionaire or billionaire well you got to be smart you got to be smarter than the rest of the people you need an information advantage you need a strategy advantage you need to have advantages in this game this is the most competitive game in the world everyone wants to make money so look this is what i would do you can buy a 70 put option but i would also sell another put option and create a put debit spread because it's going to be a lot cheaper so instead of putting up 470 if if you end up uh selling the 65 put here okay this is going to create a put debit spread position and now your cost goes down because well when you sell a put option you collect some income right so you're buying a 70 that's betting on it going to 70 or below but it's not going to i don't think it's going to crash like paler could go down but you know it'll go down it'll reach a support level at 65 right i did my research before this video because i respect your time i try to go fast in these videos so if i buy a 70 and i sell a 65 that 65 will subsidize or reduce the cost of the $70 put option that i'm buying so instead of putting up$ 470 i am going to uh basically sell a put option and when i sell that 65 put option reduces my cost all the way down to just $217 so again if you go ahead and buy three leap options on the the first example i showed you or the second example i showed you the first example was just a call option a regular call option the second one was a leap option right for september which i consider a leap guys most people will say oh a leap is only one year but no a leap is just a long-term call option right for me 9 months is significantly longterm all right so first you buy a call option second you buy a leap option and then you jump in with a put deit spread and you can do all three of these trads this is probably what i'm going to end up opening up in my own portfolio i already have a lot of pents here and i've been early so you know i can only open up so much of a position but i'm always making these videos for you new guys that you know i hope you guys obviously subscribe and hope to keep making you guys money now look let me wrap it up now with the explanation of you know why i think paler is a good stock and why i cover this stock so i've been covering palen here from ipo and recently they've had the best quarter ever like literally the best quarter ever and when it comes to results it is mindblowing what palante here is doing right when i look at their commercial uh revenue growth when i look at their government contract revenue growth i've never seen this happen before this company is going to be a trillion dollar market cap it's just a question of when right and i think right now now it's an opportunity for leaps to jump in to get that you know growth up into the future to hold shares i do think it's still a good time to buy paler shares and hold for the long long term in the short term again we we're going to see volatility i guarantee pretty much guarantee we're going to see volatility it's unlikely that a stock is just going to go sideways paler is not a stock that likes to go sideways this stock has a personality this stock has a lot of personality and when i say the stock has a lot of personality let's be honest the investors trading the stock have a lot of emotion and that's what the stock market's about you have a lot of people that think the stock will go up and that's what actually makes it go up because you see a lot of buying volume people are putting money guys this game is psychological right it depends what other people are doing and that's why these videos that i'm making are very important because i have a very clear signal of what's going on with pal here based on the investors in my discord community based on the folks i talk to on wall street you know after working at goldman sachs i still have connections there i'm still talking to people every single day right i have friends there hey how how's how's your investment banking job right they're slaving their job they saving their life away in an office but hey you know i i chose option trading because i can do it remotely i can do it anywhere in the world and that's been my dream to uh basically have a lot of freedom i value freedom more than money it's not even the money that i was after i was after freedom right i have enough money making more money to me make another million $10 million it doesn't change anything i am in dubai right now traveling but you don't need millions and millions of dollars because with options if you can just produce 5 10% a month right you have a million dollars you don't even need a millionar you can have $400,000 10% is $40,000 a month that's enough to live in in dubai it's enough to live anywhere right it's enough to travel it's enough to have freedom it's enough to not need a 925 job it's enough not to even be a lawyer it's it's more than most lawyers make right i have so many lawyer clients that you know they go from case to case where they have to work really hard and then maybe they get a 50k 100k payout well with option trading you can make actually more consistent income than even many of these high level positions it just makes a lot of sense and then also the last thing that i want to say is that when can i take a look at uh what's going on in our in our postelection cycle i'm very very bullish right because look with the republicans republicans like bigger governments right we've seen that before they come in right like donald trump and he makes the office bigger he makes government they're just more government spending they love to spend money and the deficit will go up right but that money being spent trust me believe me i'm telling you this right now i've seen it from facts the government spend is also going to go to defense defense is going to go into paler pocket guys this is not even rocket science it's just pure facts look at what the republicans did last time spent a lot of money right and i'm not saying that's that's good or bad that it's actually good and bad there's pros and cons right but let's just be honest where that money is going to go it's going to go to healthcare and it's going to go to defense all right so on the defense side paler is going to make money hand over fist bicep over tri step and that's going to that's going to flood your pocket with money that's going to flood your pocket with money and when you jump into option strategies you will get a better return with lower risk or you will get a um you'll have a higher risk but a much higher return that's how options are there's two benefits you can either make a ton more money like boatloads of more money with higher risk or you can follow what i'm doing which i'm doing both i have a portion of my portfolio in the riskier stuff especially with my one-on-one clients i have folks coming in and they're like henry you know i've i've done well in life have you know few hundred, or even pushing seven figures i want to aggressively grow this money i want to get it from 400k to 800k i want to take it from half a mil to 1 mil or i want to scale my seven figureure portfolio so i am focusing on some of the more risky stuff because in this market when you can make 10 15 20% a month it really pays off it pays off because it helps you retire years earlier can you imagine you have a half a million dollar portfolio you're probably think in your head i have to work for you know in my lawyer job or my nursing job or you know as an engineer for a lot long longer i have stock options or whatever in my company but i'm going to have to work for another 10 years right i want i want freedom now i want to travel now or i want to you know be at home now and be a dad or or be a mom now right and have time with my family instead of being at the office all day well if you can go from 500k to 1 mil in one year that's going to like really really reduce the amount of time that you have to work to actually reach retirement it's going to give you more options and it just it's a shortcut why not take a shortcut why not take a shortcut to building wealth so i would say that when i look at what's happening in our post-election cycle i'm very bullish and i've been bullish and that's why my portfolios you know let's let's actually take a little quick deep dive into my portfolio and then wrap up this video that's why my portfolio is now at 4.1 million we just hit 4 million like a couple what is it like two weeks ago now we're at 4.1 million and that's going to continue to grow in this bull market so take advantage of this bull market saturday i have a webinar for two hours where i'm going to show you some lead plays that's going to just absolutely let you on fire so i'm really looking forward to that webinar i've already invested a lot of time into building the materials for it i'm super excited to jump on show you guys how to make money bicep over tricep i know i said it

2024-12-07,eVifPL2xAPM,"kind: captions language: en i just put $1 million into tesla stock very recently and as you can see i'm up $116,000 in the past few days and i just added more to my position in this video i'm going to explain to you why i'm buying tesla stock what i'm doing with tesla stock and an option trade that's going to make you a lot of money so let's jump into the video i respect your time so here's the main explanation now guys also i want to tell you one thing about analyst and i i'll tell you the dark truth here okay because i i worked on wall street i've seen how analysts work i have a degree in this stuff and to be honest analysts are likely to revise tesla's price target up but not because the stock's actually good but it's still a good reason the reason why they actually will revise their price target up is because as tesla surges these analysts feel stupid they feel dumb right because as tesla goes up and they have a price target of 150 they have to raise their price target which creates kind of like that spiraling effect okay as analysts are like wait i'm way too far from tesla i look stupid let me raise my price target up more analysts copy each other it's a copying game guys you think these analysts are not looking at each other they're just copying each other all right so when the company surges in value like tesla has and it reflects in the company's growth the analysts are like well duh this was an obvious play so they start raising their price targets and that's actually going to help tesla's price per share maintain its value i have $1 million in tesla stock i have 3,000 shares as you can see here i bought this just a few days ago and i made a video on it but at the same time i also have more more shares in tesla in my other portfolio my main portfolio that you guys usually see and i up $153,000 on tesla stock here with 1,000 shares so it's safe to say that i have a ton of tesla stock i'm either crazy a genius or somewhere in between let me explain the reason why i put $1 million more into tesla stock is it is clear to me that this stock is going to $500 per share and it will hit $500 per share in 2025 i have high confidence in that and i'm sure of this because elon musk's announcement of robo taxi event the tech bull market and um the tech bull market that will increase demand for tesla stock recent analyst upgrades switching from bearish to bullish and my new reason bank of america securities they have a bullish outtake after a giga austin factory visit so that's your answer those are my reasons why tesla is going to $500 per share so if you need a balce you don't have that much time totally understand now for you guys that do have some time let me give you a full explanation and i'm going to go over an option trade as well now i can't believe what happened with bank of america but also a be on wall street that turned bullish let me give you some context and if you recall just 4 days ago i said this guys i said that analysts raise price targets and it creates a whole spiraling effect right there's one analyst that says hey i think this stock's worth a little bit more and then another analyst that says oh i know i see this analyst going up and they follow each other they're doing like copying and this is exact exactly what has happened in just the past few days so past few days when i bought tesla to begin with and i started that $1 million position i had $1.3 million in it i had 1 mil and then 300,000 now is basically i had 1.5 mil that's because of analyst upgrading as well as other reasons i'm going to get into in this video let me prove that analysts are completely switching 180° they see tesla going up they're completely changing their mind one of those analysts is roth capitals craig irvin this guy for years and years actually he said that tesla has no technological advancement compared to toyota what a crazy statement this guy literally said that toota and tesla same thing same thing they don't have a technology advantage which is absolutely absurd technology is obviously the biggest thing that tesla has they have the biggest advantage with data with technology with ai you think elon musk isn't better than toota you got to be kidding me absolutely it's a joke so this guy finally realized he's finally jumped off of his looney tunes bandwagon and he finally switched 180° which i think is also a big contributor why the stock has popped a few percentage points because as each analyst jump ship from their bearish case because they realize they're stupid and they jump onto the bull case that actually creates a spiral effect as i mentioned now we also know from other analysts like dan ies he mentioned how regulations are about to get a lot better for tesla and with elon musk in the white house essentially that tesla is going to do very well in 2025 and 2026 and dan ies had that famous clip where he said fire this market is going to be fire and i'm in 100% belief and i'm on the same page that with the market right now going up and we see a really really bullish trend that this is just going to continue we are going to see a continuation because there's a lot of money on the sidelines that's being basically plowed into the market i don't know how to say a better word for it but plowed into the market a lot of people have a lot of uh stockpiled cash on the sides 7 trillion to be exact right there's there's you know there's some debate on that it could be 8 trillion and that is going into the market right now and a lot of it is going into the mega cap stocks especially the high innovation stocks and the high momentum stocks which i've been telling you guys paler tesla and nvidia these are the powerful stocks that you have to be in right now and i'm not just telling you guys like the other youtubers right i know which channels you guys are watching these youtubers show you excel sheets they have coaching programs but none of them actually show you the real results and what they're actually doing the transparency which is why i make sure to show you everything that i do and i make big bold bets because i have high confidence i've been doing this for 10 years and i've worked at goldman sachs i'm trying to put more money in your guys pockets i'm telling you this is the opportunity i invested $1 million and i'm already seeing a payoff i have more than a million do in two different portfolios i showed you both positions so for me this is a no-brainer play and in my own analysis guys let me tell you in my own analysis i don't follow others so just because i'm looking at craig irving i'm looking at dan ies and i'm looking at other analysts from bank of america which i'm about to get into it doesn't mean that i'm not doing my own analysis at the end of the day i trust myself more than i trust anybody else i'm only looking at these clips and i'm showing you guys a clip i'm going to show you one more real fast for 40 seconds i'm only showing this to support my thesis as well as when i'm looking at other research online it is really important because there's something called social velocity guys social velocity is essentially when other retail investors are looking at news and they're piling into the company because of the news going on news is a very big important piece of the stock market because it's a psychological game and volume does drive price okay listen volume drives price so when there's high volume and the stock is going up that means kind of like a herd of sheep everyone is running in one direction that's actually a good thing and you want to hop on on that trend that's how you squeeze out an extra 10 15 20% in this bull market if you can make 20% in the next three months what would that be for your portfolio if you have six figures that's like multiple five figures that's 20k 50k there's a lot of money to be made right now here's also my opinion i'm looking at my research right here we have two backto back 20% years and investors are wondering how much more can the stock market go up are we at the peak is it like going to be game over are we're going to get a big pullback are we going to get a crash i'm afraid you know i get a lot of my students saying i'm afraid right now you know what do i do i have some other students that are not afraid at all they're saying we're going to go up 50% 100% more i think that's too extreme okay so what's the actual answer well the actual answer is it doesn't really matter if we get more good news on tesla and the company keeps delivering on revenue and high performance earnings on the bottom end and the revenue actually reaches the bottom end we see more news coming from robo vans robo taxis the robots that elon musk has going on it doesn't really matter even if we're at a market peak because tesla itself is going to do really well okay tesla itself is going to grow and even if the stock market pulls back just a little bit we're still going to see a really good performance on tesla on a relative scale but i'm telling you on an absolute scale this company is going to $500 per share in 2025 and that's why i put a large chunk of my own net worth and my own wealth on this company as a big bet here's another really important reason i hope that you don't mind that i have multiple reasons supporting my claim here or my position here and honestly i'm not a financial adviser or anything like that i'm just showing you what i'm doing i'm being transparent because i've gained a lot of wealth and i to share it with you i want you to understand why i'm doing certain things i want you to copy me i want you to get the same results i want you to get richer so look elon musk's announcement of robo taxi event was very good news and the economics are absolutely insane it is so compelling the economics are so strong and i'm convinced that tesla is going to be over $2 trillion in market cap in 2025 because economics make sense you should be uh buying a tesla robo taxi because it's way cheaper than mass transit it's way way cheaper and you know what elon said honestly actually blew my mind so i want you to watch this really quick 40 seconds about elon musk and what he said about the economics and the economies of scale that tesla is going to achieve with the robo taxis i think the the cost of autonomous transport will be so low that you can think of it like individualized mass transit um the like the average cost of of a bus per mile for a city um not not the ticket price cuz that is idiz but the average price is about a dollar a mile whereas the cost of uh cyber cab uh we think probably over time from the operating cost is probably going to be around 20 cents a mile um and price including taxes and and everything else probably ends up being 30 or 40 cents a mile can we buy one so yes and you will be able to buy one cheaper and better mass transit are you you kidding me cheaper and better this is going to be a no-brainer for tesla this is going to be a no-brainer for the entire population of folks because why would you take a bus why would you take a taxi with the actual human when elon just said that it's cheaper to go into robo taxi and it's more luxurious so when it comes to mass transit there's going to be a revolution and that's all going to go to tesla's pockets that's a big reason why this stock is going to $500 per share that's a big reason why i put a million dollar into it and i also have another half a million dollar in it that's why analysts are raising their price targets as well you know they're copying each other it's very obvious you know they're looking at one analyst and they're like oh my goodness i'm i'm dumb for not copying that analyst and as every analyst finally starts to you know reorient their you know price target you know we've see guys going from $150 to $500 per share they're going making big jumps i'll show you an example in just a moment but analysts are making a big jump in their price target and this is actually giving conf confidence to the market and again confidence is where it's at guys the retail investors as they gain confidence they push up the stock but also don't get me wrong there's a lot of smart money in tesla as well we got etfs in tesla obviously they have to be in tesla right s&amp;p 500 obviously has to put a certain amount in tesla we have institutional investors we have a lot of smart money guys in tesla and i'm following this trend very closely because if the smart money is not in there i don't want to be with the dumb money i'm telling you i do not want to be with the you know the retail investors that don't know what they're doing i'm following the trend but i'm also following where the smart money is going so look here's a little bit more research on the bank of america case that i mentioned in the beginning after visiting the gigafactory in austin bank of america said this they said the trip gave us increased confidence that tesla is well positioned to grow in 2025 be and beyond with its core ev business and launch of its robo taxi offering and longer term from its investments and optimus this was all said by lead analyst john murphy and he wrote this in a note to to investors that is a lot of confidence for the market because this guy does have a good reputation murphy reiterated that his buy rating for tesla and he upped his price target to $400 per share from $350 not a huge bump but it is a significant bump from 350 to 400 giving the market some confidence now i've been making money hand over fist guys bicep over tricep and that's because i was a little bit early in this i wasn't super early in tesla but you don't have to be early i'm trying to tell you guys every video i'm making nowadays it's been months we've been printing money like 10 15 20% per month in returns and i'm not even early i'm just following the trend because you can buy an expensive stock and as it goes higher as the momentum goes up you can make a ton of money you can make 15 20% and that's also because where the market's at right now you know if i look at the environment it's a very good environment and it's conducive to high returns that's the most important thing it's not even picking the best stocks per se like tesla's a great stock i picked nvidia early i picked pounds here for you guys but when it comes to the actual market itself i'm just taking a look at uh what's going on and i'm taking a look at the doish fed that's really good as interest rates go down tech companies are more valuable and tech companies are going to go up i'm also taking a look at trump in the white house that's good because republicans they they make a bigger office they print money and all that high inflation does mean that that money goes into the stock market at the end of the day because no matter how much money you print it still goes into the rich people's pockets and the rich people put their money in the stock market it's as simple as that guys it's super simple all right the money is going to go into the stock market stocks are going to go up and we're going to beat inflation in the stock market it's just pretty much the laws of physics the laws of finance okay the laws of money all right now look also elon musk has a really tight relationship with trump they're buddy buddy right now they became really good friends and that is not for no reason i'm telling you these rich people they don't do things for no reason everyone has a motive everyone wants to make money okay so trump he's very focused on the stock market that's actually his metric guys his actual metric is the stock market because when you take a look at a presidency success one big thing that you want to mention is how well you did under that under your term with the stock market okay so trump said that a lot in his campaign now look tesla's market cap it went up $330 billion following donald trump's election in the us right so with media and analysts they speculated that the implications for this kind of partnership it kind of looks like a partnership guys have you noticed that elon musk and donald trump kind of looks like a partnership with these with these guys in the white house and having influence with elon having influence i'm telling you it's going to be big things for tesla it's going to be really big things and that's why i'm i'm confident to put a lot of money into this i'm telling you a million even though i have you know a big siiz portfolio guys it's no joke every decision i make by the way i'm always being transparent about it and if you want to see the live trade by the way if you want to see me do it like live as i make a trade that's actually in my discord community i have monday and wednesday sessions where i show all my students everything live okay so look i want to wrap this up i want to give you a couple more things i want to show you a leap option play as well i'm giving you guys a lot of insights in this video i'm going i'm going quick so make sure that you're you're not missing out make sure you're taking notes because i'm telling you i'm about to put a lot of money in your pocket about to flood your pockets with money i've been doing that but i want to do some more of it right i want to bless you with money because money freedom that's it i don't a fancy lifestyle i don't do anything crazy i just believe in freedom and having time for yourself time freedom okay not having to work i have so many doctors lawyers engineers you guys are high paid professions but you don't have freedom you're going to be working for a long time so if you want to break through from that you got to invest you got to invest properly okay that's what it's all about look to wrap up the trump and the elon musk relationship here what you should be looking out for to make a lot of money is this as their relationship grows tesla's going to get more favorable policies on manufacturing on innovation on economic growth they're going to get more favorable relations on all of those fronts that's going to push tesla's revenue higher or that's going to make tesla become a higher perceived value guys don't forget this the market isn't about how much a stock always makes it's about how it's perceived by investors all about expectations that's why i'm giving you this research is because when you understand what the expectations are you have formulated a proper opinion on the stock and you believe that it's worth more than what people expect that delta that difference okay that's where the money is made so policies focused on reducing energy cost deregulation tax incentives the corporate tax uh reduction this is all going to benefit tesla all of these incentives are going to make more money for tesla as simple as that all right all right so there we go i don't want to spend any more of your time explaining why tesla this video will serve for why i invested over a million 1.5 milli now into tesla now let's talk about a leap option play okay because listen leap options are the hottest thing that you should be doing in this market whether you have a small a medium or a large siiz portfolio i got millionaires that are making a lot of money on leaps i have portfolios that have 100k and they turned 100k into 200k in this market right now in fact it's kind of crazy like i'm getting so many emails i'm getting so many discord students my oneon-one students we're just celebrating right now we're harvesting all these fruits and veggies right now and i tell them the bad times will come we have to make as much money hand over fist right now this is the time there's a lot of urgency because when you can squeeze out a lot of money at the end of the bull market i'm telling you that's how in 2021 i turned 100k into 700k that's how this year i went from like under 3 mil to over 4 mil okay we have made leaps and bounds in terms of results now when the tough times come when we have some potential negative months i'm going to hold on strong and i'm going to try to outperform the market which i've been doing for almost you know seven out of my 10 years my first three years i didn't do so well because you know i wasn't as experienced these past seven years i beat the market very well that's because during the good times i'm reaping all these fruits and veggies and i'm freezing them for the winter all right so you better do the same right now look here's what a leap option is all right i want to cover the leap option and the benefits i'm looking at a leap option at 330 at the 330 strike for tesla i've already mentioned that in another video i'm going to reanalyze right now and i'm going to show you a play that i'm going to do okay so i'm going to go to trade tesla options right you can see on my screen right now and i'm actually going to go ahead and buy a call option for september now look i'm going to analyze the 330 i'm going to tell you why the 330 is good but i'm also going to show you um a little bit of variation right now all right so here's a 330 call option it's actually it's actually like perfectly ripe it's at the 70 delta right that's really good however because tesla continues to go up you know if i were to open up a new position i would actually go for about a 350 right now now the 350 has a little bit lower delta all right it's not actually a huge difference but it kind of is look 350 here is worth 9 grand whereas the 330 here it's worth 10 grand so it's $1,000 cheaper to go for 350 and to be honest this makes more sense because a delta 66 still gives you a lot of upside let me explain real quick a little bit more about leap options leap options are basically kind of like owning stock and also kind of like a call option at the same time right so a leap option is just a call option that goes out a little bit further in dates okay it could be 9 months it could be a year it could be 2 years etc i consider 9 months a leap option i know that's not a textbook definition but that's that's henry definition all right because it's long enough for me right so leaps allow investors to gain significant exposure to the underlying stock with less capital than buying stock outright like why would you buy tesla at $371 per share and put in $37,000 when you can buy and basically own a 100 shares with just $99,000 so you're putting up 13 of the capital i mean that makes a lot of sense to me and the risks are also really low all right let me explain look you can put in 1/3 of the capital so that's already onethird of the risk okay the sensitivity of this option is 66 delta right as you can see the 66 delta means that when the stock goes up 10 bucks this option will go up about $660 all right so that's actually really powerful because if the stock goes up by 10 bucks right 10 bucks on 371 is just like a 3% return so as a stockholder you're making about 3% but as a leap option holder right that 3% is almost 10% right because you're making $7 on $89 that's almost a 10% return so you get a huge return and you get a leverage factor okay leverage is where it's at if you want to make money you need leverage now i don't believe in borrowing money i don't really believe in paying interest interest but with this leap option you get strong leverage if you make good decisions and you leverage them that's where it's at that's how you make a ton of money and you have that long-term perspective i'm not a fan guys of looking at these short-term plays you know one week out two weeks out i'm looking at leap options because if i get in now and i have the right opinion the right perspective this option is going to increase 2x 3x in the next 9 months all right so this strategy is ideal for those who are bullish over the long term and expect the stock to appreciate significantly which you know i wouldn't say $500 is extreme appreciation but if we go from tesla hitting to $500 or even $450 okay that's going to be easy double on your money on the leap option so you can double your wealth in a single year now obviously pay attention to risk management pay attention to position sizing it's it's going to be too long for me to cover in this video i covered this in my oneone coaching and i go over your risk tolerance and i work with you hands-on if you're interested is always the first link in the description right we still have actually eight spots we had 15 we now have eight we're getting a little bit busy but i love what i do all right i love what i do and i feel super blessed when i make other people money you know that for me i just feel blessed doing that when i look at leap options i'm looking at risk management and look your maximum loss is limited to the premium that you pay on the leap that's all you can lose you can't lose more than what you pay so this tesla example you know the 350 that i'm recommending now i recommend the 330 by the way when i recommend the 330 it was like around 5k or so right now it's at 10 i've already du doubled the i've already doubled 330 it's been couple weeks on that that's actually a 2x return now obviously i only put in 5% on that position right on a leap option i didn't actually even put in on a leap option because i have a lot of shares guys you know but i'm recommending leaps to my community so they have 2x on their 5% position i said 5% on the 330 so you know 5% on the 330 you double that's a 5% return just from 5% of your portfolio you've made 5% in your overall portfolio that's crazy right how much money there is right now so i was selling a a lawyer a student of mine then he had a lot of money in leaps right and i was saying like listen he had a lot of leaps on a bunch of like safe stocks i said now is not the time now is the time to have leaps on tesla on nvidia and when we made that shift he went from making like 3 4% a month which is great uh nothing wrong with that i'm all i'm a big fan of 3 to 4% a month returns in in in you know in regular times but we're not in regular times right now now is the time where we got to make 10 15 20% so we we shifted his strategy this was like 3 four weeks ago and it's been phenomenal we've had instead of 3 4% we we've had like literally 15% so it's been a really

2024-12-08,Qy1Uzkk4q0M,"kind: captions language: en guys we have to talk i'm going to show you some stocks that are going to print money for the rest of december i did this video last week and i made over $200,000 over 6% and this week i'm going to do the same thing i'm making plays on sofi i'm making plays on tesla paler nvidia and i'm going to cover all of these stocks as well as some others in this video and i have some big news and updates as well as some plays so look i respect your time let's jump into the first play of how we can make money i'm going to talk about sofi but first my portfolio is at $4.2 million basically and last week when i made this video it was around $4 million we are scaling very fast and this is the best market that i have seen to make money hand over fist bicep over trip i'm loving this market and i'm loving how my students are getting results look i'm going to show you sofi right now because sofi is a very interesting fintech stock and specifically what i see with sofi is this stock is ready to explode the technical analysis on this stock is absolutely insane if i look at the past 3 months this stock has reached over $15 per share as it started around $7 so it has more than doubled now listen momentum is a really important factor and i want to talk about momentum because this stock keeps hitting new highs every single day so should you jump into it well the thing is i have discussed sofi in my video on monday last week and the stock has been doing actually some sideways action i've discussed sofi in my last video last week when i said watch before 9:30 am and this stock is actually trending a little bit sideways so we have had a peak and actually a double top pattern around $16 per share now the stock has retracted just a little bit but to me it's looking like it's going to go back to $16 and beyond due to momentum the three-month chart here is really clear and not just from the technical standpoint also from a fundamental standpoint i'm looking at my notes here i would do a sell put 15 strike price i would do that for january expiration the reason why is you can collect a very juicy premium by selling the 15 put option on sofi and getting a good entry as the stock continues to move up i would actually do two strategies i would sell a $15 put option and i would actually buy a call option as well at the 16 strike for january expiration now i've been an option sol for a very long time but in this market i'm also buying options i'm showing this as fast as i can on youtube but obviously i'm doing everything live in my discord community and on my one-on-one coaching i send out text messages so look the reason why sofi is such a powerful stock is because they're disrupting in industry okay i have quite a lot of research here i'm going to try to move through it as fast as possible while also making it simple to understand look trading is all about momentum it's like dropping a ball from the 30th floor i'm in dubai right now i'm on a high floor if you were to drop an apple right it starts off very slow but as it falls down it accelerates accelerates and really fast okay the same thing is with stocks as they're going up you really want to catch that upside all right as the stock goes up you know like soi over 100% it's really easy to go from 100 to 120 so you can capture that 20% move in a month that's why my portfolio was just like $3 million literally like 2 3 months ago now it's at over $4.2 million i've been printing money and that's because i'm following trends and i'm showing you the stocks that i'm trading personally so sofi i like that they have rapid growth and more important than rapid growth okay rapid growth is cool amazon had rapid growth tesla had rapid growth even more cool is not just rapid growth but profitability this is a big sign for me because like palen here palen here reached profitability finally after scaling and then they were put into the s&amp;p 500 right they have s&amp;p 500 inclusion same thing can happen with sofi sofi has demonstrated all right very impressive growth and looking at my notes here they added 756 th000 new members in q3 2024 alone achieving four consecutive quarters of profitability four consecutive quarters of profitability means that they're going to enter into the index and once they enter into the index just like pound here this stock's going to fly up okay this stock's going to go up a lot it could be a $20 stock a $25 stock easily now i can't predict the future i don't know exactly when that's going to happen but in 2025 i'm telling you this stock is going to perform very well especially for the rest of december so this week you better be looking at making some plays and being smart with the stock because there's there's so much money to be made and right now i' i've said this in a couple of my videos now now is the time to reap all the fruits and vegetables that you have planted and harvested over you know it's summertime right we have planted fruits and veggies we we've taken care of them for months now it's time to reap what we have swn okay guys that now this market is as it's peaking as the high momentum is coming in you want to take all this money and produce as much as possible you need it right now because when we get a pullback which i don't know what's going to happen but when we get a pullback we need to have so much money saved up we need to have loads of cash in our pocket that you know hey if you make 100 grand in the next 3 months you lose 20 uh down the road it's okay because you're going to go back up losing 20 grand out of 100 grand totally okay right because we can't predict when the market is going to come down when when the market shifts you know i can't predict that in a day but once it's shifting for about a week i know i know when it's shifting then i'll switch up my strategy i'll start to hedge stuff like that but i never prepare for a bare market or crash ahead of time so right now what i'm doing my strategy is i'm going to get so rich i'm going to make so much money in in a short amount of time that when the bare market comes i don't really care well when i say 100k i mean for you guys for me i'm going to make a few million i'm going make a few million i might reach eight figures here in the portfolio i don't know it's going to take some time but my next goal is $5 million and probably next 3 to 6 months and i've been very conservative but you know i have to kind of tell myself hey henry it's not time to be conservative it's time to make money hand over fist and get rich because right now i'm i'm going to just get to the facts i i want to i'm just being hyped right now i'm just way too excited i'm way too excited to share this profits with you guys in my opinion here look the impact of s&amp;p 500 inclusion with sofi boom baby it's going to be like fire the stock's going to skyrocket like paler did and this is also going to cause increased liquidity it's going to cause attraction of institutional investors and number three it's going to cause a positive price impact due to index tracking funds automatically purchasing this stock what happens is when a stock enters the s&amp;p 500 boom all the index funds have to buy the stock because they must the definition of an etf of an s&amp;p 500 etf is it's supposed to have the 500 companies that the s&amp;p 500 has right that's the whole goal of an etf it tracks an index right so if the index has sofi for example then the index month's purchase soofi as well right because they have to have the shares and that's what you're investing in so that's going to increase liquidity and institutional investors many of them actually have rules and one of their rules is the stock must be in the s&amp;p 500 right they don't trade a liquid stocks which is what i tell you guys all the time if if you're looking at trading options better be a tight bit ask spread there better be a lot of volume i can show you what that looks like actually let me go here and let me show you a trade soi put option here i just wanted to give you guys the understanding here i'm spending extra time because this is something new that i'm putting out on youtube i'm going to go over my tesla position guys real quick check it out i have tesla 3,000 shares okay i bought at 300 $32 some people said oh you're crazy it's peing no it's not no it's not i'm going to talk about tesla in just a moment but i just want to point out that i already made $169,000 i just posted this week this video last week and i have more tesla shares in my in my robin hood as well so i'm telling you guys i've been at this game for 10 years i worked at goldman sachs i know exactly what i'm doing to make money in a bull market and the bare market i'm not scared of bare markets at all look for sofi what i would do is i would go to january 17th give yourself some time i like 30-day options cuz then you can you know put in a little bit less work and get that passive income this is fairly passive but really high return okay here's what i would do this is going to be something new i'm going explain right now all right you can sell the 15 right here okay sell the 15 this will give you $87 that's heck of a lot of money $87 on ,400 excuse me because when you sell a put option the maximum profit is 8 is 87 in this example and it reduces the capital that you have to put up instead of putting up $1,500 you're basically putting up about $1,400 so this this return is very high we have a very high return in in a month but look the real money is made when you also buy a call option here so let's say that sofi goes up to like $17 which with this momentum it's very possible i would also look at buying a 16 call option i'm going to show you a very interesting strategy right now very interesting nobody talks about this one nobody talks about this one they don't have the experience that i have listen if you sell a 15 put right you get 87 now if you buy a call it's pretty it's it's fairly cheap you only have $61 here right so look your break even right here is going to be about $658 so if this stock sofi goes to $17 per share all right what's going to happen is you're going to make about $42 but you're only putting up$ 661 so if you put up $61 and you make basically you know $42 in profit that's like a 67% return right this doesn't seem like a lot obviously don't do 100 shares i'm just i'm just showing you how high of a return this is you still need safe and proper risk management and also because you're selling a put option this can be a fairly capital intensive strategy but if you did a 100 here i mean you can see how you can make thousands of dollars this is not like a crazy big siiz position but obviously you don't want to make a crazy big siiz position so you want to go ahead and do like say 10 contracts here also what you can do let me just give you a little bit of another perspective what you can do to reduce the cost even more is you have sold a put option you have bought a call option you can also sell another call option don't get confused basically this right here is going to be a very similar position to owning stock you can see how you get upside you also do get downside if the stock ends up falling there's no perfect strategy but you can also sell a call option right here let's say we we think it's going to go to 17 but not that much higher so now if i sell a 17 now these returns are going to look a lot better they're going to look a lot better in our uh we actually get a total credit here which is pretty crazy so essentially you're selling a put option and then you're doing a bull call spread okay a bull call spread i am doing more bull call spreads and leaps in my community right now with my one-on-one students even the lawyers the doctors the the i work with some pilots right now even with these guys that have bigger portfolios you know we got of 300k 500k 800k we're still doing leaps because in this market you can print a lot of money and if you can use a leap option and put up onethird of the capital why not scale your portfolio even if it is a big portfolio 500k 800k right i i'm seeing guys that are producing 50k a month right now on portfolios that are you know 400k 500k we're seeing some big results and that's fantastic a lot of my guys are telling me i got lawyers that are like y i don't want to be a lawyer no more i don't want to work for a contract basis and maybe i win a case maybe i don't they're making more option trading right now the same with doctors they're really busy i get it you guys are super busy i see so many profits coming in with options they're like you know i don't know maybe i should uh do a part-time schedule you know we got some guys in the er room stuff like that um nurses everything engineers i see engineers are like man i don't want to work for uh for meta no more i don't want to work for snow no more this job isn't for me i want to trade options and that's it is possible especially if you have a sixf figureure portfolio you can you can look at retirement in this bull market if you can go from 500k to a million and i was saying in a in a in a recent video how you can scale at 500k if you're at 100k in this market you can scale so fast you can reach retirement in a much shorter time if you play your cards right that's why right now it's such an urgent time i need you to really pay attention and really just capitalize so anyways i spent a lot of time on sofi this is a strategy that i would run right now and i just think that you know sofi based on their their revenue streams as well the company has mul multifaceted business model right they're looking at making money from banking services they're looking at making money from a growing deposit base they're looking at fint infrastructure offerings and they provide multiple avenues for revenue growth which makes me really bullish when i was working out goldman sachs and i was looking at their systems their technology guys it was so outdated i was like this is a multi-billion dollar company these advisers they're managing billions of dollars but they're using like some dinosaur technology right and a lot of banks nowadays they have high expenses they have lots of branches sofa is rethinking things it's like the future it's fintech right i really like fintech because it's finance which makes a lot of money but it's technology as as well so look the strategic partnerships that they have are really strong so they launched the robo advisor platform with the partnership with black rock and this demonstrates to me that sofi has the ability to form strategic alliances that expand its service offerings partnerships are very powerful of done right especially when you look at partnerships on a on a big company level right i don't personally you know so so look make that sofi play and uh let's move on to the second stock which is going to be tesla i'm going to try to go over this a lot faster i showed you my position here on tesla at 169 ,000 in gains i put a million dollar i got $1.2 million i made a video yesterday on my tesla position i'm also going to show you my tesla position in my robinhood portfolio my other portfolio i'm using some more interesting strategies i only cover that in my one-on-one coaching because some of the strategies i do are more more aggressive higher growth and uh you know i i can only put out so much free content here on youtube so look tesla all right i got another 400k so i actually have 1 point over $1.5 million on tesla right now i have two positions on tesla one in my other portfolio one in my in my public portfolio here for the youtube and uh i'm buying this stock hand over fist and i've been 100% right on this stock 100% correct i said this going to be a $500 stock you can watch yesterday's uh video that i posted but i'm going to recap real fast what i did in that video was i recommended buying a 350 leap option on tesla you want leaps i recommended previously at 330 we doubled our money on the 330 now i'm recommending to do 350 the 350 gives you upside on tesla all right that was in yesterday's video so after you watch this video you can check it out i'm going to go quickly here just to recap 350 buy leap option the expiration i post i posted in that video and the reasoning for it was i think tesla's undervalued because robo taxis are not fully priced in in the last video i also showed what elon musk said about robo taxis and the economics of it guys economics is the most important thing humans we do things that make sense for us economically we're all making economic decisions even often times with love okay even often times with our friends we are making economic decisions humans we naturally are trying to see what is a good opportunity what is a good decision for us to make you call it you know whatever you want to call it right i have faith but at the same time humans are going to be humans so when you look at tesla and what elon mus said about economics that fired me up that changed how i thought about tesla i've been bullish on tesla since 2021 i've been bullish on paler since 2021 we're going to go over paler next but for tesla the picture is clear the tech market right now we got fire tesla elon musk buddy buddy like buddy buddy with donald trump this is going to be huge for tesla regulations look trying to make this video quick watch other one if you want tesla 350 buy call now the next stock i want to go into is paler i also made a recent video on paler let me give you the the the summary of paler real fast palen's current pe ratio looks excessive it looks extreme it looks crazy palen pe ratio makes no sense guess what guys pe ratios don't matter on high innovation high quality tech stocks they don't matter okay people that talk about pe ratio on a tech stock i know they don't know what they're talking about i know they don't understand at all because it's not about the pe ratio first of all ps ratio is more important for palen here ps ratio is pretty reasonable all right but i'm looking if palance here is overvalued and i would say no it's not overvalued on a long-term basis okay i'm going to go to my paler position i'm going to show you my position guys it's all about transparency for me right i want to show you everything i'm doing i show you my $1.5 million position on tesla i'm going show you my paler position my nvidia position i show you every single position i'm not one of these guys on youtube like all all my other competitors who show you an xl sheet who make the same videos as me with the same titles the same thumbnails everything i'm showing you guys cuz to me it's important i want you to see that i i'm eating my own cooking guys i eat my own cooking to me it's the most important thing i'm not going to cover a stock i don't personally believe in i'm not going to cover anything for the views i'm going to cover what i personally believe in and pal here is something that i absolutely believe in $775 i've covered this stock since it was $21 .71 there's proof on the screen right there 5,000 shares i'm up $284,000 guys i can't spend the money i'm in dubai and i'm still creating more passive income from my portfolio than i could spend even if i wanted to live a lavish life which i don't i don't need any fancy stuff i'm just telling you this game is a lot easier then you think if you have the right mentor the right tools the right knowledge and you can take action okay i can help you with action if you want my one-onone students i tell them listen you got to do this this is what i believe to be right i can't pull the trigger for them they got to make the trade but i say like this is my opinion opion you've hired me this is what i think you should do we've been making money hand over fist that way so i'm telling you palante here i have high belief in i do have some covered calls i'm rolling up i got a little bit of hot water here with the covered calls i'm down $44,000 i'm just being honest i'm not perfect i did covered calls and i've been telling you know i don't want to call it advice because i'm not a financial adviser i'm just you know lots of experience here and i'm just sharing my knowledge here i've said on this youtube channel right now we don't want to be in covered calls we want to let our shares ride i'm telling all my one-onone soon as i said listen i have have this business owner right now who has a marketing agency and i have a lot of business owners and he has a lot of covered calls i said man you don't want them right now we're in a bull market take it easy just let your shares ride all right so i given him that tip and it's it's made a difference it's made a difference because as our covered calls go to the money you got to roll them not ideal in this market so i'm in a little bit of hot water but i'm not in hot water on a lot of my positions cuz i'm letting them ride even my boring positions on apple i'm i'm going to show you some more stuff look since 21 i've been in palen here and this stock i'm going to continue to stay in it okay it's at $775 i'm up almost $250 something perc paler solutions by the way guys they've been proven they're i would say they're time tested at this point paler is essential to the economy um you know unfortunately paler is fantastic for for wars we got the ukraine and russia you know conflict i'm not too far from that's kind of my roots around that area myself and we got some conflicts there okay we got we got conflicts in the middle east you know we got the whole situation in the middle east won't even get into the politics of that but listen palante here they're going to make a lot of money because listen when there's wars happening modern warfare right now it's shifting to cyber guys the warfare isn't about you know like in the old days where you got guns and knives and stuff like that uh right now it's cyber warfare it's cyber security it's ai driven strategies it's fierce out there and it's all about technology right we're going into the tech we've been in we've been in the tech age right so palante here with the modern warfare they're going to be making a lot of money fortunately or unfortunately however you want to look at that situation i wish we didn't have any wars um but listen you know whatever there people are making money you know we got to follow where the money goes obviously i'd love to not have any wars but paler is making a lot of money and they're going to continue to make money off of that now analysts like dan ies they describe paler and they call it like the messi of ai right dan i is like it's like the messy stock and that's because it kind of is right when you look at defense uh paler is using ai the software everything that i see with paler i made a video recently guys i've been right on the money trust uncle henry i'm here for you i'm going to stay here for you whether you're a student or you're just a subscriber i'm going to keep putting out all the knowledge that i possibly can you know most of it for free on youtube listen next stock i want to cover is going to be nvidia i'm going to go into my nvidia position nvidia has had a move so i want to give you an update on what i see happening with nvidia stock listen the stock i have an average cost at 137 i want to buy more nvidia stock i got some options here as well that are up about $1,000 i got covered calls i would say we still want to go covered calls i would do a simple 150 covered call honestly for march expiration 2025 you can also do the positions that i have right here this is still a good position for 1220 for this month you can do a covered call at 148 you can do a covered call at 146 both of these positions are going to be completely okay and you can collect some income on nvidia and i would say nvidia is a fantastic ai play you can sell puts to enter the stock or you can do covered calls to generate some income on the shares that you already have either way guys selling puts and covered calls is very similar because you're tying up about the same amount of capital to make about the same amount of premium so the only advantage is when you do a covered call you get the dividend but nvidia really has a few pennies of of dividends it's really not that much so it's really not something that is a concern to me i would actually do both this is something that i call the coverage strangle strategy i know i'm hitting you guys with a lot of content here making content e even i'm on vacation i'm traveling but i'm still dedicated it's my mission i sent out an email by the way you can join my free email list i sent out email sometimes with plays or just yesterday i sent out an email just being grateful with some gratitude and thank you guys and telling you how how blessed i am to bless you guys with with money to me i feel like a lot of mission and purpose here to do that helping everyday people but also helping helping even successful people doctors lawyers engineers you guys make a lot of money but you don't have a lot of freedom it's about freedom like i've been traveling you guys see me you see actually i make a different video in a different hotel room all the time because i i travel a lot i i enjoy it i get i meet people for business and anyways listen two more stocks i want to cover here spy i'm bullish for december i'm bullish on on spy so if you're scared of being in single stocks just buy spy and hold spy and dollar cost average spy i used to do boot camps i no longer do boot camps because all the other option youtubers offer boot camps cuz they've been in my boot camp they learned from me and they started doing boot camps and i want to be different uh so that's why i started doing one-on-one coaching everyone offers a boot camp now but my boot camp what i used to teach right when i ran boot camps is uh dollar cost average seems like a simple topic seems like h duh i want to learn something new hold on a second if you actually want to get good listen i'm not worth multiple millions and have retired by giving you know by doing stupid things dollar cost average is literally the smartest thing that you can do including with options okay i may actually have a webinar on that in the future because i feel like it's a deep topic that you know comment down below i can cover dollar cost averaging options it's kind of specific but just dollar cost in general you guys got to do that last is uh like mstr smci i kind of put this in the same category they're

2024-12-13,EKVJnJC9lzw,"kind: captions language: en it's time to scale from 100k to 500k or even a million dollar in this market there's a lot of opportunities and in this video i want to cover three stocks two stocks of which i do not cover at all on this channel but two new stocks that i think are very good opportunities for this bull run if you want to become a millionaire there's more upside in this market i made really good bets and based on my research i'm going to give you some new place i made over 15% in the last month alone and here's a breakdown of what i think is going to happen for the rest of 2025 i'm going to explain why i think this is still an inflection point in the market why i think there's still a lot more room to run and why we're in something called the industrial revolution for ai stocks okay so i was looking at morgan stanley's private wealth director and she was referring to something called the industrial revolution so check out this quick clip and let's talk about it and now i feel like we're potentially at another inflection point i'm not sure what to make of the fact that you have the resurgence in tech what what do you make of it as you say we're in a not to miss industrial revolution that tells me you're focused on tech focus on tech so if you go back to 2023 that market was 10 stocks 2024 we got 40% of the s&amp;p so we got a bit of the broadening 2025 is going to be a broader broadening but the the difference is that uh we should start to see companies that aren't already positioned for the download of ai are going to have to play rapid catchup and that's what i mean by sort of these corporate extinction events that hearken back to the early 2000s it's going to be very hard for companies to catch up and we're already seeing that as an example in some of the companies within the chip sector do you like um sectors and stocks outside of tech cuz i i guess in some respects what i hear you saying is i like tech but i don't have to be all focused in the mega cap i like the down the you know the derivative plays the derivative plays because ai is an equal opportunity installation across all business cycles that's the difference between this moment and 20 0 1 and that's why i think the opportunity is so big because we're installing a technology impr proven business models that already takes current earnings and improves them expands them and reduces costs it's a very different kind of industrial revolution than the uncertainty of the early 2000s around what the internet was going to be in this economy guys as you can see from that clip we are in an inflection point right now i can see the market continuing to go higher whether it's paler whether it's tesla i'm going to cover some stocks in this video like amd i'm also going to cover google and you might think that okay these are not that hot of a stock i want to stick to paler i want to stick to the highflying stocks but these stocks right now are also presenting a really good opportunity because when a stock has pulled back in a very crazy market it does deserve attention it does deserve a lot of attention because it's still part of ai it's still part of the trend guys so look in 2025 i'm telling you ai is going to dominate ai is going to make the most money that you have ever seen in 2025 you want to be in that sector versus other sectors because the momentum is really hot and i've already talked about in a lot of my videos momentum is key so all three of the stocks that i'm going to cover in this video they have a component of ai in them so let's not waste any time we've already seen a clip we've already seen what my thought process is let's go to the first one this is a known stock this is a stock i've been talking about for a long time paler and i'm going to be looking at my notes right here okay i've been watching recently a new interview with alex carp and he was talking about his company and honestly i said this in my last video that paler can be a $75 stock easily or even $85 stock this year we've actually seen a little bit of volatility with pounds here going up to like 82 and then falling down a lot in one day and i'm telling you i mean that's what it's about you can't really avoid the volatility we're just going to have to ride volatility we're going to have to be smart about volatility you can't just look at a stock and say this stock's just going to go off to the moon and nothing else we're not going to see any pullback but along with the pullbacks you should be purchasing you should be dollar cost averaging and as palen here goes up to i think maybe $85 at the end of this year obviously that's a short time frame and you guys know i don't like short time frames but in 2025 we're going to see this this business skyrocket really really bullish and on palance here what i think is going to happen is i'm placing my trust in alex karp the confidence and the truth that alex karp spoke about in his recent interview um it made me realize two things okay watch this quick clip about uh what alex karp said and then we'll talk about it uh we have the best people and have the best products and uh and we built these products that were basically were built years before people thought were irrelevant the most relevant one of now is is how do you manage large language models in ai so that you can actually extract value so that and the value is quantifiable either on the battlefield to bring solders home uh kill our enemies or in commercial to change margins reduce dwell time uh make your reinvent your business and one last point one of the most important things people do not understand about ai is they understand roughly kind of how it could work of course they also have noticed that many ai companies or you know the large language mods alone basically lead to a science project but what the the the purpose of what you can do a with ai is you can do exactly what we did at paler which is build your institution the way it ought to be built a country ought to have a border a military ought to be efficient in both how it spends and how it kills and how it protects a enterprise that's in manufacturing should be able to control the supply chain should be able to control the workforce should be able to manage people who are smart but not technical technical but maybe don't have business document those kind of things can be managed bringing an institution back to what it ought to be is the single purpose of what paler does and we're now able to do it which is why our enterprise our enterprise our enterprise business in the us is just very very sh i mean it's unbelievable total commercial sales in the third quarter rose what 27% to $317 million do you well the most important stat are you trending the same or even better this quarter well obviously i can't talk about well unless you want me walking out of here in shackles i'm already i'm already i'm already pushing the limits alex car said we're pushing the limits of what he can say but did you notice his body language his body language is confident this man's like i'm confident he's going like this he's going like that he's about to jump out of his seat because he's so excited about what's going on with palen here and i think that is the biggest telltale sign okay it's not about what a ceo says because a ceo can be like well i think think i think the company can do well but if the ceo is like we're going to the moon i'm confident that's that's exactly what i read from alex karp his body language really showed me that he's not just saying things he's actually meaning what he says so i'm confident in him as a ceo and he said that he's building institutions okay he says ai directly is impacting a large enterprises efficiency all right check it out let me tell you what what this means when you are affecting a large institutional's efficiency meaning that ai from paler is reducing cost that is a direct bonus to that company they are directly profiting from more efficiencies through data this is why ai is so important because ai gives you the ability to analyze data to basically create data to make business decisions and every single company needs to make business decisions even i myself as a coach during my one-on-one calls i'm asking students where's your wins where's your losses what have you followed that i've done have you made trades that are outside of what i have told you from my discord and if i see okay my discord is making them trades them making their own trades not working that's like a simple example of data that i use to understand how to improve my coaching this is data that every company needs every person even needs data even you yourself have health data how old did you sleep what is your body weight what are you eating how many calories data is exactly what drives performance without data there's literally no point that's why i have a degree finance economics business analytics business analytics is very similar to data analytics okay it's the same same thing just called something else right so listen when it comes to pounder i'm really bullsh in 2025 i'm giving you the full rundown explanation here so you understand why i'm in my place because it's not that hard to just look up my channel and say hey henry's made this play henry has this leap this covered call uh this sellp put i mean it's not that hard right you can you can just look at those plays but why you want to understand why i'm holding them is because when you get a pullback in a stock you want to understand is this an inflection point uh is this a change of momentum should i jump ship okay if you understand and listen to this video then you will know exactly what to do you'll say hey paler is down a little bit i'm not worried right i did have some people panic about paler and get a little bit upset but the thing is we're up so much money on it that we can afford to have a little bit of a pullback hold and then wait for the rest of the pullback right it's i mean we don't go up in straight line we go up basically by steps step step step we take a little bit of an elevator down and back to taking steps up that's how the stock market works and that's because that volatility is something that you have to bear you have to bear through volatility you have to go through some hard times if you want to see the good time i don't know anything in life where you just get good times and i mean there's no bad times even like myself i have millions and millions of millions of dollars and i still have lots of things that i am overcoming i'm struggling and i'm always looking to improve if i'm not looking to improve you shouldn't you shouldn't even be watching my videos because someone that's not looking to improve and thinks they're already perfect that's not a person to follow because this market's always changing and life's always changing okay look when it comes to paler and ai unfortunately i got to say this but i don't like wars but paler is revolutionizing the ukraine war and the israel war okay so they're playing a key component and wars are now done through you know cyber warfare a lot of it is cyber warfare so you know unfortunately uh i don't think war is going to be like really stopping and that's going to be a benefit to paler i don't want war i want peace but you know when you look at what paler is doing in the role that they're playing when it comes to defense that's not going anywhere guys we need more cyber defense people are not fighting wars like you know maybe i don't know what's going on with china and taiwan right i'm not into politics but you see countries neighbors that have like issues and stuff you know pakistan india whatever right all all these countries that may have some issues with each other they're they're not preparing with physical like armies on each other's borders although they are doing that as well to it depends on the country they're fighting with cyber warfare or they're just prepared they're prepared technologically so um that's going to be that's essential and paler has grown their uh you know commercial business they're in their government business tremendously um and it's going to continue and analysts are have been wrong about paler for years i think since i covered pound here from ipo this stock has been one of the best investments and i always say i'm going to show my portfolio so let me show you this wouldn't be an invest with henry video i didn't show you proof in my portfolio i'm doing pretty good actually so even though we had a little bit of like some choppy market i'm at 4.2 million or thereabouts i do have to take out money for taxes very very soon so you guys will probably see my portfolio drop a little bit i got to pay my end of year taxes um and i'm also thinking about doing a end of year a little tax webinar potentially we'll see if i have enough time for that so i'm going to look up pltr i'm going to show you my position right now and what i'm going to be doing excuse me if i'm taking a long time i got three stocks you know i want to make sure that i'm telling you guys the full story so look paler is at $72 and we did have that little bit of volatility i know that paler went up to you know 80 and i i know people are like hey that's it that's it i'm going $100 here but look you know like i said there's going to be some pullbacks shows who's a good investor and who's a bad investor uh when there's a pullback do you panic because i don't at all i'm just holding the stock i have it at $21 you think i really care when this stock basically pulls back just a little bit i don't care you know it's fine that is what it is that's the stock market for you it kind of cracks me up if you think there's not going to be volatility we're going to see volatility and we're going to capitalize on volatility let me tell you when i was working on wall street and i asked one of the traders you know it's a volatile market that day things are going up and down you know is this okay right it it was hilarious because that's like me asking an airplane pilot i work with many airplane pilots actually we have doctors lawers engineers i have a lot of pilots lately my one-on-one coaching that would be the equivalent of me asking hey you know on on a plane hey we got some turbulence is it okay the pilot's going to be like of course it's okay i mean we're in the air right now we're going a little bit up and down because we got some some wind it's okay right he was going to look at me like i mean it's going to be a joke right so same thing when it comes to volatility in the market i mean that's just part of the game and i have my average cost at 2171 you think you think it's a big deal no it's not it's not i'm going to be continuing to hold into q1 and uh we'll see what happens in q2 of 2025 guys it's really important stay subscribed to this channel because i'm i'm looking at any inflection points i'm looking at momentum i'm looking at trend changes right now everything's clear the coast is clear don't worry about any pullbacks co coast is clear right now i'm giving you the green flag that there's a lot more money to be made but at some point when the market pulls back i may change the strategy but i'm not going to talk about it right now what would be the point too early right now there's we're going to be good for a while look i have 12,000 or 13,000 basically made on the options themselves i'm selling puts guys sell puts on paler go for a 65 sell put i would sell a 65 sell putut probably for january expiration or february expiration or march listen it's not that important whether you go for january february march because you get paid in proportion to the time when you sell options it's not really that rocket science people will say say hey this strike sorry not this strike strikes are important let me just talk about expiration dates in this video so we keep it efficient expiration days are not that important people say oh this expiration day is the best or zero dte is the best or weekly is the best or monthly is the best look for me monthly is the best but you can also go two months out you can also go three months out that's fine because you get that passive income and with with passive income you you collect about the same in a two-month period versus a 3-month period so it's really not that big of a deal and when i look at pal here when i see what they're doing with their government efficiency uh how they're revolutionizing the market we're going to do just a okay guys for q1 at least also guys i want to say one thing like i'm i'm really passionate about alex carp because alex karp he's transparent this man's transparent right that's who i respect that's who i look up to to be honest alex carp went to my high school i learned about him when he launched his i like right a little bit before ipo i learned that he was in my high school so i is kind of like gravitating towards him because you know obviously i have some similarities there and i just want to say that people they have doubt nowadays in this economy in this world that we have now there's a lot of fake people and even things like university it feels like a scam you pay so much money for a university what did they teach you you're not even guaranteed a job okay when you look at government right now there's a lot of people questioning you know republicans democrats both ways people are questioning government in general regardless of who's in the presidency right and when it comes to alex karp this man's transparent he says it how it is he tells i i believe he tells the truth this man has a lot of money in paler himself and he's growing a business okay it's not a perfect business but he's growing a business and he's transparent about it which is what i respect this is why i am invested in in the stock because you know look what actually politicians are doing i'm paying a lot of taxes guys i don't fully know where my taxes are going i paid a million dollars in taxes all right a million dollars i'm going to pay in 2024 i pay my estimates right that's a lot of tax and i don't fully understand where it's going it's going to worse or what you know and i want to be sure that when i invest in a company that company is transparent the on the leadership is authentic and for me that's the most important thing i don't care how much a company makes if they're doing you know shady stuff because i don't want to be invested in a company that's you know potentially going to crash or do do bad things right so i'm in a company that has the american values that is actually helping all right it's not perfect but it's helping all right so that's palent here for you the next stock i want to talk about is amd all right amd so this stock right here i haven't ever covered on on this channel before okay but i want to really go over it because when i looked at amd and i did some research right obviously i got a lot of nvidia you know chip buyers want to see more competition guys chip buyers they want to see competition and amongst the ai chips amd they intend to continue to compete in the market for ai chips all right so i'm going to pull up amd right now on the chart i'm going to show you this really important chart right here so as i was looking at it and actually let me refresh this because um i was going to make this video yesterday and i got a little bit busy here in dubai with some business meetings look a amd it is in a very interesting position if i go to the one-year chart just check it out guys we're we're at the bottom we're at the bottom bottom we're at the like the sea bottom okay look in the last one year this stock has been as high as over $200 per share now take a look we're hitting below support below support we had a bottom here at around 130 we had a bottom here at around 133 we had another bottom here at 135 now we have reached a new level of bottom this okay we're at 12774 listen you guys are looking all the big stocks that are up a lot i like them too i like sofi i like nvidia but listen you also need some value stocks in your portfolio okay because when the market pulls back we don't know when that's going to be or just in general when you see some volatility you want a good growth play that is trading for a value which is why i'm going to cover amd and google as my other two stocks these stocks you have have to pay attention to if you want to become a millionaire uh and you have 100k 200k and you want to scale you need to scale with grow stocks and some value stocks that are disguised as gross stocks that's why i'm showing you this stuff guys i'm still showing you a grow stock but i'm showing you a growth stock disguised as a value stock everyone thinks it's a value stock but no it's not a value stock i'm going to explain to you why i'm going look at the management and all the stuff that i was talking about with pal here and alex carp i'm going tell you the same exact thought process here with amd check it out it's at 127 the chart is pretty pretty freaking obvious and i'm not as bullish as i am on nv video obviously i like nvidia more um but i do think that there's a short-term opportunity with amd for at least in the next 90 days what i want to do is i want to jump into this stock because it's at a 52 we low and it's it's at support it can't it really can't go that much lower okay so i'm going to be selling i'm going to show you an example let me show you an example what i'm going to be doing i'm going to pull up amd right now i'm going to show you several option positions for you to take a look into so because amd right now it's under $130 per share anything under 130 fantastic you can literally go look at 130 and anything below close your eyes throw a dart you're good okay but i'm going to show you the exact play that i'm going to do so right now in my discord community i'm basically trading for january expiration and i'm going to go ahead and do something like the 125 okay so this is probably a trade that i'm going to make today it's like early in the morning right now before the market opened up as soon as the market opens up and i have my uh my session my group session i'm going to be uh selling the 125 right here so i'm going to sell the 125 uh put option for an entry into amd and essentially i'm going to be collecting $480 worth of uh premium so with $480 collected in premium you know that's that's roughly like a 4% return in 37 days now look in this market i'm making 10 15% but like i said you know we can only be so much in the growth we need a little bit of value as well and if my value portion of my portfolio makes 4% a month you know what i'll take it i'll take it guys i'll take the 4% a month amd zer center revenues by the way they soared by 122% year-over-year to 3.5 billion dollars in the third quarter and the company sees more growth ahead and i and i believe it i see more growth ahead as well because ai isn't going anywhere chips aren't going anywhere look just just look at the amd co lisa su all right here here's a quick three things right here's a quick three things about her that i need to point out because i study ceos i study leadership when i'm investing in a company because a company is just this leadership right it's not you know even on my youtube channel it's all about me how much can i improve have i you know gone to the gym have i done my research have i improved myself i get coaching myself i spent a million dollars on personal coaching myself not on financial coaching i'm good there i spend coaching on my mindset i spend coaching on my business i spend coaching on my health and i'm investing in myself that's really really important because everything that i invest there in myself i bring to you here that's why i have the best plays up on youtube that's why i have the best returns on youtube that's why i have number one option channel and that's why i'm here to help you because i enjoy what i do and this is my mission and look when i look at leadership just like i look at humans it's the most basic thing you can do if you can judge a person well if you have good intuition you're going to make a lot of money okay i have good intuition and when it comes comes to lisa sue i think that she is doing the right things this woman cares all right and you know unlike alex karp she didn't go to my high school but that's okay i did my research and when i looked at lisa woo and when i looked at lisa sue she became ceo in 2014 it's been 10 years she has been leading uh amd i get it amd has not had the best performance but there is something important about continuity okay continuity of a ceo is really important when you see ceos bouncing back and forth like we saw with star with chipot for chipotle it was a win for starbucks not so much starbucks stock went down after the ceo left right when i look at lisa sue she's been loyal to the company she has a lot of beliefs and amd was struggling financially and losing market share to competitors like intel and nvidia but her strategy right now it's focused on innovation it's focused on efficiency and she's identifying markets where amd could excel okay she's doing what she can right the fierce competition from nvidia of course but under her leadership and de expanding into graphic technology they're competing effectively with nvidia to their best ability right they're not destroying nvidia but they're maintaining their market share and they're also in other areas like data centers and gaming okay i'm bullish on data centers and gaming so in general i think amd is a really good player right now and uh lisa su led amd into diversified segments including partnerships with major companies like microsoft guys that's not that's not a joke when you partner with microsoft you don't have to be a genius right you're going to be printing money you're going to be flooding your pockets with cash right and uh for me partnering with microsoft and sony by the way they partner with sony for gaming consoles and they're expanding amd's footprint into ai and machine learning this is all stuff that uh i'm very very interested in you know when i was studying in college data analytics when i graduated this was what this was uh like eight years ago or so yeah about 8 years ago now i i could see the writing on the wall that ai and data analytics would would take over right i wanted to actually be a data scientist i really like numbers which is why i like option trading i like numbers i like data i love that stuff so you know that's really helped me pick the best stocks that's helped me become a better investor so just understanding data analytics for me has been a gamechanger i would say that um when it comes to amd i'm just going to wrap it up i think you can either sell puts at 125 or just honestly here straight up just jump into the stock just buy 100 shares and sell a covered call um you know i'm not going to recommend any leap options although i did recommend some leap options on target in my community i'm so upset at myself because i told everyone to buy leap call options on target and i didn't do it myself i didn't do it myself but i did recommend it to my students so we've had tremendous results on something as simple as just like as target right so when this stock pulled back all right this was right right around here i said oh this is a big pullback buy calls okay so now it's back up to 135 buying calls was was a money printer right so i myself have it at 121 and i'm up you know 11% but this is 11% which i said you know just a couple of weeks ago or when was this this is actually no this is november 20 yeah it's a couple couple of weeks ago so this has been a beautiful trade i love it and look that just shows you you don't have to be into the hottest hottest names you can trade simple names i'm up a lot on walmart i i think i doubled my money on walmart as well so look amd sell 125 puts also just jump into the stock and sell 13 covered calls for january expiration or on amd you can you can buy leaps you let me show you what a leap would look like i'm not sure i am super keen on a big fast recovery when it comes to amd so be cautious let me explain to you which leap i would use you know i don't think we're going to see it go back up to like 160 but we could see it go back up to like 140 that would not be unreasonable all right so you can buy you can buy a leap option um for september and you can say hey you know i think we're going to get a bit of a recovery back up to up to 140 but check it out here's here's where you have to understand premiums okay premiums are really important cuz look even if you buy the 130 uh call option right here look you're not going to profit if it goes to 140 look at the break even it's at 15095 so you're not even going to see you're not even going to see the profit on your hands um by going to the 130 call option it's it's not going to even work out because the premium here is $21 because the option market ex expects the stock to have some big moves i mean just look at the implied volatility it's it's pretty high actually for a long-term leap option at 45% i mean you kidding me that that's a lot of volatility that's a lot of implied volatility here the volume here you know it's it's all right it's good you can definitely trade this but i i won't personally recommend it because even if we go to 140 um you won't be profitable here but i will show you a different uh strategy this won't be like this is a leap buying a leap you can just simply say hey i think it's going to go to 140 and now you will see a really good profit if you do a call debit spread so uh the call debit spread right here i'll buy the 30 and the 140 you're making a longterm bed here and by the way you don't have to go this long term i'm going to show you a different play as well i'll show you the difference but the total cost here would be about $430 and the total gain is about 10 so you can you can essentially turn 400 into a th000 or 2.5 extra money in less than a year i mean listen you're talking about scaling fast i told you scaling to to 500k to a mil you have 100k portfolio and you're doing all the other stuff i talk about but you mix in 5% of your portfolio into leaps another 5% into you know potentially like uh like debit spreads and call options and buying strategies i said that's that has a place for sure um listen you're going to do pretty good i'm telling you my portfolio it's it's up over 15% in a month so and i'm not even doing these type of strategies myself because i'm so busy coaching um i enjoy i actually don't really enjoy trading to be completely honest with you i enjoy coaching more i like human human interaction action i like um helping others i mean i i enjoy trading to the extent of the results but let me not ramble on here this is 2.5x return so you can two and a half extra money i mean sh it's a no-brainer but look you don't even have to go out to september you can also do this for a shorter term recovery so let's say that i'm going to go for may which is like five yeah five months out so i'm going to just go ahead and buy a call option at 130 okay again same same thing same thought process and then sell at 140 now here it's a shorter amount of time still worth about the same it's about $400 so it's kind of like a preference you can say that you can go for september you can go for may it's about the same return but obviously amd going out to september it it has a a likelier chance to recover or go to 140 so again it's kind of crazy because this trade is i'm not really i'm just saying amd can go up $10 to12 which is just a 10% return but you end up more than doubling your money on a 10% return that's a 20x leverage factor so it's no joke when when you take a look at a trade like this now let's go into the third trade that i wanted to cover so this is going to be on uh google all right so google is one of my favorite stocks of all and i'm bullish on big tech in general because you know you look at s&amp;p 500 guys we can hit 7,000 on the s&amp;p 500 in 2025 we can we can absolutely hit 7,000 on s&amp;p 500 we can reach that pretty easily and that's because of all the good momentum and guess what that's definitely going to go into google and i'm very positive on big tech and i have a lot of money in google a lot a lot i don't even post all my trades here on youtube because i have a second portfolio i save that for my one-on-one students right you know they obviously i get compensated i have a team i have to compensate that fames to feed so i am a coach and i do save some of my trades and you know one of my big big big big huge trads is

2024-12-14,p3gMXWKtP-M,"kind: captions language: en tesla stock is up over 70% and at an all-time high since november election and a lot of my students are asking me if this stock is still okay to buy and my answer is yes my price target for tesla is $500 per share in mid 20202 and i'm going to explain to you in this video using research and very important new information that i have just gotten on why my price target is 500 and i am going to move up my price target to $525 and why i put a million dollars into tesla you can actually see my position right here i'm about $29,000 i have a th000 shares in this portfolio and in this portfolio my other portfol have 3,000 shares and i am up $281,000 in just a very short amount of time so i have some really important information i'm going to keep this video short as possible let's start by talking about my future revenue expectations and why tesla is going to exceed them let's watch a really quick clip on some context from dan flax an analyst coming a trillionaire at some point dan flax newberger burman senior research analyst is with us this morning dan does the does the move in your mind make sense and if so how do you explain it good morning andrew i think the market clearly there's an impact from uh elon musk's close relationship and growing relationship with donald trump i think what the market will focus on though over the next year is really their ability to drive better unit sales uh in in the core auto business uh bring out a lower priced car if you can bring out a lower p priced automobile that helps to drive demand uh in in that p in that segment of the market and so we we'll have to see how this evolves ultimately i think what will matter most to the stock is is uh growth of units uh i think trump uh excuse me musk will play uh an important role but it's going to come down to the performance of the business more than anything else in my view you know we were talking just earlier this week about the fact that gm is effectively shuttered i mean the cruise project is just not what it was supposed to be and so now you have tesla and you have weo does that i mean do you say that they're the winners of this whole game and everybody else falls to the wayside i think it's a much bigger story than that i think what you have here is really this this transformation of the automobile industry uh new business models i i think uh weo having taken rides in whos i i think it's a very compelling experience i think uber has a very important role here uh to play their their network uh lining up supply and demand i think remains valuable i think you'll see partnerships between them and other players i think tesla with their capabilities around full self-driving those will get better and better ultimately though it's about uh creating value for customers it's about uh creating new profit pools gm will obviously uh uh continue to to focus on its core business they they have an important role to play in in the business but but when i look out i see opportunities for several players we've listened to that short clip my future expectations for tes is that each and every single quarter we're going to get $30 billion of revenue and in 2025 we're going to easily exceed $100 billion now look the reason why i put a million dollars into tesla it is very clear to me that we're going to go to $500 per share and that's going to happen in a very short amount of time we have very high momentum and i telling you that this is a stock that you don't want to miss and i do have two option place i'm going to give you my quick analysis though i believe that the profit margin on tesla is going to increase not just the revenue which is going to grow in 2025 to over you know 100 billion but also the profit itself and i'm going to explain something called the profit pool very shortly to you now dan flax let me explain what he said he basically says that tesla still has to perform on unit growth in the main side of the business right which is their car business selling cars all right and that is true tesla still has to create value for their shareholders and they're going to do so with full self-driving technology and based on my research by 2025 its plausible tesla will have significantly advanced fsd reliability and regulatory approvals offering true autonomy and that's going to happen in many regions now even if they don't have 100% execution this is exactly why dan fla said they still have to have a good strong core units business which is just tesla's vehicle sales now i think those vehicle sales are going to do very well because you will notice that elon musk continues to innovate and continues to to drop the price of tesla for every single vehicle he sells now this is genius because when you sell more vehicles you can also tap into other things within those vehicles to create profit pools let me explain to you two quick examples of what a profit pool is this is something i learned in my degree actually this is the most interesting thing hands down i learned in my education my formal education two examples the first one is printer manufacturers like hp and canon they sell printers for a very cheap price but where they actually get you and where they actually make most of their profit is the ink the ink cartridges cost a lot of money and that's why they sell almost for a loss or break even on the actual printer itself the second example is mcdonald's they have the ice cream machines right but those machines break very very often on purpose same thing with apple actually some of the apple iphones the the batteries don't work that well after like two years because they want you to get another iphone right so ice cream machines break so you can fix them and you make more money now tesla has something very similar and these are the two things that i'm personally bullish on first one is a supercharge uh network tesla profits from its supercharger network which charges you know basically tesla's vehicles all over you know the world and those generate a lot of recurring revenue for tesla which is actually a huge profit pool for tesla itself and creates that recurring revenue a really strong even second profit pool is their high margins of software so tesla earns additional revenue through software subscriptions and upgrades such as you know full self-driving that's going to be so freaking huge i'm super super pumped up guys i'm buying this stock hand over fist bicep over tricep you already know we're trying to make all kinds of money and we're scaling this portfolio very fast and we're going to scale very quick in 2025 so i'm telling you last thing that i want to say or last three things i want to say i'm going to give you one more thing then i'm going to give you two plays okay first of all let me give you the plays real quick if you don't have time you're in a rush right i'm i'm making this video fast the 330 leap call option that i recommended for september i would say you can still hold that right now because every single day tesla is going up like this is a $427 stock right now in the past one week alone it's up 15% and in the past 1 month we're up 33% i'm up 96% in this portfolio and this port i'm actually not sure what the return i'm up on but i bought the stock at $332 and now we're almost up a4100 that's in a short amount of time i do think that we're still going to have more room to run and that's essentially why i still recommend that right now you hold tesla stock do not take profit yet i'm going to be running on tesla i'm not taking profit too early that's that's some weak stuff if you take profit too early i mean you can listen if you have bills to pay you want to take the money out go for it but i'm holding 330 leap option that i recommended on youtube and i'm holding the 350 leap option so congratulations i'm super excited and that's why we keep growing our positions here guys and we keep reinvesting back into the portfolio and one really important thing that i see happening with tesla is their data first advantage right they have more data than all the competitors so this company is going to continue to grow and and even dan fla said that there's actually opportunities across the the whole automotive market things are changing really fast tesla is going to benefit off of that now look in this portfolio i have tesla at $218 per share makes up 10% of my portfolio and the other portfolio makes up a a much larger chunk of my personal worth in that other portfolio so i have a big bet on tesla i say exactly what it is i'm sharing you exactly what i think i have the 300 cellp put i have the 220 cellp put these two things are pretty much useless and then the 420 call i made a mistake a little bit because you should be uncovered right now you should just be riding the profits continue to hold this 420 honestly i might even have to close this out right now i'm going to show you what a roll looks like real quick because you know i don't i do not want to lose tesla absolutely not i do have about you know five six more days until these options expire but you know this was a mistake i should just take a loss right now you can see here how the bid is $685 $17 on the ask volume is absolutely insane um so you know i could either close out this position fully or i can also roll this position out further now part of the reason why i did this covered call position was because i do have 3,000 shares and 1,000 shares so i'm like you know what i'll sell a covered call but that's dumb i don't even listen to my own advice so all right so let's go ahead and i'm going to close this out i have 10 contracts here so i'm going to put 10 contracts and this is this is i'm going to pay for my own mistake i'm telling you guys on youtube what i'm doing and i didn't even follow i did a covered call that was dumb of me so let me go ahead and close this for a $177,000 debit and i'm going to submit this right here and then boom i close this trade out because i do not want to lose my shares so let your shares ride guys going into 2025 i'm going to have a webinar pretty soon so make sure that you stay up to date because i'm going to make you a lot richer i don't know the exact date yet i'll give you some updates for now make sure that you're subscribed make sure that you have the bell notification on and every single video i put out i'm telling you it's going to make you some money so let's keep making money let's stay strong let's invest safe and i'll catch you guys

2024-12-15,gMSr_XFQrwU,kind: captions language: en i'll make this a short but super important video if you want to make money this week i'm going to give you some research on some of the top stocks that i have right now where you can make a lot of money okay no master classes you don't have to smash nothing no free webinars nothing i'm just going to get to the point i respect your time so let's jump right into it the first stock i'm going to cover is sofi stock now guys last week i said that sofi stock is a buy for a call option at $16 the stock went up 4% i'm telling you do not miss out on this stock this stock has some really clear and good momentum in addition to buying the 16 call i also recommended to sell a $15 put that's because if we get a pullback which is unlikely you can acquire shares at $15 now my portfolio right now is over $4 million and we're going to be scaling very fast this is the best market that i have seen and hands down you can capitalize on and make over 10% per month in this market guys this opportunity is not always available so i'm telling you listen and take notes on these stocks in soi what i want to say is if you hold this stock it's a millionaire maker let me explain why simply said the market cap is 17 billion dollars okay if you look at something like pounds here you look at something like nvidia they have a much higher market cap and what that means is it's much harder for a high market cap stock to rise by a lot however if you look at sofi it's not unreasonable for this stock to double in value okay take a look at nvidia we're at $3 trillion do you really think that nvidia can double as easily as so sofi the answer is no sofi stock can double and that's why i think it's a really interesting case study and it's an interesting hold to have in your portfolio right now but be smart you do not want to have too much money in one stock that would be stupid what you want to do instead is you want to have proper risk management in place and have about five or at most 10% of your money in sofi stock the market cap is rallying due to the combination of a doish federal reserve guys we have the perfect opportunity right now because you have a doish federal reserve as interest rates go down i've said this in my prior videos this makes tech stocks more favorable in the market because interest rates going down makes the company more valuable okay where else are you going to put put your money nowhere you have to put in the stock market option market something like that right but the option market is very similar to the stock market it's the same thing so listen when it comes to money on the sidelines and a a doish federal reserve all the stock market is going to go up all the stocks okay but specifically tech stocks that's why you see folks like dan i say fire we are in a fire market when it comes to tech stocks especially the mega cap stocks like nvidia tesla some of the other stocks i'm going to cover in this video with a couple of new ones by the way so it's going to be really important i'm going to keep running through these and i'm not going to uh take too much of your time all right let me finish off with sofi and then we're going to jump into the next stock pounds here i'm going try to make this video really short look for sofi you can position yourself and capitalize because it's all about disruption guys sofi is disrupting traditional banking if you take a look at traditional banks they're using absolutely really old systems even when i was working at goldman sachs guys the best bank one of the most prestigious banks to work for i was shocked when i was taking a look at the technology that they were using it literally looks like windows 95 okay sofi is changing that not only are they a fintech company which is a really awesome trend to invest in guys it's all about top down i'll explain to you what top down means in just a second when i get into palance here but sofi is a top down play okay from the top if you take a look at the digital first trend of banks starting to have you know less storefronts lower expenses and more fintech more technology within that finance role you're going to see something like a sofi really go up in value because investors realize that um there's a lot of disruption going on so that's the most um most attractive trend and fintech on bullish in general and soofi is the number one player that i have there so be smart with sofi have 5% of your money you know obviously i'm not a financial advisor but i made millions of dollars in the market so you should listen up to that now look also following momentum is paler paler i'm going to talk about this as a sector play first and i'm going to give you the breakdown between what a top- down approach is and what a bottom up approach is guys i studied finance i worked on wall street a top down approach is looking at an industry trend like ai a bottomup approach is taking a look at a specific company's price to earnings ratio now paler isn't the most attractive price earnings ratio in fact a lot of people would say it's a very expensive price earnings ratio but a lot of people that just look at price earnings ratio have no idea how to invest let me tell you what's important with pal here and what you should look out for this week specifically because you know last week had some people sell off pound here which was a stupid thing to do because it went to 82 and then it fell down to 72 and a lot of people like uh you know i'm not sure am i'm going to hold hold or not hold listen if you don't have diamond hands in this market you're not meant to make money you're not meant to make money if you can't control your own mental attitude with investing you have to hold high quality companies look when the trend changes listen i'm not an idiot i'm not could just have all my money in the stock market and ignore that there could be a bare market ignore that there could be a correction that's absolutely possible guys but listen i prepare to make money in good times hand over fist bicep over tricep you guys already know how i say it but when the tough times come it's okay we will shift we're not going to catch a day one if someone can say they can predict the market and catch a day one they're lying to you absolutely lying to you that's not going to be the case with me you know it might take me a couple days 3 four 5 days who knows maybe i'll lose 5 10% i don't care here though because if i can outperform the market and i can make 10 15% per month every single month which you guys have seen we've taken the 3 mil to four over four we've been scaling i have students right now that are doctors lawyers they don't no longer want to work because they're making a lot of money i say guys settle down i know we're making a lot of money right now but let's get you to you know let's scale you up from six to seven figures and you know don't don't retire too early why not let's just keep building up this wealth but i have a lot of folks that made so much money it's it's crazy this market is the biggest opportunity that i've seen in a very long time and when i look at palante here i'm looking at it from a top down approach because ai in general is a really strong trend bottom up as i said you know it's it's not it doesn't look as strong but i just wanted to give you that education because i always try to teach you something new in my videos which is why you should be subscribed to this channel i try to teach you something new i do all that for free my free stuff is better than people's paid stuff literally i give everything away or as much as possible for free right so look when it comes to palance here the reason i've been bullish is because they're solving a really crucial problem guys the crucial problem is they are solving government inefficiency they're supporting the us government and they're investing in an ai so those those reasons are going to be the biggest catalyst for paler continued success and trust me the government has a lot of inefficiencies i pay a bunch of taxes you guys already know we have a huge government republicans are going to come on board right now and you know democrats republicans either way the government's spending just keeps growing that debt keeps increasing but at the same time you can think about iter america prints more dollars and everyone else has to uh it benefits us in many ways like the other currencies are pegged to the us dollar so other countries they have to just put up with america printing more money which makes americans lives better abroad if uh if you look at it from that play but it also helps america purchase foreign goods and uh stuff like that so america is not stupid for printing a lot of money but still it is not so good for inflation which is why you should be investing which is why you should be making as much money as possible and it's week by week guys you know i take a look i'd like to do monthly options but week by week i've been updating you guys you guys really enjoyed it so thank you for your feedback i'm really happy that i've been making money for you guys that's what it's all about now look talenter specifically listen something is simple you don't even have to look at the valuation you don't even have to look at what they're doing although those things are important just look at the body language of alex car have you guys seen it the body language is like he's he's all pumped up he's pumped up guys and you know what that means that means if the ceo himself is pumped up if he's excited if he's optimistic that's why i'm in pound at the end of the day you have to trust leadership guys pay attention to leadership so i'm telling you this week i think pal is going to go back up to $80 per share now you know i don't want to be this genie in the bottle i don't know if this week will be 80 but as we finish off the year into the q1 it's going to be 80 85 maybe 90 so i'm going to see a really good upward momentum on palen here and good leadership like alex carp it's not easy to come by there's not that many good leaders guys so when you see a good leader like an elon which is the next stock we'll talk about you guys know how much money i put in in tesla i've been spot on and i think that in this market i'm going to continue being spot on because you don't even have to be a genius you can honestly make so much money in this market by just understanding the trend being in the high quality companies and um playing your cards right just doing research guys i only i don't even i only do a few hours of research per day that's it and i already do that research for you guys i do that for my discord community i do it for my one-on-one students that's why you know we as a community are super successful um i'm bringing my 10 years of experience here on youtube you know we're we're really challenging what we can make per month and we're beating the market like absolutely destroying the s&amp;p 500 and my portfolio right now it's honestly like half options and half just stock right now because i see a lot of opportunities i don't need to do covered calls i'm i'm just buying options more often right now switching my strategy a little bit and i'm owning high quality stocks uncovered not doing covered calls and you know you look at folks the analyst right now um there's a lot of good analysis on paler as well as tesla like dan ies keeps calling paler the messy of ai okay and i think that he's right you know if you look at paler it's a fantastic defense sector play tech play ai play like what does this company not have same thing with tesla you know let's move on here and let's talk about tesla but my play for pal here is just hold just hold don't do anything else all right now when it comes to tesla i i'm telling you guys this is the next stock i'm going to cover right now it's really simple we're going to see $500 sooner than you think i said 350 by the leap congratulations if you followed my play enjoy the money guys enjoy the games have a good time enjoy it with your family and happy holidays because i'm telling you tesla all i want to say is congratulations and i'm going to keep updating you on this my really short summary here is that we're going to continue to get momentum i'm prepared for a pullback however i think that's very unlikely i actually see the opposite happening right now where we can see a short squeeze happen because short sellers are covering you see that every every freaking week another shorts arear is like i covered my position because they can't handle it as tesla goes up the short sellers are getting squeezed out of the trade what do you think a short is okay i'm not going to spend too much time on a short but a short is basically when you're betting the stock will go down if it goes up you lose money you can't afford that because they're paying interest and they're losing money so these short sellers are getting blown out the water completely so they're losing money and they have to cover their position for a loss that increases the price of the stock and let's go real quick into tesla let me just show you what's up you guys already know i showed you the other position other portfolio that's up over 300k right now but in this portfolio the the public portfolio that i show you guys you know we have an average cost of $218 per share stock's at $435 guys telling you this stock has more room to run but it's kind of like your last chance so i'm telling you get ready it's we're in the bull market but it doesn't last forever you got to be smart on this bull market you can't just keep buying and buying and expect it to go to the moon it has more room to run but every day you wait that gap fills so the other thing i want to cover real fast is nvidia i told you sell nvidia 130 puts and i'm going to stick to that play this week as well um because if you take a look at nvidia i already covered it i can make another video if you guys want this video gets enough likes and subscribes i'll make another video on uh nvidia i think the valuation is very reasonable this stock has cooled off and i see a clear trajectory that we can get to $150 per share sell 130 puts for january 17 expiration now the next thing i want to cover is a lot of you guys just have spy and and index funds and i think that's fantastic i'm bullish this week on spy and i think we're going to get some upwards action so i'm bullish in december in general due to the macroeconomy now the next and last stock i want to cover is going to be amd so amd um you know chip chip buyers they want to see more competition between nvidia and then some of their competition because nvidia is just crushing it i think amd can give nvidia a little bit of a run for its money not completely right but amd has a little bit of a market share it's doing okay we're at a 52- we support you take a look at nvidia stock nvidia is at one you know 133 like i said get aggressive sell the 130 you know put option but when it comes to amd this stock has fallen way too much we're well below the you know the support if you take a look at the six-month performance right here we're at a 52 we low guys we can't i mean we can but it's unlikely that we will get any lower it's just not really likely if you think about the valuation it's becoming too cheap for for a lot of investors they're going to start buying it up 52 we low is no joke but you know if you want to be extra safe just sell a 120 put for january 17 and look if it goes to 120 you're going to see a big bounce because at 120 just going to be way too cheap so a lot of investors will start to pile in and i expect to see it bounce and to give you the short summary i did cover amd my three stocks to become a millionaire actually recently that i uploaded and i just want to say real fast that amdc lisa sue she's focusing on innovation efficiency and identifying markets where amd could excel so it's as simple as that guys amd is going to continue to have their market share and um it's a fantastic stock to sell puts on a own now last thing i want to say wrap up the video is i'm also thinking to jump into cava but i'm going to have to do a little bit more uh research this week if this video gets a th000 likes and 1 th000 subscribes i'm going to do some more uh research on cava and give you guys some more new plays if you want to make some new money as these tech stocks do start to approach full valuation we still have some more room to run but i'm going to have to do my research and do my job and give you guys more plays so if you want that like subscribe and uh let's let's make some money this week stay safe and yeah let's just make as much money as possible because during the good time s we have to reap a lot of rewards and you know like freeze those veggies and fruits for the winner so all right guys i'll catch you in the next one have a good one,GS;NVDA;TSLA,NVDA:INCREASE;TSLA:HOLD;GS:OPEN,NVDA:INCREASE;TSLA:INCREASE;GS:INCREASE,ACGL:0.0090;BAC:0.0094;BLK:0.0157;HPQ:0.1861;INTC:0.0737;KHC:0.0002;MSFT:0.0920;NFLX:0.0002;NVDA:0.0817;PLTR:0.0019;PYPL:0.0007;SBUX:0.0737;SMCI:0.0019;TGT:0.0952;TSLA:0.2633;WMT:0.0952,ACGL:0.0041;BAC:0.0042;BLK:0.0071;GS:0.1732;HPQ:0.0840;INTC:0.0333;KHC:0.0001;MSFT:0.0415;NFLX:0.0001;NVDA:0.2656;PLTR:0.0009;PYPL:0.0003;SBUX:0.0333;SMCI:0.0009;TGT:0.0429;TSLA:0.2656;WMT:0.0429,AAPL:0.1467;ABNB:0.0000;ACGL:0.0121;AVGO:0.0000;BAC:0.0121;BLK:0.0239;BRK-B:0.0000;GOOG:0.0000;GS:0.0239;HPQ:0.1467;INTC:0.0472;KHC:0.0009;MCD:0.1467;MS:0.0472;MSFT:0.0472;NFLX:0.0009;NVDA:0.0472;PLTR:0.0022;PYPL:0.0022;SBUX:0.0472;SCHW:0.0022;SMCI:0.0022;TGT:0.0472;TSLA:0.1467;WMT:0.0472;XOM:0.0000,AAPL:0.0868;ACGL:0.0071;AVGO:0.0000;BAC:0.0071;BLK:0.0141;BRK-B:0.0000;GOOG:0.0000;GS:0.1792;HPQ:0.0868;INTC:0.0279;KHC:0.0005;MCD:0.0868;MS:0.0279;MSFT:0.0279;NFLX:0.0005;NVDA:0.1792;PLTR:0.0013;PYPL:0.0013;SBUX:0.0279;SCHW:0.0013;SMCI:0.0013;TGT:0.0279;TSLA:0.1792;WMT:0.0279,1.1105077429966594,1.0720758897614096,0.11050774299665944,0.07207588976140955
2024-12-16,bbuEFmIDxp8,"kind: captions language: en the stock market is ripping and so many stocks are at a 52- we high while everyone is looking at expensive stocks like paler like tesla there's an awesome ai stock with even more upside that's really lucrative and it's at a 52 we low it's an absolute bombshell that i just put money into so i respect your time i'm going to share with you and break down the stock that i just invested in and the stock that i am really bullish on that so many people are not talking about the stock is amd amd stock is cheaper today than it was a whole entire year ago this stock is near a 52 we low and it's at a very key inflection point and that's why i'm buying the stock and i have two option trades for you one of the option trades is going to absolutely blow up your account in a good way all right here's a brief summary because i respect your time if you have to bounce from this video you don't have time you have to go get a workout you have to go spend time with your family or you're just at work whatever here's the quick breakdown okay in my research what i did was i looked at amd ceo and i decided to purchase amd shares today because i'm bullish on the ceo i'm bullish on the fundamentals they have really low rsi the rsi is absolutely ridiculous when i see rsi this low that typically means that the stock is completely oversold and i'm recommending two option trades here okay one is going to be publicly the $130 buy leap option for september 2025 okay that's going to give you time for that upside it's also going to give you multiple earnings quarters because i think amd is going to continue taking share from intel and it's going to compete effectively with nvidia okay my other trade i'm going to have in my private discord community i'm going to give a little bit more information on that at the end of the video but if you don't have time it is the first link in the description and prices will be going up in the new year so make sure you go ahead and check out my one-on-one coaching last but not least my price target for amd is $175 per share in 6 months so there you go if you have to bounce off the video buy the leap option take a look at amd invest wisely and i'll see you in the next one but now if you do have time let's get that money guys i'm pum pump up i'm really pumped up because i'm telling you this thing makes a lot of sense like you you crazy right now if you investing all your money in all the stocks that are at 52 we highs guys we are making money right now instead amd right now amd is time to buy and there's this weird completely really weird dynamic guys i'm doing this video in the morning and i'm telling you i i was just thinking about it amd has a really weird dynamic where if other tech giants like nvidia do well amd goes down so there's like this reverse correlation stock goes up on you know nvidia amd goes down that doesn't make sense to me because yeah i get it they're playing in the same space they're not directly oneto one proportional it's not like nvidia does well amd is going to zero guys that's that's like the weirdest thing that i'm seeing right now the reality is there's plenty of room there's plenty of room to make money in the ai space so it's i'm about to put so much money in your pocket you guys about you guys about to blow up i'm telling you i'm telling you so look let me just go over the facts let me let me stop tell you the hard facts all right bank of america analyst vivic arya he downgraded the stock i'm laughing cuz it's kind of crazy how how much impact these analysts have he downgraded the stock from 180 to 155 and you got to take a look at the stock by the way my portfolio is heading to $5 million we about a crush it we're about to absolutely get to 5 mil next 2 to 3 months 10 to 15% returns telling you mark my words unless we get a crash but i'm telling you doish fed and where the market's headed at right now the momentum you better be in it you cannot miss out amd look this stock is a no-brainer okay this is a cheap stock if you look at the six-month return just take a look we're at 52 we low we're at 126 we're under $127 that's insane under $127 this stock not that long ago was well it was $27 right uh actually one year ago if i go to the one year chart this stock was over $200 per share so a stock that was over $200 per share in the ai space in the ai space like seriously this company is innovating okay look the analyst he was basically what arya said you know vivic arya what he said was that tech giants like amazon like microsoft like alphabet are leaning towards you know going for nvidia chips heavily and that's signaling a strong risk for amd and they can lose market share guys they've already been losing market share it's already priced in like this is already priced in i'm telling you what's already priced in to amd is priced in because it's at a 52e low you think this is something new you think this analy just came out oh there's a lot of competition and the stock crashed the 52 we lows does that make sense to you do you think there's that many stupid people that have basically not thought that there's competition they thought okay amd is the only company in the space that's been the case so now an analyst just emphasizes the point hey there there's some competition going on and people are like okay let me sell off the stock to a 52 we low that's actually why i decided to pick up this stock because when i was doing my research i actually use options.com it's the third link in my description i don't like to promote it but it is a software tool that i like to look at and i've contributed to it i like to look at that software tool for new opportunities i actually caught airbnb through it i caught nvidia now amd is is the next stock that i'm going to throw $75,000 into it i'm going to start off with a fairly small position to me okay to you what i think you should do is on the share side you go for 3% of your portfolio but the key is leaps because what i did with leap options and i've already explained leap so let me briefly tell you with leap options you get a huge leverage on the upside okay i recommend the 330 leaps on tesla blew people's portfolios up all right i hope i hope you guys start to think about blowing up in a good way cuz i think a lot of people think blowing up in the down way i haven't lost money for 7 years now i've been trading for 10 years and after working for goldman sachs after becoming a coach in 2020 i've absolutely killed it and that's because i'm looking at the facts i'm using conservative analysis i'm taking a look at fundamentals and i'm picking the right stock stock selection is the most important thing okay if you're start using my option strategies on trash stocks you're going to get trash results it's it's as simple as that okay it's all about stock selection and right now with everything at a 52 week high looking at amd you know a lot of chip buyers they want to see more competition amongst ai chip makers and amd they intend to provide chips to the entire industry they don't just have applications to you know just self-driving cars they have many applications i'll talk about that in just a little bit i want to hit you with the the best facts that you should take action on 130 by le option for september 2025 that is a good pick for me that's going to give me upside without having to spend you know tons of money on the stock what you don't want to do is you don't want to spend a ton of money on the stock by buying shares instead a leap option will give you that upside you're going to get upside without having to fork up all that cash like let me show you right now in my portfolio if i pull up amd why would you buy a 100 shares of the stock when a leap option gives you the same 100 shares upside movement without having to actually put up all the capital that's actually why options are so powerful is because they give you leveraged upside like you get leveraged upside same movement so if i go to september right now and specifically i like september because it gives you multiple earnings quarters for amd to perform well and if amd performs well obviously your leap options are also going to benefit tremendously so check it out if i go for the 130 it's only going to go for $2,000 so $2,000 you get to put up rather than if you buy 100 shares you literally have to put $127,000 like what's better 20k or $1 127k yes you have to pay some money and you do have a little bit of upside in terms of the stock has to have upside for you to even break even but there are multiple ways to reduce the cost here i'm going to do that live when the market opens up in my discord but to give you the short summary you basically can sell call options against this call option so you buy a call option you sell a call option or what you can also do is you can just do a bull call spread right away all right so that's a bull call spread i do have videos on that just type in invest with henry bull call spread on youtube and you will see my bull call spread strategy but look this is a much better strategy than just owning amd because to be honest with you i am fully invested i don't have a lot of cash you guys saw that i made a big play on tesla i put $1.5 million into tesla 1, $280,000 i'm up $280,000 in just like a weekend a half and then i also have another tesla position so i am dry on cash and i can't really even sell my positions because i have a lot of gains and i don't want to pay taxes so getting a little bit more difficult so i'm giving you guys some plays that i hope you take advantage of but i can't even take advantage of all my plays like i have to go conservative in terms of how much i invest because i don't have that much cash but look i'm just giving you a little bit more information let me tell you about what i think about the ceo and i'll wrap up this video i'll keep it you know fairly short amd ceo lisa sue she's focusing on innovation efficiency and identifying markets where amd could excel it's all about looking at the ceo guys if there's a crappy ceo you can forget about that company why you think i invested in pound here because alex carp went to my high school i believe in alex carb i see what he's doing i like his leadership i like his networking i like the government contract that that he's getting all those government contracts tesla right i respect elon musk elon musk is like my mentor like i want to be like elon in many ways elon's awesome he's smart he's innovative what he's doing with tesla is remarkable the relationships that he has is amazing now he's like he's buddy buddy with trump in the white house so i'm very very very bullish on tesla and i'm going to continue to cover tesla on this channel because i have over $1.5 million into tesla in just two weeks i'm up hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars right it's like retirement fast my my stock picking ability is retirement fast um so look i'm telling you amd when it comes to their chips i think there's going to be a big difference in the market because it's not just ai you know amd is making their chips for a lot of different markets not just ai so you know it's it's kind of like investing in technology it's investing in ai in general you know and if you actually take a look at amd this is going to be a little bit of a bold claim but honestly amt is the only company that is actually has a real shot at competing with nvidia they actually have a real shot at competing with nvidia who else has a real shot you think a company can just you know get out of nowhere and just start competing with nvidia no but amd's been in the game for a very long time they have a good ceo i get it the ceo is not as good as jensen hung but the valuation is also super super cheap like i can go over the valuation a bit more actually with you guys like the valuation just makes a lot of sense like the price earnings ratio very reasonable price of sales ratio very reasonable growth rate is still there 52 low rsi is low i mean amd is constantly taking market share by the way from intel 2o so even if they never end up beating nvidia it's still a great company to bet on especially at the valuation that they're at right now like you would be silly not to honestly invest in this company like we're in an ai market we literally have a lot of momentum right now that is driving our portfolios higher and i'm not saying you should invest like all your money into amd but i think investing just like $500 $1,000 or just the $2,000 leap options that i'm recommending you're going to see so much growth in your portfolio it's going to be insane like right now i have students that they put in like $10,000 into leap options on tesla on the 330 call that i actually put up on youtube that $10,000 became over $50,000 like it's crazy it became well over $50,000 depending on when you know some of you guys jumped in and when people take profit but at this point people have made more off of just one tesla leite play than they make as a doctor as a dentist like it's more lucrative to trade options than the root canals that my dentists are doing so it's like we're in a bull market take advantage of it make as much money as possible i've said this already two times i think or once or twice i do a lot of one-on-one coaching now so my words kind of sometimes get mixed up but i hope this is super valuable in good times you take that money you grow your portfolio you grow your wealth you exponentially increase the value of your wealth you approach retirement much quicker but when the tough times come we're going to lose money like let's be honest like we're going to lose some money when the bare market strikes you think i can predict the market back okay we're going to go down i'm going to sell my positions no so when it pulls down i'm going to lose 3 4 5 maybe 6% but if i've made 300% i don't care about 6% um honestly if you've made half a mill in a month five months in a row which i think i'm at half a mill in the past two three months in a row in this bull market if you have made that type of money right or even if you scaling your portfolio i made some videos about scaling from 100k to 500k let's let's say you started with 100 you got to 450 then the market pulls back and you go from 450 to 405 are you sweating it not really really you went from 100 to 450 now you're back down to 405 you go into defensive sectors more which i'll keep you updated on if you're subscribed to the channel i'll tell you hey we're shifting from this market to this market i'm shifting from growth to defensive i'm cutting these positions for these positions i'll do that as fast as i can obviously all my live trades are my discord but i'm going to still provide lots of value on youtube as much as possible so i'm just telling you how i'm thinking make as much money right now there's going to be a bare market at some point don't worry about it for now keep making money hand over fist bicep over tricep all right

2024-12-18,XpWMjvWVz_U,"kind: captions language: en nvidia suffered eight losses in 9 days and this is a really huge opportunity that i'm about to tell you how to capitalize on because right now there's two analysts that came out in the last 24 hours alone with some concerns about nvidia being in bearish territory and they also discuss the evaluations so in this video i have not one but two analysts that i'm going to cover and i'm going to tell you my opinion and how to make money on nvidia with a new play that i have right now for you this is an opportunity that i need you to capitalize on not want i need you to capit on this opportunity because while everyone is turning bearish on nvidia or at least some people have concerns this is literally the biggest opportunity and this is an opportunity that you can't miss so i respect your time let's jump into today's research i want to first start off with saying that vivic arya he is an analyst on wall street covers nvidia extensively and he recently addressed the bearish concerns he talked about his price range and what he sees happening with the stock and i agree for the most part but i have a little bit of a twist i want you to watch this quick 90c clip and then i'm going to tell you my opinion in the play that i'm making on nvidia raises a question how vulnerable is nvidia in the short and medium term to the market's overall risk sentiment i mean nvidia is lower since the election right hi john thanks for having me i think nvidia um so is our topic for uh for next year we like broadcom and marvel uh for that matter as well because these three companies are ideally positioned uh to capitalize on this demand for ai uh infrastructure i think specific to nvidia there are two issues that are uh have been affecting it near term one is uh the execution on the new blackwell uh product uh you know the last two quarters they have reported uh there have been some uh production issues with black bel that they have resolved then there were some delays in getting it out uh to hyperscalers and i think those will also be resolved so in in our perspective this is actually a very attractive opportunity uh to look at uh nvidia because these concerns will be uh shortterm in uh nature when we look longer term uh and look at the um situation that broadcom mentioned that in the next few years there could be greater demand for custom chips i don't think that is inconsistent with the way we have thought about the market which is about 80% of the market will be merchant accelerators where nvidia will dominate and about 15 to 20% of the market will be more custom chips where um marvel and broadcom i think will do extremely well so we think of these as very complimentary in nature and some of the issues around and we think are very uh shortterm and the stock is trading at a very attractive valuation right now all right guys as you saw in that quick clip i want to talk about the attractive opportunity that we have in nvidia right now because we're still in a tech bull market dan i said that we're going to go from 1 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. party has only begun and he sees the market going up for the next 2 to three years i'm not going to predict it that far i'm just going to say that in the next 12 months i am bullish on nvidia and my specific price target is $200 per share in 2025 kind of like a mega bull on nvidia right now and i'm going to discuss this in just a moment but i want to say that one of the most important things to look out for and some of the bearish concerns why we have a pullback in the stock is it's important for you to understand why we have a pullback and should you jump into it right now the answer is yes we should jump into it right now the reason why we have a pullback is there has been some delays with blackwell so nvidia's blackwell which is going out to a lot of the hyperscalers there's a little bit of a delay which is not really a long-term concern this is only a short-term concern so basically it has no impact on the stock's long-term future or valuation the most interesting thing is i was watching watching a recent video from john vin he's a key bank capital markets equity research analyst and he was pointing out some really big specific things about his earnings predictions and they are very bullish for the most part and even his bease i would say is very reasonable as well so the most interesting part is that he has a very specific range for where the stock is going to be and i want to elaborate on that as well i'm giving you two of these quick clips and then i'm going to jump into my portfolio i'm going to show you why nvidia well we can already see in the pre-market right here it's already going up a little bit in the pre-market because it's it's too cheap i'm telling you it's too cheap this stock is way too cheap under $130 per share so we hit 130 like under 130 for a little short amount of time but we're going to pop back up real fast i'm telling you we're going to pop up real quick because nvidia just can't be that low so anyways i'm going to cover my picks and my personal what i'm going to be doing but i want you to quickly watch this uh 30 second clip as well on john vin and his price analysis on nvidia and you you gave a lot of of good reason it's going to continue to outstrip competition for gpus and ai uh you if if the company were able to earn $530 your high-end estimate and you put 38 times that you get you could get the $200 although you've got a a 180 price ar let's talk about the bare case uh because no one ever really we don't hear that much but if it instead of $530 you think the downside uh possible uh earnings per share miss would be 350 and if you put 29 times on that you're all the way down to 100 so you you can get to a range of 100 to 200 on what's fair value all right guys so as you saw there there's a really specific price range between $100 to $200 per share with the base case around 180 but john vin did say like at the very very top end it's about $200 per share okay on the bottom end the be case is $100 per share let me tell you the be case is very unlikely when we say be case listen i worked on wall street let me tell you how analysts work there's a bare case a base case and a bull case that's how all analysts work on wall street essentially they have three three ranges right typically the base case is like 50% and then it's like 25% bare case and then 25% bull case and then you get an average of those three so let's say that you know the base case is 180 and then you know the bare case is 100 and the bull case is 200 okay so you just take you know 25% of the first one 50% of the second one and then 25% of the third one so if i do that math in my head real quick 25% of1 is $25 50% of 180 is 90 so 25 plus 90 is already 115 and the bull case is going to be a quarter of 200 right because it's 25% so quarter of 200 is 50 so what did i say 50 + 25 which is 75 and then we're going to add that half of 90s so we're at like 165 all right so we're around 165 as our mixed average price target 165 is about $30 upside okay so that's usually what it looks like i'm just telling you the standard i personally think that the bare case is more like 10% the bull case is more like you know maybe 30% and then the base case of 180 is like 60% so if you take that blended mix i'm not going to do that math in my head but that blended mix is going to be a lot closer to that 180 price target which i think is super reasonable for nvidia to see about a $50 gain in nvidia stock in 2025 which is basically what i think as well about $180 per share super reasonable but let's just go bullish i'm bullish on the market in general we have dan ives pumping the market we have uh tom lee saying that we're in a you know bull market every all the top two analyst the top three analysts that everyone follows is saying it's a bull market and that's going to influence psychology guys it's all about psychology and i say that in all my videos but i i really want to drive that point home it's not about what actual valuation is i think the valuation for nvidia is very reasonable i think their technology is fantastic i think they're riding on the ai trend and no one's going to compete with nvidia that's a fact amd can't intel definitely can't but at the end of the day it is investor psychology and what i'm seeing in the market right now and from talking to my clients nvidia is going to go higher because we still have a lot of momentum even though we have some concerns in the market i'm personally not concerned i'm staying bullish on this stock and let me jump into the plays that i'm going to be making right now so nvidia i have a couple of different plays i have multiple different options that you can go for so let's start off with the first one i would say the first one you can do a leap option leap option would be absolutely no problem so i would go for september so i just needes that means we're about to make all kinds of money it means we're about to get stupid rich we're going to make hand over fist bicep over tricep about to hit the gym right now but uh we got to make gains in all areas of life guys and especially financially we're going to go to the moon right now cuz now's the opportunity we can make 10 15% per month that's what i'm saying my one-onone students right now we're absolutely killing it i decided to become a one-on-one coach because i've had massive impact although it is limited it is a lot of my time so spots are limited if you want to check that out it's the first link in the description let's jump into this play right now what i'm looking at is i already have a leap option you guys can already see this leap option here i'm already doing pretty well on but uh look i think actually i'm just going to recommend the 130 i would stick to the 130 i already have this play and i would do this again so i would just add to this position when the market opens up i'm going to add to this 130 leap option for september 19th now look what you can do also if you want to reduce the cost of this leap option cu obviously it is not cheap paying $2,500 is better than 13,000 but it's still not really that cheap so what you can do is you can actually play a poor man's covered call so you can go to sell call and then you can pick an expiration date i mean i don't recommend short-term expiration dates like 9 16 days no it's not good even 30 days for a poor man's cover call is a little short but the march right now is exactly 90 days out so exactly 90 days out i'm telling you in 90 days we can see a a movement upward in the stock but just use your logic like it's not going to go to 180 in 90 days so this is kind of easy money right here where you can just sell the 150 call option boom this is easy money easy okay you sell it for 750 now your cost went from you know 2500 down to 1770 guys if your cost went down to 1770 that doesn't seem like a lot but actually it's a 25% reduction essentially it's actually even more than 25% because 4 * 750 is 30 but the 130 call you're you're paying 2500 so you're getting over a 25% discount which to me i'm telling you is a no-brainer now i've recommended leaps on tesla which was fire you know you saw daniv talk about fire i actually gave some real fire like my plays have been the most fire on youtube i'm super proud of it super proud of of calling the 330 leap and the 350 leap it's made it's made hundreds of thousands it's made millionaires in my group as well including myself so look when it comes to nvidia i would say we're not going to go too much past 150 by march it's probably not going to happen um but i also see a really strong floor and really strong support for nvidia at like 120 so in my opinion next 3 months 90 days we're going to be between 120 and 150 all right very simple very straightforward there's no rocket science you don't have to watch the news that's where it's going to be telling you it's like a 99% i've already looked at the binger ban i've done a lot of technical analysis on nvidia because it's it's all about technicals in this market it's all about investor psychology and momentum all right so when i'm looking at video we're going to be between 120 to 150 sell this uh poor man's covered call i'm telling you this is going to make this is going to make some money you know obviously not financial advice i'm not a financial advisor i'm just a dude who's very successful at what he does and has 10 going on 11 years of experience actually in a few weeks i'll have 11 years of experience crazy all right so other thing i would do is if you have a larger portfolio which you know in my private coaching which obviously i charge money for i have a team there's an investment cost to that i you know work with folks that have $50,000 or plus those are the portfolios that i feel like i can scale the easy and that's that's who i have success with right it's just easier to work with folks that do have money so when i'm looking at their portfolios yeah leaps are cool but if you have money you should just honestly go for the wheel strategy just selling puts to get in and selling covered calls on your position it's as simple as that you can you can make five figures a month you can even scale your portfolio with the wheel you're not going to get to 15% per month on just the wheel but if you have a bigger portfolio you can still make a really handsome profit by just selling puts to get in so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go for the january 17 expiration which is 30 days after so if you're looking for an optimal entry into nvidia if you trying to make really good money while being safe like really really safe i'm telling you the best put that you should be selling would be slightly out of the money you know i typically say 30 delta let me analyze the 120 right here in front of you 120 is a little low right so we're going to go up to like 125 which to me is also really good 34 delta so i would go a little bit in between 120 and 125 123 looks like the sweet spot and there we go it is the sweet spot right there boom we look at beautiful all right the implied volatility is 47 the volume is 2,000 very good volume bid and ask is very tight these are a option traders dream guys do not miss out on nvidia just sell puts at1 123 that's $10 lower than what the stock's trading at right now all right if it's lower that's better a lot of you guys think when the stock goes down you get concerned don't get concerned it's a good thing listen the market goes down it's a good thing you get a discount like why are you guys allergic to discounts got chang that mindset it's the first thing i work on in my one-on-one coaching is because it's not even option strategies those are pretty obvious you guys already know what a covered call is what the wheel is it's how you implement it's how you manage it's how you take profit it's when you take profit it's your mindset it's it's just a whole bunch of stuff to get to the next level i have a coach myself not with trading i don't need a coach in trading been doing this 11 years but i have coaches and coaches on coaches in other areas of my life because it's the biggest shortcut in life having a mentor is the biggest shortcut ever like literally ever so i'm a super big believer in that and look the delta here is.3 30 delta the volume is amazing so i would just sell this 123 and i would just make make money collect income for getting a stock that i want to own anyways this is a nob brainer absolutely no-brainer now look i'm also going to give you another play which i think is also really smart if you want to make some income on the put credit spread i haven't mentioned put credit spreads in a long time now guys you already know if you're new to my channel subscribe i have lots of videos here on option trading a put credit spread is not something i've covered in a little bit of time essentially it's a small account trading strategy where you can collect a really good income and put up very little upfront capital so what i'm going to look at is i'm going to go a little bit lower cuz i want to be safer if i expand the 115 here the delta is6 that's amazing that's good so you can just go ahead and sell the 115 or sell a $5 spread so 115 to 110 so if i go ahead and i buy this to protect myself you'll see that this is a put credit spread and you'll see that i'm collecting $69 on$ 430 which is essentially 15% in 30 days so listen 15% in 30 days i've been doing that over and over without even using spreads in this market just using leaps but if you want to have like a safe play i would say 115 110 it's safe so if you have a small portfolio this is what you would do even if you have a medium or small portfolio you can also do this all right i don't want to make this video too long i got to the point i gave you guys the research so take advantage be smart in this market make some money subscribe and i'll catch you guys in the next one",AVGO;INTC;NVDA;TSLA,AVGO:OPEN;INTC:DECREASE;NVDA:INCREASE;TSLA:DECREASE,AVGO:OPEN;INTC:INCREASE;NVDA:INCREASE;TSLA:INCREASE,ABNB:0.2540;ACGL:0.0017;BLK:0.0029;HPQ:0.0343;INTC:0.2540;KHC:0.0000;NFLX:0.0000;NVDA:0.1495;PLTR:0.0004;PYPL:0.0001;SBUX:0.0136;SMCI:0.0004;TGT:0.0175;TSLA:0.2540;WMT:0.0175,ABNB:0.0725;ACGL:0.0005;AVGO:0.2256;BLK:0.0008;HPQ:0.0098;INTC:0.2256;KHC:0.0000;NFLX:0.0000;NVDA:0.2256;PLTR:0.0001;PYPL:0.0000;SBUX:0.0039;SMCI:0.0001;TGT:0.0050;TSLA:0.2256;WMT:0.0050,AAPL:0.0307;ABNB:0.1073;ACGL:0.0025;AVGO:0.0000;BAC:0.1073;BLK:0.0050;BRK-B:0.0000;GOOG:0.1073;GS:0.1073;HPQ:0.0307;INTC:0.1073;KHC:0.0002;MCD:0.0307;MS:0.0099;MSFT:0.1073;NFLX:0.0002;NVDA:0.1073;PLTR:0.0005;PYPL:0.0005;SBUX:0.0099;SCHW:0.0005;SMCI:0.0005;TGT:0.0099;TSLA:0.1073;WMT:0.0099,AAPL:0.0163;ABNB:0.0568;ACGL:0.0013;AVGO:0.1603;BAC:0.0568;BLK:0.0026;GOOG:0.0568;GS:0.0568;HPQ:0.0163;INTC:0.1603;KHC:0.0001;MCD:0.0163;MS:0.0052;MSFT:0.0568;NFLX:0.0001;NVDA:0.1603;PLTR:0.0002;PYPL:0.0002;SBUX:0.0052;SCHW:0.0002;SMCI:0.0002;TGT:0.0052;TSLA:0.1603;WMT:0.0052,1.062088506349628,1.030911156323159,0.062088506349627925,0.030911156323158995
2024-12-20,hRn5OZWKlso,kind: captions language: en tom lee said this is an opportunity of a lifetime and the market right now has pulled back and there's an opportunity that he sees as a buying opportunity for the rest of 2024 going into 2025 now look i have a very strong opinion on this because i do see a lot of opportunities in the market however i do see some stocks that are overvalued and i do believe they will be falling further in my opinion over the past 10 years what i've seen in this market what works what doesn't and when the market corrects like this what you should be doing to capitalize it's all about capit izing it's all about human emotions and right now in this market what i'm seeing is we do indeed have a buying opportunity for two stocks i'm going to cover in this video while there are a couple other stocks that are overpriced listen i'm going to show you a quick clip this clip is going to help you understand repricing and what to do in a market pullback because what i'm seeing right now is a huge opportunity to take advantage of volatility so watch this quick 90c clip tom we'll start with you i take it you think this is a buying opportunity this uh this is another buying opportunity in our view 2024 has proven to be a year where the market's been strong and it has eluded many opportunities for sustained weakness i know yesterday's pullback was really painful but to us i think the fundamental supporting stocks are intact and i think it's a good opportunity for investors here a good opportunity for investors jee i take it that you feel is differently putting it too strong well i don't disagree with tom on the fundamental side of it but i think if you look at where we're at with the interest rates what's on the horizon from taxes tariffs and deficits i really have to be considered of what happened yesterday it was the second largest move in the vix we have seen and historically speaking kelly tom is right a month after that spike in the vix you see the s&amp;p 500 higher however i don't think we can lean on history here due to the fact that we've seen stretch valuations in the top 10 names of the s&amp;p 500 we've also seen just a straight line up if you look in the last two years back toback years of above 25% we become conditioned that the markets is going to continue to move higher thanks by and large to the fed dobish in their $7 trillion balance sheet so i'm looking i know tom wants to back up the truck here i have the truck running but i'm not ready to back it up yet i want to see this more processed reset valuations i think that's going to be the next couple months possibly the first quarter because we become too conditioned kelly to markets repricing in a day i have to go back to my 30-year career and understand that we will see reset valuations more of a quarter or two not just a day or two all right guys so let's go over what we just learned in this clip tom lee said this is a buying opportunity and i agree completely with tom lee guys we have been making money hand over fist we've been pulling in so much profits in this market we made over 15% in the last month alone now we see a little bit of a pullback so you're thinking to yourself is a game over is this over for the market are we going to continue to pull back i want to tell you no we're going to continue to see a bull market repricing shortterm little bit of correction is nothing nothing to worry about because this is actually healthy for the market the market can't go up in a straight line guys it's not like a complete like like this right it can't go one day two days 10 days in a row up what you actually need to happen in the market is a steps and ladder pattern okay so you go up in steps all right and then boom you take the elevator down that is normal that's exactly what happens in the market that's the point of volatility if it was easy everyone would be rich that's not how it works so we want to take advantage of the upward momentum when it pulls down like you know 3% like we just saw yesterday we take advantage by buying high quality companies and we avoid the companies that have you know higher risk the companies that don't have good valuations the companies that don't have good technicals this is what you want to look out for now what i saw in this clip right specifically is tom lee said hey this is buying opportunity it's business as usual all right business as usual we're making money things are going to continue to go up now jeff kilberg he's also a very interesting man he has a lot of experience and what he said is he actually disagreed a little bit with tom lee he said that you know we're going to see some repricing and repricing takes some time in my personal opinion repricing can take time but not in this market the momentum is super clear to me and one- day pullback is not going to scare me one day pullback is actually a fantastic opportunity to jump into the market in my opinion and i don't really see this as a longer term repricing as jeff kilberg said so in my opinion i'm telling you the facts amd is at a 52e low guys are you kidding me it's at a 52- we low how much lower can it get amd is a fantastic buying opportunity as well as nvidia these are the top two stocks that you should be buying right now if you're not buying them you're going to be missing out on a ton of money amd at a 52e low is going to be a fantastic buying opportunity for the 130 call option leap for september 2025 i mentioned this in my last video and i'm telling you this opportunity in amd is going to print money because i'm not looking at expensive stocks i don't really like stocks at 52- we highs what i'm looking at is 52 we lows so that's where amd is at right now as well as nvidia we're not necessarily at a 52e low for nvidia but nvidia has pulled back and at the price level that i'm seeing it right now anything under 135 is a fantastic buying opportunity for me in fact i think that nvidia is easily going to be a $180 stock in the next 6 to 12 months both amd and nvidia are fantastic ai plays guys we have heard from dan ies that we're at a tech party right we're we're at 10: p.m. and the party's going to 4:00 a.m. that's what he's famous for saying right and i am in full belief that the tech party is still here and we have 25% more growth to have in 2025 now obviously we're at the end of 2024 so there's a little bit of volatility people are going on holidays and you know some folks are selling off on the market if you sell off on you know stocks at 52e highs and take profit i can't blame you that's fine but if you're selling off and you're panicking from nvidia or amd that's a huge mistake and based on my research right here amd and envid my top two plays however i will also say tenter still has opportunities as well and i'm personally holding my leaps on paler i'm also holding my leaps on tesla both of those stocks are going to continue to do well so these are my four top plays now look when it comes to nvidia i want to point out something super important because some people say nv video is going to pull back further i will tell you what i'm seeing right now in terms of a floor okay this is what i'm referring to as a floor floor is basically a support level those two things are synonyms floor and support okay now understanding where floor is we're at a much lower multiple for nvidia versus other ai peers guys this is a relative game if you want to understand how to actually invest there's actually no absolute numbers okay on an absolute level yes nvidia has you know good pe ratio but it's all about what is it compared to others in this market that's what we want to understand on a deeper level and when i look at aip peers versus nvidia the aip peers are more expensive than nvidia nvidia is going for very reasonable levels and i want you to understand this through this short clip that i want to show you from a morgan stanley analyst this morgan stanley analyst explains why nvidia is a good opportunity right now so watch this quick clip it's only going to be 90 seconds uh where's the floor where's uh where's the bottom here is there is there one and uh what do you think the fair value of this company really is hi good morning um so i think we're wrestling with a couple of things um we have this transition to blackwell and so your product hopper which still driving you majority of revenues is starting to slow down as you would expect to see and there's a lot of enthusiasm now for custom so we can or as6 as we've seen with broadcom and marell i think those things are weighing on the stock i still think when you think about 2025 and ai the story is blackwell the product cycle that ind india has i think they're going to have a huge second half of the year and i think we do have these transitional issues as we're moving there but i think the stock is very attractive at this level uh i'm not going to say absolute bottom because it's volatile but you know as very attractive at this level i think you're you're trading at a much lower multiple than some of the aip peers and i really believe that they actually gain share versus custom silicon in 2025 i'm very excited for this custom silicon trend but i still think nvidia can gain share relative to that in 2025 and has a very strong product cycle um you know we think the stock trades well north of 150 uh as we sort of move into that back half 150 end of the year meaning if if if we do the holidays again together joseph that uh we're 150 then or 150 6 months out no sorry 12 months out yeah we're we're uh our forecast our our price targets are high 150s i think uh 12 months out 15 what kind of multiple what kind of multiple are you you putting on that 12 months out relative and how would you compare that to the to maybe the whatever you think the best comps are at this moment yeah i think we have a mid four number in 2025 we think north of $ five doll in 2026 i think those numbers are very conservative and we've seen the stock in the low3s kind of multiple range when there's periods of strong growth ahead of us and i think we have that uh the peers are now trading kind of more like high 30s uh when you look at the you know where the brcs and marvels are trading on our estimat so i think that's that's a very reasonable multiple now they have high margins and they're again they have these transitional issues that you're wrestling with all of that can continue to weigh on the stock we may continue to hear some data points about the the older products manufacturing starting to slow down but but black was really robust and the demand they have uh is is very strong yes all right so what we just saw from this clip is basically 2025 is trending for an up market that was the analyst's opinion um from morgan stanley he says 2025 is going to be fire we've seen that from multiple analysts and by the way this is not rocket science guys the higher the stock goes the better it performs other analyst realize that they are stupid for not being bullish on the stock so i'm planning to see more and more analysts come out and say hey i'm also bullish because it's kind of like a cycle all right so when a bunch of analysts have a price target on nvidia 80 bucks 75 bucks and nvidia is at 1 30 they have to change their price target otherwise they look dumb so they need to go up and as more analysts go up they start to copy each other so this is a cycle and i expect this to continue to happen in 2025 now we also saw the morgan stanley analyst mention that the product cycle for nvidia is a little bit difficult with blackwell however they do have a strong product cycle in general so in 2025 we should see a lot more of that come to fruition now the morgan stanley analyst did see the stock above 150 i think that is way too conservative for me i see the stock at $180 per share and you know if i'm taking a look at opportunities in the market that have the most upside for the level of risk guys it's not about just money okay anyone can you know buy a call option and take a huge risk and maybe get lucky i'm not trying to maybe get lucky i'm trying to get rich for sure i'm trying to put you in the positions that are the most likely to build your wealth without you know having any adverse effects because a lot of people can buy like really risky and high volatility stocks sometimes you win sometimes you lose that's not what i want i want to win and put the most odds in my favor as possible i'm trying to be a casino i'm trying to put the odds in my favor so i can build wealth for sure and when i do my one-on-one coaching with my students i see a lot of success stories especially right now i have so many doctors lawyers engineers pilots these guys are making more money in the option market right now with my plays than they're making in their full-time job so this is a no-brainer market to continue to build wealth and i said this in a prior video let me tell you one more time because you need to understand this if you make a lot of money right now you are not going to care when there is a correction because it's like reaping a harvest if you're going to be a farmer and you have a lot of fruits and a lot of veggies all you have to do is pick up those fruits and veggies freeze some of them for the winner so when the tough times come you can weather those tough times it's as simple as that guys that's why right now this is a huge opportunity and i'm building a lot of urgency for you to take action because i've grown my portfolio multiple six figures per month and you can do the same telling you as you guys know you can always hit the first link in my description i do have some more spots in my one-on-one coaching but let's continue on with the video because what i want you to understand is that amd i said is a fantastic leap opportunity play what you want to do is you want to purchase some leap options on amd now be smart you guys need proper risk management you can't just dump all your money into leap option and think okay my portfolio is going to go to the moon no what you have to do is put 3 to 5% of your money in amd or into nvidia you need to have proper risk management and it does depend on one by one basis because if you have a bigger portfolio then you should have less of your money and leaps and if you have a smaller portfolio then you can afford to take on more risk because you basically need more risk to leverage up your portfolio to have faster growth so i want to conclude this video by saying that i agree with tom lee and based on my own research what i'm doing every single day spending multiple hours on research putting my students in the best place to make money i agree with tom lee that this is a buying opportunity for almost every stock in the market that has pulled back for many stocks in this market especially amd and nvidia especially the ai companies however i would be cautious right now on adobe and meta what i'm seeing right now is there are some risk on the table when it comes to adobe i just don't see a strong support where a lot of investors are jumping into the stock i see continued negative momentum same thing with meta i think there is some demand same thing with meta i think that this is a fantastic company but in the short term i see some weakness in the stock so i would be careful with those two stocks i would have you know clear sight on the stocks that i mentioned in this video and then the other companies that i've covered i'm still holding and i still have a lot of belief in this market i think we're going to continue to make money hand over fist i'm going to keep making those fruits and veggies and i'm going to continue to freeze them for the winner because when tough times come we take advantage we take advantage of opportunities like this so i want to encourage you guys to be smart don't panic don't sell and understand that this is a long-term game where we're building a ton of wealth and we're going to continue to build a ton of wealth if we play it right okay if we adjust to the market if we understand the market and most importantly if we dollar cost average the high high quality companies that are going for reasonable valuations if you want to learn how to become a better investor and you actually want to scale up your portfolio understand risk management understand momentum understand delta understand all the things that i cover in this channel make

2024-12-21,RfHcqSqrsUs,"kind: captions language: en i'll make this a super short but very important video if you want to make money this week no webinars no free master classes don't smash nothing don't buy nothing i'm just going to get to the point and give you the research that i see happening in the market i'm going to cover the market itself what we saw with jerome powell as well as certain key stocks that i'm holding like pal here tesla you know i'm going to just get into it sofi let's go into sofi first so look sofi right now is in a really interesting position my portfolio is still doing very well okay this week we had some volatility but i have a very strong feeling of what's going to happen for the rest of the market and i'm telling you right now for the most part we are business as usual certain stocks are going to keep pulling back while other stocks are going to rebound and they're going to do just fine because we're at some key support levels as well as the floor for you know amd for example so look sofi technologies is a really powerful stock and i'm telling you right now i recommended last week to sell a put option this week i'm still recommending selling a put option because it was actually very very profitable to sell $15 puts $15 puts right now despite the volatility despite you know what we see from you know jerome powell despite what we see with some investors getting scared selling $15 puts on sofi is an absolute no-brainer you sell 15 puts because it's an optimal entry the stock is over $15 so even if the market pulls back 2 3% you're still going to be profitable and at worst you get to purchase sofi and you get to hold it and i think this stock is honestly a millionaire maker if you look at the market cap like honestly look at the market cap of sofi if i scroll down here you can see that the market cap is $16.67 billion this stock can be a $50 billion market cap if it 3x's and it's not that huge so having a 3x return isn't unreasonable in the next you know several years i'm not going to be you know trying to predict the future here and say it's going to happen in a month no it's going to take some time but listen what you want to do in this market is dollar cost average into the best companies and so far for me is an absolute hold this is the easiest hold and even if the stock goes to a market valuation of $34 billion that's still a 2x in your money so you're looking at 2x or 3x return you know in 2025 i would say that we can see this stock at $25 per share so what i would do is i would sell some put options and the clear the honest truth is why why am i believer in sofi it's because of innovation and disruption okay innovation and disruption is why i'm investing in this company and you know i'm just looking at my notes right here they essentially are developing a comprehensive mobile app right this mobile app allows customers to manage various financial products and services all in one place i really like the simplicity and that's also why i personally use robin hood because it's more simple than the other brokerages and simplic is what people want nowadays why do you think amazon did so well it's because everything is delivered fast everyone gets their dopamine hit right away and they get exactly what they want soofi is exactly that it's like the fast food of banking and by combining technological payments by com uh combining banking businesses into one agile model sofi is challenging the standard banking uh structure they're challenging these old banks guys when i used to work at goldman sachs it was literally like you know 1987 wall street if you seen the movie wall street it's literally like 1987 the systems are outdated the office looks old i mean everything is super outdated and everything looks super old and when you take a look at sofi it's basically just like a no no-brainer play because banks are dinosaurs and sofi is an obvious play because they're innovating and disrupting that's why you see some of the top investors jumping into this company so in terms of what's going to happen this week i think it's a really crucial time for you to sell put options if you have cash sell put options on sofi i would go for the 15 sell put and i would do that for january expiration to wrap it up with sofi the last thing i want to say is sofi is set to benefit from falling interest rates that's another big benefit right we we actually have inflation under control guys from the research that i see and from you know looking at the market i spent several hours actually looking at resources studying the market and i think inflation is under control and interest rates as they fall lower sofi is going to benefit and this is going to be actually as trump enters the office and as we get into 2025 not only are we going to be in a fire market as we saw dan i said fire this market is going to be fire okay i also am in belief of that as well um but it's also going to be a fantastic time due to favorable regular atory environment right look at the the regulatory environment guys when regulations go down which you know trump is probably going to do and you know republicans on that side right i don't have a side i don't care democrats and republicans are the same thing to me i'm only thinking about how how can i become better how can i put more money in your guys pockets who's actually speaking there as the as the politician doesn't really matter to me but look it's a fact regulatory environment is going to be better and i that's a benefit for tesla and that's a benefit for sofi you know potential tax reforms this is going to be a a very huge competitive advantage and this is going to help sofi compete very you know heavily against the traditional banks so i expect them to continue to take share and i reiterate a $15 um entry into this stock by selling puts all right let's go into the next stock well actually it's going to be spy i want to talk a little bit about the general uh market and what i see in the market going to the santa claus rally so for many of you guys and actually for a lot of my students we made money like hand over fist we we really crushed it however a lot of questions are coming to me right now do we still see a bull market and for me the answer is yes we're still in a bull market and just giving you my three points real fast about spy looking at reduced market liquidity as we head into the holiday season is actually an issue because there's a reduction of trading volume right even in my one-on-one coaching there's a reduction of people booking calls right now because we're going into the holiday season people are busy people are traveling people are on vacation they're with your wife you're with your husband right you're with your kids you're with your family so just understanding that there's going to be less liquidity right now in the market and there's going to be less trading volume which is actually kind of bad for option trading specifically because the bid ask spread widens and since there's less volume going on there's you know wider bid ask spread there's more slippage cost and it's a bit more expensive to to trade but look there's two sides to the coin okay with trading you guys already know there's never like a green light this is green light red light it's always somewhere in between and you need to analyze and make your own high quality decisions right i'm obviously here if you're subscribed to this channel i keep giving you insights on what makes money because i want to light your wealth on fire i want you to make as much money in as possible in this market that's my goal obviously i also like making money i make a ton of money from the stock market i also do coaching which which you know clearly everyone on youtube sells something for me i try to do the very bare minimum of that and i try to give as much as possible for free because at the end of the day my goal is to educate and grow a large community here and uh all just feast feast and eat a whole bunch of good you know food and just yeah celebrate and make money that's what's changed my life so look getting to the point the santa claus rally the period right now that we're in is really interesting because i expect the bullish move on monday and i think going into christmas this is going to be a really optimistic time for a lot of investors despite the volatility typically what happens is we have a santa claus rally also what happens in january there's typically a january effect where the stock market pumps up so this is like the best time to be bullish even though we've had a little bit of short-term pain here with a little bit of an overreaction i'm going to cover the overreaction in just a second but look there's there's a lot of optimism in the market and i would say that we're still on the optimistic track to have a 25% return in tech stocks in 2025 and for the next 9 days of this year look know over the next eight days whatever we're going to have success and i think that we are going to see a santa claus rally and this is a really interesting situation because from one perspective you have less people trading and then the people that are trading are making a lot more money there's a whole big disparity right now at the end of the year with people just making a ton of money while others just you know miss out and that's because uh actually hedge funds some of them have vacation some of them also you know they're not coming to work it's actually a really huge opportunity to take money from other people to be honest with you so you know that's my goal is to outperform the market and just looking at the nasdaq we have seen significant gains and this reflects you know the optimism despite earlier uh rate concerns we have some rate concerns but you look at nasdaq the thing is is wild i mean i'm just going to move on i'm going to go into my stocks but i just want to tell you i'm bullish on the market and let's jump into the actual next stock um the next stock is pal here and just starting off real quick we saw that tom lee he said buy the market dip i cannot reiterate that enough guys i see way too much panic i see way too much overreaction in this market i think this is a big buying opportunity and here's a 206 clip just reconfirming what i'm saying with tom lee saying it this is another buying opportunity in our view 2024 has proven to be a year where the market's been strong and it has eluded many opportunities for sustained weakness i know yes yesterday's pullback was really painful but to us i think the fundamental supporting stocks are intact and i think it's a good opportunity for investors here all right guys so that was 20 seconds listen paler is trying for $80 per share paler wants to hit 80 okay i'm telling you guys i'm super pumped up palen here to hit $80 per share right you can you can see it right you guys already know i'm buying this stock hand over fist and that's because i believe in it it's a no-brainer just understand paler is trying for $80 per share and they have surged you know 350% this year 350% okay they have surged because people understand that this is an obvious play they just recently had a $400 million partner extension an extension by the way is a lot more better than an initial contract guys because when you initially get a customer get a client it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of negotiation it takes a lot of cost right paler executives are trying to close a deal they have all these meetings and there's all these costs and time but to extend a contract it's like this right it's like when i do a good job with my 101 students are like henry i want to keep working with you i had a fantastic year let's have another year that's an extension that's way better than a new person because i already have a built relationship with them it's already easy from a coaching perspective for me right same thing for a company right they have success they sign a $400 million contract boom it's easy right that's easy money for palen here to just you know make a lot of money and a lot of money on the top top line this is actually by the way higher profit margin because when you have a $400 million extension more of that actually hits the bottom line so guys i'm pumped up i'm pumped up literally this is this is a really big deal uh and just understanding the application of paler ai it has so many vast ways of being applied we don't even you guys don't even understand i'm telling you this stuff actually blows my mind when i re research into paler and i look at aerospace when i look at defense i'm shocked because paler it's it's a company that i want to own you know we talked about this in a prior video when i look at the body language uh the ceo right alex carb his body language is not changing guys his body language is i'm confident i think you know he thinks it's going to go to the moon the best indicator of a stock doing well is the ceo speaking all right that's why i look at elon musk relationship with trump that's why i look at amd ceo which i'm going to talk about a little bit later and i when i look at palen here when i look at the body languages of alex scarp i'm telling you don't miss out and right now we have a really awesome opportunity like i'm telling you let me move here from from the sofi let me show you palante here let me show you how much of the stock i own and what i'm doing with it because you know this stock there you go a lot of people are like oh henry you're wrong this stock is going to $70 well in the same day it hit 80 so like listen take a chill pill relax we're going to make money don't panic like you just have to place some look you don't have to trust me just use common logic okay just use common logic right i don't even i just want you to make as much money as possible i'm clearly making money made $300,000 on paler every time you guys look at my paler position i'm profiting not just from the stock but from the options so i have this stock at an average cost of $21 i'm making a lot of money on paler and on the options themselves i had leap options in my other portfolio right now i see an opportunity to sell puts at $75 for january expiration and for march expiration diversify guys you can go for two different expirations ation dates always be selling options for income all right you can buy leap options which i've been saying but as we reach a market high i'm a little bit less enthusiastic i hope you understand me that we have already made so much money that the leaps that i currently have on pound or the leaps that i have on sofi and tesla i'm just holding i wouldn't necessarily put a whole lot more into buying strategies right now and it's not that i'm not a bull anymore i am but when you see a little bit of a market pullback and a little bit of volatility you do also have to take down your risk level okay it's like you're getting a warning sign you have to understand the warning sign is you know it doesn't mean that we've shifted course but it means take it easy a little bit use your mind and properly get into positions at a good price so i haven't been recommending selling puts for a little bit because i've been making insane amounts of money guys i'm i'm absolutely double retired now from from this market going up because you know we're made over 15% in a single month right and as you continue to scale that becomes like insane amounts of money for paler at $80 i'm still bullish i think the stock is heading towards $85 per share and i don't see any changes with with modern warfare stopping unfortunately i i continue to see a shift in cyber and ai driven strategies which paler positioned extremely well for and they're a leader and they're transforming how wars are are fought right and when it comes to ai driven strategies that's how wars are fought nowadays so you know like it or not i don't really like it the whole tension with the middle east and russia and ukraine but look the picture is clear palante is making money so you know it is what it is but i'm just telling you the facts we' seen folks like dan i say this is the messy of ai it is it is the messy of ai because you have the best ceo you have the best technology you have the best momentum like what are you hoping to get otherwise like we have nvidia we have um alover nvidia and tesla these are also very popular stocks it's hard to pick you should have all of these stocks in your portfolio so let's just get into the next one you know for pal here my my you know vision is pretty clear there my position is pretty clear let's go into tesla now tesla i've made a lot of money but tesla is also one of the most volatile stocks out there so at one point i made over 400k on tesla and just one of my portfolios uh now i'm i have 200k in this portfolio on a gain um you know i doubled my money here i have it at $218 per share a, shares and then my other portfolio i actually did sell a covered call all right i did sell a covered call i'm going to talk about why i sold a covered call and what i see happening for tesla for the end of 2025 essentially so i'm i'm going to try to hurry up right now i have a 475 covered call i sold this 475 for january for the short term because i think that tesla can bounce we can get a recovery but we're not going to we're not going to go above $ 475 doar per share in the next 30 days like that's plenty of room still so you know i'm up on the option itself and i'm also up on the stock i mean guys options is super beautiful cuz you know when i saw this stock pull back i said to myself like okay the momentum is a little bit broken at the moment there's a little bit of an interruption and i i want to make premium so i still see $500 per share in 2025 but i want to make some money in premium guys i want to collect some premium and i think now is a good time so i'm going to you know recommend that you guys take a look and obviously i'm not a financial adviser i'm just the guy who's made multiple seven figures almost going on eight figures almost on on option trading so i want you to understand that selling premium is wise right now since we did get an interruption i will also say that i'm still holding the 330 a leap option and i did get a lot of my one-on-one students that asked me you know is it time to basically close out and take a profit on my um actually i had a group call as well i do mondays and wednesdays group calls in my discord and essentially i said look it can't be time right now to take 50% reduction in your leap options if you made a lot of money cash out some chips off the table now is the time to cash out a bit you know i'm i'm going from becoming a mega mega bull where i made more money than anyone else on the youtube platform made more money and i recommended the best stock i've been on fire but you know let's be honest you know it the party can't continue forever so i'm going to just say i'm still bullish but i'm becoming a little bit down to neutral and i'm becoming a little bit more relaxed where we are in the market cycle so you know when it comes to taking some ships off the table if you're feeling nervous right now in this market which i don't blame you we see we do see some volatility um i'm going to show you some better plays in this video but when it comes to tesla take some profit off the table take some money off the 350 leap and you know do do like a 50% reduction guys you know that that's fine so in addition to that i think catching momentum right now is super important so we want to catch proper momentum and uh you know taking a look at tesla we've had a huge pullback but i think it's going to be business as usual as i said in the beginning of this video you know we're we're going to still be in a uptrend market so this week i expect the prices to stabilize and i think you know we you know i've shown you guys a clip yesterday about repricing okay when you see repricing in the market you know some folks say it's going to take a day to reprise some people say it's going to take a month and you know even the best investors say oh we're going to go into a bare market to crash listen let's be logical here let's be logical we're trying to make money let's not become bears okay that's that's stupid right what you want to do is we don't know if repricing will be a day or a week i personally think that we're going to have repricing just for one day i honestly think we're back to a bull market and we just saw that like we literally saw that everyone panicked and i got all these messages my my phone blew up because on my one-on-one coaching let everyone texted me so i had a whole difficult day on friday with a bunch of messages where i had to become like a therapist and that's fine that's that's i enjoy this right i want to help you but just being honest i think we're going to get a stabilization in the market and we're just back to business as usual so you know if i'm looking at tesla i would say i'm going to keep holding shares and when i looked at some of the data from the market like the personal consumption expenditures the pce as they call it right i looked at the pce report it's not a big deal we see a strong rally later on in the market because there was clearly an overreaction the numbers are pretty good this is proof of course by the way that um there's a lot of confusion in the market which is actually a good thing if you actually listen to what i'm saying i'm going to make you richer than you thought was possible because a lot of people they don't understand how to invest and this market right now has a lot of beginners which unfortunately are losing money because they're not trading properly if you trade properly you understand the setup you understand what price they get in it's honestly been the easiest time to make money money is super easy to be honest because there's a lot of people it's a very competitive game there's way too many people that don't have the proper information and there's so many channels now on youtube that the more channels are out there the more confusion there is in the market so i've actually noticed that i have had better results the more youtubers are you know selling their master classes and webinars and courses and boot camps and all this nonsense i actually see an improvement in results right now in trading itself because there's actually a lot of kind of dumb money in the market so i just want to point out that there's a lot of opportunity to make money right now and i think you can really scale your portfolio fast even though we see some volatility this is the best time to scale your portfolio and there's a very clear trajectory from you know folks that know what they're doing that they don't and for me i had just three mil not that long ago i'm at over four mil in one portfolio the other portfolio which i do keep private it is for my one-on-one students because i'm doing different types of strategies i'm doing more buying strategies i'm doing a little bit of margin trading and i already provide all the value that i need to for my discord so in my other portfolio i decide to take on a little bit more risk and it's been extremely easy to scale like like i had 2 mil in that and now it's like i've had even a bigger return than i have in my main portfolio so i want you to understand that this 3% pullback right is not a big deal and actually we're still going to be headed into a bull market when it comes to other stocks as well let me get into the other stock let me wrap it up with tesla hdle tesla keep holding tesla take some profits on your 330 and 350 leap call options which i recommended if you have shares then go ahead and sell the 475 covered call option collect some premium make some gains and you're good right next one is nvidia and let me be honest we found the floor we found a hard floor okay we found a floor that's made of wood and we're good we found crazy support on nvidia i am the most bullish on nvidia right now because i said sell 130 puts and that was a really good decision because we're hovering right around 130 let me show you the position right now i actually have a lot of nvidia shares in my other portfolio but then this portfolio but in this portfolio i just have three positions i did end up selling shares because i have to pay some taxes and actually withdrew money from my portfolio so my portfolio actually even more than the 4.2 mil that you see i just had to withdraw some money because i got to pay year end christmas bonuses and and pay for you know salaries and stuff like that for um the folks on my team coaches and my team that that supports me and allows me to deliver the best results in the world to my one-on-one you know clients that i'm helping trade options and i did have to sell my nvidia shares i don't currently have any shares in this portfolio i still have a lot of shares in the other this one i just have three option positions which i think is really important for you to understand i have let me i'll click into one of them but let me first cover the 129 cell putut 129 sellp put is easy 130 sellp put is easy this is easy money like look at the premium right here it's $400 which is well over 3% you can make over 3% in a month even in bare market bull market whatever nvidia has a hard floor it has a hard support just understand just take okay take a look at the three month chart we have a hard bounce we've had a hard bounce from 132 we have a hard bounce from 135 we have a even harder bounce from 128 this is not rocket science guys this is simple logic like nvidia has some of the best technicals i has some of the best fundamentals it's an ai play and i have two different debit spreads actually this is a poor man's covered call i'll briefly go into this you know this video is getting a little bit long so let me try to make it as fast as possible you know i do respect your time let's let's let's just say here i got the 120 call which i purchased and then i i sold the 150 uh short-term call so this is a leap option buy leap options on 120 on nvidia for september 19 expiration and then basically sell cover calls against it i think this is a no-brainer it has a very reasonable valuation and the floor is here this is the number one safe stock that i have in this market right now the rest of the market i'm bullish but this is safe this is i would say nvidia is my number number one safe stock probably next to amd which is the next stock i want to cover amd also has a hard floor so amd has fallen a lot and this stock has really strong support as well so just in general amd and nvidia are the top two plays and amd specifically they intend to provide some of the competition um for ai chips that the market really desperately wants right because right now nvidia is dominating and the pricing isn't the best for nvidia right why are they making so much money because it's a scarce resource and they're charging an arm and a leg for their graphics uh processing units right so they're charging an arm and a leg so the market really does really does need um some competition so amd i'm looking at it and this stock

2024-12-26,wpZdY0eR4WU,"kind: captions language: en we have the opportunity to make a ton of money on paler right now as paler reaches all-time highs record high over and over again paler is up 400% year to date in 2024 and going into 2025 you can absolutely take advantage of the stock using options to make a ton of money and in this video i'm going to keep it as short as possible i respect your time i'm going to reveal to you new information my updated price target on paler stock what i'm seeing in the market overall because obviously that's going to impact paler a lot so let's not waste any time here's a short summary if you don't have time you just want to enjoy the holidays with your family totally understand merry christmas and happy holidays here's a short summary i think small cap and midcap stocks are going to outperform in the market i'm pretty clear on that and also that's going to translate into the tech sector uh the tech sector is going to blow up in terms of ai having a really powerful year in 2025 as we skyrocket and compounding interest and compounding innovation hits more of palance here it's already innovating like crazy but this is going to become a mega cap stock 2025 will be the year of tech as well as cyclicals tech specifically um i think we're going to get a 25% return in 2025 but obviously the leap option that i'm going to recommend you in this video the leap option uh to be specific is 75 leap option this is not in the money as much as i usually recommend however i think this is really interesting opportunity for two reasons uh there's this interesting strategy it's called a synthetic long stock position tell you a little bit later but essentially 75 buy leaps 75 sell puts you can buy leaps for september 2025 and you can sell 75 puts for january or march expiration that's the summary if you need to bounce have fun with your family or just enjoy the holidays go for it all right and here is the longer summary before i jump into longer summary i just want to say that one quick mention i am running a webinar on january 9th this webinar will talk about the trump trade i'll also talk about option strategies and leaps for 2025 to double your money i think 2025 there's a lot of urgency to make a lot of money you can reach retirement literally in one year one year can change your life it has for me so during this webinar i going to uh talk about how to double up how to look at leaps uh everything there's going to be so much stuff there you can watch a six minute clip of of me actually explaining all of that in the first link in description hit the first link and you'll see you know little six minute video of me talking more about this webinar for january 9th okay it's going to be all the details will be on the page all right so let's jump into what's going on in the market real quick and then how that translates into palance here looking at the market it's kind of interesting because i see a lot of talk about animal spirits and i've been telling you guys momentum is in the market i've been telling you investor psychology is really important to understand and now in 2025 the animal spirits so to say will definitely push up the market 2025 i'm a bull i'm a perll i'm a mega bull and there's a lot of money on the sidelines that's going to enter the market in 2025 and we're going to continue to see market rally and momentum especially in this lower interest rate environment and all the cash on the sides it's pretty obvious and paler is going to be the top stock paler uh you know you guys know i have tesla nvidia but paler to be specific we just hit an alltime high it's pretty clear that we're going to hit another all-time high in next couple of weeks here if you're not invested you're you're just missing out all right i'm just being honest with you listen here's here's a quick 90c clip i want you to watch this about animal spirits it sounds funny like animal spirits you're like well who cares about spirits and animals i just want to make money henry well the thing is these animal spirits are just like another word for investor psychology momentum and what's going on with investors emotions and emotions are extremely important so watch this 9 clip on what you can expect when it comes to emotions because this is going to move the market i want to ask you about the animal spirits because i was reading in the producers notes that you believe they come back next year what species of animals come back uh and were they hibernating this year because we saw some species out in full force in 2024 so i'm curious which ones you think will be uh in full force in 2025 um thank the what i'm thinking about with animal spirits and it's milton fredman reference is the ism's been below 50 for almost 3 years meaning companies have been cautious their visibility hasn't been great but finally the fed is cutting and we have an incoming administration that's seen as very business friendly and so i think companies for for the first time in a long time are going to be expansionary feel confident doing mergers i think this is a very good environment for small caps midcaps the financials and cyclical broadly like in just so i i think it's going to feel a lot like the market broadens in 2025 um even as tech sort of keeps up with the market all right so what we saw there let me quickly recap is essentially we have tom lee who is a you know a market leader he's been right on so many plays and i really respect the man he has a very similar view to me and i think it's a pretty obvious view it's similar because it's obvious um i like to be very original and make unique content and have unique ideas because i believe that if you're using the same ideas as everyone else you're going to get the same results with everyone else and that's the defin of you know being average and i am not here to be average guys i'm here to be the absolute number one best i want to have the highest returns for the given level of risk that i take and i think pal here is going to be uh is that stock to do that all right so look i'm going to read off my research real quick here i'm going to go f as i can small midcap stocks are going to outperform in the market that's obvious to me because there's going to be a lot of mergers and acquisitions mergers and acquisitions i almost worked in mergers acquisitions but i did not want to work at goldman sachs a lot of people say you know couldn't work there i could work there for the rest of my life but i would be miserable i was coming to work 6:00 in the morning doing things that i don't really enjoy i just want to trade options so that's why i also left goldman sachs but it's pretty clear i was going to work in merges and acquisitions the way it works is companies that see synergies will buy other companies that they synergize with it's as simple as that okay bigger companies buy smaller companies because they are first of all buying competition and second of all they have synergy third of all they can fire people that's what synergy is you know you have one ceo buy another company that's the other ceo you can cut cost you don't need as many employees you have systems in place to scale operations it's pretty simple and um we're going to see a lot of that in 2025 i'm really excited about that because that's going to be huge opportunities in the market um and that's going to be a really big bullish event now i also think that tech stocks are going to do extremely well um because ai is is here and ai is super exciting just understanding ai in general you can just tell that it's just early innings and we've seen folks like dan ies say that you know we're 10: p.m. and the party goes until 4:00 a.m. uh guys we're going to be partying we're going to be making money and i'm not a big partyer i don't drink i don't do drugs i don't do any of that stuff guys i just hit the gym try to be a good person have fun eat i love eating and traveling so i'm in dubai for the holidays so look um when it comes to mergers this is going to be interesting for paler because paler is going to be gaining under the same laws they're not they're probably not going to buy anything in 2025 but when you have a hot market where you know there's mergers and acquisitions stock market is going up al is going to be a beneficiary because economies do the the economy doing well look means governments will have more money from tax dollars more projects to fund more wars etc you know that's kind of where a lot of tax dollars go healthcare wars and pal going to make money off of all that they're going to make money from healthcare they're going to make money from war this stock is going to go up because they're just making money they're making money hand over fist i've been saying bicep over tricep i got to work on my tricep a little bit but bicep over tricep guys we're getting big gains for 2025 and i'm telling you this is going to be a lifechanging year mark my words at the end of 2025 i'm already getting all these success stories for my students lawyers doctors engineers etc you know my spiel i'm getting a lot of high results but in 2025 i'm bullish we're going to continue to get richer all right and i look at alex karp his demeanor this man's like this okay when he talks he's like a champion all right he's like got i don't know he's got so much confidence and this gives me confidence guys it's all about confidence and that's kind of funny but something so simple like that you look at the ceo you know he knows what he's talking about so alex carp the volume is also really good on palance here and uh you know i do see some unusual option activity which i'm going to show you i just want to give you the full insight of how i feel how i think and the facts okay it's not about feelings feelings actually are important for the market because you guys are all feeling let me tell you many of you guys are making emotional decisions you're not putting money into certain stocks look at yourself around the hard mirror tell me do you know why you hold every single stock if you can't explain it to me you're doing it based on feel all right that's what i work with a lot of my clients on is understanding why we hold things asset allocation diversification you know my one-on-one coaching is full that's why i'm doing a webinar i'm just focusing on giving value through that for the next couple weeks until i open up more spots now look we have earnings in march all right earnings in march for paler means that right now we're going to get some upward you know we're going to have an upward slope where the stock continues to go up and hit alltime highs but once earnings hits it's going to hit all right it's going to hit like a freaking truck all right we're either going to get get some some big news that the stock is continuing to have record after record revenue profit innovation or the market could be disappointed i am in that first camp where i think p um palen here we're going to get alex harp that's going to hit us with the secret sauce he's going to hit us with the good news and um pretty obvious i i think it's a 90% chance that paler beats earnings mark my words we have a lot of time until earnings but i'm early i'm early you know people are going to talk about earnings a week before earnings i'm already thinking about earnings in the holiday season merry christmas to you and merry you know christmas to everyone happy holidays i'm thinking about making money i'm also very excited and thankful and blessed for what had god has given me and what i've been able to do for our community and if you're not subscribe please subscribe that's all i ask i don't need anything else have enough finances i have enough everything i just need health happiness you guys to be healthy and happy and cross all to make money that's it i don't really have any other goals other than that that's what life's about happiness health family rel relationships and just understanding like right now we're in christmas time and i'm just thinking how blessed i'm opportunity paler has been in 2024 and i don't think the blessings sto you know i think in 2025 around this time in the year i hope to be here on youtube telling you that we have had a 100% return and we have taken our portfolios from you know 100k to 200 maybe some of you guys will go from 100k to 300k with the leap strategies that i put out nothing is out of the question now nothing is out of the ordinary with this market okay i' put in a mill into tesla and i'm at 1.5 mil and it's been six weeks it's been seven weeks okay so it's not out of the question to get a 200 300% return in 2025 if it's a good time if it's a good year listen i'm a perable guys why am i per perable because i actually have an education and i understand finance on a deeper level and i worked at goldman sachs and i understand that the market's up like 86% of the time since like the the cold war or whatever since 1929 right the market's up 86% of the time so if you're a bearer and you're trying to time the market you are playing in the 14% of you know situations where it's just it's dumb all right don't be like michael bur don't predict 17 in the last two crashes i was like um always joke with with clients and and friends and and everyone that anyone who's bearish just hasn't been investing long enough just don't have enough experience i feel like the white hairs that i have right here have the experience that i have it's i'm a bull and i and i'm a bull because i'm logical if you're not a bull you're just not logical so you know we we've been waiting for a recession by the way for some time and i don't see any recession coming we've been waiting and we've been predicting oh market crash you guys see all the videos on youtube market crash or buy this and do this and oh my goodness you know what drives me nuts i see guys posting titles that says $25 in this stock or $50 in this stock or $100 into this stock will make you 25,000 h let's i don't know i'm trying to be a little bit realistic here guys p here is going to go up but a $10 is not going to become a million you got to be realistic and that's why i like to work with folks that have 50,000 plus in their portfolios because it's easier to scale big money like it's not it's not easy to scale smaller money look to wrap it up before i go into the option positions here you know sometimes just go into the option positions right away and i'm just testing out this theory of giving you guys a full picture of my thoughts and the psychology behind why i'm doing things because a lot of you guys ask why i'm doing things when i give you the trades up front people say well you're just giving me trades why are you doing it and then when i say why i'm doing it you're like you're not giving me trades so i'm just making it up i hope i'm respecting your time i hope you feel respected that i you know take this very seriously um maybe ram a little bit extra in this video but i just feel really blessed and happy and i want to share h how i'm thinking about you know holiday season going into 2025 so let me uh finish off this video with the actual trades let me type in pltr right now let's look at paler as a stock and let's talk about the two option positions that that i think are going to be really smart that i think are going to make a ton of money so i'm up 280% on palance here in this portfolio alan i bought it at $21 i've obviously traded it since ipo i have some covered calls which i had to roll up but overall holding shares and i have a lot of shares that are uncovered and what i'm thinking right now is i've been on the sidelines a little bit on adding my to two palance here a lot of it is because i just don't have any cash i just did clear up some buying power because january is going to be a big year and the webinar that i talked about i'm going to make a lot of trades and a lot of positions that are going to be new so i did clear up some cash um just because i see a lot of opportunities so as you can see $21 average cost 5,000 shares and now that i have some more cash available this is the trade that i'm going to do i'm going going to go to trade pound your options i didn't do this trade yet i'm going to open it up when the market opens up i think that during the holidays on the market just a little bit uh lower volume and um i don't really see a point of investing during this time but planning planning reason why i've been so successful actually is sometimes i take a whole week where i just walk around go to the beach and i think about ideas and one idea sometimes can make me a quar million $500,000 so that's why i try not to be too busy i try to be free and available so i can innovate and do things that no one else can because everyone's on that hamster wheel i'm trying to be innovative and for me that means that uh doing less is more so i'm going to look at buy call 75 here i'm telling you this right here is a genius play um it's better than holding paler stock because with paler stock you have to tie up $88,000 by having 100 shares here i'm tying up $2,300 and i get the same benefit i'm going for 75 it's even breaking some of my rules because i usually go oh actually it's not breaking my rules it's interesting because i usually go for a 70 delta and i thought this would be a little bit lower so that's how bullish the market is this option is barely in the money but the delta is still 70 so shoot i don't even have to break any rules in this video my intuition has has been on point so hopefully the audio was good there look the next thing that i'm going to do is i'm telling you selling puts is also no-brainer i would sell shortterm puts so you can sell puts for march 21st a lot of people ask me like why are you trading options that are three months out what are you going to do in the meantime well if you got $10,000 in a month or $30,000 in three months it's like the same thing so like i don't understand when people say like what are you going to do during the meantime well the whole point of investing for me is to create passive income which is why i don't really work with people who are like trying to swing trade or daye trade or do the zero dt options i mean i've made plenty of money by just selling puts covered calls going bull call spreads doing the wheel and i'm not really trading weekly i'm trading monthly but for selling puts on palance here you can go really simple and add to your position cuz obviously you guys already have a position most likely' been watching my videos i've only been talking about p here since ipo only since ipo it's been years so if you want to add more to the position you should add more by selling puts i don't know if i would buy more shares at 82 you know i'd rather just jump in and and get forced dollar cost averaging okay this is an interesting topic i'm going to reveal to you because i used to just cover this in my boot camp but i told a lot of my students that the reason why we sell puts is because selling puts is actually like back door to dollar cost averaging dollar cost averaging means that you're buying stock on a frequent basis at highs at lows over time right and you're putting in a consistent amount of money there and that's dollar cost averaging you can dollar cost average up or you can dollar cost average down both are fine right when it comes to selling puts you when you get a sign you're forced into buying so i'm forcing you to dollar cost average so that's like an invisible hand that i've been playing on you guys to make you richer which people don't realize is selling puts i'm forcing you to buy good stock good high quality stock for a cheaper price so it's a easy play march 2175 sell put do the trade get some entry into paler and and enjoy it's pretty simple that's it i'll stop rambling hope you guys have happy holidays merry christmas happy new year's and see you guys

knowing the strike prices knowing the expirations to pick how to manage the position from the very beginning of entry all the way to closing for a profit if you're not making a full-time income from option trading yet the answer is very simple i'm going to show you how to do so i have many students who just focus on selling puts in general and that's why i'm making this two-hour course because i think you don't need to have many strategies if you understand how to sell puts properly you can make a ton of money i have students who are making $5 to $8,000 per mon month with their strategy and they're in retirement they don't have to worry about volatility they don't have to worry about stock making they're using the strategy on some simple stocks and they're doing it every single month for consistent monthly cash flow so first if you're not familiar with what an option is buying and selling calls or puts and how options work watch my options for beginners full course it's a 4-hour course i'll pop it up on the corner of the screen right now and it goes over multiple different strategies and everything a beginner needs to know about option trading this course will foc focus more so on selling put options for beginners here on the screen now is everything that i'm going to be covering in this course there will also be timestamps in the description because i respect your time so if you want to go through the play bar and see what works for you and what you want to skip that's your business that's completely up to you my goal here is to give you all of the education and everything that i know and what i've learned working on wall street working at goldman sachs getting a finance degree and just transferring my knowledge and experience to you so you can be profitable and hopefully in return you share some of your wins with me and subscribe to the channel that'd be awesome first let's start with the basics before we dive into selling puts it's crucial to understand what put options are a put option is a contract that gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to sell a specific stock at a predetermined price called the strike price on or before a certain expiration date when you sell a put option you're on the other side of that transaction you're agreeing to potentially buy the stock if the buyer exercises their option to sell it to you at the strike price for example let's say a stock is currently trading at $50 and you sell a put option with a strike price of 45 the buyer of that option has the right to sell you 100 shares of the stock at $45 no matter where the stock price goes before the options expiration date if the stock price falls below 45 say to 40 the buyer might choose to exercise the option and you would be required to buy 100 shares at 45 no matter what even though the stock is trading for less that's the risk that you take i'll cover later to this course how to make the risk essentially zero how to make it almost a risk-free trade where you profit and you're happy every single time that you open a put position because selling put options is safer than stock trading and it's actually high income i'm going to show you a report of making 3.4% per month on average now let me explain to you how this works by the way this is an article that i have used back when i was at goldman and this article basically states i'm going to go over this most important part so selling puts is a higher yield and less riskier way than buying stocks so this is coming from goldman sachs not myself so over the past 10 years selling listed one month at the money puts in s&amp;p 500 stocks allowed investors to collect 3.4% per month in premiums and showed a 7.1% annualized return with a 12% stand deviation let me explain to you what all of this means and how i've been able to actually beat this return by a lot so so basically if you had invested in the s&amp;p 500 you would have made 7.3% with an 18% standard deviation however selling puts at 1 month actually had a 12% standard deviation so it was a lot lower risk in fact it was roughly 33% lower risk than holding stocks so selling puts is safer however the returns are not that appetizing but i found a way around that and how to make a lot more money put selling offers the same return as equities with lower draw down risk that means that during 2008 when the market went down over 30% put selling actually only went down 20% however you can see in this chart something that is actually unusual which is put selling under the s&amp;p 500 raw return that means the s&amp;p 500 usually performs better but selling puts is safer the way i've gone around this is by just not selling puts on s&amp;p 500 the reason why this is not a good strategy on s&amp;p 500 is because that's s&amp;p 500 has very very low volatility you'll see how later when i do single stock put selling i'll be making way more than 7% per year which is pretty ridiculous that's like nothing right i'm making around four or even 5% per month by selling puts but here's a twist if the stock goes lower and you have to get assigned as the seller of the put option you actually get paid a premium upf front for taking that obligation that premium is yours to keep regardless of what happens whether or not the buyer decid decides to sell the stock to you you've already collected the premium upfront and it's cash in your account so even if the stock falls below the strike price that premium provides a buffer to reduce your overall risk it reduces your overall average cost and if the stock stays above 45 and the option expires without being exercised well you still get to keep the premium and now you get to do it all over again you get to sell puts as often as you like as much capital as you have because when you do sell a put you should be cash secured you should have the cash available to buy 100 shares if it goes to the strike price we'll talk about managing that position from a to z in just a moment so why would anyone want to sell put options the key reason is the premium income selling put options is one of the few strategies in the stock market that allows you to generate income consistently without having to wait for the stock price to go up the premium income is immediate you receive it at the moment that you sell the option contract this means you can collect cash flow regularly almost like getting a paycheck from the market and whether you want to get a paycheck on a weekly basis on a bi-weekly basis on a monthly basis even i have some students that want to just get paid quarterly they just want to sit back collect a quarterly income and basically live their life in retirement i think that's beautiful you get to choose that you get to pick the expiration and i'll talk about best expiration selection later on in this course but it's not just about cash flow when you sell a put option you're essentially getting paid to agree to buy a stock at a price that you'd be happy with okay that's what it all comes down to if you're long-term investor who believes in the company's fundamentals this can be an excellent way to acquire shares at a discount check out this example right here so selling put options is absolutely genius and let me show you an example of how to do that so first of all as i'm making this course it is taking me a long time to do it and you can see here how my portfolio is almost at $4 million i've been trading super successfully i'm super proud of myself in the community for getting really good results now let me just show you what selling a put option looks like i have so many sellp put options okay and i have multiple different expiration days so what i like to do is i like to go for a highquality company so let's say that i want to sell a put option on nvidia so if i go to nvidia i'm going to show you what selling a put option looks like i've actually been selling put options on nvidia for a long time if you see different prices it is taking me multiple weeks to make this course so excuse me for the changes in the price all right so i have a sellp put at 130 a 129 cellp put and a 132 cellp put all of these options right here are making money actually $1,810 at this very moment so these put options right here are an example of me trying to get assigned the stock and actually being excited to own the stock but getting paid in the meantime to wait for a good entry price so i'm deciding that i want an entry price of around 130 or 129 or 132 so i am selling puts at this strike prices because i would like to get assigned and have nvidia so let me show you an example of how i would do that from scratch so i will go to trade nvidia options then i will go to sell put option so you want to sell a put option and the expiration that you want to usually choose as we've been talking about in the course can be anywhere from 30 days or 60 days or 90 days you do get paid in direct proportion to how much time is left on the option so you know let's go for example december 20th okay this is about 40 days or you know 30 days as i'm making this video so let's go to 148 let's go to sell put okay and then if i were to scroll down i'm going to be looking for for a delta of around 30 which is roughly my sweet spot right if i go to 138 perfect so i have a 30 delta here the volume is 649 and the open interest is 10,339 that is a very good open interest and the volume here is also very good now the bid ask spread is 515 and uh 530 that is pretty good because the difference here is $15 now the tighter it is the better because then you get a better fill rate you lose less money imagine if this was $5 and this was $10 that would be pretty bad because if you were to be selling this option you'd be losing a lot of money and if you'd be buying this option you would also be losing a lot of money because of the non-liquid options these are very liquid so this is perfect and i would go for a 138 sell put and collect $515 right here you can see how i would basically be making money as long as nvidia would stay above $132 85 now how come i only start losing money at this point since this option strikes is 138 well the way this actually works is you actually will be assigned at 138 if nvidia goes to 138 at expiration now before expiration you don't have to worry about assignment i'll cover that in a little bit but as long as it's above 138 you're good even if it's at 139 or 140 or one you know 138 and two cents it's okay as long as it's above you're good now if it's below and there's still time to expiration you're also still good you just want to make a judgment call do you want to close this position do you want to roll this position right and we'll get into that shortly so 138 is a the strike price okay but the reason why your break even is 13285 is because here you're collecting $515 or $5.15 per share and that's why you need to put that into account so you take the 138 and subtract the premium that you collect which gets you a break even price of 13285 as you just saw in the example it is genius to sell a put option because regard regardless of what the stock is trading at just like you saw it's going to look the same for basically every trade it's always going to be a lower average cost than the current stock price so let's use another broad example let's say you have a stock at 100 you sell a $100 put well you're always going to get paid for risk right so whatever that amount is let's say it's a dollar now your average cost is 99 right because you get paid a dollar when you sell a put so you're always getting a better price than someone that wants to just buy the stock right now someone buys it for $100 you're basically buying it for $99 because you're getting paid $1 so it's always advantageous to sell put options it's more advantagous than just buying the stock unless of course the stock explodes in value because a sellp put option is going to give you pretty much a steady income but it may not give you a huge income it might not get to 20% per month 30% per month no but it can provide you a very safe passive income for retirement where you can generate the income that you need for retirement whether that's $5,000 or $10,000 or whatever your goal income is per month you can achieve it by selling put options and you can just use this one strategy and achieve retirement that's right the worst case scenario is you know when you sell a put option you get assigned stock that you like because you should always be basically selling puts on stocks that you like i think it's crazy if you sell puts um chasing volatility and chasing premium that's a really big mistake i see that all the time i see a lot of my students well to be frank before they're my students they're chasing premium once i show them the math that when you make two three% per month and you compound that and you look at your yearly return say it's 30 40% per year you start to realize that these numbers really add up you can really make a sustainable living by just selling put options so i want you to understand that it's all about safety and consistency for me at least i'm being a little bit biased and this is a beginner's course but i still want to teach you the framework and my mindset because i think mindset makes a really big difference in trading so i want you to understand risk management i want you to really understand that what the worst case scenario is and how you can avoid the worst case scenario because i'm a safe investor so you're going to um when when you're selling put options you're going to be getting a stock that you like at a discount essentially you can think of selling puts as a safer version of buying regular stock it's superior in every way except when the stock shoots up you you won't be able to profit nearly as much as a regular stock holder but when the stock goes down or goes sideways you're going to be smiling a lot and you're going to be laughing all the way to the bank in literally 11 out of 12 months that's pretty much my results i win almost all the time some months can be bad but they're always better than the stockholder so even in the bad months i'm outperforming because when you sell a put option it's out of the money usually we'll talk about outs of the money and in the money options but for now think about out of the money as a safe zone if a stock is at 100 and your strike is at 95 it's above your strike you're in the safe zone well technically it's all the safe zone because you're happy to buy it but an out-of-the money option is simply when the strike is not currently in risk of being a signed okay so if you have a 95 sell put the stock's at 100 you're above 95 if the stock's at 98 you're still above 95 if it's at 94 well there's some chance of getting assigned you might get put some shares right the person who bought the put option they may decide to give the shares to you that usually doesn't happen early i'll explain why later in this video but it usually does not happen wor so you don't have to worry about early assignment it rarely ever happens actually let's talk about assignment real quick okay when you sell a put option there's a few different scenarios that can happen okay first scenario is when you sell a put option as long as it's out of the money say you sell a 78 put the stock's at 200 giving you a crazy example you got nothing to worry about it's going to expire out of the money the stock's at 150 you got nothing to worry about it's very far you got you know no chance of getting a signed right so that's the first scenario you're well in the green everything is calm and relaxed now the second scenario is that stock is very close to your strike price so say you have a 78 strike price and the stock is at 78 7801 7803 something very very close you guys start thinking about do you want to get a sign do you want to close the position pretty much i don't even worry about it because again i'm selling puts on stocks that i like so doesn't even matter if the stock price is below your strike price you're going to be assigned and that chance increases the closer you get to expiration so there's three four weeks out you really got nothing to worry about here's why now i want to show you how it would make no sense at all for early assignment to happen so this is the same nvidia option we're going to look at a sellp put example okay and i'm going to pick the 150 sellp put here okay so check it out let's say that you've sold a 150 put all right however now your option is in the money all right it's in the money so nvidia is below 150 you might be thinking to yourself oh i'm worried i'm worried that i'm going to get assigned but the chances of getting assigned before earnings before expiration is very low and let me explain to you how low it actually is so if if your stock is below 150 in this example think about it from the shoes of the buyer someone who bought the put option if you think about it they're 150 how much are they in the money well if they bought at 150 and the stocks at 148 74 they're up $125 correct because they're $125 in the money the stock is $125 below 150 so if they were to exercise they would basically save or make or have a value of about 125 but look at the option it's worth $10.55 so it would make absolutely no sense whatsoever for someone to want $125 when they can just trade the option for $10.55 cents this is very clear and very obvious right it's a very big discrepancy but let me show you something even shorter term even when there's like a couple days left even this option right here it's super super close and the discrepancy is going to be very little however even when there's a few days left the chance of getting a sign they still near zero in this example 149 were a little bit in the money the option is still $3.40 and this would only be in the money by 25 so this would still not make any sense at all for someone to want to exercise early all right so we talked about why early assignment usually doesn't happen i want you to understand you will still make money even if you get assigned this strategy is not about being greedy because chasing huge price movements is only going to backfire in the long run now i want you to understand even if the stock price never drops to the strike price you still pocket the premium for your efforts it's a win-win scenario when you execute correctly executing correctly is actually the easiest thing when you sell a put option because as long as you're doing it on a high quality stock you're going to be in good shape let's talk talk about how to maximize your succcess with this strategy okay i'm going to tell you all the different things that you need to be aware of there are three critical decisions that you're going to need to make every time you sell a put option number one choose the strike price select the expiration date and understand the premium you're going to get paid let's break each one of those down the strike price is the price at which you agree to buy the stock if the option is exercised ideally you want to pick a strike price that's lower than the current market price of the stock the reason for this is simple if the stock drops you'll be willing to buy it at a discount again even if you sell a put option at the same exact price as the stock you're still technically getting a discount because you're collecting income but it's even better when you can find a sweet spot and sell a put option that's already out of the money and you get paid so now the stock falls 2% and you're completely unaffected you've collected 1% income for the week let's say stock falls down 2% and you're like i don't really care it's still out of the money it still has not reached my strike price so for example if a stock is trading at 50 and you sell a put option with a strike price of 45 and think about it you're getting a $5 buffer which is amazing that means if the stock falls from 50 to 48 everyone has lost $2 you're still unaffected let me finish you the point on why the stock option might be showing you a loss even though it's still out of the money because a lot of people get confused if the option is out of the money how can the option itself be showing a loss well that's because the chances again of that option have increased and they've gotten higher for the option to get into the money and since the option has increased in risk it's closer to the strike price the value has gone up okay let me explain to you and this is what i do in my coaching program i give analogies okay so imagine that you can invest in people pretend that somebody is going to be a doctor and a doctor makes $300,000 per year so if you were to be able to buy a person which you can't but let's just say you were able to bet on that person 's income you know they're going to make $300,000 say it's going to happen for 10 years now you know that right so you you'll bet you know $300,000 now if you were to have an option on this okay and that person has good grades and they're continuing to be at in med school and becoming a doctor you'd be comfortable right nothing changes however now let's say something bad happened let's say that person got into an accident or they started smoking and drinking and skipping classes and getting bad grades you would probably rethink your option a little bit right that person he or she is still in medical school they're still going to be a doctor most likely but the chances of becoming a doctor have gone down so your risk has gone up right because that person has got in bad habits the same thing happens with an option when the option gets closer to the strike price it's becoming more risky doesn't mean that things are going to be bad it just means at this moment in time it is a loss for you to buy it back the good news is you don't have to you don't have to buy it back because when we sell a put option it's not a single person we're betting on right a person is very risky right a person even a good student might have an issue or an accident or change of of behavior let's say but a company a solid company a high quality company an apple or google right these are strong businesses with brands lots of employees a long track record big market caps big brand big cash flows strong profit margins if you pick companies like this then you could be very sure for yourself that hey even if you get assigned that it's fine you're happy to get assigned you're like sure apple was at 200 now i get to buy it at 170 i'm happy to buy it at 170 170 might not even happen if it happen you get to buy it that's the beauty of selling puts you have a lot of control and you put yourself in a win-win situation next i want to talk about expiration date every option has a specific expiration date and this is the date by which the buyer has to decide whether to exercise the option or to let it expire the expiration date is important because it affects the premium that you receive shorter term options like one or two weeks out will offer lower premiums but you'll know that outcome of the trade more quickly longer term options like 30 to 45 days out will offer higher premiums but your capital will be tied up for a longer period of time many experienced traders prefer selling options with an expiration date of around 30 to 45 days some of my students like more weekly income so they go for 5 to 7 days this strikes a balance between collecting a decent premium and not having your money tied up for too long keep in mind there's a lot of flexibility with options so you can sell onee options two we options and monthly options nothing stopping you because selling options in general from my research working at goldman sachs i found that selling options has been extremely profitable it doesn't really matter what expiration date you go in my opinion 1 to 12 weeks is perfectly fine options decay in value as they approach expiration so a onewe option has more uh decay and it's decaying faster than a one-month option for that reason you could make a point that weekly options are slightly better than monthly options but they are more work and the compensated amount of money that you make is very minimal let me show you an example right now weekly income versus monthly income this is a big debate within my discord community and many folks like to go for weekly income because it's more attractive and they like the frequency of it however i want to argue the point that weekly income and monthly income are very very sim similar so if i go to sell put for apple and i go for something that's going to expire in roughly a week and i go for the 225 strike here so this would get you $126 okay that would be one week but if we go for a one month option okay and we still go for the 225 option is going to be $370 so the fact of the matter is weekly option trading is a little bit more profitable you can say because this is 370 okay and and before we were looking at an option that was going for 126 well 126 * 4 is going to be about $500 so in a week you can make let's say about $500 but in a month you can make about $370 however let me tell you this that if you're doing short-term options a you have to do a whole lot more work b in a week a lot more can happen whereas in a month the stock will stabilize a bit more so the reason why you get paid a little bit more on a weekly basis is because there's more risk and there's more work to do with managing the position however on a monthly basis you get paid less but you lock it in at a much safer rate okay so there's actually a discrepancy here weekly income is more attractive in terms of returns by a little bit but investing in monthly income is safer and more passive and on a long-term basis i have not found there to be that much difference between weekly trading versus monthly trading although i will admit weekly trading is slightly more profitable but i would say that the returns of weekly trading are only about .1 to .5% more per month so if you think about it yes you can squeeze out an extra 5% per year if you're selling weekly options however the risks are going to be higher you're going to have more variance it's a lot more work and it's a lot less passive and it's more active trading finally let's talk about premium the payment you receive for sell selling options and selling put options to be specific the amount of premium depends on several factors including the current price of the stock the strike price the time until expiration and the stock's volatility volatility is a key factor the more volatile a stock is the higher the premium you can collect because the risk of the stock price moving significantly is greater and you get compensated for that risk it can be very awesome being an option seller it is very awesome but keep in mind that with higher volatility comes higher risk risk as the stock price is more likely to drop and cause you to be assigned on the shares again if you don't mind getting assigned that's fine if you're selling puts on stocks that you do mind getting assigned you really shouldn't be but it can be very lucrative to chase higher premiums and higher volatility because that's more money in your pocket now that you understand the mechanics let's dive into a strategy that you can use to consistently generate income from selling puts this strategy is straightforward but it's highly effective especially if you stick to it over time step one is picking the right stocks you don't want to sell put options on just any stock that is the biggest mistake the key is to focus on highquality companies that you'd be happy to own if you're assigned shares look for companies with strong fundamentals solid earnings and a long record of stability these are typically large well-established companies with strong balance sheets think of apple microsoft johnson and johnson google i mentioned some of these stocks already but it is imperative that you just stick to top s&amp;p 500 stocks if you want consistent cash flow and you want retirement income otherwise you're going to experience more volatility it's also less beneficial to sell put options on smaller cap companies because they have less liquidity in their options they have worse bitas prices they have worse volume they have a lot worse conditions for a put seller step two is choosing conservative strip prices the strike price is critical because it determines your risk level i'll be honest if you go for higher you know deltas you're going to be a signed more often and that gives you less margin of safety the more conservative your strike price the less likely it is that the option will be exercised and at the end of the day less chance of being exercised even if you pick high quality companies less chance of being exercised is still going to be lower risk but the lower premium that you're going to collect so it is a direct tradeoff some my students ask why don't we just sell options and sell puts that have a two or five delta very low chances of things happening is cool very low risk but it's also very low return and you probably want to balance your return and i would say very low returns are just not that attractive why would you be selling options looking for small income you should be looking for big income big consistent income so a good rule of thumb is to choose strike prices that are typically 5% or maybe 10% below the current stock price and that's why i like to look at options that are 30 delta when i show you the research later on in this video you will see that i go for 30 delta because it gives you the best mix of both return and low risk and this is where delta is very important because delta helps you accurately choose a proper strike price and manage your risk very effectively and delta is going to be something i'm going to cover in great detail later in this course going out of the money gives you a cushion and in case the stock drops but also make sure that you're not taking in too much risk step three is to keep the expiration date short options that expire in 30 to 45 days offer a sweet spot for premium collection lower risk and not that much work as much as weekly options are they provide enough time for you to earn a decent premium without tying up your capital for too long shorter term puts honestly plus these options reduce the likelihood of major market events so it is really beneficial to go shorter term in many ways but a one-month option is honestly also considered shortterm but selling weekly puts is even better in many ways better because you get a lot of feedback and in one week usually not that much happens so when you sell weekly put options you get to see your results you get to count your money every single week so it can be really fun but for me as someone who is retired and working with other folks that are trying to get to retirement i do like to go to one month it's a little bit lower on the income a little bit but it's just way more consistent and it's way easier to just manage the beauty of this strategy is that it can be done repeatedly once the option contract expires whether it's exercised or not you can simply sell another put and collect another premium this creates a cycle of consistent income generation even if you're eventually assigned the shares you can still sell covered calls on the stock to generate even more in come a strategy will save for another video now let's address a common concern what happens if the stock drops significantly and you're assigned to shares this is where risk management comes into play first if you've chosen high quality companies that you believe in for the long term owning the stock at a discount shouldn't be a problem in fact it can be a great opportunity to buy a stock that you love at a lower price what if the stock drops much lower than the strike price here's where the premium you collect upfront provides a cushion or a margin of safety for example if you sold a put with a strike price of$ 45 and collected a $200 premium your actual cost basis for this stock is $43 per share this means the stock would have to fall below 43",AAPL;GS;JNJ;MSFT;NVDA,AAPL:OPEN;NVDA:DECREASE;JNJ:OPEN;MSFT:OPEN;GS:DECREASE,AAPL:OPEN;NVDA:DECREASE;JNJ:OPEN;MSFT:INCREASE;GS:DECREASE,ABNB:0.0076;ACGL:0.0000;ADBE:0.0670;BLK:0.0001;GS:0.2997;HPQ:0.0010;INTC:0.0236;KHC:0.0000;NFLX:0.0000;NVDA:0.2997;PLTR:0.0000;PYPL:0.0000;SBUX:0.0004;SMCI:0.0000;TGT:0.0005;TSLA:0.2997;WMT:0.0005,AAPL:0.1892;ABNB:0.0015;ACGL:0.0000;ADBE:0.0130;BLK:0.0000;GS:0.1737;HPQ:0.0002;INTC:0.0046;JNJ:0.1892;MSFT:0.1892;NVDA:0.1809;PLTR:0.0000;SBUX:0.0001;SMCI:0.0000;TGT:0.0001;TSLA:0.0582;WMT:0.0001,AAPL:0.0041;ABNB:0.0144;ACGL:0.0003;ADBE:0.0770;AVGO:0.0770;BAC:0.0144;BLK:0.0007;GOOG:0.0144;GS:0.2177;HPQ:0.0041;INTC:0.0407;KHC:0.0000;MCD:0.0041;MS:0.0770;MSFT:0.0144;NFLX:0.0000;NVDA:0.2177;PLTR:0.0001;PYPL:0.0001;SBUX:0.0013;SCHW:0.0001;SMCI:0.0001;TGT:0.0013;TSLA:0.2177;WMT:0.0013,AAPL:0.1470;ABNB:0.0070;ACGL:0.0002;ADBE:0.0373;AVGO:0.0373;BAC:0.0070;BLK:0.0003;GOOG:0.0070;GS:0.1470;HPQ:0.0020;INTC:0.0198;JNJ:0.1470;KHC:0.0000;MCD:0.0020;MS:0.0373;MSFT:0.1470;NFLX:0.0000;NVDA:0.1470;PLTR:0.0000;PYPL:0.0000;SBUX:0.0006;SCHW:0.0000;SMCI:0.0000;TGT:0.0006;TSLA:0.1056;WMT:0.0006,1.0756327540236073,1.0459768329282035,0.07563275402360725,0.04597683292820354
