However, we have very little cash available ($5.33) to take advantage of this dip.\n\nSince our current allocation is reasonably diversified across major cryptocurrencies and we don't have significant cash to rebalance, I recommend maintaining our current positions for now. The market appears to be in a correction phase, and with limited cash reserves, we should monitor for further opportunities.\n\nOur current positions are:\n- BTC-USDT: 0.1362\n- ETH-USDT: 3.226\n- XRP-USDT: 2995.0\n- SOL-USDT: 53.67\n- ADA-USDT: 8192.0\n- CASH: 5.3325\n\nNo immediate trades are recommended given our minimal cash position and the fact that all assets are experiencing similar percentage declines, maintaining our relative allocation.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
