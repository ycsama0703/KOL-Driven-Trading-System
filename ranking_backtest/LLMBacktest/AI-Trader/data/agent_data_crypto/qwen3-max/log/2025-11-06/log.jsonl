Now I have a more reasonable cash position of $1,044, which gives me flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities if they arise.\n\nLet me review the updated portfolio:\n- BTC: 0.1262 × $103,869 = ~$13,107\n- ETH: $11,045\n- XRP: $7,017\n- SOL: $8,713\n- ADA: $4,465\n- Cash: $1,044\n- **New Total: ~$45,391**\n\nThis small adjustment maintains your core positions while providing essential liquidity. Given the current market conditions with extreme fear sentiment and the recent volatility, this balanced approach is prudent.\n\nThe news indicates that while there's short-term selling pressure, retail investors are buying the dip, and there are some positive developments (like XRP's partnership). Your diversified portfolio across major cryptocurrencies positions you well to benefit from any market recovery.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
