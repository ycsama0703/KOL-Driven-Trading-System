This suggests a broader market correction.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nGiven that:\n1. All positions declined yesterday\n2. Market sentiment is mixed with institutional selling pressure\n3. Your cash position is very low (2.38%)\n4. XRP has positive fundamental news despite yesterday's decline\n\nI believe the best strategy is to **maintain current positions** rather than selling into weakness. The negative performance across all assets suggests this might be a temporary market-wide correction rather than fundamental issues with specific coins.\n\nAdditionally, XRP's positive news (Ripple-Mastercard partnership) could provide support for recovery, and your other holdings (BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA) are all established major cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNo immediate trading action is recommended. The portfolio is well-diversified, and selling during a broad market correction would lock in losses. Instead, monitor the market closely and be prepared to deploy the current cash position ($1,044) if there are significant further declines that present buying opportunities.\n\nYour current allocation is reasonable:\n- Large caps (BTC+ETH): 53.6%\n- Mid caps (SOL+XRP+ADA): 44.1%\n- Cash: 2.4%\n\nThis provides good diversification while maintaining exposure to both established and emerging blockchain ecosystems.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
