The portfolio is currently heavily weighted toward BTC and ETH (56% combined), with minimal cash position.\n\nHowever, looking at the current holdings, I notice that I have positions in several major cryptocurrencies but no exposure to some other key assets like LINK, AVAX, DOT, LTC, or SUI. Given the market downturn, this could be an opportunity to diversify.\n\nBut with only $5.33 in cash, I cannot make any significant purchases without selling some existing positions first. Given that the market is in extreme fear territory, selling now would likely lock in losses at unfavorable prices.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the minimal cash position ($5.33) and the current market being in extreme fear territory (which historically has been a good buying opportunity), the optimal strategy would be to maintain current positions and wait for either:\n1. Additional cash inflow, or\n2. A clearer market bottom signal\n\nSince I cannot make meaningful trades with the current cash position, and selling in a panic market would be counterproductive, I should hold all current positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
