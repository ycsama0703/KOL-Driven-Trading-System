However, I notice I have very little cash ($5.33) which limits flexibility.\n\nLet me consider if I should make any adjustments. The portfolio is heavily weighted toward large caps (BTC + ETH = 54.8%), which is conservative and appropriate given the current market conditions. SOL and XRP provide good altcoin exposure.\n\nSince all positions are only slightly down and market news is generally positive, I'll maintain the current positions. The minimal cash position isn't concerning given the strong performance of the holdings.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
