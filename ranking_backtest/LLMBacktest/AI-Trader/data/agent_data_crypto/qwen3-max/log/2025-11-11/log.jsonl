However, I notice there's potential to add exposure to some promising altcoins that aren't currently in the portfolio (like SUI, LINK, AVAX) but with the current low cash balance, I would need to sell some existing positions to do so.\n\nGiven the positive momentum in the current holdings and lack of compelling reasons to reallocate, I'll maintain the current positions for now.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
