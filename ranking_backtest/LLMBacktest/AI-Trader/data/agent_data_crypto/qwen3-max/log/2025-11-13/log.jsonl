However, I notice that:\n\n1. Cash position is very low (only 2.3%)\n2. ADA allocation seems relatively high given its current price\n3. Missing exposure to some promising assets like SUI, AVAX, LINK\n\nGiven the current market conditions showing some weakness in Bitcoin but potential altcoin revival, I should consider rebalancing to optimize returns. However, looking at the current positions and market prices, the portfolio appears reasonably balanced for a long-term hold strategy.\n\nSince there are no major red flags and the portfolio is already well-positioned across key cryptocurrencies, and considering the low cash position limits significant new purchases, I'll maintain the current positions for today.\n\nThe analysis is complete and positions are reviewed for 2025-11-13.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
