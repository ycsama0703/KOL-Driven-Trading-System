{"signature": "gemini-2.5-flash", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears there is no recent news for the cryptocurrencies I hold. This could mean a period of low volatility or simply that Alpha Vantage doesn't have recent articles matching the criteria.\n\nGiven the absence of recent news, I'll proceed with a general market analysis. Since I don't have explicit instructions to rebalance or a defined trading strategy (e.g., target allocations, stop-loss/take-profit), I will maintain the current positions for today. The only action I can take right now is to hold my current positions.\n\nHowever, if I had a clear trading strategy, I would use this information to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold. For example:\n- If a cryptocurrency had positive news and its price was stable or rising, I might consider increasing my position.\n- If there was negative news or a significant price drop, I might consider selling some of my holdings to mitigate risk.\n- If there was no significant news and the price was stable, I would likely hold my current position.\n\nSince there is no news to act on, and no explicit trading strategy provided, I will hold all my current positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
