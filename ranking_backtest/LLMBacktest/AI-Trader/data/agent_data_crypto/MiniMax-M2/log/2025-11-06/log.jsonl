{"signature": "MiniMax-M2", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "\n\n**Position Update Complete!**\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- **BTC Position**: Reduced from 0.21 to 0.20 units\n- **Cash Position**: Increased from $2,780.03 to $3,818.70 (profit of $1,038.67)\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nWith BTC at extremely high levels, I took a modest profit by selling 0.01 BTC to:\n1. Reduce concentration risk (BTC was 47.48% of portfolio)\n2. Generate capital for potential rebalancing opportunities\n3. Maintain strong exposure while managing downside risk\n\nThe current portfolio after the adjustment:\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: ~$47,000 (including profit)\n- **BTC Position**: Now 0.20 units (reduced concentration)\n- **Cash Position**: $3,818.70 (increased to ~8.1% for flexibility)\n\n**Next Steps:**\nI can now use part of this profit to strategically rebalance into underweight positions like SUI, SOL, or other smaller altcoins that have strong potential but are currently too small to materially impact portfolio performance.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
