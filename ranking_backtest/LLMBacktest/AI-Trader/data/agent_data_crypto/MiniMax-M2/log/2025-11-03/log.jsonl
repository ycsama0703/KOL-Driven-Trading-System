The lack of significant volatility suggests a consolidation phase.\n\n**Strategy Decision:**\nGiven the mixed but mostly stable performance, I'll make minimal adjustments today. The portfolio is well-diversified across major cryptocurrencies. I'll hold current positions and wait for clearer market signals before making significant changes.\n\n**Recommendation: Hold Current Positions**\n\nThe portfolio shows good diversification and the losses are within normal daily volatility ranges. No immediate rebalancing is required.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
