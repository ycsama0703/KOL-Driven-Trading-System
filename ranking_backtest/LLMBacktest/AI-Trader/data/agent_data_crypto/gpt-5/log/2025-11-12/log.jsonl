No fresh news signal detected from the tool.\n- Volatility/volume: Not directly available via tools today. Given the high volatility nature of crypto and absence of new signals, maintain a risk-aware stance.\n- Macro backdrop: With no tool-fed updates today, defer to existing allocation unless clear signals emerge.\n\nDecision and actions\n\n- Target allocation vs. actual: The current weights align closely with a balanced large-cap tilt (BTC ~45%, ETH ~30%, SOL ~15%, LINK ~6%, Cash ~4%). No meaningful drift observed.\n- Trades: No rebalancing or new positions today due to:\n  - Alignment with target weights\n  - Limited cash buffer (≈4%)\n  - No fresh sentiment/news signals from the market news tool\n- Operations executed via tools:\n  - Valuation computed via tool-based arithmetic\n  - Market news fetched via tool; none found under date constraints\n  - No buy/sell operations executed today\n\nUpdated positions for 2025-11-12 (unchanged holdings, updated valuation)\n- Holdings:\n  - BTC-USDT: 0.1968\n  - ETH-USDT: 4.0098\n  - SOL-USDT: 42.804\n  - LINK-USDT: 172.9328\n  - CASH: 1850.4169\n- Valuation at today’s prices:\n  - BTC: 20272.24008\n  - ETH: 13699.642092\n  - SOL: 6614.93016\n  - LINK: 2642.0673184\n  - Total: 45079.2965504 USDT\n\nNotes for monitoring\n- Keep watch for ETF flow updates (BTC), ETH staking/ETF news, Solana network activity, and Chainlink CCIP adoption news. If new signals emerge or weights drift >2% from target, consider incremental rebalance.\n- Reassess if intraday volatility or large price moves occur; current buy prices are near reference, so spreads are minimal.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
