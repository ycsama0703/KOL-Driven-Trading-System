Deviations are small and do not warrant trading given potential slippage/fees and minimal benefit.\n- Action: No trades today. Positions remain unchanged; valuations are updated as above.\n- Rationale: With no strong sentiment or macro signal and allocations near targets, holding avoids unnecessary turnover while preserving cash for opportunistic entries on volatility.\n\nNext steps:\n- Continue monitoring price action, funding rates, and any ETF flow or protocol upgrade headlines.\n- If any asset deviates >2–3% from target weights or a strong catalyst emerges, consider a small rebalance.\n\nUpdated positions for 2025-11-05 (unchanged holdings, updated valuation):\n- BTC-USDT: 0.1825 (value ~18517.94)\n- ETH-USDT: 3.8878 (value ~12776.13)\n- SOL-USDT: 54.5 (value ~8446.96)\n- LINK-USDT: 138.6 (value ~2035.48)\n- CASH: 2347.8662\n- Total portfolio value: ~44124.37 USDT\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
