Cash Position: $0.79 (very minimal)\n\nPortfolio Distribution:\n- BTC-USDT: $18,008.30 (38.8%)\n- ETH-USDT: $10,556.44 (22.8%)\n- SOL-USDT: $4,513.81 (9.7%)\n- LTC-USDT: $3,019.14 (6.5%)\n- XRP-USDT: $2,306.78 (5.0%)\n- AVAX-USDT: $2,223.44 (4.8%)\n- DOT-USDT: $2,177.52 (4.7%)\n- ADA-USDT: $1,353.76 (2.9%)\n- LINK-USDT: $1,334.07 (2.9%)\n- SUI-USDT: $864.99 (1.9%)\n- Cash: $0.79 (0.0%)\n\nYour portfolio is heavily weighted toward Bitcoin and Ethereum, which together make up over 60% of your holdings. This is generally considered a sound strategy as these are the most established cryptocurrencies with the largest market caps.\n\nSince your cash position is extremely low, any portfolio rebalancing would require selling some of your current holdings. Given the limited information about market trends and the lack of news data, I recommend maintaining your current positions for now.\n\nIf you'd like to make any specific adjustments to your portfolio allocation, please let me know, and I can execute the necessary trades.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
