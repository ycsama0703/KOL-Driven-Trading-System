This could be done incrementally to manage market impact and tax considerations.\n- A phased approach could target moving AOXUM toward a mid single-digit to low double-digit weight over several weeks, while trimming one or two other positions by modest amounts.\n\nExample potential path (high-level, not executed here)\n- Phase 1 (small, intraday-friendly adjustments): Sell a small amount from YDQMA (e.g., 1–2 shares) and/or XPMAP (1 share) to generate cash; use cash to start increasing AOXUM (e.g., 5–10 shares). This would modestly reduce concentration in the top positions while lifting AOXUM’s weight.\n- Phase 2: If AOXUM’s weight increases toward a more balanced level, continue incremental rebalancing by shifting a bit more from other overweighted holdings into AOXUM or other underweight candidates as desired.\n\nIf you’d like, I can execute a specific rebalancing plan (buy/sell) now, using a staged approach and keeping in mind any constraints (lot-size, T+1 if applicable, etc.). Please tell me your preferred target weight for AOXUM and any other constraints, and I’ll implement the plan. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
