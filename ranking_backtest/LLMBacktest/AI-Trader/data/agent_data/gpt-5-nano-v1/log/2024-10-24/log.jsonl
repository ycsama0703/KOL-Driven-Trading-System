If you’re aiming for a more diversified risk profile, you might target a 8–12% cap per single position and rebalance some weight into smaller holdings or cash.\n- If you’re comfortable with current concentrations, you could consider a minor rebalancing toward the other mid/low-weight holdings to maintain a broader spread.\n\nEnd of update.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
