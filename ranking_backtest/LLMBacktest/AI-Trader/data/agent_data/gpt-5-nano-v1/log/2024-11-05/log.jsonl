If YVDEP truly wasn’t in your long book yesterday, its presence today should be ignored for weight calculations unless you confirm a new position.\n\n Short-term risk/return considerations\n- MOUGQ and PCZVU are the new largest weights; ensure they fit your risk tolerance and beta exposure.\n- The cash buffer (~4%) is light for execution in volatile markets; consider increasing liquidity if you expect more turnover in the near term.\n\n Proposed next steps (optional, I can execute if you want)\n- Rebalance toward a target weight set (for example, 20% MOUGQ, 18% PCZVU, 15% XPMAP, 15% YDQMA, 15% GCMLF, 5-10% XJFOC, 5-10% KRZIZ) to improve diversification and reduce single-name risk.\n- If you prefer a more tactical approach, tier the portfolio into a core (top 4-5 positions) and a satellite (2-3 smaller bets) and adjust weekly.\n- Consider trimming MOUGQ or PCZVU back toward 15-18% each if you want to reduce concentration while keeping gains intact, especially if RSI/price momentum shows signs of peaking.\n\nWould you like me to implement a rebalancing pass toward specific target weights, or run a scenario (e.g., 2 weight-sets: conservative vs. growth) and show the impact on value and risk?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
