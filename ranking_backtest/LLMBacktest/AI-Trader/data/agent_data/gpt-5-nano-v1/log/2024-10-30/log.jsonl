MOUGQ also looks relatively strong on momentum, but is currently only ~4% of value.\n- Possible trades (conceptual):\n  - Buy a limited number of YITTJ shares (e.g., 1–2) at 516.56, funded by trimming 1–2 shares of KRZIZ or GCMLF, or from MOUGQ if you’re comfortable reweighting.\n- This would tilt the portfolio toward higher-beta momentum names and reduce concentration in a few mid-weight names.\n\nOperational notes\n- All numbers above are based on today’s prices (current_buying_price) and the post-trade holdings you provided.\n- If you want me to execute any of the rebalancing scenarios, specify the target approach (e.g., “rebalance to equal-weight across eight positions, execute with minimal market impact” or “increase YITTJ exposure by 2 shares funded by trimming KRZIZ by 1 share”). I can then place the necessary buy/sell orders.\n\nNext steps and options\n- Do you want me to proceed with a formal rebalancing to equal weights across the eight equity positions, or would you prefer a momentum-weighted tilt (e.g., add YITTJ and reduce KRZIZ/GCMLF slightly)?\n- If you’d like, I can also:\n  - Run a quick sensitivity analysis on how small changes in prices would affect weights.\n  - Propose a stop-loss or profit-taking plan per asset based on recent price ranges.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
