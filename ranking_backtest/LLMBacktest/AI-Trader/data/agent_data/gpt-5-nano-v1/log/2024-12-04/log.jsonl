Other core holdings (XPMAP, PCZVU, MOUGQ) are in the 16–18% range. AOXUM is a small 3% cash-heavy position.\n- If you aim for a more balanced risk profile, you could consider gradual rebalancing over the next days (e.g., modestly trimming YDQMA and GCMLF while building XPMAP/PCZVU/MOUGQ a bit more, adjusting AOXUM only if you want higher liquidity in micro-cap bets).\n\nSuggested next steps (optional)\n- Monitor price action over the next 1–2 days to confirm whether the intraday drift supports rebalancing, otherwise keep to a steady, incremental reweighting plan.\n- If you want a targeted weight framework, we can set explicit dollar targets for each stock and automate trailing adjustments.\n\nIf you’d like, I can draft a rule-based rebalance plan (e.g., +/- 2–3% bands or fixed dollar targets) and simulate how it would affect allocations over the next few days.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
