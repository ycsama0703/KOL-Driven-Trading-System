With 8 names, a rough equal-weight target would be about 12.5% each, which would imply modest buys in some names and trims in others.\n- Alternatively, maintain the current tilt if you have a view on MOUGQ strength; you could allocate a portion of the cash to modestly boost smaller positions (e.g., XPMAP, PCZVU) to diversify risk.\n\nIf you’d like, I can place a rebalance plan or execute specific trades to reach a target allocation. Just specify the targets (e.g., equal-weighted across the eight names or a custom mix), and I’ll implement. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
