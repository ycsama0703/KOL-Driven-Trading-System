No single name dominates, which is good for diversification.\n- Cash reserve: 4.2% cash is modest; if you want tighter risk control or more flexibility for rebalances, you could consider boosting cash to 5–7% or more during consolidations.\n- Signals glance:\n  - GCMLF is modestly positive on MACD with RSI around 51, suggesting room to run if the trend remains constructive.\n  - MOUGQ shows a weak momentum signal (MACD negative histogram, RSI ~28) which could indicate oversold conditions perhaps near a short-term bounce.\n  - AOXUM and XPMAP are at lower price points; XPMAP RSI ~22.8 indicates oversold conditions, potential for mean reversion if fundamentals align.\n  - YVDEP has a high price relative to recent range (60D high ~196.43, current ~194.05) but still within range, suggesting limited upside near resistance but not necessarily overvalued.\n\n9) Suggested next steps (optional)\n- If you’re comfortable with the current diversification, hold and monitor for rebalancing opportunities when any position drifts meaningfully from an intended target (e.g., 11–12% per name, excluding cash).\n- If you want a more even distribution, you could consider using part of the cash to increase exposure to underweighted names like AOXUM or MOUGQ, but note you can only buy whole shares (AOXUM at 11.25, MOUGQ at 396.50). With 459.27 cash, you could buy up to 40 shares of AOXUM (cost 450) or 1 share of MOUGQ (cost 396.50), but that would push weights higher in those entries. A precise rebalancing plan should match your target weight and minimum trade size.\n- Keep an eye on names with momentum turning positive (e.g., GCMLF) and consider incremental adds if the price action confirms a breakout above recent resistance levels.\n\nIf you’d like, I can propose a concrete rebalancing plan to target a specific weight distribution (e.g., equal-weight across the nine non-cash names, or a volatility-weighted scheme) and compute the exact trades given today’s cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
