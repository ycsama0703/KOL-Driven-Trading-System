I used today’s positions as the baseline for updating valuation and weights.\n- Today’s prices: taken from the CURRENT MARKET STATE section (current_buying_price for each ticker).\n- Current cash: 7.42\n\nPosition snapshot (today)\n- YDQMA: 9 shares | price 134.24 | value 1,208.16 | weight ~11.25%\n- XJFOC: 14 shares | price 92.51 | value 1,295.14 | weight ~12.06%\n- GCMLF: 12 shares | price 114.00 | value 1,368.00 | weight ~12.73%\n- PCZVU: 16 shares | price 83.19 | value 1,331.04 | weight ~12.39%\n- KRZIZ: 3 shares | price 345.06 | value 1,035.18 | weight ~9.63%\n- XPMAP: 88 shares | price 17.21 | value 1,514.48 | weight ~14.10%\n- AOXUM: 88 shares | price 10.47 | value 921.36 | weight ~8.58%\n- YVDEP: 7 shares | price 183.61 | value 1,285.27 | weight ~11.96%\n- MOUGQ: 2 shares | price 392.27 | value 784.54 | weight ~7.30%\n\nPortfolio totals\n- Total stock value = 10,743.17\n- Cash = 7.42\n- Total portfolio value ≈ 10,750.59\n\nComputed weights (by market value)\n- YDQMA: 11.25%\n- XJFOC: 12.06%\n- GCMLF: 12.73%\n- PCZVU: 12.39%\n- KRZIZ: 9.63%\n- XPMAP: 14.10%\n- AOXUM: 8.58%\n- YVDEP: 11.96%\n- MOUGQ: 7.30%\n- Checks: sum ≈ 100.00%\n\nQuick qualitative analysis\n- Momentum signals (MACD, RSI, etc.) suggest mixed momentum across holdings, with several names showing mid-to-high RSI (e.g., GCMLF at 66.45 RSI) and some strong MACD readings (GCMLF MACD Line 3.48, YVDEP MACD Line 8.01). The portfolio is diversified across nine positions with no single position dominating capital allocation (largest single-weight is XPMAP at ~14.1%).\n- Concentration risk: The top holdings by weight are GCMLF, XJFOC, YDQMA, PCZVU, and XPMAP — collectively these contribute a substantial portion of the portfolio, but no single name exceeds about 14% on a stand-alone basis. The smallest overweight is MOUGQ at ~7.3%.\n\nShould you trade today?\n- With only 7.42 cash, there isn’t practical room to meaningfully rebalance toward a more optimal target without selling to fund buys or taking on margin. Orders to bring weights closer to a chosen target would require more cash or fractional-share execution (not assumed here).\n- Given the cash constraint, the prudent course is to hold and monitor for:\n  - A new cash influx (fresh funds or proceeds from sales you’re willing to realize)\n  - Price moves that extend or reduce momentum signals\n  - Rebalancing opportunities if you adjust target weights (e.g., move toward equal-weight or risk-parity once cash allows)\n\nRecommended next-step actions (policy, not executed today)\n- If you want a neutral rebalancing target, consider equal weighting across the nine holdings once cash allows. Current deltas (relative to 1/9 of total value ≈ 1,194.51 per holding) suggest small fractional adjustments would be needed:\n  - Some holdings would slightly trim (XPMAP, GCMLF, PCZVU, XJFOC, YDQMA, YVDEP)\n  - Others would need modest increases (MOUGQ, AOXUM, KRZIZ)\n  - Practical note: fractional shares are not assumed in buy/sell function; a cash infusion or rounding to whole shares would be required.\n- If you prefer a momentum-tocused tilt (keeping today’s cash constraint in mind), you could:\n  - Watch GCMLF and YVDEP as higher-momentum names given positive MACD tendencies; consider adding on dips if cash becomes available\n  - Watch MOUGQ and AOXUM for potential overweight opportunities if you bolster cash; MOUGQ has a relatively modest weight today but a favorable position for incremental add-on if price strength continues\n- Maintain a watchlist for potential exit candidates if risk controls tighten (e.g., if RSI approaches extended levels with MACD turning negative)\n\nBottom line\n- Today's updated portfolio value is about 10,750.59 with nine positions totaling 10,743.17 in stock value and 7.42 cash.\n- Weights are roughly balanced but show MOUGQ and AOXUM as under/overweights relative to a rough equal-weight target (depending on how you define the target).\n- No trades executed today due to cash constraints; hold and monitor for cash inflows or scheduling of rebalancing when feasible.\n\nIf you want, I can propose a specific rebalancing plan with a target weight (equal-weight vs. momentum-based) and simulate the required trades once you confirm how you’d like to weight the portfolio. <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
