Near-term momentum neutral/slightly positive but not extreme.\n- YDQMA and KRZIZ: moderate weights (12–13%), RSI high for KRZIZ (~75.6), suggesting strength but potentially extended in run.\n- XJFOC: RSI ~31.4, suggesting potential near-term support/oversold condition; momentum is mixed.\n- GCMLF: RSI ~69.2, near overbought territory; momentum modest positive.\n- PCZVU: RSI ~65.2; modestly strong.\n- YVDEP: RSI ~49.6; neutral.\n- XPMAP: RSI ~44.0; very light exposure, room to grow.\n\nWhat this implies for you\n- If you want to reduce concentration without sacrificing liquidity, MOUGQ is the primary lever.\n- Cash provides optionality to fund modest redeployments into smaller weights (XPMAP, PCZVU) to broaden diversification.\n\nRecommended action options (non-binding)\nOption A — Balanced/Equal-weight tilt (include cash)\n- Target roughly equal weights across 9 assets (8 stocks + cash): approx 11.1% each.\n- Proposed approximate adjustments (order of magnitude only; amounts in USD based on current prices):\n  - Sell MOUGQ to reduce concentration: target MOUGQ around 1,100–1,300 value range (~3–4 shares adjustment). For example, trimming 3–4 MOUGQ shares would free ~1,090–1,456 USD.\n  - Allocate to underweights:\n    - Increase XPMAP by a small amount: a buy of 20–40 dollars (roughly 1–2 shares at current price) would modestly raise XPMAP’s weight.\n    - Increase PCZVU by 10–30 dollars (1–3 shares) to lift its weight.\n    - Minor adjustments to YDQMA/KRZIZ/YVDEP/XJFOC/GCMLF could be considered, but keep within liquidity constraints.\n  - Target cash around 11.1% as well (roughly 1,125 USD). Current cash ~1,299; a slight reallocation of ~100–250 USD into new allocations can help bring the cash weight closer to the target.\n\nOption B — Conservative rebalancing (smaller moves)\n- Do a modest trim of MOUGQ (2 shares ≈ 727 USD) and deploy to PCZVU and XPMAP (e.g., 4 shares PCZVU to raise ~351 USD; 3–4 shares XPMAP to raise ~50–70 USD). This would reduce MOUGQ to ~21–23% and nudge XPMAP/PCZVU higher, improving diversification without heavily changing risk.\n\nOption C — Do nothing today\n- Maintain current allocations given liquidity and potential near-term catalysts. Monitor for signals (MACD crossovers, RSI shifts, price approaching 60D highs/lows) and rebalance if MOUGQ or KRZIZ/YDQMA push too far relative to your risk tolerance.\n\nWould you like me to execute any of these rebalancing actions? If you want, I can:\n- Sell a specified number of MOUGQ shares to target a new weight (e.g., bring MOUGQ closer to ~20% or ~15%).\n- Use part of the cash to buy XPMAP and PCZVU to modestly improve diversification.\n- Recompute the exact trade sizes and confirm the new positions and updated cash after execution.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
