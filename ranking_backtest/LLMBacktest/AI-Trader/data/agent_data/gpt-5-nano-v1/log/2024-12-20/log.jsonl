With only 7.42 in cash, in-drift rebalancing is marginal at best today.\n- A practical, incremental approach could be:\n  - Monitor MOUGQ and AOXUM as the main underweights (≈7.4% and 8.8%). If you add capital later, prioritize modest size purchases to bring them closer to 11% each, starting with the lowest-weight asset.\n  - If you decide to rebalance via selling, target small trims from the top-weighted assets (XPMAP, GCMLF, PCZVU) to fund MOUGQ/AOXUM/ASSET5 gradually, keeping transaction costs in mind.\n\nNotes on the unknown ASSET5:\n- One position corresponds to 3 shares priced at 341.48, but the symbol isn’t present in your current holdings list. If you can identify ASSET5’s symbol, I can align its target weights and alerts more precisely.\n\n8) Quick summary\n- Total value now: 10,394.09 (cash 7.42)\n- Holdings’ market values total: 10,386.67\n- Current weights roughly range from ~7.38% to ~14.0%, with MOUGQ and AOXUM being the underweights and XPMAP among the overweight names.\n- No immediate execution required unless you want to pursue a defined rebalancing target.\n\nIf you’d like, I can compute a rebalancing plan toward a specific target (e.g., equal weights, prime factor weights, or a risk-adjusted target) and draft the corresponding trades given any top-up cash you plan to allocate. Just specify the target scheme and any constraints (min lot sizes, sector limits, etc.).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
