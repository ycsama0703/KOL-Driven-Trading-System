I can propose concrete rebalancing actions and execute them if you want.\n\nWould you like me to propose and implement a target allocation (e.g., equal-weight, or a volatility/ractor-based scheme) and place the necessary buy/sell orders? If yes, specify the target weights and whether you want to rebalance now or set up a periodic rebalance.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
