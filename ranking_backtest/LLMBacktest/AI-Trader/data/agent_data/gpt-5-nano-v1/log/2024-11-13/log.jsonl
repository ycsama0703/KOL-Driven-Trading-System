Example: buying 11 more XPMAP shares costs 11 × 17.04 = 187.44, leaving ~4.97 cash.\n- Alternatively, you could rebalance toward a more equal-weight approach across the 7 core positions (YDQMA, XJFOC, GCMLF, PCZVU, XPMAP, MOUGQ, YVDEP). Right now weights are fairly close (roughly 13-15% each), so only modest rebalancing would be needed unless you want tighter diversification.\n- Risk note: MOUGQ is a high-priced name (and a small number of shares). If you want to reduce concentration risk, you could trim MOUGQ slightly and redeploy into lower-variance exposures, or keep the cash buffer for hedges or new ideas.\n- KRZIZ: If you still want KRZIZ exposure, you’d need to fund the purchase with cash or wait for a price pullback. Currently not feasible with available cash.\n\nWould you like me to place a further small buy (e.g., 11 shares of XPMAP) or propose an explicit target weighting (e.g., equal-weight across seven holdings) and simulate the resulting trades? If you have a preferred target weight or a list of “target” stocks, I can optimize and execute accordingly. <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
