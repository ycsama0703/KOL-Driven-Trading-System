This suggests potential overbought risk in the near term.\n- XPMAP and YVDEP are smaller but still contribute to diversification; XPMAP’s price is near 60D high, which can imply limited upside in the near term.\n\nRecommended next steps (optional)\n- Rebalance suggestion 1: Move toward an evenly weighted portfolio across the eight current holdings (target ≈12.5% each). This would involve trimming some of the larger positions (MOUGQ, PCZVU, GCMLF) and possibly increasing exposure to smaller-but-still-attractive names, while preserving cash for liquidity.\n  - Example target per position (approximate): 1,281.72 each (based on total 10,253.80). This would imply:\n    - Reduce MOUGQ, PCZVU, GCMLF to trim about 295–330 value each.\n    - Increase KRZIZ, YVDEP slightly (or reallocate to whichever set you prefer) to approach 1,281.72 per name.\n- Rebalance suggestion 2: Risk-weighted approach favoring lower-volatility or higher-return candidates based on your risk tolerance (requires vol estimates and a defined target).\n- Actionable options I can execute for you:\n  - Sell portions of PCZVU, GCMLF, or MOUGQ to prune top-weighted exposures.\n  - Buy additional shares in smaller positions (e.g., KRZIZ, YVDEP, XPMAP) to tilt toward a more balanced allocation, subject to cash constraints and lot size rules.\n\nIf you’d like, I can execute a specific rebalance plan (e.g., equal-weight rebalance to 12.5% each) or implement a risk-based target. Just tell me the target weights you want, and I’ll place the trades. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
