Rough target per asset: total portfolio value 10,143.46 / 8 ≈ 1,267.93 per stock.\n  - Current per-asset values are in the 1,090–1,103 range for several names, with some higher and some lower. Rebalancing toward equal weights would involve modest additional purchases (or sales) using the available cash.\n  - For example, rough delta to move toward equal weights (in dollars, not yet translated to exact share adjustments due to price granularity):\n    - YDQMA: +~177.5\n    - XJFOC: +~164\n    - GCMLF: +~168\n    - KRZIZ: +~297\n    - YVDEP: +~192\n    - PCZVU: +~220\n    - XPMAP: +~210\n    - MOUGQ: +~171\n  - All deltas sum to about +1,600, which is compatible with your cash cushion (~1,598). In practice you'd convert these dollar deltas into whole-share adjustments (based on each price per share) and place trades accordingly.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate a concrete set of exact buy orders to move toward an exact 12.5% equal-weight target, given current prices and lot-size rules.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
