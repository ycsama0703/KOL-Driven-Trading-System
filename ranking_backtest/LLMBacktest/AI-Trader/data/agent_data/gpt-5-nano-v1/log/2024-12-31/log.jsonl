Holdings now reflect XPMAP = 72 (was 88 yesterday). Proceeds added to cash and the position values for other holdings remain based on today’s prices.\n\nObservations and quick strategizing\n- Concentration: AOXUM is the largest single-position weight (~14.9%). If you’re aiming for a more even spread, AOXUM could be trimmed modestly when / if you want to rebalance.\n- Undersubscribed holdings: MOUGQ (~7.7%) and KRZIZ (~10.3%) are below the mid-range of the current eight-holdings; there could be room to tilt toward these on a dip or with new cash.\n- Defensive read: Most of the eight active holdings are around the 11–14% range, with RSI values mostly in mid- to low-40s, suggesting neutral-to-bearish momentum in several names. No extreme overbought signals jump out, but several are near neutral to weakly bearish MACD/hist signals.\n\nWhat you might consider next (no action required unless you want me to place trades)\n- Rebalancing toward equal weight (about 12.5% each) would imply minor adjustments:\n  - AOXUM: trim a small amount (e.g., 2–6 shares) to pull toward ~12.5%.\n  - MOUGQ and KRZIZ: consider adding small amounts if cash allows or if price dips, to push toward ~12.5%.\n- With only 7.42 in cash today, there isn’t room for meaningful new buys. If you want to maintain this eight-name exposure, you could consider selling a small slice of AOXUM or YVDEP to free cash for incremental buys later (or leave as-is and wait for a price dip).\n- If you’d like, I can draft a rebalance plan with target thresholds and place trades automatically when you approve.\n\nSummary\n- Post-trade snapshot: 8 active holdings with total holdings value ~9,705.47 and cash 277.66.\n- Total account value: ~9,983.13.\n- Current weights are fairly spread around 11–14% per name, with cash at ~2.8%.\n- Next steps: optional modest rebalancing to tighten weights toward ~12.5% per name, depending on your risk tolerance and any new cash inflows.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
