If you want to enforce a stricter equal-weight across all assets (including cash), you could conceptually target ~10% per stock and ~10% cash; however, with integer shares and current price levels this would require multiple trades and could shift liquidity.\n- If you prefer to maintain a conservative stance, no trades are recommended. The portfolio is balanced and cash remains accessible.\n\nOptional action ideas (not executed yet):\n- Slight rebalancing toward strict equal-weight: could consider small adjustments by buying a few shares in weaker-performers or trimming a small amount in a few stronger ones to nudge each equity closer to a ~10% target, while letting cash settle toward ~10%. This would require executing buys/sells and may impact trading costs.\n- Risk-aware trimming: given RSI readings above 70 on some names (e.g., YVDEP, PCZVU, AOXUM), consider trimming a small amount if you’re comfortable locking in profits and reducing potential pullbacks. This would entail selling a portion of those holdings and redeploying into cash or underweight assets.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Keep the current allocations as-is, or\n- Attempt a formal rebalancing toward a target (e.g., equal-weight across the nine equities with ~10% cash), and execute the necessary trades? If you choose the latter, I’ll proceed with the trades using the platform’s buy/sell tools. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
