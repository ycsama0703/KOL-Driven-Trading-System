If you want to maintain a buffer, you’ll want to keep an eye on cash usage for any rebalances.\n- The portfolio is modestly diversified but concentrated in a handful of holdings by value (notably YDQMA, GCMLF, XPMAP, and MOUGQ).\n- We don’t have explicit target weights from you. If you’d like, I can propose a few rebalancing options (equal-weight, risk-adjusted, or alpha-driven) and compute the exact buy/sell quantities.\n\nNote on a prior trade attempt\n- I tried to place a sale for PLNOQ 1 share. The trading tool returned an error: “Insufficient shares! This action will not be allowed.” Based on your current positions, you actually hold 14 shares of PLNOQ, so the sale should be possible. This appears to be a tool-state inconsistency rather than an actual holding issue. If you want to go ahead with selling PLNOQ, I can retry with a specific amount.\n\nWould you like me to propose and/or place any trades to rebalance toward a target weight? Some common options:\n- Equal-weight across the 9 holdings (approx. 12–12.5% each).\n- Target weights based on momentum signals or alpha scores (e.g., overweight MOUGQ, YDQMA, XPMAP if you want higher exposure to those with stronger recent signals; underweight AOXUM given its small size and recent activity).\n- Risk-parity or volatility-weighted adjustments.\n\nIf you want, I can compute a concrete rebalance plan (buy/sell quantities) for:\n- Equal-weighting (9 holdings)\n- Momentum-enhanced weighting (e.g., overweight top 3-4 by MACD/H-Momentum signals)\n- A conservative plan that keeps cash buffer above a threshold (e.g., >2% of account value)\n\nPlease tell me which approach you prefer, or provide target weights and I’ll execute the plan. <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
