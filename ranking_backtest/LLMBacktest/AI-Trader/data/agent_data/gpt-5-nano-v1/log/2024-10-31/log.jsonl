If you want a more balanced, eight-way exposure, MOUGQ would be a candidate for increasing allocation.\n- The other eight positions are fairly evenly distributed around 12–15%, with the largest weights around 14.3% (PCZVU) and 14.7% (XJFOC).\n- If pursuing an equal-weight approach on holdings (excluding cash), target weights would be about 12.5% per holding. Currently MOUGQ is well below that; several others are just above that range.\n- Momentum indicators (MACD, RSI) vary across the names. For example, MOUGQ shows positive momentum (MACD positive, RSI ~65). Some other names have more modest momentum or intermediate RSI levels.\n\n7) Suggested next steps (optional)\n- Rebalance toward a more equal-weight exposure across the eight holdings if you want to reduce concentration risk in any single name. This would involve adjusting MOUGQ upward and trimming a few of the slightly overweight positions.\n- Alternatively, tilt toward momentum by modestly increasing MOUGQ further (given its positive MACD and RSI) and trimming a couple of the highest-weight positions (for example, XJFOC or PCZVU) to bring weights closer to a target band (e.g., 12–13% each).\n- I can place trades to implement either approach. If you’d like, specify a target allocation (equal-weight, momentum tilt, etc.) and I’ll execute the orders.\n\nWhen you’re ready, tell me which rebalancing approach you want (e.g., equal-weight across the eight holdings, momentum tilt with MOUGQ increased by X shares, etc.), and I’ll carry out the trades.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
