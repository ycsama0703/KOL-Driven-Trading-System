The above deltas assume dollar-amount moves; in practice, you’d translate to whole-share trades.\n\n8) Immediate recommended action (today)\n- Do not execute any trades today given the cash constraint (0.56). The portfolio is reasonably exposed to a high-beta name (YVDEP) with an overbought RSI, and two smaller positions (XPMAP, MOUGQ) show weaker momentum.\n- Monitor for an influx of cash or a price-driven rebalancing signal. If additional cash becomes available, consider:\n  - Building KRZIZ exposure (buy as many whole shares as possible) to push toward ~40% weight.\n  - Minor trims of YVDEP, MOUGQ, and XPMAP to reduce concentration risk and reallocate toward KRZIZ, keeping an eye on YVDEP’s RSI.\n\n9) Summary\n- Today's valuation shows a portfolio of four positions totaling about 5,233.28 with a cash cushion of 0.56.\n- Current weights favor YVDEP ~32% and XPMAP ~25%; KRZIZ ~20% and MOUGQ ~22%.\n- Momentum favors KRZIZ; YVDEP is overbought; XPMAP and MOUGQ are weaker.\n- Targeting a momentum-led reallocation (KRZIZ 40%, YVDEP 32%, MOUGQ 16%, XPMAP 12%) would require about 1,207 in additional cash to execute cleanly; with today’s cash, no trades are recommended.\n\nIf you’d like, I can run an alternate target-weight scenario (e.g., more conservative or more aggressive) and outline the exact share-level trades needed once you provide available cash or a price-based trigger. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
