The new weighting leans more toward YDQMA and MOUGQ, with YVDEP also a relatively large contributor.\n\nSuggestions for the next steps (optional)\n- If you’re aiming for a more balanced/diversified portfolio, consider trimming MOUGQ or MOUGQ’s weight a bit and deploying cash into a new idea with positive momentum signals, or rebalancing toward equal weights across the five currently held names.\n- Keep cash buffer (currently ~12.8%) for new opportunities or to hedge against drawdowns.\n- Set price alerts or stop checks around key levels (e.g., GCMLF near 60D high, YDQMA at current RSI/price levels) to react if momentum changes.\n\nStatus recap\n- Yesterday’s positions updated today with two trades executed:\n  - Sold GCMLF 2\n  - Bought YDQMA 1\n- Final positions and cash as of now:\n  - GCMLF 10, YDQMA 11, XPMAP 15, YVDEP 12, MOUGQ 5\n  - Cash 930.33\n  - Total portfolio value 7,274.23\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
