For example:\n- Target GCMLF ~12-14%, AOXUM ~10-12%, YVDEP ~10-12%, others adjusted accordingly.\n- Or set a price-triggered ladder (e.g., buy AOXUM if price dips under 11.00) to gradually shift weights without committing a large amount of cash now.\n\nIf you specify a target allocation or risk preference, I can compute the exact trades and execute them.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
