KRZIZ is high-priced per share, which can create apparent concentration even at a smaller share count.\n- Balance opportunities:\n  - If you want tighter risk control, consider trimming KRZIZ further or even trimming a position in GCMLF or YDQMA to push some weights closer to a nominal target like 12–13% per position.\n  - If you want to maintain the current eight-name diversification, a simple reweight to a near-equal-weight target (about 12.5% per name) could be implemented by small rebalances across the largest overweighted names.\n- Cash cushion: Cash is at 126.72. If you plan new buys, you can allocate incremental capital to underweight names or use cash as a safety buffer.\n\n8) Next steps (optional actions I can take)\n- Rebalance to an equal-weight target across all current holdings.\n- Trim overweight positions (e.g., GCMLF or KRZIZ) to reduce concentration risk.\n- Add a new target or replace any underperforming names with another diversified pick, depending on your risk tolerance.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Rebalance to an equal-weight portfolio across the eight holdings, or\n- Trim specific positions (e.g., KRZIZ or GCMLF) to a defined target, or\n- Allocate a portion of cash to a new target (and specify the symbol and target weight)?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
