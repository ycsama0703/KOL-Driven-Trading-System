This is one of the stronger momentum signals among held assets.\n- KRZIZ also shows strong MACD momentum with a high RSI near 68.5; could be a source of continued upside.\n- PCZVU and YDQMA look more balanced but not strongly bullish based on MACD histograms (mixed signals).\n- XPMAP and GCMLF look relatively weaker (oversold indicators: RSI around 30; MACD hist negative), suggesting they may be more mean-reversion candidates.\n- XJFOC and YVDEP show modest signals; XJFOC has a positive MACD histogram while YVDEP is mixed.\n\n7) Suggested next steps (without executing trades now)\n- If you want to maintain a diversified, near-equal risk exposure across these eight positions, the weights are already fairly balanced around 11–13% each plus ~2% cash. No urgent rebalancing required.\n- If you’d like to tilt toward the current momentum leaders (MOUGQ, KRZIZ) and away from weaker names (GCMLF, XPMAP), you could consider a small rebalancing when cash permits. Given the current cash of 192.41, meaningful reallocation would require either selling some positions or adding new capital, and any trade should consider lot sizes (especially for CN stocks, multiples of 100) and tax/transaction costs.\n- Maintain a small cash buffer (the current ~2% cash is reasonable for tactical moves and to cover fees/round-trips).\n\n8) Summary\n- Current total value: 10,048.14\n- Holdings valued today: 9,855.73\n- Cash: 192.41\n- Allocation (approx): MOUGQ and XPMAP are near the 11–13% range; YDQMA, XJFOC, PCZVU, YVDEP are ~11–13%; GCMLF ~11%; KRZIZ ~11%; Cash ~2%.\n- Key alpha ideas to monitor: MOUGQ, KRZIZ (positive momentum), GCMLF and XPMAP (mean-reversion candidates).\n\nIf you want me to implement a rebalancing plan, specify target weights (e.g., equal-weight across holdings, or tilt toward MOUGQ/KRZIZ), and whether you want to buy more with available cash or sell some holdings to reallocate. I can then compute the exact trade quantities respecting lot-size rules and provide a trading plan.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
