XPMAP is the second-largest at ~42.8%; AOXUM is a tiny position (~0.3%).\n- The three new purchases (KRZIZ +2, XPMAP +1, AOXUM +1) were made at today’s prices, so immediate P/L on these additions is 0 for the new lots (price paid equals price now).\n- Your overall portfolio remains diversified beyond these three; the exact total portfolio value isn’t shown here, but the updated three-holdings weight is heavily KRZIZ within that subset.\n\nRecommended next steps (optional, based on your risk preferences)\n- If you want to rebalance toward a more diversified risk profile, consider trimming KRZIZ to bring the KRZIZ share closer to a target (e.g., 25–35%) and allocating more to XPMAP and AOXUM or other holdings with favorable risk/return profiles.\n- If you’re comfortable with a KRZIZ-heavy position due to its momentum, you could add modestly to AOXUM or XPMAP to boost diversification gradually.\n- If you want a full portfolio re-evaluation, I can compute total portfolio value and weights across all holdings (not just updated ones) using today’s prices, and propose a balanced target allocation.\n\nWhat would you like me to do next?\n- Compute the full portfolio value and weights across all holdings today (requires aggregating all positions with their current prices).\n- Propose a concrete rebalancing plan to reach a target allocation (e.g., 30/30/10 for KRZIZ/XPMAP/AOXUM, or another target you specify).\n- Suggest stop-loss or take-profit levels for the updated holdings.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
