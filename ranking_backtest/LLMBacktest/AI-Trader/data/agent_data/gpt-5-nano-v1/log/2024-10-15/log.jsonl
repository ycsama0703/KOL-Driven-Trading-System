XPMAP is currently very small (~3.2%) despite a recent buy.\n- If you want to rebalance toward a more diversified risk profile, consider:\n  - Reducing MOUGQ exposure by a few shares to bring weight down toward a target range (e.g., 20–25%), and/or\n  - Increasing weight in XPMAP or PCZVU (both currently underrepresented) to diversify beyond the three largest holdings.\n- If you have target weights or a risk budget, I can compute a suggested rebalance plan (quantities and cash impact) and place trades accordingly.\n\nWould you like me to propose and execute a rebalance to a specified target allocation, or adjust any specific holdings based on your strategy? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
