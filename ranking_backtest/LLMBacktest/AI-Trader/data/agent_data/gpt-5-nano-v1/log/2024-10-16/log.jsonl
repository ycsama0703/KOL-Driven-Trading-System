Any rebalancing to significantly alter weights would require realizing gains (selling some positions) or allocating more cash via new funding or from sells.\n\nWould you like me to propose a concrete rebalancing plan (e.g., move toward a target weight, or implement an equal-weight basket among these eight) and execute trades if you approve? If yes, I can outline target weights, required buy/sell quantities, and simulate the trades. <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
