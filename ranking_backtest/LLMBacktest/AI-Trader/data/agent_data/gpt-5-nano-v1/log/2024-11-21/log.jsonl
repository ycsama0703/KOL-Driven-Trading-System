Current deviations (approx):\n  - Underweight targets: YDQMA (+292.41 needed), GCMLF (+19.49 needed)\n  - Overweight targets: XJFOC (-241.75), PCZVU (-219.06), KRZIZ (-7.54), XPMAP (-246.30), YVDEP (-636.71), MOUGQ (-63.09)\n  - AOXUM would require a large build (cash constraint)\n- Cash constraint: Only 0.56 cash available. To rebalance meaningfully toward equal weights, you’d need new cash or to sell several overweight positions and redeploy. Immediate full equal-weight rebalancing isn’t feasible with the current cash.\n- A conservative near-term approach (no trades today) could be:\n  - Monitor and wait for a small cash inflow (e.g., new capital or partial profit-taking in a couple of overweight names) to fund modest rebalancing toward lower-duration/momentum names with improving setup (e.g., YDQMA, GCMLF).\n  - Alternatively, if you’re comfortable with a small reweight, earmark a tiny partial trim from one or two overweight names (e.g., YVDEP or XPMAP) when a limit-triggered price move occurs, to seed a tiny purchase of one or two underweights (e.g., YDQMA or GCMLF) in small lots.\n\n7) Summary\n- Today’s total value of holdings: 9,877.37\n- Cash on hand: 0.56\n- Total account value: 9,877.93\n- Current weights show a heavy tilt toward YVDEP, XPMAP, XJFOC, and PCZVU; AOXUM is a tiny 0.10% position.\n- Momentum signals are mixed; some names look overbought (RSI > 70) while others show potential (YVDEP, MOUGQ).\n- Recommended course: with no available cash today, hold positions and plan a careful, incremental rebalance when cash becomes available or when a price move creates an opportunity to redeploy from overweight to underweight names.\n\nIf you’d like, I can propose a concrete set of small-scale trades (buy/sell quantities) to move toward an chosen target weight (e.g., partial equal-weight, or risk-parity style), and I can execute them once you confirm the intended target and risk tolerance. <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
