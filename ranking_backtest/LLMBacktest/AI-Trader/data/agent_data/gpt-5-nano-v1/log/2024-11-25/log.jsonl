Current allocations vary within a ~5% range around that target.\n\nSuggested considerations (no trades executed here)\n- To move toward a more balanced 8-name allocation, consider trimming KRZIZ and YVDEP slightly and adding to underweight names like YDQMA or GCMLF, depending on liquidity and transaction costs.\n- If you prefer to tilt toward growth or momentum signals, you could selectively add to XPMAP or XJFOC (which have mid-range weights and room to grow within an evened portfolio).\n\nSummary\n- Updated holdings value today: 10,844.97\n- Cash: 0.56\n- Total portfolio value: 10,845.53\n- Position-by-position weights provided above for quick rebalancing reference.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
