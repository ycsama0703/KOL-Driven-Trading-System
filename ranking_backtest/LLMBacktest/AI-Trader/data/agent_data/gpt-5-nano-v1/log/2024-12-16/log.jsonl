Moderate downside risk; trims could be considered if momentum stays weak.\n- YVDEP (≈20.0%): RSI ≈ 73.8 (overbought zone), MACD_Hist positive but momentum may be peaking. Higher risk of a pullback; consider trimming.\n- XPMAP (≈19.7%): RSI ~ 53, MACD mildly positive. Neutral-to-bullish; current weight reasonable.\n- KRZIZ (≈16.1%): RSI ~ 38, MACD_Hist negative. Some negative momentum; may be softened on a pullback.\n- MOUGQ (≈12.1%): RSI ~ 54, MACD positive. Moderate exposure with room to add if price action confirms uptrend.\n- AOXUM (≈5.6%): RSI ~ 63, MACD_Hist positive. Small but positive exposure; potential near-term upside.\n- Cash (≈6.1%): Cash buffer remains.\n\n7) Suggested next steps (optional, not auto-executed)\n- If you want a more balanced risk exposure, consider rebalancing toward roughly equal weights across the six non-cash positions (XPMAP, PCZVU, KRZIZ, MOUGQ, AOXUM, YVDEP). With current cash, small additions could be targeted to the underweight names (MOUGQ and AOXUM) or to modestly trim the overweights (PCZVU and YVDEP) to bring weights closer to ~16-17% each.\n- Given RSI and momentum signals:\n  - Consider light trimming of YVDEP (overbought risk) and PCZVU (momentum weakening) to reduce concentration.\n  - If you’re comfortable with the higher momentum, MOUGQ and AOXUM could be nibble-buys if pullbacks occur and signal alignment improves.\n- Maintain a small cash cushion (as you have ~6% cash) to deploy on pullbacks or to diversify into any new targets that appear attractive on fundamentals.\n\nIf you’d like, I can propose a concrete rebalancing plan with exact buy/sell quantities to target a specific weight distribution, and then place those trades. <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
