If your target is an even 10% per bucket (9 stocks + cash), you’re very close; no urgent rebalancing is required.\n- If you want to tilt toward momentum or rebalance toward a strict equal-weight scheme, minor adjustments could be considered:\n  - Small trim opportunities: take tiny trims from KRZIZ, XJFOC, or MOUGQ (each ~10.25–11.32% weight) to realize a small amount of cash for reallocation.\n  - Boost AOXUM modestly: AOXUM is currently ~0.1% weighted. Deploying a small amount of cash (e.g., 1–2% of portfolio value, ~$100–$217) to AOXUM could elevate its weight meaningfully without large turnover. For example, purchasing ~9–20 more shares would add ~90–210 in value depending on price.\n  - If you’d prefer a clean equal-weight tilt across all 9 stocks (excluding cash), you’d be aiming around 1,200 per stock, which would entail rebalancing trades across multiple names. This would require a trade plan in terms of acceptable transaction costs and slippage.\n\n8) Practical next steps (recommended)\n- Keep current positions given momentum signals and near-equal weights.\n- Optional small rebalancing (if you want to nudge AOXUM up):\n  - Buy a modest batch of AOXUM (e.g., 9–20 shares) using available cash (~$100–$200 impact on cash) to raise its weight from ~0.1% toward the 1–2% range. This diversifies the portfolio further and leverages the low price point.\n- Monitor the momentum and RSI for signs of overbought conditions in the high-RSI stocks (YVDEP, MOUGQ) and be prepared to take profits or trim if MACD or RSI signals deteriorate.\n\nIf you’d like, I can execute a small AOXUM buy (e.g., 20 shares) now to nudge its weight, or I can implement a full rebalancing plan to target exact equal weights across the nine stocks. Tell me your preferred approach (aggressive, moderate, or conservative) and the amount you want to allocate to AOXUM and I’ll place the appropriate orders. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
