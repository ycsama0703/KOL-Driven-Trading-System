For example, AOXUM is a small 2.4% weight; if you’re comfortable with its risk, you could allocate a small tranche to bring it closer to mid-teens.\n- Conversely, you might trim a bit of GCMLF or MOUGQ if you prefer to reduce concentration in those names, given they are among the larger weights.\n\nIf you’d like, I can propose a target-weight rebalance plan and place a buy order for you (subject to your preferences and any lot-size constraints). \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
