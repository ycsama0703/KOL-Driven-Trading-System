Consideration: high concentration near a recent high; potential profit-taking or tightening risk if price stalls.\n- YVDEP (7 shares): price 173.08, RSI 78.67, MACD positive. Similar overbought signal; risk of a pullback if momentum wanes.\n- XJFOC (14): price 100.10, RSI ~68, MACD positive; decent momentum.\n- XPMAP (81): price 17.33, RSI 66.91; small-cap vibe but notable position size.\n- MOUGQ (3): price 402.44, RSI 69.37; strong name but could be sensitive to vol shifts.\n- AOXUM (1): tiny position, price 10.35; a minor ballast.\n- Other holds (YDQMA, GCMLF, PCZVU, YVDEP) show mid-to-high momentum signals with reasonable diversification across names.\n\nPossible next steps (optional, I can execute if you want)\n- Rebalance idea 1: trim KRZIZ and YVDEP modestly to reduce concentration risk given high RSI levels (KRZIZ and YVDEP are around 11% each, with RSI in the high 70s/80s). Redirect proceeds to cash or to slightly overweight XJFOC or XPMAP for incremental upside exposure.\n- Rebalance idea 2: top up AOXUM or AOXUM-like small cap ballast to improve diversification and reduce concentration in the nine-core holdings.\n- Rebalance idea 3: if you have a bullish view on momentum names, consider modestly increasing XJFOC or MOUGQ allocations within risk limits.\n\nWould you like me to place any follow-up trades to rebalance toward a target allocation (e.g., equal-weight across non-cash holdings, or a 12% cap on KRZIZ/YVDEP, etc.)? If you have preferred targets, tell me and I can execute. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
