I’m basing updates on the current live positions and today’s market prices.\n- Valuations are computed using today’s current_buying_price for each holding.\n- Cash balance is included in overall portfolio value.\n\nPortfolio snapshot (today)\n- Holdings (shares held) and current prices\n  - YDQMA: 9 shares, price 131.31 → value 1,181.79\n  - XJFOC: 14 shares, price 91.78 → value 1,284.92\n  - GCMLF: 12 shares, price 110.69 → value 1,328.28\n  - PCZVU: 16 shares, price 82.52 → value 1,320.32\n  - KRZIZ: 3 shares, price 341.78 → value 1,025.34\n  - XPMAP: 88 shares, price 16.92 → value 1,488.96\n  - MOUGQ: 2 shares, price 385.06 → value 770.12\n  - AOXUM: 88 shares, price 10.52 → value 925.76\n  - YVDEP: 7 shares, price 181.39 → value 1,269.73\n\n- Cash: 7.42\n\n- Total holdings value: 10,595.22\n- Total account value (including cash): 10,602.64\n\nPortfolio weights (based on total account value)\n- YDQMA: 11.16%\n- XJFOC: 12.12%\n- GCMLF: 12.54%\n- PCZVU: 12.46%\n- KRZIZ: 9.68%\n- XPMAP: 14.05%\n- MOUGQ: 7.27%\n- AOXUM: 8.74%\n- YVDEP: 11.98%\n- Cash: 0.07%\n\nTarget allocation (conceptual, e.g., equal-weight across the 9 active holdings)\n- Equal-weight target for each holding ≈ 11.11%\n\nDelta to equal-weight (how far each position is from the equal-weight target)\n- YDQMA: +0.05 percentage points over target\n- XJFOC: +1.01 pp over target\n- GCMLF: +1.43 pp over target\n- PCZVU: +1.35 pp over target\n- KRZIZ: -1.43 pp under target\n- XPMAP: +2.94 pp over target\n- MOUGQ: -3.84 pp under target\n- AOXUM: -2.37 pp under target\n- YVDEP: +0.87 pp over target\n\nFeasibility of rebalancing today\n- Cash on hand is very small (7.42). Bringing the underweight positions up to equal-weight would require net cash (to buy more of MOUGQ, KRZIZ, AOXUM, YVDEP, etc., depending on which you want to target) and/or selling overweight positions.\n- Net adjustments to reach equal-weight would require a mix of sells and buys in multiple tickers. With only 7.42 cash, any meaningful reweight would be impractical today unless we liquidate some holdings to raise cash, which isn’t currently justified by the signal quality (many holdings show neutral to negative momentum and mixed signals).\n\nKey takeaways\n- The portfolio is concentrated among 9 holdings with a fairly diverse spread, but several positions are currently near or above the equal-weight target (notably XPMAP and XJFOC/GCMLF/PCZVU), while MOUGQ and KRZIZ are underweights.\n- No actionable trade is recommended today given the tiny cash balance and lack of a strong, clear buy signal to justify reallocating capital.\n\nWhat I’d monitor next (watchlist and potential signals)\n- Watch MOUGQ, AOXUM, KRZIZ, YVDEP for potential reallocation if cash becomes available or if a stronger momentum signal emerges.\n- If you gain additional cash or profits, consider a gradual move toward a defined risk/return target (e.g., a disciplined rebalancing to a chosen tolerance band rather than strict equal-weight).\n- Also monitor underweight assets for any positive momentum change (look for MACD_hist turning positive, RSI stabilization above 40-50, and price above short-term moving averages).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Run a scenario where we add a small cash buffer (e.g., 1-2% of total value) and simulate a stepwise rebalancing toward a preferred target (e.g., equal-weight or momentum-based).\n- Create an alert/watchlist for any of the nine holdings when their momentum signals improve (MACD hist turns positive, RSI moves higher, price breaks above MA.\n\nEnd of update. <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
