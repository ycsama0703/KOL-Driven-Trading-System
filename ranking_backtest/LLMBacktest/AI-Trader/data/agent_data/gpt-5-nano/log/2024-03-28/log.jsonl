With current whole-share lots, achieving exact 25% would need fractional adjustments or a larger cash buffer to fund whole-share moves.\n- With only 0.15% cash, there isn’t a practical opportunity to buy even a single additional whole share right now. Any rebalancing would require selling from one or more positions and buying others, which would move you away from the current approximate equal weights unless you consider larger trades.\n\n7) Suggested next steps (optional)\n- If you’re comfortable with fractional trading (or plan to accumulate more cash), you could target a near-25% each allocation over time.\n- Otherwise, monitor price movements and consider a practical rebalancing plan when you have enough cash to make meaningful, allowed trades in whole shares.\n- If you’d like, I can run a few rebalancing scenarios (e.g., aiming for 26/24/25/25 or 25/25/25/25 using whole shares within your cash constraints) and show the resulting trades and new weights.\n\nCurrent updated positions (unchanged quantities; valuations updated)\n- HPQ: 70 shares, value ≈ 1,994.30\n- KO: 35 shares, value ≈ 2,043.65\n- NKE: 22 shares, value ≈ 2,009.04\n- XOM: 18 shares, value ≈ 1,948.32\n- CASH: 11.94\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ 8,007.25\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
