This provides modest sector diversification, but overall portfolio size is still small, so transaction costs and tracking error matter less, but price swings in any single name can impact P&L meaningfully.\n- Small negative tilt on day-of purchases due to minor pullbacks in several of the new entries (as shown by the incremental P&L).\n\n8) Suggested next steps (optional)\n- If you want a cleaner equal-weighted exposure, you’re already near equal dollar-weight across the five holdings. Consider a periodic rebalancing pass (e.g., quarterly) to maintain equal weights if you’re aiming for a simple, diversified approach.\n- Set price alerts or trailing stops to monitor these five stocks for any sustained momentum reversal.\n- If you’d like further diversification, we could add a non-correlated or defensive name or reallocate a portion of cash to a quality dividend payer or a higher-growth candidate.\n\nFinal note\n- Updated holdings reflect five 1-share additions today: HPQ, KO, NKE, PFE, XOM.\n- Cash on hand after the trades: 15.15\n- Current total portfolio value (stocks + cash): 9,794.04\n- If you want, I can run a broader risk/return projection or simulate a few rebalancing scenarios.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
