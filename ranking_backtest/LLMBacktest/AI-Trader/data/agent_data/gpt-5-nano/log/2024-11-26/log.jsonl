Cash is a very small position (~1% of total value).\n- Rebalancing: Not necessary at this moment given cash constraints (only 103.44) and small daily drift. Exact 20% target weights would require more cash or fractional trades; with integer-share trading, a meaningful rebalancing would be limited today.\n- Potential actions for future consideration (when you want to rebalance or adjust risk/sector exposure):\n  - If a true 20% per stock target is desired, you could gradually rebalance as more cash accumulates or if price moves allow, prioritizing adding to NKE, XOM, or KO where you want to tilt exposure, given your thesis.\n  - If you want to maintain an equal-weight stance but can tolerate small deviations, you can allow minor drift and revisit at next update.\n  - Consider setting stop-loss or take-profit triggers per name if you want more defined risk controls.\n\nIf you’d like, I can simulate a small, staged rebalance plan (e.g., sell 1 HPQ share and reallocate to NKE when feasible, tracking cash buildup and execution feasibility) or propose a different target allocation (e.g., sector-based weighting or risk parity). \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
