With 10k+ in total, a ~1% cash cushion won’t materially impact risk, but it prevents quick rebalances.\n- Quick rebalancing ideas (approximate, using today’s prices):\n  - Buy 1 XOM (~$110) to push XOM toward 19 shares (weight a bit higher but closer to 20%).\n  - Or buy 1 additional PFE (~$26.50) to nudge PFE toward 76 shares, depending on which exposure you want to tilt.\n  - If you want to keep cash tight, you could also wait for a pullback or a new price opportunity before adding positions.\n\nBottom line\n- Today’s updates yield: PFE 75, XOM 18, HPQ 66, KO 31, NKE 29; CASH 112.25.\n- Total portfolio value ≈ 10,187.02.\n- We’re roughly balanced around 20% in each stock with a small cash cushion. If you’d like, I can propose a precise rebalancing plan to hit exact target weights, or tailor a strategy (e.g., risk parity, dividend-weighted, sector tilts) based on your preferences.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
