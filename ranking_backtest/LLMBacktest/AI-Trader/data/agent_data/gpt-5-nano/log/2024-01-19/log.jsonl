Any rebalancing to exact 20% would require fractional shares or more cash. If you are willing to implement a close-enough rebalancing today, you could:\n  - Sell a small number of shares from the slightly over-weighted holdings (NKE and PFE are slightly over 20%) and use the proceeds to fill the deficit in XOM and HPQ. However, the exact integer-share adjustments would be small and may not yield a clean 20% split.\n- Practical note: Since you can only buy/sell integer shares (no fractional shares via the provided buy/sell tool), expect minor deviations from exact 20% targets unless you accumulate more cash or there is a price move.\n\n6) Next-step plan\n- Monitor price drift and cash accumulation. If you’d like, I can:\n  - Propose a precise rebalancing plan for the next trading day when you have more cash, or\n  - Set up a rule-based rebalance (e.g., rebalance only when a stock deviates by more than X% from 20% and cash > Y).\n- If you’re considering adding exposure, we can also simulate potential additions (e.g., adding a new position or trimming the lightest weight) and estimate impact on risk/return.\n\nSummary\n- Current total value: 9,695.97\n- Current weights: HPQ ~19.99%, KO ~20.07%, NKE ~20.18%, XOM ~19.60%, PFE ~20.15%, Cash ~0.24%\n- No immediate trading required given the near-equal weights and limited cash. Rebalance today would require fractional shares or more cash; plan for a future date when you can execute precise rebalancing.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
