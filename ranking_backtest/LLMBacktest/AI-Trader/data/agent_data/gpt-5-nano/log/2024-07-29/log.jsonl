If the goal is to maintain near-equal weighting across the five names, you’re very close to that target.\n- To fully invest the cash and lock in a strict 20% target per name (plus negligible cash), you could deploy the current cash across the five holdings in a proportional manner. Estimated deployment to bring cash toward 0 would be around 0.046 × total portfolio ≈ 495 (based on the current rough total). That would adjust weights toward exactly 20% each.\n- If you’d prefer to keep some cash as a buffer, you could set a target like 18–22% per stock and 2–6% cash, rebalancing only when prices move enough to push one name meaningfully out of range.\n\nRisks to monitor\n- Sector concentration remains five large-cap names (tech/consumption/energy). If you want broader diversification, consider adding a different sector or asset class.\n- Pharma (PFE) has different volatility drivers; watch for earnings/approval news.\n- Valuations can shift quickly with price changes; keep an eye on price-to-value alignment versus your targets.\n\nIf you want, I can propose a precise rebalancing plan to move toward a defined target (e.g., 20% each across HPQ, KO, NKE, XOM, PFE) and compute the exact trades needed given today’s prices. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
