No immediate buy action is feasible today without liquidating or reallocating positions.\n- If you want to move toward a strict 20% target per holding, you’d typically rebalance using cash or by selling a portion of one holding to fund a buy in another. For example, to move closer to an exact 20% target while keeping cash negligible, you could consider:\n  - Sell 1 share of KO (~61.74 at today’s price) and buy 1 share of HPQ (~33.48). This would increase HPQ and decrease KO, nudging both weights toward closer parity. After this hypothetical move, the new approximate holdings value would be:\n    - HPQ: 2,008.80\n    - KO: 2,039.82\n    - NKE: 2,050.92\n    - PFE: 2,098.80\n    - XOM: 1,924.56\n    - Cash: 60.48\n    - New total: 10,183.38\n    - New weights (approx): HPQ ~19.75%, KO ~20.01%, NKE ~20.16%, PFE ~20.61%, XOM ~18.95%, Cash ~0.63%\n  - This demonstrates that a small rebalancing move is possible if you’re open to trading, but it would require selling and buying and would leave you with more cash on hand unless you execute additional trades.\n\nNext steps (optional)\n- If you’d like, I can simulate a few rebalancing scenarios (e.g., aiming for exact 20% per stock without changing total cash, or adjusting weights with a modest cash buffer) and show the resulting holdings, cash needs, and new weights.\n- If you want to maintain the current posture, you’re effectively sitting near a balanced 5-way allocation with a tiny cash cushion.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
