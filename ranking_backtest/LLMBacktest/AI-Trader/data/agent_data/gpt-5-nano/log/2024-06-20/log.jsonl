This is a balanced, diversified posture.\n- If your objective is to maintain near-equal exposure, you’re already close. With current cash of only 22.15, it’s not practical to rebalance meaningfully toward exact 20% targets without a larger cash build.\n- Action today: No trades are required given the small cash amount and balanced exposure. Monitor performance and consider disciplined rebalancing if a larger cash buffer accumulates or if you want to tilt toward a thesis (e.g., adding more to a name you have higher conviction in, or rotating out of a laggard).\n\nIf you’d like, I can model a targeted rebalancing plan (e.g., aiming for exact 20% per holding) given a hypothetical cash inflow, or set price-alert-driven triggers for rebalancing. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
