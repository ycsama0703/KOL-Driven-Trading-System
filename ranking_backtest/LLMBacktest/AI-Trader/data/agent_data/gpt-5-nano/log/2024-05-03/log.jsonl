Fractional shares aren’t assumed available here, so no new buys can be executed today without reallocating existing shares.\n- KO remains unheld (0 shares), so there is no exposure to that ticker today.\n\nPotential next steps (optional)\n- If you want to rebalance toward a tighter 25% each among current four holdings, you’d need additional cash to buy more of the lagging-weight stock (XOM is ~23.6%, HPQ ~25.1%, NKE ~25.0%, PFE ~26.3%). With more cash, you could add to XOM to push toward ~25% of the holdings value.\n- If you’re aiming to maximize returns, consider a watchlist screen for fundamental catalysts (dividend stability, earnings revisions, free cash flow) to identify which of these four might outperform on a longer horizon, then deploy cash when available.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
