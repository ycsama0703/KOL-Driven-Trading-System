If you want more balance, we could consider trimming HPQ or adding to other positions to target a broader diversification (e.g., ~25% per core position or a more equal 4-way mix).\n- Value orientation: The four holdings (HPQ, NKE, PFE, XOM) have a roughly 2:1:1:1 weight distribution by market value, with cash a small buffer.\n- If you’d like, I can run a quick rebalancing plan to target specific weights (e.g., equal weights across the four names, or risk-adjusted weights based on volatility and fundamentals).\n\nWould you like me to propose a rebalancing plan (target weights, suggested trades, and expected cash impact) or run a few alternative scenarios (e.g., adding a fifth position or increasing cash reserves)? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
