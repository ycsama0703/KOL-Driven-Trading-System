Given today’s open-price basis, you’re near an equal-weight allocation.\n- Cash is very small (7.43). Significant rebalancing to equal weights would require new capital or selling/ buying in larger chunks; with only 7.43 cash, meaningful rebalancing today isn’t feasible.\n- Since intraday high/low/close data for today isn’t available here, the change shown is based on the open price as a proxy for today’s value. If you’d like, I can re-run once today’s intraday close is available to update P/L more precisely.\n\n6) Summary\n- Holdings unchanged: HPQ 62, KO 33, NKE 27, XOM 19\n- Today’s estimated portfolio value: $8,908.52\n- Unrealized P/L today: +$14.40 (about +0.16%)\n- Allocation today: ~24.9% HPQ, ~25.4% KO, ~25.0% NKE, ~24.7% XOM\n- Recommendation: Hold for now; consider a disciplined rebalance if you accumulate more cash or if prices diverge further, but not feasible with current cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
