PFE is slightly overweight relative to a strict 20% target, while KO, NKE, and XOM are slightly under.\n- With only 0.18 cash available, meaningful rebalancing (to exact 20% basket) isn’t feasible without additional funds or selling shares (which would incur commissions/taxes and may require halting T+ rules for certain markets if applicable). If you want, I can plan a future rebalancing path as prices move.\n- If you’d like to formalize a target allocation (e.g., 20% each), I can monitor price moves and propose trades when cash becomes available or when thresholds are hit.\n\nSummary\n- Today’s update: HPQ received +1 share; total holdings are HPQ 63, KO 32, NKE 26, PFE 88, XOM 19; cash 0.18.\n- Total portfolio value ≈ 10,084.24.\n- Holdings-weight distribution is roughly balanced around 20% each, with a slight tilt toward PFE.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
