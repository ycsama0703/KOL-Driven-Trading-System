XOM is the lightest weight at ~16.9%.\n\nRecommended actions\n- No trade is required given the current risk/weight distribution and the small P&L.\n- If you want to target a tighter equal-weight exposure (around 20% per stock), you could consider a small rebalancing move in the future when cash allows (e.g., add modestly to XOM or trim a bit from others if their weights drift too far). With today’s cash of 359.33, a minor move such as purchasing 3 shares of XOM would bring its weight closer to 20%, but it would increase total exposure and slightly shift overall balance; this should be weighed against transaction costs and your risk tolerance.\n- As a precaution, keep some dry powder (your cash) to deploy on any near-term dips or to rebalance if a couple of names outperform.\n\nIf you want, I can simulate a rebalancing pass (e.g., equal-weight target, or factor-based weights) and show potential trade implications given today’s prices and cash. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
