For example, equal-weight target around 20% each would imply ~2,088 value per stock (based on current total). Subtle adjustments would be needed given the cash constraint (0.65% cash) and round-lot limitations.\n- If you’re focusing on dividend yield, you could compare current yields of these five names and rebalance toward higher-yield candidates if that’s part of your strategy.\n- If you want, I can propose concrete trade plans (buy/sell ideas with approximate share counts) to move toward a specified target allocation and then execute them.\n\nIf you’d like me to rebalance toward an explicit target allocation (e.g., equal weight, or a value-weighted scheme), tell me the target and I’ll compute the trades and, if desired, place them. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
