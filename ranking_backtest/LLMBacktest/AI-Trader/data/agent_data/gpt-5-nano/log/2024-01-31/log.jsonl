Consider a minor rebalancing only if you want to tighten to exact 20% per name; the current deviations are small.\n- Optional risk/position tweaks (not required):\n  - If you want a slight tilt toward growth, consider modestly increasing NKE or HPQ exposure if you’ve got a higher risk tolerance and a favorable view on consumer staples/retail resilience.\n  - If you prefer defense, you could blend in a bit more XOM or PFE on a longer-term conviction basis, since their weights are already near target and the P/L is modest.\n\n7) Next steps\n- If you’d like, I can place targeted rebalancing orders to trim/boost specific names to exact weights (e.g., +/- 1-2% to align to 20% each), subject to trading costs and any market timing considerations.\n- I can also set price alerts or a quarterly rebalancing plan to keep the portfolio near a fixed target allocation.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
