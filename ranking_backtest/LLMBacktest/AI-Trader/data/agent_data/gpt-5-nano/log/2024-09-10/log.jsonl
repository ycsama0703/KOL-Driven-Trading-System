The exact trades would depend on whether you want to adjust via buys or sells and how precise you want to be. Rough idea:\n  - To move toward roughly 25% per stock (2131.23 value per stock given total ~8,524.91), you would:\n    - Increase HPQ by a few dollars’ worth (a small number of shares at HPQ price ~32.57)\n    - Increase KO by a small amount (a small number of shares at ~69.28)\n    - Increase NKE by a small amount (a small number of shares at ~77.76)\n    - Decrease XOM slightly (sell a small number of shares at ~110.03)\n  - Actual shares to adjust would need to be integer multiples that fit your trading constraints and available cash. If you want, I can propose a concrete set of buy/sell orders to align closer to a 25% each target and run the math to minimize transaction impact.\n\n7) Next steps\n- If you’re comfortable with the current balance, we can simply monitor and occasionally rebalance as prices move.\n- If you’d like an automatic rebalancing rule (e.g., keep each stock within +/-1% of 25% and adjust with minimal trades), I can outline and simulate that.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
