This is close to a five-way equal-weight distribution.\n- If you’re aiming for strict equal-weighting, you could consider small rebalancing moves later (as cash permits) to nudge KO, which is currently a very small weight, toward the 20–25% target range.\n- Given the cash on hand is minimal (11.94), any rebalancing would require future contributions or a reallocation from a current holding.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Rebalance toward an exact target (e.g., ~25% each for the five stocks) when cash becomes available, or\n- Propose a lightweight monitoring plan (e.g., notify on a >2% move per stock, or alert if any stock deviates from target by >3% in a day), or\n- Add additional positions to broaden diversification while keeping a similar risk profile?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
