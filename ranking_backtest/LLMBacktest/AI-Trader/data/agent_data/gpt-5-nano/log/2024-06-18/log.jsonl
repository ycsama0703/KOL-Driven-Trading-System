A small rebalancing move could be:\n  - Small buy to PFE or small sell from NKE/XOM/KO to tilt toward 20% each.\n- Given the small cash cushion (22.15), any rebalancing would likely require selling a small amount of one holding and reallocating to PFE, or withdrawing cash for a minor reweighting.\n- No drastic changes are warranted unless you have a new view on these sectors; all five positions have relatively balanced exposure.\n\nNext steps (optional)\n- If you want, I can compute a precise new target allocation assuming a 20% target per stock and generate suggested buy/sell quantities that use available cash (or propose a small sell to free cash for a cleaner rebalance).\n- I can also monitor today’s intraday prices and flag any material moves that would change the recommended reweighting.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
