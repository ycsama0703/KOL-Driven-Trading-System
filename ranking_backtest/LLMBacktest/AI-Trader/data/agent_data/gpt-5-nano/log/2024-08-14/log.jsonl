If you aim for a more precise 20% target per stock, you could consider small rebalances within cash limits.\n- If you want to rebalance toward equal weights (60% in five names, 40% cash is not the case; current cash is ~1%), you’d need additional cash or to reallocate from one or more positions. The current cash is tight for a full 20% target rebalance, but minor adjustments could be possible (e.g., shift some weight from XOM or PFE to HPQ or KO).\n- Consider setting a watchlist around catalysts for HPQ and KO to decide whether to trim or add on dips, given both are around 20% weight with similar risk profiles.\n\nIf you’d like, I can run a quick rebalance calculation to move toward a specific target (e.g., equal weights among the five holdings, or a 25/25/25/15/10 split) given the current cash, and propose the exact trades. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
