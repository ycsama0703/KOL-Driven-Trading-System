The position updated to PFE: 78 shares (77 + 1).\n\n5) Today’s valuations with updated holdings\n- HPQ: 65 × 374.36 = 24,333.40\n- KO: 30 × 69.70 = 2,091.00\n- NKE: 27 × 78.89 = 2,130.03\n- PFE: 78 × 27.39 = 2,136.42\n- XOM: 19 × 109.24 = 2,075.56\n- Holdings subtotal: 32,766.41\n- Cash after purchase: 196.42 (223.97 - 27.39)\n- Total portfolio today: 32,962.83\n\n6) Updated portfolio weights (based on today’s values)\n- HPQ: 24,333.40 / 32,962.83 ≈ 73.89%\n- KO: 2,091.00 / 32,962.83 ≈ 6.34%\n- NKE: 2,130.03 / 32,962.83 ≈ 6.46%\n- PFE: 2,136.42 / 32,962.83 ≈ 6.48%\n- XOM: 2,075.56 / 32,962.83 ≈ 6.30%\n- Cash: 196.42 / 32,962.83 ≈ 0.60%\n\n7) Observations and quick take\n- After the PFE purchase, the portfolio value is essentially flat relative to yesterday (slight net change due to the cash outlay versus the price movement on the added share).\n- The concentration is still heavily in HPQ (~74%), with the other five positions each around 6–6.5% (including cash at ~0.6%). If you want to diversify more, you could target a higher allocation to the mid-cap/tech names or add a small cap/alternative to reduce concentration risk.\n\nNext steps (optional)\n- If you’d like, I can propose a rebalancing plan to target a different allocation (e.g., equal weights across the five tickers, or a split like 60% HPQ, 15% KO, 10% NKE, 10% PFE, 5% XOM, etc.) and simulate the cash impact.\n- I can also compute a rough P/L for each position if you provide cost basis details; otherwise I’ll use approximate cost basis inferred from past trades.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
