This is a reasonably diversified mix for a smaller cash buffer.\n\nPotential actions I’d consider (optional, if you want to adjust now)\n- If you want a more explicit target allocation (e.g., equal weights, or weight by sector risk), I can propose a rebalancing plan and simulate the trades.\n- Given the tiny cash cushion, you might want to keep reserves for fees or future opportunities, or adjust to a larger cash buffer if you anticipate near-term risk or volatility.\n\nWould you like me to propose a target allocation and a potential rebalancing path, or keep the current weights as-is? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
