The portfolio already sits close to an equal-weight stance across the five names.\n- If you want to tighten to a strict 20% target per name, you’d need to add cash (or rebalance by selling some shares and raising cash to buy others). With 0.15% cash headroom, it isn’t practical to rebalance meaningfully today.\n- Potential next-step ideas (pending your strategy):\n  - If you’re aiming for a more diversified cross-sector profile, consider introducing a fourth-five additional name in a different sector (e.g., financials or utilities) when cash or price moves create a more favorable entry point.\n  - If you’d prefer to maintain the current five-name diversification, you could set a target to rebalance only when a holding drifts meaningfully from its 20% target (e.g., +/- 2–3 percentage points), at which point you would need to allocate enough cash to adjust by several shares.\n  - Monitor price movements: small changes in price will slowly shift weights due to the near-equal position sizes; keep an eye on any stock that moves significantly relative to the others.\n\nIf you want, I can run a scenario analysis (e.g., what happens to weights if HPQ rises 5% or XOM falls 3%), or propose a concrete rebalancing plan with estimated buy/sell quantities once you specify a target weight or a new stock to include.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
