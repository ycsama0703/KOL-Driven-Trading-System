Given your cash of 32.22, there isn’t enough to meaningfully rebalance without selling some shares or adding funds. For example, adding money to XOM would require buying whole shares and would push other weights off further unless you adjust multiple positions.\n- If you’re comfortable tolerating small drift, maintain the current stance. If you’d like, I can model a targeted rebalancing plan assuming you specify a cash usage level (e.g., convert a certain amount of cash into one or more stocks, or reduce one or two positions by a few shares).\n\nNotes:\n- Values are based on yesterday’s closing prices (as listed in your “Current value” data). If you want intraday or today’s open in the calculation, I can fetch those and provide an updated figure.\n- If you have a cost basis for each position, I can compute unrealized P/L and today’s P/L more precisely.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
