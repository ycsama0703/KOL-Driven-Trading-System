The current snapshot indicates the positions did not reflect those exact adjustments, so I can retry with precise parameters if you’d like.\n\n7) Next steps (options)\n- Rebalance toward target allocation: If you have a preferred target allocation by stock or sector, I can propose a concrete plan and place orders accordingly.\n- Adjust risk: Consider modest hedges or diversify into additional sectors to reduce single-sector concentration.\n- Performance review: If you’d like, I can run a simple performance check versus a benchmark (e.g., SPY) and suggest tweaks.\n\nIf you want me to re-submit the requested trades with specific price or order type (market vs. limit) and confirm quantities, tell me your preferences and I’ll execute. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
