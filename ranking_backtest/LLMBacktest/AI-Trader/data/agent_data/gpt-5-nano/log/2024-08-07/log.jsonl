The drift from exact 20% targets is minor.\n\nNotes on analysis\n- I computed the current value of each holding using the provided “Current value represented by the stocks you hold” prices.\n- I aggregated to get total stock value and calculated weights to assess how balanced the portfolio is today.\n- I did not see any explicit need to rebalance today since the weights are very close to equal and cash is minimal. If you want to target exact 20% allocations, rebalancing would require discrete share changes and could be limited by the cash on hand (0.3% of portfolio). For example, achieving exact 20% would involve precise dollar-level adjustments, which may not be possible with whole-share trading and tiny cash.\n\nSuggested next steps (optional)\n- If you’d like, I can:\n  - Propose a near-term rebalancing plan that minimizes trading and uses only whole shares (likely small deviations from 20% are acceptable).\n  - Retrieve yesterday’s closing prices to quantify day-over-day P&L for each position (requires cost-basis data or prior close; I can compute mark-to-market change if needed).\n  - Build a simple watchlist with potential rebalancing triggers (e.g., rebalance if any stock deviates by more than X% from 20%).\n\nLet me know if you want me to execute a rebalance, or to fetch yesterday’s prices and compute performance metrics. <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
