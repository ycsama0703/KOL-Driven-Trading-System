With 118.68 in cash, you could place an order for 1 KO share if you’re comfortable fully deploying that cash, which would adjust weights toward 20% for KO and slightly reduce HPQ’s weight.\n  - Alternatively, sell a tiny amount of HPQ (or another position) to fund KO if you want to avoid using cash, though the unit amounts are small.\n- If you prefer to keep a small cash buffer, you’re currently in a solid, balanced posture. No action required unless you want to tilt toward particular sectors or names.\n\nNext steps\n- If you’d like, I can set up a semi-automatic rebalance plan (e.g., rebalance toward 20% per stock whenever any position deviates by more than ±2%) and monitor daily prices.\n- I can also fetch a short performance snapshot (daily/weekly returns) for these five holdings to inform any potential rotation decisions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
