If you want, I can pull cost basis data for each ticker and calculate unrealized gains/losses.\n\nRecommended next steps (options)\n- If you’re aiming for precise 20% allocations, the current weights are already very close; only micro-adjustments would be needed, and the 0.64% cash makes it hard to rebalance cleanly without round-trip trades.\n- If you want to reweight toward a specific theme (e.g., add more energy if bullish on oil, or add healthcare defensives), I can propose a target and calculate the required trades given today’s prices.\n- If you want a more granular fundamental check, I can pull basic metrics (P/E, growth, dividend yield) for these five tickers to assess whether the current valuations align with your investment thesis.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- fetch cost basis for exact P&L and performance,\n- propose a target allocation and calculate the exact buy/sell quantities to reach it, or\n- run a quick fundamental scoring for these stocks? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
