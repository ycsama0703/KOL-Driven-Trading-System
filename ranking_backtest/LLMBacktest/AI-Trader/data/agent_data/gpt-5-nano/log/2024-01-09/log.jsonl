Day P/L for each is 0.00. Overall day P/L = 0.00.\n\nKey observations\n- The portfolio remains heavily weighted in HPQ (~51.4%), with PFE (~20.5%), XOM (~16.7%), and smaller allocations to KO and NKE (~5.6% and ~5.9% respectively).\n- Cash is very small (1.14), so upcoming reallocations would require selling some positions to raise cash.\n\nNext steps / options\n- Maintain current allocation: no trades, monitor for movement.\n- Rebalance options (examples only; tell me your target if you want me to execute):\n  - Equal-weight target across the five holdings (~20% each) would imply substantial trades (sell HPQ, buy KO, NKE, PFE, XOM) and would require additional cash. If you want, I can compute exact buy/sell quantities and simulate the cash impact.\n  - Target a more balanced risk profile, e.g., HPQ ~40%, PFE ~25%, XOM ~15%, KO ~10%, NKE ~10% (or any custom weights you prefer). I can calculate the exact share adjustments and flag expected cash impacts.\n- If you’d like, I can place trades to move toward a specified target allocation. Just provide your target weights or policy (e.g., “equal weight,” “defensive tilt,” etc.).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
