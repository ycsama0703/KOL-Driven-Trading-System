For example, adding about 0.8 shares of XOM would move its weight closer to 25%, but you can only buy whole shares. A precise tweak would require more cash or reallocation from one of the other positions.\n- If you want to diversify beyond these four names, we could plan a modest new position in a different sector (e.g., tech, healthcare, or utilities) to reduce sector concentration.\n- If you’re targeting a specific risk profile (e.g., higher growth, lower volatility, or more defensive), I can propose a rebalancing plan and compute exact trade quantities given your cash constraints.\n\nWould you like me to run a concrete rebalancing plan (e.g., aiming for roughly 25% in each of HPQ, KO, NKE, XOM, while keeping cash minimal), or would you prefer to keep the current allocation and explore adding a new position to diversify? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
