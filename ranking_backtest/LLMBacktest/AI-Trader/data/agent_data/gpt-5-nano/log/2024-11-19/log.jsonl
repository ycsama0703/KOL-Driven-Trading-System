With fractional shares not allowed in many setups, the minimum rebalancing step would be to buy 1 more NKE (72.88) or sell 1 XOM (115.51) and adjust cash accordingly. However, doing this would likely reduce total value today due to price differences and should be weighed against your long-term goals.\n- A practical approach is to set a rebalancing rule (e.g., rebalance when one stock deviates by more than 5 percentage points from a target 50/50 stock allocation) and only act when there is sufficient cash or when price moves provide an economically sensible trade.\n\nIf you want, I can set up a periodic watch or run a tiny rebalancing pass based on a specific rule (e.g., rebalance when weights deviate beyond a threshold or when cash exceeds a certain amount).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
