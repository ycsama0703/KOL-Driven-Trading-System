The small deviations are due to price movements from yesterday’s close to today’s open.\n- With only 28.06 cash, there isn’t enough to buy even 1 share of HPQ (price ≈ 35.69). The cash position is tight for any new purchases today.\n- If you want to rebalance toward an exact 20% per name, you would typically require additional cash or adjust by selling a small number of shares and buying another to hit exact targets. For example, a precise rebalancing would require fractional shares or more cash, since the nearest affordable adjustments would still not be possible with current cash.\n- No trades are recommended today given cash constraints and near-ideal equal weighting. If you’d like, I can simulate rebalancing scenarios (e.g., selling a small number of shares and using the proceeds to adjust weights) and show the impact on total value and weights.\n\n5) Quick summary\n- Today’s portfolio value (open prices): ~$10,465.80\n- Yesterday’s portfolio value (close prices): ~$10,454.88\n- Daily P/L: +$10.92\n- Current weights: HPQ ~19.8%, KO ~19.9%, NKE ~20.1%, XOM ~19.8%, PFE ~20.1%\n- Cash available: $28.06\n- Action: No trade today due to insufficient cash for meaningful new positions; portfolio is well balanced. If you want, I can run rebalancing scenarios or plan small adjustments for the next opportunity when cash allows.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also fetch end-of-day close data for today (11-13) when it’s available to finalize the day’s close valuation and P/L.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
