For example, modestly adjusting positions with +/− 1 share in certain names (keeping in mind price and liquidity) to move toward equal-weight targets. I can calculate a precise set of trades and estimated cash impact if you want.\n- Monitor for sector diversification: this set is diversified across consumer, pharma, and energy, but you could consider aligning with a broader sector strategy if desired.\n\nCurrent state recap\n- HPQ: 66 shares\n- KO: 30 shares\n- NKE: 27 shares\n- PFE: 78 shares\n- XOM: 19 shares\n- CASH: 162.99\n- Total portfolio value: 10,942.05\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
