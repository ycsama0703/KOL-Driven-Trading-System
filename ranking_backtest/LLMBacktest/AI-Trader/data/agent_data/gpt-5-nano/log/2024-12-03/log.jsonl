The biggest deviation is HPQ being slightly underweight and PFE slightly overweight on a value basis, but the differences are small.\n- With only 138.57 cash, there isn’t enough to buy an additional full share of any of these stocks without compromising the target weights. If you want to rebalance, you could:\n  - Wait for a price move to rebalance passively (let holdings drift toward target), or\n  - Add cash to a larger recurring contribution plan and rebalance gradually over time, or\n  - Occasionally adjust by small sells/buys when price moves create a clearer deviation (note: due to whole-share lots, exact 25% targets are approximate with integer-share trading).\n- Data note: Today’s update used opening prices for valuation since today’s intraday high/low/close data isn’t fully available. If you’d like, I can recompute using today’s actual close once it’s published.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Propose a concrete rebalancing plan (e.g., target 25% in each stock and 0% cash, or keep 1–2% cash, etc.) and show the exact trades needed once you confirm target weights.\n- Monitor prices and alert you if any stock deviates by a chosen threshold (e.g., >2% from target weight).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
