The current weights are already fairly balanced (within roughly ±1 percentage point of 20% for each). A full exact rebalancing would require about $205 of additional value to bring all five to exactly 20% of the total, which your cash of $190.29 can’t fully cover in a single round of whole-share trades.\n- If you’re aiming for strict equal-weighting, you could plan a gradual rebalancing over the next few days (potentially using fractional shares if your broker supports them) to approach the target. Alternatively, you could leave the portfolio as-is since the deviation is small and the diversification is reasonable.\n\nSuggested next steps (options)\n- Option A (no trades today): Maintain the current positions. The weights are close to target; monitor price moves and cash level. Rebalance can be revisited when there is price action or additional cash.\n- Option B (gradual rebalancing, with fractional shares if allowed): Target roughly 20% per holding by deploying the $190.29 cash toward the under-weighted names (KO, NKE, XOM). With only whole shares, spread the cash carefully (e.g., small number of share increments) and recheck after price movement—this will inch you closer to equal weights without overextending.\n- Option C (partial rebalancing with current cash): If you want a simple, executable plan today, you could allocate the cash to modestly overweight the smallest deviation underweights (e.g., poke a small buy in KO or NKE) and see how the weights settle with next price update.\n\nNotes on cost basis and P&L\n- I don’t have your cost basis for each ticker, so I can’t compute realized/unrealized gains or losses today. If you provide purchase prices or yesterday’s cost basis per position, I can calculate day-to-day P&L and percentage changes.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Execute a small, predefined rebalancing step (e.g., allocate cash to one or two underweight holdings using whole shares), or\n- Set up a plan to rebalance gradually as prices move or as you add more cash, or\n- Pull a P&L update once you share cost bases for these positions?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
