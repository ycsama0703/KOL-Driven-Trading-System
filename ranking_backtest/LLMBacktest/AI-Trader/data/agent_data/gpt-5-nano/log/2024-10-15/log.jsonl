Without additional cash, a strict rebalancing to exact 20% targets would be difficult (and unnecessary given current closeness to 20% each).\n- If you want to maintain an exact 20% per stock going forward, you would need to add cash or liquidate a portion of one or more positions to fund equal reallocations. With the current cash, you could only buy whole shares if you sell other holdings to fund increases.\n- Given a buy/sell constraint (integer shares), and tiny cash, the best action is to maintain the current allocations unless your strategic view changes.\n\nPotential next steps (optional)\n- If you expect continued flat-to-upside in these five names, keep the current balanced stance and wait for new cash inflow to rebalance.\n- If you want more conservative risk control, consider introducing a defensive stock/sector or cash buffer when new funds come in, to diversify away from near-equal weights.\n- Set price-driven targets if you have a view (e.g., trims on overperformance, adds on pullbacks) to maintain balance over time.\n\nOperational note\n- No trades executed today since the portfolio is balanced and cash is minimal. If you’d like, I can simulate a rebalancing plan given a new cash inflow or a target adjustment (e.g., add one new name or adjust weights).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
