Current weights are already near target (~20% each). The available cash isn’t enough to meaningfully rebalance without skewing another position.\n\nOptional next steps (if you want to act)\n- If you’d like to nudge weights toward exactly 20% for all, we’d need more cash or to plan a staged rebalance over multiple trades as cash accumulates.\n- As a micro-step, you could earmark a small future purchase (e.g., add to the lowest-weight position when extra cash becomes available) to approach equal weighting gradually.\n- If you want to diversify beyond these five, we could target a new stock with a low price per share (to maximize purchasing power with small cash) and set a small starter position.\n\nIf you’d like, I can set up a plan to rebalance automatically as cash grows or price moves create drift beyond a threshold.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
