The small negative P/L in HPQ and NKE vs the positive move in XOM slightly shifts the balance, but overall weights remain near equal.\n- If you want to tilt toward higher quality/defensive exposure or reduce concentration risk, you could consider rebalancing (e.g., trim HPQ or NKE a bit and allocate to XOM if you’re comfortable with energy exposure). If you prefer to maintain equal weights, no action is needed beyond monitoring.\n\n8) Next steps\n- Confirm whether to rebalance toward an explicit target weight (e.g., equal weights, or a conservative/defensive tilt).\n- Set price alerts for HPQ/NKE if you want to act on a nearing resistance/support or a larger move.\n- If you want, I can propose specific buy/sell quantities to rebalance to a chosen target and execute them.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
