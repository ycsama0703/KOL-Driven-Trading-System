No trades needed today.\n- If you want to systematically rebalance to exact 20% targets, a modest reallocation could be considered, but given current near-equal weights, this isn’t urgent.\n- Maintain monitoring; consider rebalancing only if a stock drifts by more than a few percentage points from target weights or if a strategic view changes (e.g., sector tilt, risk tolerance).\n\nNext steps (optional)\n- Would you like me to set an explicit target weight (e.g., exactly 20% per holding) and calculate the necessary trades if deviations exceed a threshold?\n- Should I run a simple scenario analysis (e.g., 5–10% move in any one name) to see how it impacts weights and total return?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
