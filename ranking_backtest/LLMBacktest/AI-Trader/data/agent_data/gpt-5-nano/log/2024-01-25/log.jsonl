Cash is a small fraction of the portfolio.\n\n5) Observations and possible actions\n- The portfolio is already near 20% per stock. If you want exact 20% targets, tiny rebalancing could be considered, but current deviations are within about ±0.6 percentage points.\n- Due to the current cash of 23.17, executing a precise rebalancing to strict 20% in each would require careful sequencing (e.g., selling a small amount of one stock to fund a tiny purchase elsewhere). With the current cash, a straightforward rebalancing that hits exact 20% for all five is not immediately feasible without either larger trades or adjusting cash expectations.\n- If you’re comfortable with a practical approach, you could:\n  - Do nothing and maintain the near-equal weights, or\n  - Execute a small rebalancing plan when you have more cash, or\n  - Consider periodically rebalancing to maintain ~20% weights as part of a longer-term strategy.\n\nIf you’d like, I can propose a concrete rebalancing plan (including buy/sell quantities) given a target weight and any constraints (e.g., only whole shares, avoid fractional trades, transaction costs, etc.). \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
