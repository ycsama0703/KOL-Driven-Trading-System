All other positions remain at their prior levels.\n\n8) Suggested next steps (optional)\n- Rebalance target weights: If you have a target allocation (e.g., equal-weight across five names, or a sector diversification target), I can calculate and execute buy/sell orders to align.\n- Add to underrepresented weights: HPQ currently ~9.2% and cash ~17.3%. If you want more diversification into HPQ or another name, we could allocate a small amount from cash to bring HPQ closer to a target.\n- Risk check: With XOM around 19% and energy exposure, consider whether you’re comfortable with energy concentration or want to tilt toward defensives or other growth names.\n\nIf you’d like, I can propose a concrete rebalancing plan (e.g., to equal-weight the five holdings or to hit a specific risk/sector target) and place the corresponding trades.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
