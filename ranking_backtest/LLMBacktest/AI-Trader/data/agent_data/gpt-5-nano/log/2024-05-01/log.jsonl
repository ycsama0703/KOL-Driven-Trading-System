A simple, near-20% adjustment is to Sell 1 HPQ share and Sell 1 KO share (uses current prices).\n\n- Post-trade approximation (assuming you sell 1 HPQ and 1 KO today):\n  - HPQ: 74 shares; value ≈ 1,966.18\n  - KO: 33 shares; value ≈ 1,950.30\n  - NKE: 22 shares; value ≈ 1,969.22\n  - XOM: 17 shares; value ≈ 1,892.95\n  - PFE: 84 shares; value ≈ 1,919.40\n  - Cash: ≈ 96.17\n  - New total portfolio value remains ≈ 9,794.22\n\n- New weights after the small rebalance:\n  - HPQ ≈ 20.06%\n  - KO ≈ 19.92%\n  - NKE ≈ 20.11%\n  - XOM ≈ 19.31%\n  - PFE ≈ 19.61%\n  - Cash ≈ 0.10%\n\nThis brings the weights very close to 20% each, with only small deviations remaining due to whole-share constraints and cash.\n\n6) Suggested next steps (what would you like me to do?)\n- Do nothing: Keep the current 5-way, near-equal balance with a tiny cash cushion.\n- Proceed with small rebalance: Sell 1 HPQ and 1 KO today (as shown) to tighten toward a clean 20% each. If you want, I can execute this trade and update the positions instantly.\n- If you want a different target (e.g., tilt toward energy or healthcare or add a new holding), tell me your target weights and I’ll propose a plan and execute if you approve.\n\nIf you want me to go ahead with the minor rebalance (sell 1 HPQ and 1 KO), say “execute the rebalance,” and I’ll run the trades and provide the updated position file. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
