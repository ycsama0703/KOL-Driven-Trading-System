A small rebalancing could be considered. Example approaches:\n  - Approach A (minimal trades): Sell 1 HPQ, 1 KO, and 1 NKE to free cash (~185.73) and buy 1 XOM (~111.94). This would move weights closer to equal while keeping cash still available.\n  - Approach B (more precise): Recalculate to achieve near 25% per name and adjust by a combination of buys/sells (likely a mix of 1–2 shares among the four; exact lots depend on current prices and desired precision). This would bring XOM closer to parity but would require monitoring intraday price changes.\n\nRecommendation\n- Given the current near-equal distribution, consider a gentle rebalance only if you want strict 25% exposure per name. Otherwise, maintain the positions as is and monitor intraday moves toward your target allocations.\n\nIf you want, I can place a rebalance order (e.g., the Approach A suggested) and update positions accordingly. Just say the word. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
