However, with discrete share sizes, you’ll likely overshoot or undershoot by a small amount. A practical approach is to keep the cash for liquidity and potential selective additions (e.g., a new name or sector ETF) if you want diversification beyond the five.\n- If you’re comfortable with a slight tilt toward PFE, you could allocate the cash to modestly adjust weights in small increments over time.\n\nWould you like me to run a targeted rebalancing pass (e.g., move toward equal weights including cash as a separate bucket, subject to lot-size constraints), or propose a new target allocation (e.g., 60/20/20 across three sectors or a 50/50 stock/cash mix)? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
