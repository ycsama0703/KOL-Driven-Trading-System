Current deviations are small but not exact due to integer-share constraints and price steps. I can run a rebalance simulation (and even execute trades) to bring the weights closer to a chosen target (e.g., equal weights, or a sector-weighted target) and show the required buy/sell quantities in shares, along with updated cash impact.\n- If you prefer a different objective (maximize expected return, maintain diversification, or tilt toward a specific sector), I can propose and implement a targeted rebalancing plan accordingly.\n\nFinal note\n- If you’d like, I can run a precise rebalancing model (equal-weight, or another target) and, if you approve, execute the trades and report the new positions and cash balance. For now, here is the updated snapshot of today’s valuation and weights. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
