Given the current small deviations, Global rebalancing may not be worth the transaction costs.\n- If you prefer to maintain the exact 20% target including cash, you could:\n  - Sell a small number of HPQ shares to trim ~0.60 percentage points of HPQ (roughly 1–2 shares, depending on price and execution), and\n  - Use the proceeds to buy underweight positions (KO or NKE) in small increments, monitoring price changes to avoid overtrading.\n  Note: With current prices, achieving exact 20% weights would require fractional shares or modest cash adjustments; practical execution would depend on your broker’s share sizing and any transaction costs.\n\nKey takeaway:\n- Your current portfolio is nearly evenly allocated across HPQ, KO, XOM, NKE, and PFE. No urgent action is required, but a light rebalance could shave a few basis points off drift if you want strict 20% targets.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
