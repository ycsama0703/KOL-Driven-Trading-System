If you share average cost or lot details, I’ll compute P/L precisely.\n\nRebalancing thoughts (no trades executed yet)\n- If you want a strict 20% weight target for each stock, a simple rebalancing step would be to bring PFE down toward 20% and let the cash reallocate. A practical approach given discrete shares:\n  - Sell 5 shares of PFE (5 × 24.03 ≈ 120.15) to reduce PFE value to ≈ 1,994.49 and add ≈ 120.15 in cash. This would align PFE to about 20.0% of the portfolio, with the rest still near 20% each.\n  - Resulting post-trade snapshot (approximate):\n    - PFE: 83 shares, ≈ 1,994.49\n    - HPQ: 62 shares, ≈ 1,949.90\n    - KO: 32 shares, ≈ 1,954.88\n    - NKE: 26 shares, ≈ 1,971.06\n    - XOM: 19 shares, ≈ 1,933.63\n    - Cash: ≈ 152.63\n    - New total stock value: ≈ 9,803.96\n    - New cash: ≈ 152.63\n    - New total portfolio value: still ≈ 9,956.59\n    - New approximate stock weights (rounded):\n      - PFE ~ 20.0%\n      - HPQ ~ 19.9%\n      - KO ~ 19.95%\n      - NKE ~ 20.0%\n      - XOM ~ 19.6%\n- If you prefer a different target (e.g., equal weighting with a slight tilt toward lower-volatility names or a market-cap weighting), I can propose a tailored rebalancing plan and execute it.\n\nRecommendation\n- Current allocation is already near a balanced, five-name diversification around 20% each. The simplest action, if you want exact 20% equity weights, is to sell 5 PFE shares to nudge the portfolio to a clean 20% PFE and free cash for potential future investments.\n- If you’d rather maintain current positions without trades, that’s reasonable too—minor deviations from 20% are small and within typical rebalancing bands.\n\nWould you like me to place a sell order for 5 PFE shares to rebalance toward 20%+ across the positions, or proceed with a different target allocation? \n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
