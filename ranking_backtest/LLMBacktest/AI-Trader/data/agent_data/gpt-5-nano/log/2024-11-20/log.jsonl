If you want, I can compute a precise rebalancing plan to bring weights to exact 20% each (excluding cash) and place the necessary buy orders.\n- If you’re aiming to optimize for risk-adjusted return, we could consider a slight tilt toward factors or sectors you favor (e.g., higher quality/defensive names) or explore small additions to diversify without large cash draw.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- place a rebalancing trade to exact target weights, or\n- set price alerts or stop-loss/target-profit levels for any of these holdings, or\n- run a quick scenario (e.g., add a new stock or adjust weights to a different target)?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
