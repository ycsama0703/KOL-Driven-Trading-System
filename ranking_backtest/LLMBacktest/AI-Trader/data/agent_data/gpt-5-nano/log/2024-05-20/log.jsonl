For example, to strictly target 20% per stock including cash, you’d aim for roughly 2,072 per stock (since total is ~10,360). Given current values, HPQ is slightly over target and KO/NKE/XOM/PFE are close; but with only 53.35 cash, any precise rebalancing would require fractional shares or a multi-step trade.\n\nRecommended next steps (options)\n- Do nothing now: You’re already near an equal-weight setup; monitor price moves for drift and rebalance when feasible.\n- Light rebalancing (if you want closer to exact equal weights): Consider selling 1 HPQ share (≈29.68 cash) and allocate to accumulate a tiny increase in one of the under-allocated stocks if you see a favorable setup. Given the current cash, this would be a minor adjustment and may not move weights meaningfully without another trade.\n- Broaden diversification: If your goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, you might consider adding exposure to another uncorrelated sector/stock if you’re comfortable increasing turnover. However, with the current cash level, this would require a larger move or waiting for price dips.\n\nCurrent actionability\n- No mandatory trades required today. Your five holdings are roughly equally weighted, with a small cash cushion.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
