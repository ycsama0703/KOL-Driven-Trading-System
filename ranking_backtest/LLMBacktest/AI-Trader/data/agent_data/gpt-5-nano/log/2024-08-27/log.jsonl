The latest tool response indicates cash around 267.01.\n- HPQ buy 8 shares could not be executed because funds were not enough at the time of attempt.\n\nUpdated positions (after operations):\n- HPQ: 64 shares\n- NKE: 26 shares\n- KO: 31 shares\n- XOM: 18 shares\n- CASH: 267.01\n\nEstimated current value of holdings (using latest prices in your data):\n- NKE: 26 × 82.08 ≈ 2,134.08\n- KO: 31 × 68.30 ≈ 2,117.30\n- XOM: 18 × 113.67 ≈ 2,046.06\n- HPQ: 64 × 33.90 ≈ 2,169.60\n- Holdings total ≈ 8,467.04\n- Cash: ≈ 267.01\n- Total account value ≈ 8,734.05\n\nNotes and next steps:\n- The HPQ 8-share buy was not completed due to insufficient cash. If you want to execute that purchase, you’d need to free up roughly 3.90 more cash (270.64 required vs ~267 available).\n- Potential options:\n  - Rebalance by selling a small number of shares from any one position to fund the HPQ purchase (e.g., 1 NKE or 1 KO or 1 XOM) if you want to maintain a similar risk/weight profile.\n  - Wait for a price move to increase cash flow from existing positions before reattempting the HPQ buy.\n  - Reassess target weights and consider if any positions should be trimmed or rotated.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
