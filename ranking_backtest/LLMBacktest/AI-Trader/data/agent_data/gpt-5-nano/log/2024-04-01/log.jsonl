A small rebalancing could be done if you want to push KO back up and HPQ down to exactly 20% each, but the current split is reasonable.\n- If you’d like, I can run a risk/variance check or suggest stop levels or simple trend-based adjustments given your risk tolerance.\n- Would you like me to set target weights and propose automatic rebalancing triggers (e.g., rebalance when any name deviates by more than ±2%)?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
