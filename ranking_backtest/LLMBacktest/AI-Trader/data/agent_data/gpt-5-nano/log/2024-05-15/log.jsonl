Today’s activity increased cash and nudged weights toward equalization without a large reallocation.\n- With roughly equal weights across five positions, the portfolio is diversified among large-cap names (HPQ, KO, NKE, XOM, PFE) and has a modest cash reserve for opportunistic trades or to fund future additions.\n- P&L perspective: I don’t have your cost basis per lot, so I can’t compute exact realized/unrealized P&L today. If you want, you can provide average cost per lot or cost basis by ticker, and I’ll compute the current P&L and overall return.\n\n11) Quick rebalancing options (if you want to optimize on weights)\n- Option A (maintain near-equal weights with minimal activity): Do nothing now. Cash is ~2% of the portfolio; the current weights are already near 20% per stock.\n- Option B (use cash to nudge toward a stricter equal-weight target): Allocate cash to slightly overweight a few underweight names to bring all holdings closer to exactly 20% of total value. Given you already have ~2% cash, you could:\n  - Example: buy 1 additional NKE share (cost ~90.02) and keep HPQ at 71, KO 33, NKE 23, XOM 18, PFE 79; this would bring holdings closer to 20% each with cash remaining around 112.88.\n  - If you prefer to stay fully cash-efficient, you could instead do a small HPQ sale to rebalance with the existing cash, but since the weights are already close, this is optional.\n- Option C (allocate to a new target or sector): If you’re considering diversification beyond these five, you could deploy part of the cash to a new high-conviction idea (e.g., a different sector or a growth/value tilt), maintaining a similar total exposure.\n\nRecommendation\n- Given today’s actions, the portfolio is balanced and cash is modest. Unless you have a new target or a specific macro view, it’s reasonable to hold as-is and monitor price movements. If you want, I can compute a precise rebalancing plan to hit an exact 20% weight for each stock using the available cash, including exact buy quantities (rounded to whole shares).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
