If you’d like, I can propose a couple of rebalancing scenarios and place trades accordingly.\n\nWhat would you like me to do next?\n- Commit to a target weight (e.g., equal-weight, or ESG-focused, or value-biased) and rebalance accordingly?\n- Add more cash into the current holdings (which one to overweight) or initiate new positions?\n- Set alerts or stop-loss/trailing stops for risk management?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
