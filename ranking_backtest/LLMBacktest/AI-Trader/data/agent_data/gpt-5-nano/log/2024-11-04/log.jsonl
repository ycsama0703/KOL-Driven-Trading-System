I can implement a plan if you have a preferred target.\n\nSuggested next steps (optional)\n- Set a rebalance rule (e.g., rebalance quarterly or when a stock deviates >2% from a target, and decide whether to include cash in the target).\n- If you want to pursue higher conviction opportunities, I can propose a watchlist with criteria (growth, value, yield, sector exposure) and simulate trade scenarios given current prices.\n\nWould you like me to activate a simple rebalance rule or simulate a minor, delta-based rebalancing (e.g., move a small amount from the top-weighted to the underweighted position to approach a tighter 25% per stock target)? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
