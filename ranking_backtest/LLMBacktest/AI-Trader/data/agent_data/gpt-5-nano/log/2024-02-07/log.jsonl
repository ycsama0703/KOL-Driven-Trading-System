I can propose a rebalancing plan that uses a combination of small sells and buys once you have more cash available (e.g., from profits or additional funding).\n- If you’re comfortable with the current allocation, you could simply hold and monitor for larger price moves before rebalancing.\n- I can set up a price-alert-based plan to rebalance automatically when cash grows above a threshold (e.g., $500–$1,000) or when one stock drifts by a defined weight (+/−2% from 25%).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Run a proposed rebalancing plan given a target cash influx or target weights.\n- Track one or more of these stocks against set price/trigger thresholds and alert you.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
