If one position drifts meaningfully from ~20% (e.g., >±3-5%), you could rebalance later when more cash is available or if you execute partial-size trades.\n- If you want to change the allocation (e.g., tilt toward a sector or add a new stock/ETF):\n  - Tell me the target allocation and any new assets you want to include, and I’ll map out the trades needed (and the cash impact) to reach those targets.\n\nWould you like me to propose a concrete rebalancing plan (e.g., aim for exact 20% across the five holdings) given a certain additional cash amount, or adjust to a different target allocation and show the required buys/sells? <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
