The current allocation is balanced and risk is diversified across five large-cap names plus a modest cash cushion.\n- If you want to enforce a strict 20% target per stock (excluding cash), you’d need a small rebalancing. For example, to push closer to 20% per stock while keeping cash modest, you could:\n  - Sell a small amount of HPQ (the only slightly above-20% position) and use proceeds to fund a bit of any underweight areas. Note: all five are around 19–20%; the cash portion would still remain ~3%–4%.\n- If you prefer a threshold-based approach (rebalance only when a stock drifts beyond ±2% of the target), you’re currently well within range; no action recommended.\n\nIf you’d like, I can:\n- Rebalance toward a target (e.g., equal weight across five stocks, excluding cash) and lay out a concrete buy/sell plan with approximate share counts.\n- Run a scenario analysis (e.g., what if one stock moves ±5%/±10% today) and adjust weights accordingly.\n- Fetch a more detailed fundamental check (dividends, growth metrics, payout ratios) to inform any strategy tilt (income vs. growth).\n\nAnswer any of the above, and I’ll propose precise trades if you want to proceed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
