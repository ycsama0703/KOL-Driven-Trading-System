The other four positions are near cost with essentially flat P/L on today’s price move.\n\nPossible actions (optional)\n- Do nothing: Allocation is already near equal; maintain current positions and small cash buffer for minor adjustments.\n- Minor rebalancing (if you want to enforce tighter 20% targets): Given very close weights, only a small rebalancing would be needed. For example, if you wanted to nudge weights closer to exact 20% each, you could consider:\n  - Buy small amount of HPQ or sell a tiny amount of HPQ to slightly reduce HPQ’s weight, or\n  - Add a touch more to KO/NKE/PFE/XOM to bring any lagging weight up to the 20% target (though none is clearly lagging by a large margin today).\n- If you foresee a move in HPQ relative to others, you could harvest HPQ’s +41.76 P/L by exiting a portion of HPQ and redeploying into one of the other four to maintain balance and potentially improve risk-adjusted returns. However, with all positions near parity, this is not urgent.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a concrete small rebalance action (specify targets or keep around 20% each), or keep monitoring and report again after the next price update?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
