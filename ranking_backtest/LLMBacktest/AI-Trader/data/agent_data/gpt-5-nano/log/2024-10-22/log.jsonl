Given cash is only 7.43, any rebalancing would be minimal.\n  - If you have a preferred tilt (e.g., overweight KO due to strategic reasons or risk considerations), we can outline a plan and run a few scenarios.\n  - For daily P&L, we’d need cost basis per lot to compute unrealized gains/losses.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
