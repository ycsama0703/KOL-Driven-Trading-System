If you have cost bases for HPQ, NKE, and XOM, I can calculate P/L and the realized vs. unrealized components.\n\nNext steps (options)\n- Rebalance toward target weights (e.g., equal-weight among the three, or a separate target split) if you have a preferred allocation.\n- If you’d like, I can:\n  - Rebalance to exact target weights by placing further trades (requires cash considerations).\n  - Add a new position or reduce risk by introducing/adjusting KO or another stock.\n  - Run a quick risk/return check using recent volatility and correlations (if you provide constraints like max drawdown or target beta).\n\nWould you like me to rebalance toward a specific target allocation, or run a risk/return assessment based on these three holdings? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
