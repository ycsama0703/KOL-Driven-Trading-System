With 2.47% cash, the rebalancing impact is limited, but you could consider small purchases or adjusting targets to account for cash.\n- If your target is to maintain the current equal weights in stocks while holding a small cash buffer, you’re already close to an optimal setup.\n\nWould you like me to propose a specific rebalancing plan (e.g., allocate the cash to bring weights closer to 25% per stock, or adjust to a different target), and execute any trades if you approve? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
