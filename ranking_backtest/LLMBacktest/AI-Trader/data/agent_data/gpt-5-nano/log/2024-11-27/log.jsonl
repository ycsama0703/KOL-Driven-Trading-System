Consider a small rebalancing if you want exact equal weights:\n  - For example, to push toward exact 20% weights, you could buy a small amount of HPQ (or trim a little from the slightly overweight positions) depending on transaction costs and liquidity.\n- If you prefer to maintain a diversified, equal-weight stance, you could keep current allocations and allow drift to be managed gradually over time with periodic rebalancing.\n- No immediate action is required unless you want to rebalance to a strict 20/20/20/20/20 target or to adjust for new risk/return views.\n\nWould you like me to place a rebalancing order to target exact 20% weights across the five holdings, or keep monitoring and rebalance at a later date? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
