This would require more cash or selling some shares.\n- Add a new diversifying position (e.g., a defensive or growth name with low correlation to the current set) if you want broader exposure without sacrificing cash flexibility.\n- Establish target price bands or stop/limit rules to manage downside risk.\n\nIf you want, I can propose a concrete rebalancing plan (quantify target weights, estimate number of shares to trade, and simulate P&L impact) and place trades accordingly.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
