The small cash reserve isn’t enough to meaningfully rebalance toward a tighter target.\n- If you want to enforce strict equal-weighting, you could consider a minor rebalancing when prices move by a few percent, but with only ~100 USD cash, any meaningful rebalancing would require taking on new risk or using leverage, which isn’t advisable.\n- If you’re aiming for a slight tilt toward a particular theme (e.g., energy or healthcare), you could earmark cash for a targeted add-on to that name when the opportunity arises, but keep the rebalancing disciplined to avoid chase.\n\n8) Next steps (optional)\n- I can fetch updated intraday prices again later in the day to refine the intraday valuation and reassess weights.\n- If you want, I can set up a simple rebalancing rule (e.g., rebalance if any stock deviates more than ±2% from 20% target or if cash exceeds 2% of portfolio value) and propose precise buy/sell quantities when triggered.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
