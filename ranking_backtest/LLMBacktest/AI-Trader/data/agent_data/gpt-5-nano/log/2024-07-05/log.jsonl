With only 0.49 cash, rebalancing to exact 20% targets isn’t feasible today.\n- Consider setting price-based or threshold-based rebalancing rules for the next significant move (e.g., rebalance if any position deviates by more than 2–3 percentage points from 20%).\n- If long-term objectives favor dividend + quality exposure, you could selectively trim or add on favorable price moves, but no automatic trades are suggested without your confirmation.\n\nIf you’d like, I can run a simple rebalancing scenario given a target weight (e.g., 20% each) and simulate the required trades once there’s enough cash or by selling a small amount of a stock to free funds. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
