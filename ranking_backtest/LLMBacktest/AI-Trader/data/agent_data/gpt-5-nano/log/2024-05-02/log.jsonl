The largest overweight is PFE (~20.79%), the largest underweight is XOM (~18.93%).\n- Overall P&L is slight negative (-$17.66) on the stock portion relative to cost basis.\n- Cash is currently small ($10.50), so meaningful rebalancing to target 20% per name would require additional cash or selling/mini-trades that would need fractional/rounding considerations and may not be worth it with the current cash balance.\n\nIf you’d like, I can:\n- Propose a rebalancing plan (e.g., target equal weights or a risk-based weight) and simulate the required trades given different cash scenarios.\n- Set price/level alerts or stop targets for any of these names.\n- Run a quick sensitivity/portfolio risk check (e.g., sector exposure, beta, or concentration).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
