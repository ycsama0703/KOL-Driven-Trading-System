This aligns with a simple 5-way equal-weight tilting strategy.\n- If the goal is strict 20% each (including cash as a separate bucket), you’re very close. The cash is small but sufficient to modestly rebalance, though practical rebalancing would require discrete share changes (and could overshoot due to price granularity).\n- No immediate action required given the approach looks balanced and cash is minimal. If you prefer a tighter rebalancing, you could target adding a small number of shares that moves you closer to 20% weights, but current cash (~0.7%) is not enough to neatly rebalance all five without trading implications.\n\n8) Quick comparison of yesterday vs today\n- Holdings and counts remain the same as yesterday.\n- Valuations updated to today’s prices: total portfolio value and per-holdings updated as shown above.\n- Overall portfolio is near neutral with a tiny cash drag.\n\nIf you’d like, I can run a strict rebalancing calculation (e.g., to exactly 20% per stock, with or without including cash) and suggest a concrete buy/sell plan given current prices and lot-size rules. <FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
