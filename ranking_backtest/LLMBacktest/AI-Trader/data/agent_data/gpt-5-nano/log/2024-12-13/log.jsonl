Current values total ~$10,216.19; target per stock ≈ $2,049.68. With 0 cash target, we’d adjust using a mix of buys/sells.\n\nProposed trades to approach ~20% each (using today’s prices)\n- Buy HPQ: +1 share (cost ≈ $33.89)\n- Buy XOM: +1 share (cost ≈ $107.86)\n- Sell KO: -1 share (proceeds ≈ $62.45)\n- Sell NKE: -1 share (proceeds ≈ $76.66)\n- Sell PFE: -2 shares (proceeds ≈ 2 × $23.66 = $47.32)\n\nImpact (approximate)\n- Net cash change: -33.89 + 62.45 + 76.66 - 107.86 - 47.32 ≈ +$0 (roughly neutral; small rounding differences apply)\n- New holdings (after trades)\n  - HPQ: 60 shares\n  - KO: 33 shares\n  - NKE: 26 shares\n  - XOM: 19 shares\n  - PFE: 86 shares\n- New approximate per-stock values (using today’s prices)\n  - HPQ: 60 × 33.89 ≈ $2,033.40\n  - KO: 33 × 62.45 ≈ $2,060.85\n  - NKE: 26 × 76.66 ≈ $1,993.16\n  - XOM: 19 × 107.86 ≈ $2,049.34\n  - PFE: 86 × 23.66 ≈ $2,034.76\n- New stock total ≈ $10,171.51\n- New cash ≈ $76.90\n- New total portfolio ≈ $10,248.41 (conserved within rounding)\n\nNew weights (approximate)\n- HPQ: ~19.93%\n- KO: ~20.17%\n- NKE: ~19.57%\n- XOM: ~20.12%\n- PFE: ~19.89%\n- Cash: ~0.75%\n\nNotes\n- The rebalancing keeps the overall portfolio value intact, but uses more cash if we aim to hit exact 20% targets due to rounding and discrete share counts.\n- If you’d prefer to minimize trading, we can keep the current allocation as is.\n- If you’d like to pursue a different target (e.g., tilt toward sectors or risk metrics), I can tailor the trades accordingly.\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n- Keep current positions as-is\n- Proceed with a rebalance to equal weights (I can execute the trades above)\n- Customize a different target allocation (e.g., add cash buffer, sector tilt, risk parity)\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
