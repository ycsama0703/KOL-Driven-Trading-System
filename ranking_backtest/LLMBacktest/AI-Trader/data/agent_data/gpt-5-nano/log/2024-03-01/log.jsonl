Using open as a proxy for current value is standard when intraday data isn’t provided in this run.\n\nPotential next steps (no action required unless you want to rebalance)\n- With the current cash balance of 10.74, there isn’t a practical way to rebalance toward tighter target weights (no fractional shares; 1-share trades would require ~hundreds of dollars, depending on the stock). If you want to maintain near-equal weights, monitor intraday moves and consider rebalancing when you accumulate more cash.\n- If you have a specific risk/sector target or a different weighting rule (e.g., equal-dollar across positions), I can model a suggested trade plan once more cash is available or when you specify acceptable trade sizes.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also compute the state at market close using updated prices when you have them, or simulate a scenario with a small additional cash inflow to illustrate a potential rebalance. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
