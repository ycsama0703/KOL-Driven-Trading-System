No rebalancing is strictly required given the current distribution.\n- If you want to tighten the weights to a strict 20% target per position, you would need minimal adjustments. For example, buying a small amount of HPQ or KO could nudge weights slightly; selling would push others relatively. With only 7.43 cash, meaningful rebalancing would be limited unless you add funds.\n- No action is necessary right now unless you want to pursue a specific tilting (e.g., overweight defensive names or more growth-oriented names). \n\nSummary\n- Current positions: HPQ 62, KO 33, NKE 27, PFE 82, XOM 19\n- Current value: $10,899.73 in equities + $7.43 cash\n- Total portfolio: $10,907.16\n- Weights: roughly HPQ 19.79%, KO 20.40%, NKE 19.72%, PFE 19.92%, XOM 20.11%, Cash 0.07%\n- P&L since yesterday: 0\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
