We’re near an even-weighted five-position exposure.\n- If you want to restore exact 20% equal weights across the five holdings, you could:\n  - Buy 1 additional HPQ share (approx cost 30.77) to bring HPQ toward 20% of total. This would leave cash ≈ 81.48 and bring HPQ to about 20.1% of the portfolio. Other holdings would remain near 20% each.\n  - After this one-share move, updated approximate weights would be: HPQ ~20.1%, KO ~20.0%, NKE ~20.4%, XOM ~19.7%, PFE ~19.3%, cash ~0.8%.\n- No further trades are required, given the small cash buffer. If you’re risk-averse, you could also hold current levels as they are, since weights are already fairly balanced.\n\n7) Next steps (optional)\n- If you’d like, I can execute a buy of 1 HPQ to nudge toward equal weights and then report the updated positions and P/L.\n- Otherwise, I can monitor intraday price changes and recompute P/L and weights as new data comes in.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
