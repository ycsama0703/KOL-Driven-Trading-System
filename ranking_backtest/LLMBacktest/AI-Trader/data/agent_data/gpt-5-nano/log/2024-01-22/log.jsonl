No immediate rebalancing action is necessary unless you want a strict 1/3 each target.\n- With only 23.17 cash, there isn’t enough to add a new position or to rebalance meaningfully without selling some shares.\n\nData note\n- Yesterday’s price data for certain symbols (HPQ, KO, NKE, PFE, XOM) was not fully available in the dataset, so day-over-day P/L cannot be computed precisely from yesterday to today. Today’s values above are based on the latest available data for 2024-01-22.\n\nRecommended next steps (optional)\n- If you want to measure performance properly, fetch yesterday’s closing prices for NKE, PFE, and XOM to compute daily P/L and return on the three holdings.\n- If you’d like, I can simulate a rebalancing plan (e.g., maintain ~33% each) and show how many shares to buy/sell given the current prices and cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
