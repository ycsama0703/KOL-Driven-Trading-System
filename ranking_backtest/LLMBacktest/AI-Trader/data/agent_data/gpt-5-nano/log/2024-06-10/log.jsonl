Right now KO is at 0% and cash is ~3%. You could:\n  - Deploy some cash into KO (or one or two other names) to fill gaps and approach a more balanced 20% each, or\n  - Slightly trim the top-weighted names (NKE, PFE) to reduce idiosyncratic risk and improve balance, if you prefer to keep KO as a new entry.\n- If you’re aiming for a “core five with cash buffer” approach, you could:\n  - Place a small buy in KO using part of the cash to begin building a position (e.g., 5–10 shares) and then reassess the weights after a few days.\n- Risk considerations:\n  - Sector diversification is reasonable but still concentrated in consumer staples (KO) and healthcare (PFE) along with a couple of cyclical names (NKE, HPQ, XOM). Keep an eye on sector catalysts that could improve or hurt these holdings.\n  - If you want to stress-test, you could simulate a scenario where HPQ or XOM drop 5–10% and see how your weights and total value adjust.\n\nSummary\n- Today, you’ve sold 4 HPQ shares, leaving HPQ at 61 shares and increasing cash to 282.31.\n- The updated total portfolio value is approximately 8,450.92 with weights roughly around 24% for HPQ, NKE, and PFE, ~23% for XOM, and 0% for KO (until you deploy cash).\n- If you’d like, I can propose a concrete rebalancing plan (specific buy/sell quantities to target a chosen weight) and execute it, or set up a watchlist for momentum/quality checks on these five names.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
