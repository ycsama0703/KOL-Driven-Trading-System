(rounded: -0.13 if using 112.56 vs 112.67; exact: -0.13)\n  - Note: Using precise figures: P/L ≈ -0.13\n- Total holdings value: 9,653.10\n- Total estimated cost basis: 9,648.01\n- Net unrealized P/L (holdings): +5.09\n- Cash: 70.88\n- Total portfolio value today (holdings + cash): 9,723.98\n\n5) Portfolio weights (excluding cash)\n- KO: 1,891.42 / 9,653.10 ≈ 19.6%\n- HPQ: 1,850.80 / 9,653.10 ≈ 19.2%\n- NKE: 2,077.36 / 9,653.10 ≈ 21.5%\n- PFE: 1,918.13 / 9,653.10 ≈ 19.9%\n- XOM: 1,915.39 / 9,653.10 ≈ 19.9%\n\n6) Takeaways\n- Your five holdings are nearly evenly weighted today (roughly 19–22% each), which is a nicely balanced small five-position portfolio.\n- Unrealized P/L is modestly positive overall (~$5) on today’s moves, after the KO sale.\n- Cash reserve is still small relative to total, at 70.88.\n\n7) Simple rebalancing ideas (optional)\n- If you want to maintain strict equal-weight tilts, you could use the cash to nudge weights toward 20% each. For example:\n  - Add roughly one more KO share (cost ≈ 55.63) to bring KO closer to the 20% target. After one more KO share, KO ≈ 35 shares, new KO value ≈ 1,947.05, and total portfolio value ≈ 9,728.66 (cash ≈ 15.25).\n  - This would bring the five holdings to very near 20% each, given the current prices.\n- If you prefer to stay fully cash-light and only adjust with meaningful moves, you could wait for clearer signals before trading again, since the existing P/L is small and the diversification is already good.\n\nIf you want, I can execute a rebalancing trade (e.g., buy 1 KO share now) or simulate a few different adjustment scenarios and show the projected portfolio metrics. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
