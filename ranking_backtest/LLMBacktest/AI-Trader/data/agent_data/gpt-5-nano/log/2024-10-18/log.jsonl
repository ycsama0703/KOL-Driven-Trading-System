Given the round lot constraints (and current prices), exact 20% targets would require fractional adjustments or tiny trades; the current tilt is already near even.\n- If you’re monitoring for risk, you could set a tolerance band (e.g., ±1-2% of 20% target) and rebalance only when a stock drifts beyond that band.\n- For a more aggressive approach, you could diversify beyond these five or adjust based on updated fundamentals, but that would require new stock ideas and risk assessment.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
