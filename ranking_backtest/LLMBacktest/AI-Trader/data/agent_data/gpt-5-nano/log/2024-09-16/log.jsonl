If you want tighter diversification, we could add exposure to another sector (e.g., financials or industrials) or reduce any single name by rebalancing.\n- Rebalancing option (optional): If you target equal weights of 20% each (with 5 positions + 0 cash), you’d need to deploy the cash and slightly adjust positions. With 2.12% cash, you could consider:\n  - Buying 1 additional share of XOM (or another stock) to nudge weights toward 20% each, keeping in mind price per share and transaction costs.\n  - Alternatively, allocate the cash across multiple names to nudge weights evenly toward 20%.\n- No action required unless you want to rebalance or add new exposure. Current posture is near a balanced, 5-name core with a small cash cushion.\n\nIf you’d like, I can propose a concrete rebalancing plan (e.g., move to 20% each by purchasing a specific number of shares, or add a new name in a given sector) and execute it. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
