Small deviations (e.g., NKE being lighter at ~17.6%) are from daily price moves and can drift with time.\n- Potential next steps (if you want to pursue a more active approach once cash becomes available):\n  - Consider adding to the lighter-weight position(s) to restore strict equality (e.g., add to NKE when you have cash to buy, aiming for roughly 20% across all five).\n  - Alternatively, rotate into firms with stronger near-term catalysts if you have a view (e.g., tilt toward a sector where you have conviction), but that would break the current equal-weight balance.\n- Risk considerations:\n  - Sector exposure is diversified across five large-cap names, which reduces idiosyncratic risk but keeps you exposed to macro factors impacting consumer staples, healthcare, energy, and consumer discretionary.\n  - If you expect material regime shifts (e.g., energy price moves, healthcare policy changes, consumer demand shifts), you could rebalance accordingly when additional cash becomes available.\n\nRecommendations for next steps\n- If you’d like, I can:\n  - Set a target weight (e.g., 20% each for the five stocks) and monitor deviations; alert you or auto-rebalance when you have sufficient cash.\n  - Propose a plan to add new positions and diversify further as cash accumulates (e.g., a new stock with complementary sector exposure or growth traits).\n  - Prepare a watchlist and price-alert thresholds for each holding to execute timely rebalancing.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
