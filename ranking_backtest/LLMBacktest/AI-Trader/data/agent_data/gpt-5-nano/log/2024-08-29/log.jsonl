For example, slightly trim XOM and allocate to the smaller weights (NKE or HPQ) if you want to rebalance toward 20% each.\n- If you prefer to maintain a small cash buffer, you could leave weights as-is or adjust only when a target tolerance band is breached (e.g., +/- 1-2%).\n\nSummary\n- Today you acquired 2 XOM shares; XOM holdings are now 20 shares.\n- Updated total portfolio value ≈ 10,772.03 with a cash balance of 42.75.\n- Current allocation is close to evenly distributed among HPQ, KO, NKE, PFE, and XOM, with a tiny cash buffer.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
