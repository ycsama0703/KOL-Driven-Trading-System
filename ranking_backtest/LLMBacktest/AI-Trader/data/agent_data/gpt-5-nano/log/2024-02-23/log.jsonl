Note that exact rebalancing would depend on transaction costs and any trading restrictions.\n- I can also set price alerts or a recurring check to monitor any drift beyond a chosen threshold (e.g., +/- 2% from target weights).\n\nWould you like me to run a quick rebalance plan to target strict equal weights across the five holdings, or set up alerts for significant price moves? If you have a preferred target allocation (e.g., 20% each, or a different split), tell me and I’ll compute the required trades. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
