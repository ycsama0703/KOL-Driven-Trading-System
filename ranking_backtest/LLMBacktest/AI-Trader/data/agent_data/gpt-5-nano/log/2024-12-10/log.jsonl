Cash is only 32.22, which is not enough to buy a full share of any of these names at current quotes.\n- If you want to maintain strict equal-weighting with a future rebalancing, monitor price drift thresholds (e.g., rebalance when any stock deviates by more than ~5% from the 20% target). With 5 positions, the current drift is small.\n- Consider implementing a rule-based rebalancing plan for when cash grows (e.g., new contributions or proceeds from a trade) to add to underperformers or overweight winners if the objective is to maximize long-run returns.\n\nWhat I can do next\n- If you want, I can set up a simple rebalance watch: alert you when any stock’s weight moves outside a 3–5 percentage point band around 20%.\n- If you provide a preferred target allocation (e.g., equal-weight, or tilt toward XOM/KO), I can simulate how today’s prices would adjust positions once cash becomes available.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
