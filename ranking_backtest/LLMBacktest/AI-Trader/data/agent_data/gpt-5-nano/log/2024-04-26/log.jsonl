With current prices, buying 1 additional XOM share would allocate ~112 more to XOM and lift its weight to around 25.5% if funded by cash, but you don’t have enough cash for that now.\n- Overall small negative P&L today (-0.37%) is driven mainly by the XOM drop from yesterday’s close to today’s open.\n\nIf you’d like, I can run a scenario to rebalance to exact 25% targets given a specific cash addition, or propose a different allocation framework (e.g., equal-dollar across four positions, volatility-based weights, etc.). \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
