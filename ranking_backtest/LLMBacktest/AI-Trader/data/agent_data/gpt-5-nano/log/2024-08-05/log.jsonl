Current KO holding = 31 shares.\n- Cash after trade: 185.20\n- Remaining core holdings (yesterday’s positions updated today):\n  - HPQ: 61 shares\n  - KO: 31 shares\n  - NKE: 29 shares\n  - PFE: 74 shares\n  - XOM: 19 shares\n\nToday’s prices used for valuation (current value basis)\n- HPQ price: 32.14\n- KO price: 66.85\n- NKE price: 72.08\n- PFE price: 27.94\n- XOM price: 110.93\n\nCurrent portfolio valuation (based on today’s prices)\n- HPQ value: 61 x 32.14 = 1,960.54\n- KO value: 31 x 66.85 = 2,072.35\n- NKE value: 29 x 72.08 = 2,090.32\n- PFE value: 74 x 27.94 = 2,067.56\n- XOM value: 19 x 110.93 = 2,107.67\n- Holdings total: 10,298.44\n- Cash: 185.20\n- Total portfolio value: 10,483.64\n\nCurrent allocation (weights)\n- HPQ: ~19.1%\n- KO: ~20.1%\n- NKE: ~20.3%\n- PFE: ~20.1%\n- XOM: ~20.5%\n\nObservations\n- The portfolio is very close to an equal-weight stance across the five positions (roughly 20% each). The main deviation is HPQ slightly underweight and XOM slightly overweight.\n\nSuggested next steps (rebalancing ideas)\n- Option A (minimal action): Do a small reweight to tighten toward exactly 20% each. The easiest path would be to buy a few HPQ shares with the available cash to nudge HPQ toward 20%.\n  - Example plan: Buy 4 HPQ shares using cash (~4 x 32.14 = 128.56). This would leave cash ≈ 56.64.\n  - After the trade (approximate, with today’s prices):\n    - HPQ: 65 shares\n    - KO: 31 shares\n    - NKE: 29 shares\n    - PFE: 74 shares\n    - XOM: 19 shares\n    - New holdings total ≈ 10,427.00\n    - New cash ≈ 56.64\n    - New total portfolio ≈ 10,483.64\n    - New approximate weights:\n      - HPQ ≈ 2089.10 / 10,483.64 ≈ 19.93%\n      - KO ≈ 2072.35 / 10,483.64 ≈ 19.77%\n      - NKE ≈ 2090.32 / 10,483.64 ≈ 19.96%\n      - PFE ≈ 2067.56 / 10,483.64 ≈ 19.76%\n      - XOM ≈ 2107.67 / 10,483.64 ≈ 20.13%\n  - This would bring the portfolio very close to an equal-weight target.\n- Option B (no action): Leave as-is. The current allocation is already near equal, with only small deviations.\n\nOperational note\n- If you want me to execute the rebalance (buy 4 HPQ shares) now, I can place that order and update the positions and cash accordingly.\n\nSummary\n- Current positions after the KO sale: HPQ 61, KO 31, NKE 29, PFE 74, XOM 19; Cash 185.20\n- Total portfolio value: 10,483.64\n- Allocation is already close to 20% per stock; a small HPQ buy (4 shares) would further align to a clean 20% target with minimal cash remaining.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
