Your weights are roughly equal and your cash buffer is small (10.5); there isn’t enough cash to meaningfully rebalance or add a new position in standard round lots.\n- If you want to optimize toward a target allocation, you could:\n  - Maintain the current 4-way equal-weight posture and rebalance only if any stock deviates by more than a set threshold (e.g., >3-4% from 25% target).\n  - Alternatively, set a momentum-based watchlist (e.g., if a stock reclaims its buying price or spikes a certain percentage) to trigger a rebalancing or a small add.\n- Optional longer-term ideas (not trades today):\n  - Build a small reserve for new ideas or to rebalance into a higher-conviction name if a favorable setup appears.\n  - Consider adding an ETF or a diversified element if you want broader market exposure beyond these four names.\n\nWould you like me to set up a simple rebalancing rule (e.g., rebalance to 25% each if any position strays beyond ±2 percentage points) and monitor for a potential trade triggered by price changes? If you have a preferred target allocation or risk tolerance, tell me and I’ll adjust accordingly.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
