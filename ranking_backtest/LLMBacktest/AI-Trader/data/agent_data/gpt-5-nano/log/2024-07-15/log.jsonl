I’ve proceeded with today’s values to provide an up-to-date valuation.\n\nPotential actions (trade considerations)\n- If you want equal-weight exposure among the five names (about 20% each), you’re very close already, aside from NKE being underweight and cash being minimal. Small rebalancing would require selling some overweights (e.g., PFE) to fund buying more of NKE, but cash is limited (only 1.3%). For example, buying 1 additional NKE with all available cash is possible (cost ~71.51), which would modestly raise NKE’s weight but would still keep you below 20% for NKE and increase total portfolio value only modestly.\n- If you’re aiming for diversification, you could:\n  - Do nothing and let weights drift with price changes.\n  - Or set a larger rebalancing plan that might involve selling a portion of PFE (or another overweight) to fund purchases in new ideas or a new sector ETF for broader diversification. This would require a trade confirmation.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Keep the current holdings and set a target to rebalance to roughly 20% per name over the next few trades, and propose exact buy/sell quantities (subject to share-lot rules and you’re comfortable with selling some positions), or\n- Propose an entry into a new name/sector with the cash you have, or\n- Leave the portfolio as-is for now?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
