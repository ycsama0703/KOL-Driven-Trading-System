Your weights are already near equal and cash is limited.\n  - If you accumulate additional cash, target a light rebalance toward roughly 20% each for HPQ, KO, NKE, PFE, and XOM.\n\n6) Quick actionable summary\n- Yesterday’s portfolio value: 9,920.92\n- Today’s portfolio value (at 4/4 open): 9,970.79\n- Daily P/L (today): +49.87\n- Current stock weights (approx): HPQ ~19.9%, KO ~19.8%, NKE ~19.7%, PFE ~20.2%, XOM ~20.4%; Cash ~1.0%\n- Recommended action: No trades needed now due to limited cash. Monitor stock moves; consider targeted buy/sell only if you decide to adjust the cash buffer or pursue a formal rebalancing when cash becomes available.\n\nIf you’d like, I can simulate a few rebalancing scenarios given different cash injections or set price alerts to help guide any future adjustments.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
