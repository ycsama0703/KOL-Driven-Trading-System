With only 6.29 in cash, meaningful full rebalancing isn’t feasible today without selling more and/or adding capital.\n- Small partial rebalance (one example): If you want a tiny nudge toward equal weight, you could:\n  - Sell 2 HPQ shares (2 * 34.21 = 68.42) and keep the rest as-is, which slightly lowers HPQ’s weight and increases cash to 75.71. Then you could use a portion of that cash to modestly build KO/NKE exposure in subsequent days as prices move.\n  This is just an example of a tiny step; we’d want to run exact calculations if you target a specific weight.\n\nIf you’d like, I can place trades to rebalance toward a target (e.g., equal 20% weights) or to a custom target you specify. Just tell me your target weights or whether you want me to execute a small step toward rebalancing today. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
