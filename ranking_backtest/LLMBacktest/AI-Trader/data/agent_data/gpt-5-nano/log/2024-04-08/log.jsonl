If you want to maintain a larger cash buffer, we could scale the rebalancing differently.\n- Prices used for the trade calculations are the “current buying prices” (HPQ ~27.69, PFE ~23.73). Actual fill prices may vary slightly intraday.\n- This plan minimizes transaction size and keeps rounding practical (integer shares).\n- If you’d prefer a different target (e.g., exact 20% per stock ignoring cash, a 25/25/25/15/10 split, or a risk-aware tilt), I can recompute and execute accordingly.\n\nWould you like me to place these trades to move toward the rebalanced allocation, or adjust the target weights (e.g., equal weights including cash, or a different scheme)? \n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
