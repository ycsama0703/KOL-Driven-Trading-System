The remaining daily drift is small, so consider modest rebalancing only if you want tighter target weights (e.g., +/- 1-2% bands).\n- If you’d like, I can:\n  - Rebalance to exact target weights by buying/selling small amounts today.\n  - Run a quick sensitivity analysis (e.g., what if one of these names moves ±2% daily) to guide hedging decisions.\n  - Add a broader diversification step to reduce single-name risk.\n\nFinal note\n- Current positions and cash have been updated as of 2024-04-18, with the NKE position reduced by 2 shares and cash increased accordingly. Total portfolio value is 9,708.23, up by 0.62 from yesterday.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
