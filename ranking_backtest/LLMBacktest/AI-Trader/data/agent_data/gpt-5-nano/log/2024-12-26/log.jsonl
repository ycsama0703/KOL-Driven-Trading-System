The other four are in the ~19–19.5% range.\n- Cash is negligible (0.18), so there is no ability to deploy immediately without selling something.\n\nActionable decisions today\n- No trades are recommended today given the near-equal weights and the very small cash buffer.\n- If you want to target exact 20% weights, you’d need to reallocate via selling/adding funds; with only 0.18 cash, a practical adjustment isn’t feasible this session.\n\nPotential next steps (optional)\n- If you’d like, I can:\n  - Compute P&L by incorporating cost basis (currently not available from the data provided).\n  - Propose a rebalancing plan to bring weights closer to 20% each (e.g., thresholds for rebalancing, target allocations, and required cash to execute).\n  - Add a watchlist or scenario analysis (e.g., what happens if one name moves ±5–10%).\n  - Retrieve cost basis data to calculate unrealized gains/losses for each holding.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
