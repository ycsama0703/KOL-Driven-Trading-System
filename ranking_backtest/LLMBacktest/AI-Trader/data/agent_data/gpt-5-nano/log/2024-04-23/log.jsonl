With a 9,852.22 total, that’s about 1,970 per stock; current values are around 1,708–1,912 per stock, so a cash deployment of roughly 600 could be used to push toward that balance. Let me know your target.\n\nIf you’d like, I can run a quick rebalance proposal to target: \n- 20% per stock (HPQ, KO, NKE, XOM, PFE) and 0% cash (or a specified cash reserve), and outline the exact orders to place.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
