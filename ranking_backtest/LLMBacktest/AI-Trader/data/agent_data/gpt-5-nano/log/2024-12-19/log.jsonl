If your plan requires more liquidity, you may either avoid further immediate purchases or consider a small, disciplined add-on only if you see a clear value signal.\n- If you intended a firm equal-weight rebalance, you’re already close to equal weights. Minor tweaks (e.g., trimming a small amount of one name and adding to another) could be done to hit exact percentages, but transaction costs may outweigh benefits.\n\nNext steps (optional)\n- If you want, I can run a precise rebalancing calculation to bring all four to exact 25% weights and propose a minimal set of buy/sell trades.\n- I can also pull a fresh set of intraday prices for today (2024-12-19) to update valuations with real-time data if you’d like a more current mark-to-market.\n- If you have a target risk profile or sector diversification, I can propose adjustments to tilt toward or away from certain sectors.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
