Currently,weights are already close to equal.\n- If you have a risk/beta preference, consider adjusting concentrations toward sectors you want more exposure to (e.g., add a defensively positioned stock or reduce a higher-beta name).\n- With the small cash cushion, you could add a new, uncorrelated name to improve diversification if desired.\n\nIf you’d like, I can propose a concrete rebalance plan (quantities to buy/sell to target exact weights) and even execute trades. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
