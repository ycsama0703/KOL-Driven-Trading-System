Rough targets would be about 2,038.30 in value per position (based on current holdings value). Quick checks:\n  - HPQ currently ~2103 (slightly overweight)\n  - KO ~2045 (near target)\n  - NKE ~1993 (slightly under)\n  - XOM ~1896 (under)\n  - PFE ~2144 (over)\n  A small set of trades could nudge weights toward 20% each, but given the small overall P/L, a deliberate rebalance is optional.\n\nIf you’d like, I can calculate exact trade sets to rebalance to 20% each or to another target (e.g., equal-weight, sector-based tilt) and propose specific buy/sell orders. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
