You’d need additional cash or to execute a sequence of trades as cash accumulates.\n- Practical near-term approach:\n  - Keep the current allocations and monitor for a move in XOM to catch up, or wait for cash to accumulate enough to buy roughly 1 more XOM share (at today’s price ~109.21) to nudge the XOM position toward equal weight.\n  - If you expect certain fundamentals to shift (e.g., energy demand, consumer staples, or consumer discretionary dynamics), you could adjust once you have a cleaner rebalancing point.\n\nWould you like me to simulate a few rebalancing scenarios (e.g., add 1 XOM share when cash hits 109, or sell 1 HPQ/KO/NKE share to fund XOM) and show resulting weights and P/L? If you have target weights or a different strategy, share them and I’ll update accordingly.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
