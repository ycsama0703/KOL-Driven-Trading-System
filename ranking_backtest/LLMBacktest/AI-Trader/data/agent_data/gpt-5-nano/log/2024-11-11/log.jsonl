Based on today’s quotes, the incremental value added by these five new shares is approximately 337.07, versus an estimated cost of 337.07 if we align with today’s buying prices. Net unrealized P/L on the five incremental buys is effectively around zero at current prices, given the prices used for purchase.\n\n8) Suggested next steps (optional)\n- Confirm whether you’d like to target a specific allocation (e.g., keep roughly equal risk-weighted exposure across sectors, or overweight defensive names).\n- Consider setting price alerts or stop-loss levels if you’re aiming for disciplined risk control.\n- If you want, I can run a quick rebalancing proposal to align with a chosen target allocation.\n\nIf you’d like me to adjust the portfolio toward a specific allocation or to initiate additional trades, tell me the target weights or tickers and I’ll proceed. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
