If you want to target a specific risk level or factor exposure (e.g., equal-weighted, sector tilts, or growth/value tilt), I can propose a rebalance.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Rebalance to a target weight (e.g., equal-weight across the five, or a growth/value tilt)?\n- Deploy some or all cash into one or more of these names or new ideas?\n- Run a quick risk/return projection for different rebalancing scenarios? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
