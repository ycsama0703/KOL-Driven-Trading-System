Current weights are all around ~20% with small deviations.\n- If you want to tighten to an exact 20% each (and 0 cash), you’d need to deploy cash to rebalance or trim one or more names if you want to free cash for new ideas. With 607.22 cash, you could buy a limited number of additional shares (e.g., HPQ at ~26.55 would allow about 22 more shares without exceeding cash; this would overweight HPQ). Given the current near-equal weights, a full rebalance isn’t mandated.\n- If you expect day-to-day volatility, you could set small price-based rebalancing rules (e.g., rebalance when any stock drifts more than a few percent from its 20% target), but that would require ongoing trading.\n\nWould you like me to place a targeted rebalance plan (e.g., add modestly to the lagging names or allocate cash to maintain strict 20% across the five), or keep current allocations and watch for further signals? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
