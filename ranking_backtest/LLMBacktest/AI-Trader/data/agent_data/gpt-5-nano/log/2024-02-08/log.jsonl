Cash is negligible, contributing ~0.04% of the portfolio.\n- The portfolio is already near a balanced 4-way exposure. No immediate rebalancing is required given the tiny cash cushion.\n\nPotential actions (optional)\n- If you want a strict 25% per stock target, you’d need additional cash or to rebalance by selling/buying small amounts, but with only 2.60 cash, meaningful rebalancing isn’t practical now.\n- For diversification/return enhancement, consider gradually adding a fifth or sixth name in a different sector when new capital becomes available. I can propose a few candidate stocks and simulate a target-weight plan if you’d like.\n- Set price alerts or a lightweight rebalancing rule (e.g., rebalance when any stock drifts beyond ±2–3% of the 25% target) to automate upkeep.\n\nIf you’d like, I can run a quick rebalancing plan once you provide new cash inflows or a desired target allocation, and simulate the trades needed. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
