This would create five positions with a different balance, so consider whether you want more diversification at this point.\n- If you prefer to stay with four positions, you could schedule a small buy if you see a favorable dip in any of the four holdings, aiming to keep weights near 25% each over time.\n\nSummary: NKE was sold 1 share today; holdings are HPQ 64, NKE 28, PFE 75, XOM 18, KO 0, with cash 192.68. Total value ~$8,474.54 and weights are roughly evenly distributed around 23–25% per stock, with a small cash buffer.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
