The exact realized P/L per share depends on your cost basis for the sold HPQ shares.\n- Unrealized component: Change in mark-to-market value of the remaining holdings contributed about 53.24.\n- Net result: +118.32 total portfolio P/L for today.\n\nWhat this implies for decision-making\n- The five current positions are roughly equally weighted today (around 19–20% each) with a small cash cushion (~1.8%). This is a fairly balanced posture across these five names.\n- If your target is strict equal-weighting across the five stocks, you’re close but the XOM position is the lightest relative to the others, while HPQ is slightly over (though the difference is small).\n- With 187.94 in cash, you could consider a modest rebalance by buying more of the laggards (XOM or NKE) or adding small increments to PFE to keep the weights near equal. For example:\n  - Purchases to move toward 20% each (rough guide with today’s prices):\n    - Buy 2 shares of XOM (~$215) to raise XOM’s weight modestly. This would reduce cash but shift weights away from HPQ a bit.\n    - Or buy 3–4 shares of NKE or PFE to fill some gap toward 20% if you want to keep HPQ from diverging too far from 20%.\n  - Alternatively, leave the basket as-is, allowing small cash to act as a ballast and keep a 1–2% cash buffer.\n\nIf you’d like, I can place a small rebalancing order (e.g., buy a specific number of shares to target a precise weight like 20% per stock or add a fixed cash buffer) or propose an alternate strategy (e.g., add a new stock, raise cash to a target level, or implement a different weighting scheme). Just tell me which approach you prefer and the target weights or dollar allocations.\n\nNext steps I can take\n- Rebalance toward an explicit target (e.g., 20% per stock across HPQ, KO, NKE, XOM, PFE) using today’s prices and the 10,356.44 total, within the 187.94 cash you have.\n- Place a buy order for a chosen stock to adjust weights.\n- Run a quick sensitivity analysis to show how small buys/sells would impact weights.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
