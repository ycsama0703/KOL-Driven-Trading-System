If you want to deploy cash soon, you could:\n  - wait for a small price move to enable a round-number buy, or\n  - accumulate cash until you have enough to add a second full share to a position you like, or\n  - diversify into a new, liquid name or ETF if you want broader diversification.\n- If you have a preference for sector tilt or a longer-term thesis, I can run a quick screen (e.g., add a consumer/tech/energy exposure, or add a quality dividend name) and propose a concrete order size when cash allows.\n\nNext steps (you can tell me what to do, or I can proceed with a plan)\n- Would you like me to:\n  - set price alerts for these five names to catch breakout/bounce levels,\n  - propose a small new allocation when cash grows, or\n  - run a targeted diversification: add a new position or ETF to broaden exposure (I can fetch current price and suggest a starter position size)?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
