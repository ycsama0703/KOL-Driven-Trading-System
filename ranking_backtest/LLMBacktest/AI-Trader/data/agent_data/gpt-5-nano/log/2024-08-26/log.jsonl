No immediate tilt stands out based solely on today’s opening prices.\n- Yesterday (08-25 close) data had some missing items in the source, but we can compare to the prior known values: using yesterday’s per-share values (HPQ 33.99, KO 67.29, NKE 81.86, PFE 26.54, XOM 111.29) yields a rough P/L snapshot below.\n\nP/L update since 2024-08-25 (approximate)\n- Total P/L for today’s open vs yesterday’s close: +$24.52\n  - HPQ: +$11.52\n  - KO: +$1.28\n  - NKE: -$15.12\n  - PFE: +$1.62\n  - XOM: +$26.22\n\nWhat this means for action\n- You’re near an equal-weight across the five positions (roughly 19.8%–20.3% each) with a small cash buffer.\n- Rebalancing to exact 20% targets would require about $2.57 of extra cash (net) to bring all positions to 20% using today’s prices. Current cash is 2.55, so you’re essentially at a cash-neutral point for exact rebalancing with whole shares. In practice, given integer-share constraints, it’s not feasible to perfectly hit 20% without either more cash or a different mix of buys/sells.\n- If you want to maintain a strict equal-weight approach, you could wait for a bit more cash or for a price move that brings weights closer to exact 20% with fewer rounding issues. Alternatively, you could adjust by modestly reweighting in a way that allows whole-share trades (e.g., target 20–20–20–20–20 with a small rounding tolerance).\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Rebalance toward exact 20% weights given today’s prices and available cash (noting you’ll likely need a small additional cash input or accept rounding), or\n- Run a quick fundamental/valuation scan to consider targeted adjustments (e.g., overweight/underweight based on sector, dividend yield, or growth metrics), or\n- Compute P/L and return analytics if you provide yesterday’s total value or cost basis per position? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
