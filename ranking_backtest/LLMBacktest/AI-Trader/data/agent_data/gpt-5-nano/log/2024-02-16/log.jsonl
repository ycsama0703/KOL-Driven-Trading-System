Cash balance reflects the total cost of these trades.\n\n3) Positions after updates (as of now)\n- HPQ: 74 shares\n- KO: 34 shares\n- NKE: 19 shares\n- PFE: 78 shares\n- XOM: 20 shares\n- Cash: 195.83\n\n4) Valuation of current holdings (using yesterday’s close prices as reference for valuation)\n- HPQ: 74 × 27.21 = 2,013.54\n- KO: 34 × 56.38 = 1,916.92\n- NKE: 19 × 102.52 = 1,947.88\n- PFE: 78 × 24.54 = 1,414.12\n- XOM: 20 × 97.66 = 1,953.20\n\nTotal value of holdings: 9,745.66\nCash: 195.83\nTotal portfolio value: 9,941.49\n\n5) Allocation by holding (weights of holdings in the total portfolio value)\n- HPQ: 2,013.54 / 9,745.66 ≈ 20.65%\n- KO: 1,916.92 / 9,745.66 ≈ 19.69%\n- NKE: 1,947.88 / 9,745.66 ≈ 19.99%\n- PFE: 1,414.12 / 9,745.66 ≈ 14.51% (Note: I used the updated PFE value above; if using 1,914.12 instead, weight would be ≈ 19.64%. The intended figure with 78 shares × 24.54 is 1,914.12. Recalculate to 19.64%.)\n- XOM: 1,953.20 / 9,745.66 ≈ 20.03%\n\nAdjusted final allocation (rounded to two decimals, using 1,914.12 for PFE):\n- HPQ: 20.65%\n- KO: 19.69%\n- NKE: 19.99%\n- PFE: 19.64%\n- XOM: 20.03%\nTotal ≈ 100%\n\n6) Observations and potential next steps\n- The portfolio is roughly balanced across the five names, with weights around 20% each.\n- If you have a strategic target (e.g., equal 20% each, or tilt toward sectors like consumer/energy), we can rebalance toward that target.\n- Consider updating stop-loss/take-profit levels or setting a cash buffer for new ideas.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Rebalance toward an explicit target allocation (e.g., equal weights or a specific tilt), or\n- Compute a projected P&L given a price scenario (e.g., what if prices move ±5% or ±10%)?\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
