HPQ is the largest loser today, but its weight remains around the mid-teens to high-teen percent range.\n- Cash buffer is very small (0.06%), so meaningful rebalancing to exact target weights (e.g., 20% each) would require new cash or selling other positions and redeploying into HPQ. Without additional cash, a precise 20%/20%/20%/20%/20% allocation isn’t feasible this session.\n- If your objective is to maintain a roughly equal-weighted five-stock exposure, you could consider:\n  - Option A (no action today): Keep the current allocations and monitor HPQ’s next moves. Small price changes could slowly rebalance without forcing trades.\n  - Option B (small, targeted action if you have a little cash later): Add modestly to HPQ (e.g., ~+4–5 shares if you can allocate ~$120–$150) to nudge HPQ toward a 19–20% range, while not over-allocating given the current tight cash.\n  - If you’re comfortable with a slight tilt (e.g., keep XOM a touch higher due to its 21% weighting today), you could avoid trades until a clearer rebalancing signal appears.\n- Fundamental/operational note: HPQ’s drop today is notable; if you or your model have a fundamental view on HPQ (e.g., earnings timing, guidance, cost structure), consider whether this move aligns with your long-term thesis or is a short-term mispricing.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Quantify a hypothetical rebalancing plan (e.g., target weights and the exact buy/sell amounts to approach 20% each) given a certain cash addition?\n- Run a mini-scan of fundamentals and recent news on HPQ, KO, NKE, XOM, and PFE to assess whether today’s moves are supported by recent catalysts? \n- Set up a threshold-based alert for rebalancing signals (e.g., if HPQ moves more than ±2% intraday, or if any stock deviates from target by ±2 percentage points). \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
