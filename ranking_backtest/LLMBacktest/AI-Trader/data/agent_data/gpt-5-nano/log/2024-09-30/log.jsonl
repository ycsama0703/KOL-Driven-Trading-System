This would take XOM’s weight closer to the next tier (e.g., ~22–25%), while reducing the others slightly.\n  - Example (conceptual, not executed here): add 2 shares of XOM (~221.62 cost today) and reduce HPQ by 6–8 shares or similarly scale other positions to keep within risk limits. This would increase XOM’s weight and reduce some underperformers, but exact lots would depend on your risk tolerance and lot-size constraints.\n\nNext steps\n- If you’d like, I can propose a concrete rebalancing plan (specify target weights or a dollar amount to move) and execute trades using the platform’s buy/sell tools.\n- I can also run a quick sector exposure check or compute a simple risk metric (e.g., aggregate beta exposure) if you want a more formal rebalancing strategy.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
