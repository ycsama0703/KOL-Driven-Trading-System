The rest are relatively evenly spread among KO, NKE, XOM, and PFE (~13–15% each).\n- If your target is a more balanced or diversified exposure, you might consider:\n  - Reducing HPQ exposure toward ~20–25% and reallocating to KO, NKE, XOM, and PFE to raise their weights.\n  - Alternatively, maintain the current weights if you’re comfortable with a leadership position in HPQ and small caps in other sectors.\n- Cash position is modest at ~3.8%, which provides some dry powder for either opportunistic buys or to support rebalancing.\n\n7) Suggested next steps (I can execute these if you want)\n- Rebalance idea A (aim ~20% per stock, five-stock equal-weight plus cash): Sell a portion of HPQ and allocate equally to KO, NKE, XOM, and PFE, keeping cash to low single digits.\n- Rebalance idea B (target risk-adjusted diversification): Slightly trim HPQ and top up the underweights with a couple of other names (e.g., add to a defensive name or a growth complement) to diversify sector exposure further.\n- Add a monitoring rule: track price movement and P/L by stock to assess when a rebalancing threshold (e.g., 5–8% drift from target weights) is reached.\n\nIf you’d like, I can place a rebalancing order now using one of the above strategies or tailor a target allocation you prefer.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
