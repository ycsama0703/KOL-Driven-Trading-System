The current allocation is fairly balanced across these positions.\n- If you want strict equal-weighting, you could rebalance by trimming a small amount from a couple of positions or allocating some cash to a new name to maintain 20% targets more precisely.\n- If you’d like more diversification (sector or factor diversification), I can suggest adding a new position in a different sector or an ETF proxy, subject to your risk appetite and transaction costs.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Rebalance to exact equal weights (e.g., adjust small amounts to hit precisely 20% each), or\n- Introduce a new name/sector to broaden diversification, or\n- Generate a daily P/L snapshot and a short scenario analysis for a given market move? \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
