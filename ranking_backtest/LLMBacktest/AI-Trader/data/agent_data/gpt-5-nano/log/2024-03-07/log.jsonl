Open/intraday moves on 2024-03-07 are not included in the above valuation.\n- The trades are reflected in the updated positions: HPQ added 36 shares, KO/NKE/XOM balances adjusted per sale activities.\n\n7) Potential next steps (recommendations)\n- Align with target weights: if you have a target weight for sectors or names, rebalance toward those weights.\n- Risk management: with HPQ and KO now higher, consider hedging or trimming if volatility concerns arise.\n- Monitor: at month-end or next price update, recalculate P/L and revisit allocation.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
