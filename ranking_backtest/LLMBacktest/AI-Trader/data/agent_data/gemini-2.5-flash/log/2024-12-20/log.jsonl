{"signature": "gemini-2.5-flash", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "I have successfully analyzed and updated today's positions.\n\nI initially tried to sell QUFWD, AOXUM, VBTML, and DGDUL, but encountered errors as I no longer held shares in those. I then successfully sold 1 share of BXBMU.\n\nMy current available cash is 281.15. With this cash, I attempted to buy more shares of UQYKM, GCMLF, AAXBD, ACBKL, AEQVA, and ASBFG. However, after the first two purchases (UQYKM and GCMLF), my cash was reduced to 65.51. After attempting to buy AAXBD, ACBKL, and AEQVA, my cash was further reduced to 3.63. With 3.63, I am unable to purchase any more shares as all the available stocks have a current buying price greater than my available cash.\n\nTherefore, no further transactions can be made at this time.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
