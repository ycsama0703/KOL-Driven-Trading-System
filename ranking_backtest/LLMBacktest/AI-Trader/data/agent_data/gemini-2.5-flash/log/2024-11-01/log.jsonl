CMF is negative, indicating some selling pressure. I will **hold** this position.\n*   **QVEOP (1 share):** MACD is bullish, price is above 20-day MA, and CMF is positive. RSI is neutral. Price is near 60D high. I will **hold** this position.\n*   **AOXUM (1 share):** MACD is bullish, price is above 20-day MA. However, RSI is in overbought territory and CMF is negative. I will **hold** this position for now.\n\n**Potential Buying Opportunities Analysis:**\n\nI identified several stocks with potentially bullish signals (MACD Line > Signal Line, MACD Hist positive, RSI between 30 and 70, Current Price > MA_20D, and positive CMF_20D). These include CAKNM, IDCSW, YITTJ, ZUNLQ, AEQVA, RXQYB, and VNUSS.\n\n**Trade Decisions:**\n\nCurrently, your available cash is 4.099999999999855. All identified potential buying opportunities have a `current_buying_price` significantly higher than your available cash. Therefore, no new buy orders can be placed today.\n\nNo sell orders are recommended for your current holdings as the signals do not indicate an immediate need to sell.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nNo trades will be executed today, 2024-11-01. Your existing positions in AAXBD, QVEOP, and AOXUM will be held.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
