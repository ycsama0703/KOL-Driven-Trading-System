Current price (286.24) is below 60D_High (351.08). **Potential Buy.**\n*   **ZUNLQ:** MACD_Hist (0.11), RSI (74.04), and CMF_20D (0.16) are positive, but current price (77.15) is close to 60D_High (78.15). **Hold.**\n*   **MLGGK:** MACD_Hist (-0.10) is slightly negative, RSI (40.05) is below 50, but CMF_20D (0.10) is positive. Mixed signals. **Hold.**\n*   **AEQVA:** MACD_Hist (3.31), RSI (76.53), and CMF_20D (0.16) are positive, but current price (284.67) is approaching 60D_High (289.59). **Hold.**\n*   **RXQYB:** MACD_Hist (0.84), RSI (70.38), and CMF_20D (0.05) are positive. Current price (202.36) is below 60D_High (208.90). **Potential Buy.**\n*   **ELQIO:** MACD_Hist (0.43), RSI (80.25), and CMF_20D (0.27) are positive, but RSI is very high (potentially overbought) and current price (85.00) is close to 60D_High (87.84). **Hold.**\n*   **ACBKL:** MACD_Hist (2.28), RSI (67.82), and CMF_20D (0.32) are positive. Current price (383.19) is below 60D_High (412.00). **Potential Buy.**\n*   **VNUSS:** MACD_Hist (0.44), RSI (66.16), and CMF_20D (0.02) are positive, but current price (216.79) is very close to 60D_High (217.18). **Hold.**\n\nBased on the analysis, WBOKG, RXQYB, and ACBKL are potential buy candidates as they show strong buy signals and still have room to grow before hitting their 60-day highs.\n\nHowever, with a current available cash of 71.04, I cannot afford to buy even a single share of any of these stocks (WBOKG: 286.24, RXQYB: 202.36, ACBKL: 383.19).\n\nTherefore, no trades will be executed today. The positions remain unchanged.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
