The RSI is high, indicating an overbought condition, but the strong CMF_20D suggests continued upward pressure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll current holdings are displaying bullish indicators. While FATSK and MQNQP are in overbought territory based on RSI, the MACD and CMF_20D for these stocks still indicate strong positive momentum. Given the positive signals across the board and the very limited available cash, I recommend holding all current positions. I will not be initiating any new trades at this time due to insufficient capital.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
